prayer mr speaker in the chair beg to move that the house sit in private question put forthwith standing order no and negative strategic litigation against public participation bill second read beg to move that the bill be now read the second time have be member of parliament for nearly year hon member no know it be difficult to believe for some but it be true this be the first occasion on which my name have be draw in the private member bill ballot be pleased to say my name be draw fourth think long and hard about the most appropriate and good piece of draft legislation to bring forward decide on this bill because genuinely think it be incredibly important and will set out to the house why that be the bill tackle strategic litigation against public participation case widely know as slapp in all their form last year and the labour opposition welcome the measure enact in the economic crime and corporate transparency act that ensure that slapp relate to economic crime can be tackle be pleased to bring forward bill to expand on that reform to protect freedom of speech and the public interest be something that all party in parliament hold dear in all debate in this house and the other place there have be broad consensus about the need for reform to tackle the pernicious effect of slapp however in both houses it have be clear that the economic crime and corporate transparency act do not go far enough slapp have take and do take many form it be vital to bring forward legislation that genuinely tackle the issue in holistic and rounded sense there be many example of slapp will refer to few high profile case that have reach court and receive some publicity and to other that have not receive that much publicity begin with case that be sure hon member will be aware of because it have attract great deal of attention in defamation case be reportedly bring against the journalist tom burgis the financial times and publisher harpercollins by kazakh mining company the case concern book by burgis entitle kleptopia how dirty money be conquer the world defamation case be bring by roman abramovich against journalist catherine belton and harpercollins regard her book putin people it be an excellent book and well worth read there be legal assault on the book through number of lawsuit in quick succession justifiably provoke group of campaigner for free expression to state that london court be become the venue of choice for legal action design to quash critical journalism catherine belton the author of putin people have call for the introduction of reform to tackle this global industry base here in london hopefully the bill will begin to address this significant problem seriously then there be the case of amersi leslie british business owner mohamed amersi bring defamation case against charlotte leslie former conservative mp and managing director of the conservative middle east council be familiar with the case because be the shadow minister for the middle east and north africa the case concern memo on amersi background and dealing with russia it be put together in response to his attempt to become the chair of cmec the claim by amersi be strike out because he have fail to show how the memo cause serious harm to his reputation it be not only high profile case that involve slapp there be the case of nina cresswell who name person who violently sexually assault she after her original report be dismiss by the police she commendably want to alert other woman who may become victim of sexual assault the man who be name sue she for defamation ms cresswell win landmark judgment last year but the very fact that she have to fight the case at all demonstrate the huge gap that slapp claimant be only too ready to exploit and we need to address that fact have also hear story of patient who have leave negative review for botched plastic surgery be issue with slapp claim by the surgeon have hear of tenant who have speak out about their uninhabitable housing be issue with slapp claim by their landlord that be wrong and it must be stop have give few example of relatively high profile case and also of some that be not so well know there be many case that do not attract any attention in court and there be many more that we do not know about because individual be intimidate before legal proceeding actually commence the datum that the government have be only the tip of the iceberg as have suggest slapp be extremely pernicious before any action reach court pre action letter and legal pressure be apply well before proceeding be initiate this often result in the search or the investigation be withdraw before publication or in some case in whole variety of different area the effectiveness of threat and intimidation be such that the case never see the light of day accordingly that will never be reflect in available datum then we come to the press in this country let we remember that as country that champion freedom both here and abroad we must ensure that our free press which be real pillar of our democracy never feel so vulnerable that it self censor on vital matter in the public interest no one in the united kingdom be above the law furthermore no one should be above proper scrutiny on matter of public interest as to the datum we have the provision of figure from the coalition against slapp in europe be deeply concern in themselves it estimate that there be slapp in england and wales in that be up from in and in case august report record that the total figure in europe over the past decade be the hon member mention the coalition against slapp in europe wonder whether he agree with the slapp coalition that the propose bill as draft would introduce subjective test require court to infer the state of mind and purpose of the filer do he agree with that that would create complexity cost and delay which would potentially make the bill ineffective it be an issue that have to be consider carefully and indeed it have be give great deal of consideration and much debate on that point will the hon gentleman give way may just respond to the other point that have be make it be vital that this issue be consider properly and deeply hope very much that if we be successful today the debate will continue into committee so that further consideration may be give to that issue at the moment be err on the side of what be suggest by my private member bill think the bill strike balance it be not quite accurate to talk about subjectivity and objectivity because judge will have to make determination on the fact that be present and his knowledge of how the case be be conduct at the moment err in favour of say that there be false dichotomy but it be something that should be consider far in committee join in concordance with the hon member for caerphilly wayne david this be an excellent piece of legislation and be very broadly in support of it just want to respond to the comment from the hon member for tiverton and honiton richard foord subjectivity be actually fundamental part of our legal system already we talk often of the man on the clapham omnibus it be the reasonableness test so do not think there be anything in the bill that be out of scope or inappropriate be inclined to agree with that comment as my bill suggest but it be something that need to have more airing and more consideration detailed consideration in committee would be an appropriate place for that to happen as other have say many time most slapp relate activity take place below the radar before formal court case and court claim be issue there be number of reason why slapp be so bad and why slapps claimant be so successful in their warped objective of perpetrate they commonly the comparatively modest mean of defendant be leveraged against they to encourage retraction or the abandonment of the important research that would shine light on questionable behaviour bully tactic can include huge threatened litigation cost and damage and all of the unbearable consequence such as bankruptcy and loss of home and livelihood as well as the emotional distress that entail all of that can cause huge hardship and psychological pressure sadly many people be not able to withstand all of that so many of the case be like david and goliath but if david have no slingshot should be clear about why the unfairness of legal system that allow all of that have to be challenge and change that be why be bring forward the bill today we must eradicate the harm cause by that kind of aggressive litigation we must protect publisher author and advocate from spurious claim and empower they to forge ahead with publish legitimate story ground well research investigative reporting must be protect not rein in for fear of colossal legal cost we must do our utmost to protect and empower ordinary people and give they the confidence to use the legal system of this country to ensure fairness in the public interest of course protect journalist or anyone else can not be at the expense of deny claimant their right of access to justice but at present the fact that claimant can wrongly exploit the justice system to obfuscate the transparency that be essential in healthy democracy mean that an important balance must be strike as thing stand that be clearly not the case and that be why call for urgent reform today robust action to counter slapp in all their form be need and it be need now have seek to work alongside the government to ensure that the approach underpin the economic crime and corporate transparency act which be positively receive across civil society medium and the legal profession include the regulator remain largely intact in the bill as it achieve what be necessary the bill will therefore keep for the most part the definition of slapp claim in the economic crime and corporate transparency act but it will also broaden the scope and capture all slapp in future in future any slapp case in which speak out be in the public interest include for publication on economic crime will be catch let address the component of the definition first the claimant will have act to restrain the defendant exercise of their right to freedom of speech secondly the exercise of that right will have be in the pursuit of the public interest or expose potential wrongdoing or other bad behaviour such as illegality or untruth or matter to do with public health and safety or the climate and the environment thirdly the claimant will have misuse litigation for its threat to cause harm to the defendant specifically through harassment stress or expense which be beyond that which can be ordinarily expect in properly conduct litigation the last point include an important distinction legal case almost always bring measure of stress and expense to the party involve give their serious nature as have say slapp claim be often design to generate excessive stress and expense in pursuit of remedy that be mere fig leaf or excuse to allow the real harm that the claimant wish to cause one thing that distinguish slapp claim be that the legal action be not pursue for the appropriate remedy but as means in its own right of bring oppression to bear to safeguard against that harm in an effective and proportionate way include by ensure that legitimate claim can proceed the bill will introduce new early dismissal test claimant will have to show that they be more likely than not to succeed at trial where they can not do so the case will be strike out in addition much of the harm in slapp claim lie in the risk of adverse cost that defendant face properly function early dismissal mechanism will assist in remove many of the risk to the defendant however for slapp claim that be not dismiss early the bill will introduce new cost regime that protect defendant from cost that they would usually pay if they lose the case that will ensure that defendant can defend themselves properly and that the risk of cost do not force they to settle claim unnecessarily the underpinning principle of that new cost regime be include in the provision but the detail will be introduce under the usual cost regime make power through rule of court together those provision will initially require only new civil procedure rule to give they shape and maximise their effectiveness as the evidence available show that slapp be focus on civil proceeding however the provision can be extend by regulation to any other proceeding as necessary such as the online procedure rule trust that the government will make necessary regulation when claimant who be well resource and able to exploit any perceive loophole choose other court in which to pursue slapp that will also help to ensure that the bill be future proof slapp be likely to evolve and we need legal infrastructure to be robust enough to meet future challenge as result of the bill the court will have the necessary tool and guidance to deal swiftly with all slapp which aim to stifle freedom of speech investigative journalist will also be empower to expose wrongdoing in all its form whatever that may be it be my hope that defendant in such case will as consequence feel safe from attempt to wrongly exploit our legal system journalist and other will be empower to shine light on criminal misconduct wherever they find it whatever form it take without fear of spurious claim be make against they unscrupulous individual or corporation brazenly misuse our court and legal system to further their agenda to the detriment of the public interest though it be wrong to do so as matter of principle the public must know about wrongdoing and corruption so that our democratic society can function and the rule of law can be preserve this bill recognise the breadth and depth of slapp currently the law focus solely on economic crime but slapp can be find in all area of the law this all embrace legislation against slapp be believe truly significant step in ensure freedom of speech and remove clear abuse of our legal system therefore urge colleague across the house to give the bill their full support we in this house should all be proud of this country international reputation for uphold the rule of law in the current global climate and follow the recent murder of russian opposition leader alexei navalny that be freedom that we can not take for grant navalny be an incredibly brave man and his wife should be an inspiration to we all navalny want the world to know the truth about what kind of man putin be and today we be help he in that aim the protection of our legal system must be priority for all in this house ensure that this country reputation continue long into the future for that reason thank the hon member for caerphilly wayne david for bring this bill before parliament today and urge all colleague to support it we be here because we have to beef up the law to far ensure that we do not allow our legal system to be manipulate and abuse by bad faith actor wish to shut down freedom of the press and freedom of speech in an investigation by the new york times find that in four of the six prior year litigant from russia and kazakhstan have be involve in more civil case in england than any other foreign national those case seek order to freeze the asset of people worldwide individual and corporation many from country where the freedom we enjoy in this country do not exist use strategic litigation against public participation claim to harass and intimidate journalist and author out of share information that those party do not want see or know the prime example be case bring by multiple russian billionaire include former chelsea owner roman abramovich who attempt to sue the author and publisher of the book putin people that book delve deep into the relationship between those oligarch and russian president vladimir putin relationship that those individual care deeply about when it suit they but journalist can face legal action for point that out as have be mention kazakh mining company bring case against another journalist tom burgis over the content of book that he publish about illegally gain money in the global economy thankfully that attempt to silence journalist fail have raise the issue surround putin people before in this chamber alongside many colleague from across the house include my hon friend the member for isle of wight bob seely whose work on this issue commend the point of these lawsuit be to threaten the defendant with colossal legal cost we be talk about amount that no normal person can afford and harass and intimidate they into capitulate putin people author catherine belton and her publisher be leave with staggering million legal bill follow the case bring against they today bill present we with the opportunity to far prevent such attempt silencing of author and journalist by russian billionaire or any other bad faith actor it would put in place new rule so that claim deem to be slapp could be dismiss and defendant could be protect from pay the claimant legal cost unless that be justify the government have be strong in their condemnation of slapp and be proud to see the economic crime and corporate transparency act recently receive royal assent that act allow judge to throw out slapp relate to economic crime which be good first step at least of the slapp case identify by the foreign policy centre in be connect to financial crime and corruption however we can not and must not stop there so welcome the fact that the government be support the bill we need to prevent all form of slapp once and for all and this bill be the mechanism for do that the urgency of this issue can not be overstate the coalition against slapp in europe find that slapp take place in europe in compare with in increase the united kingdom be name slapp hotbe and the forum of choice for would be slapp initiator birmingham law school professor have say that the high cost of defamation litigation and the ability of foreign claimant to resolve dispute in the uk have make this country an ideal location for slapp other legislature have already take action several us state have introduce similar law and the european parliament be expect to approve similar anti slapp directive next week as result if we do not pass this bill today britain risk be leave behind in an area in which we should be proudly lead as more place prohibit slapp the chance that more case will be bring in the uk increase far we must be clear that the only purpose of slapp be to silence critic they have no legal merit we must act to protect this country international reputation for uphold the rule of law and our hard fought freedom of speech justice and the press we must ensure that journalist and publisher can publish information back by source and fact concern any individual no matter the size of their bank account we in this country be proud of the leadership we have show follow the bloody russian invasion of ukraine and pass this bill would be small but important way of contribute to that leadership again thank the hon member for caerphilly for bring this bill to the chamber and look forward to support its passage through the house commend my hon friend the member for caerphilly wayne david for his work in bring this bill to the house and thank campaigner for what they be do to prevent the misuse of litigation to suppress freedom of speech democratic and press freedom be fundamental to our right and to challenge corruption and the abuse of power when whistleblower speak out and journalist and free press report the truth society be well for it just this week julian assange extradition appeal close at the royal courts of justice it be concern to hear that he be unwell and unable to appear in court be conscious that the proceeding be ongoing but want to say that human right be central to what be happen in his case the issue be not just how he have be treat simply for tell the truth if extradite he could be at risk of treatment amounting to torture and other form of ill treatment and punishment include the death penalty julian assange case have profound consequence for press freedom and democracy around the world we can not say that we stand for press freedom if that freedom exist only if it do not challenge certain power or go beyond what they want as my hon friend say our freedom be undermine when the rich and powerful use the threat of costly legal action to suppress public criticism that be why last year many of we welcome amendment to the economic crime and corporate transparency act that give uk judge new power to dismiss lawsuit that attempt to silence those speak out about economic crime however give the limited scope of the act and certain shortcoming in its text those amendment fall short of provide meaningful protection against slapp there be inequality under the legislation for those subject to slapp that do not relate to economic crime and corruption we know that powerful man use their power and the law to silence woman the purpose of such proceeding often describe as gagging order be to silence intimidate discredit and further disempower survivor some campaigner call it gendere censorship it happen in the uk but it be also global phenomenon although welcome the ambition of the bill believe there may be scope for further amendment about the definition of slapp so that domestic abuse be fully cover particularly in the understanding of public interest say that because we all know of series of libel case in which wealthy man have seek to protect their reputation when woman accuse they of abuse current legislation put survivor at disadvantage for example under the defamation act the defendant in libel case can argue public interest defence but that be not available to survivor appeal to the government to look at that carefully and at how the bill can be extend beyond the civil court to the family court in january participate in backbench business debate on the use of lawfare and strategic litigation against public participation by those seek to suppress public debate bully people into submission and conceal vital information that be in the public interest describe my experience of lawfare be use against the house will be aware that be completely clear and vindicate in snaresbrook crown court after what and many other in my constituency and around the uk view to have be vexatious litigation pursue with the purpose of shut down my public participation as democratically elect socialist member of parliament and survivor of domestic abuse the use of lawfare by abuser to pursue their current or ex partner be come to light more and more be aware that the occurrence of civil litigation case of this nature have drastically increase particularly follow the widely publicise amber heard versus johnny depp case in the us the most common proceeding we see bring be by man accuse of sexual misconduct domestic violence launch vexatious case in relation to defamation libel the misuse of private information harassment and press injunction the un special rapporteur on freedom of expression irene khan write in dedicated report on gender censorship in say in perverse twist in the metoo age woman who publicly denounce allege perpetrator of sexual violence online be increasingly subject to defamation suit or charge with criminal libel or the false reporting of crime weaponise the justice system to silence woman feed impunity while also undermine free speech in addition barrister jennifer robinson and dr yoshida make the argument in their book that the current situation strike an unfair balance between his right to reputation and her right to freedom of speech what be miss in the legislation in the uk as it stand be recognition of the importance of her additional right her right to live life free from gender base violence and her right to equality the practice of abuser weaponise civil litigation against survivor be continuation of abuse as well as additional trauma often find myself ask if we can not speak about violence against woman and girl how can we even tackle it by their nature these case misuse the court and be bring against survivor to silence they and re victimise they emotionally and financially urge the government to look at the situation in the family court as well as the civil court no one should suffer domestic abuse and anyone in such situation should be support in speak out it be matter of public good and public interest it be pleasure to follow the hon member for poplar and limehouse apsana begum may start by congratulate the hon member for caerphilly wayne david he have bring forward an excellent private member bill and this be entirely what we should be do with friday sitting love friday sitting have out myself as geek on multiple occasion for this be what the job be about come here and talk at length about stuff that be important to people also out myself as lawyer and wave my llb about be passionate about our legal system and believe keenly in it it be the jewel in the crown of our state it be par excellence and second to none it deeply grieve when something so important be pervert for the narrow interest of small cadre of people who have rightly deduce that technical flaw be available to they and they have enough money to exploit it the system should not be exploitable purely because someone have the financial resource to do it we should not be able to purchase justice in this country but people do that will speak to two main issue only that have deduce from read this private member bill which will support fully hasten to add the first be matter for when the bill reach committee and that be how we address the serious problem of forum shopping this country have particularly robust approach to defamation legislation imagine that publish book like putin people for example it could be the case that it be publish in different country but that only get sue in this one because this country be the one that be most technically adept at allow somebody to get money out of and keep quiet that will then prevent from be able to publish that book in other place effectively that process in one country will gag in other country think we can do something in that space the hon gentleman have put together an excellent bill it be one for the pinstripe suited be actually not wear pinstripe suit today geeky bod to get into we will have to drill down into the bill to ensure that it be as robust as possible but be happy with its direction my second point be about address what the bill be really about it be about not technical amendment to the legal system as much as love those but freedom of speech freedom of speech be one of the most fundamental right in every democracy the united states constitution start with congress shall make no law respect an establishment of religion or prohibit the freedom of speech or of the press or the right of the people peaceably to assemble and to petition the government for redress of grievance that be an incredibly powerful and potent set of clause that prevent the situation we be discuss from happen in the united states we have to rely on article of the european convention on human right and will say now for the avoidance of doubt that you will get through wood chipper fast than you will get through division lobby to take we out of that article be incredibly important but it be not adequate for the task ahead of we and that be why this be such an important bill as member of parliament want to be able to go out and talk about what be correct right proper and decent without have to rely on the fact that have immunity in this chamber but can not do that without fear or favour at the moment because this lawfare system think the hon member for poplar and limehouse coin that term which be an effective way of describe what be go be basically be use to destroy one of the fundamental principle of our democracy the hon member for caerphilly be entirely right and proper to bring we this bill will enthusiastically support it if he need people for bill committee when it get to that stage will be there and be afraid will be talk lot it be pleasure to take part in the debate particularly with you in the chair mr speaker this be essentially debate about free speech which know be of great concern to you not only in this chamber but outside it it be also of particular concern to my hon friend the member for caerphilly wayne david and congratulate he on bring the bill forward he be quite busy with his other hat on as the shadow minister for the middle east so it be good that he have time to be here on friday to promote his bill hope he have the government support would say that this become live issue for the house when the right hon member for haltemprice and howden sir david davis hold his january debate on lawfare and the uk court system as with everything american the term slapp have take over the language here but lawfare be effectively the same thing on that day which be really the issue first run out reply for the opposition there be many strong contribution and the debate put the issue on the map include on the government map let we give the government little bit of credit although not too much there have be some progress we have hear about what be in the economic crime and corporate transparency act deal with the issue of slapp but in particular way and for particular type of offence that is around economic crime and the anti slapps taskforce also meet but it be somewhat disappointing that the government have not bring forward their own comprehensive legislation on the issue hope they will use the agency of my hon friend the member for caerphilly to get something on the book in the time available in this parliament nevertheless we have not do the entire job that be no criticism at all of my hon friend and do not know whether that be an invitation for to be on the bill committee as well will deal with three point that need slightly further attention the first which my hon friend mention be the issue of slapp take place in the dark pre issue as it be there have be some attention by the solicitors regulation authority to that in issue guideline but there be still quite strong feeling that many slapp be effective long before get to the courtroom because of the intimidation which we should not underemphasise place on individual they may be author or journalist but they may just be individual member of the public the intimidation may even be of corporation and yet they can not take the risk because they be up against people with not just deep but bottomless pocket we hear about the million cost for catherine belton in relation to putin people that be pocket money for abramovich but for publisher let alone journalist it be significant sum of money more comprehensive view of how slapps act be important in relation to resource do not want to disagree with my hon friend but we need to look at the point that the anti slapp coalition and the nuj have raise and the hon member for tiverton and honiton richard foord about subjective or objective test that be not easy obviously there be subjective as well as objective test throughout the legal system nevertheless there be real fear that the need for defendant to show subjective element will be path for the claimant to tie proceeding up in knot complicate thing and drag they out do not know what the solution be but we should at least explore that and listen to the expert organisation particularly the national union of journalists and the anti slapp coalition which be urge we to take that course do the hon member think that minor amendment could be introduce to add an objective test base on observable feature of abuse to help prevent litigation from be misuse to suppress freedom of speech it sound like the hon member want to be on the bill committee and be draft his amendment in his head have never know private member bill committee to be so popular be not legal draftsman and do not know the answer to his question but we need to bottom out this issue because it seem to be attract the most attention other issue have be raise about overlap with the defamation act and cost there be provision on cost in the bill but it be about whether they be drive down cost as far as they can and about public interest number of area could be far explore even in this short bill cost be vital but often neglect part of the legal process this be hobby horse of mine we have just discuss the media bill in the house and the repeal of section of the crime and courts act which in effect take leveson part out of the equation with regard to have level playing field for victim of press abuse if can put it that way on slapp the government appear to support legislation such as this to prevent cost be use as weapon to prevent people get their just desert and their day in court but there be different situation when it come to the medium itself can not for the life of see the difference of course leveson cut both way leveson also provide formula for protect small publisher against exactly the sort of people who take part in slapp indeed he could have use the word slapp in his report it also protect the innocent victim of press abuse because the press magnate not journalist and small publisher but major publisher also have bottomless pocket in his response or during the passage of the bill could the minister think again at the very least about how the government will approach the issue of small publisher and journalist be sue in order to protect the so call privacy often the nefarious activity of very wealthy individual and corporation this can affect anyone include journalist like tom burgis who win his case the experience do not discourage he because next week be hop to go to the launch of his late book cuckooland where the rich own the truth let give he little plug it will soon be available from all good bookshop it take huge courage for someone to risk everything simply in the course of prosecute their employment when there be the risk of bankruptcy or be drop by their publisher although that be not at risk have to say in tom case we hear about the case of charlotte leslie former colleague of ours who be effectively persecute through the court we be lucky we have the protection of privilege here however when we step outside this place we can become victim in that way just like anybody else who be with good intent simply try to tell the truth this even affect organisation such as the serious fraud office which be still be prosecute through the court by the eurasian natural resources corporation the serious fraud office launch the action in good faith and there be what would call retaliatory slapp action although the original action by the sfo have be discontinue the slapp continue it really do look like topsy turvy world when organisation that we should rely on to regulate society in which include investigative journalist members of parliament and certainly criminal investigation organisation themselves become the victim of those they wish to call out that be why we urgently need much more comprehensive approach to slapp and that be why fully welcome the bill and will support it today however think we can do more work on this in respond today hope the government will express their strong support and their desire to go far call the shadow minister this could be quite big day for the welsh with my hon friend the member for caerphilly wayne david introduce his bill and my hon friend the member for newport west ruth jones introduce her later hope also hope to move from the front bench to the back benches to introduce my own bill later in proceeding so that be three welsh bills this morning of course on the front bench we also have my right hon friend the member for alyn and deeside mark tami from the opposition whips office so it really be big morning for the welsh my hon friend the member for caerphilly and come into the house together in it be hard to think that that be nearly year ago congratulate he on his first outing in all that time promote private member bill this morning be glad he be successful in the ballot as it be an important bill for year strategic lawsuit have enable the wealthy and powerful to weaponise their wealth to sue critic into silence as hon member have say it be important that this house vote to put an end to these tactic that gag the press and intimidate people ask legitimate question by threaten they with enormous legal cost lawfare as it have be refer to today thank those who have participate in the debate my hon friend the members for poplar and limehouse apsana begum and for hammersmith andy slaughter and the hon member for heywood and middleton chris clarkson and for west bromwich east nicola richards they all speak extremely effectively in support of the bill but also raise appropriate question about how it should proceed in committee be pleased that the bill have cross party support and understand the government be in full support of it can confirm that it have the support of those on the labour front bench as well it be step forward that the scope of protection provide for in the bill be not limited as be currently the case to economic crime slapp often masquerade as defamation or privacy claim be not really about seek justice but about impose silence exploit the financial and emotional strain of proceeding to discourage individual from exercise their right to speak on matter of public interest labour have long recognise the danger pose by slapp to our democratic value we have already commit to introduce legislation to halt the ability of russian oligarch and the super wealthy such as roman abramovich who have already be mention today to use their wealth as weapon against those who dare to scrutinise their action the background to my hon friend bill be root in disturbing trend of legal harassment from aggressive pre action letter to the targeting of vulnerable financial defendant slapp undermine the foundation of accountability and freedom of speech the enormous legal cost threaten by slapp serve not justice but the suppression of truth the bill be not merely response to grow trend of legal harassment but declaration of our value as society that cherish free speech and the rule of law it broaden the scope beyond economic crime offer protection across all public interest discourse to ensure that no avenue be leave for the misuse of our legal system to suppress legitimate scrutiny and accountability the legal reform propose by my hon friend in his bill be both necessary and timely they reflect deep understanding of the challenge pose by slapp as outline in the evidence session of several parliamentary committees by provide mechanism for early dismissal and cost protection and extend protection to all court and tribunal we be fortify our defence against the abuse of legislation as we consider the provision of the bill let we remember the individual and indeed institution who have be unjustly target by slapp their struggle underscore the imperative for this legislation acknowledge the effort of campaigner include the uk anti slapp coalition for their tireless work in bring this issue to light we must ensure that our legal system serve justice not the interest of those who seek to wield it as tool of oppression acknowledge the issue that have be raise about the bill be sure they will be rehearse in committee when we will have deep discussion on they in addition to the concern that have be raise we need to make sure although be sure it do not that the bill do not prevent ordinary people who wish to restrain the publication of libel and intrusion by wealthy publication from be able to do so in law as my father always use to say in life we should help the weak against the strong know that that be my hon friend intention in bring forward his bill urge all hon member to support the bill in do so we be take stand against the tactic that gag our press intimidate our citizen and erode our democracy it be step forward in an ongoing effort to protect freedom of expression and to ensure that those who seek to report on wrongdoing can do so without fear of retribution in the fight for justice and accountability there be no room for silence the bill can help to end the scourge of slapp and reaffirm our dedication to the principle of democracy and freedom congratulate the hon member for caerphilly wayne david on bring forward the bill and the numerous campaigner who have be press this issue for many year as we have hear slapp be an abuse of our court and our law by corrupt individual who seek to stifle free speech and free press two of the linchpin of our democracy can not talk about the specific case that the hon member for poplar and limehouse apsana begum raise but can reassure she that the bill widen the scope beyond what be in the economic crime and corporate transparency act and that it now talk about all kind of behaviour be more than happy to discuss the specific issue with the hon member for caerphilly as it be his bill to see what we can do to ensure that we either reassure or accommodate she on the specific issue she wish to see cover this issue become increasingly press when the russian oligarch and ally of putin use this process for their own end alongside they we see behaviour by multinational corporation or disreputable landlord to use and abuse our process slapp must always be take seriously and tackle swiftly in this house we have the ability and the privilege to ensure that such abuse be address head on this house stand for free speech and for hold the powerful to account and for always seek to ensure that the good interest of the public in the wide sense be be serve by the law slapp style litigation be an abuse of power design to inhibit public interest investigation and reporting the harm that slapp cause be not only that they stifle public comment by force its removal or edit it they also discourage journalist academic and campaigner from investigate issue in the first place leave matter of public interest undiscovere and the british public in the dark in this way the effect of slapp be far more pernicious we can not sit by and allow our medium to feel that some people and organisation can not be subject to scrutiny just because they have unlimited financial firepower to mobilise aggressive legal tactic to quote andrew galizia whose mother daphne maltese investigative journalist be murder in the aim of these lawsuit be to deprive the target of time and resource and to deter other from take up the same story his mother be subject to lawsuit at the time of her death regardless of whether claim be aim at an author an academic journalist or private individual this abuse of the law to muzzle the free press must not go unchecked we will not allow our justice system to be abuse in the government response to our original call for evidence we say that although there be power enable court to strike out case as an abuse of process these power need to be strengthen to counteract the very sophisticated and aggressive action bring by slapp claimant the house will be aware of some high profile case that have shine light on slapp case such as that bring against the british journalist tom burgis whom member have already mention who be sue for libel in the high court by enrc an oligarch own mining company follow his publication of kleptopia how dirty money be conquer the world there be multiple claim issue against tom burgis by enrc target he as an individual author rather than his publisher these claim concern his tweet podcast and article that mention his book the case be dismiss early on the statement complain about be find not to be defamatory and mr burgis be vindicate but how many more case do not reach our courtroom due to the intimidatory tactic and cost run up by aggressive claimant before proceeding be even initiate think that be the point make by the hon member for hammersmith andy slaughter and will address couple of his point at this juncture we have engage with the sra and will continue to do so as the hon member mention warning notice have already be issue the fine for misbehaviour by solicitor firm have be increase and pre action behaviour be legitimate cause of concern the government will continue to engage with the regulator to see how that can be far address as so many people have volunteer to be on the public bill committee be sure that with the indulgence of the hon member for caerphilly we can look at the issue in more depth there be evidence that the number of slapp be increase year on year there be case in the uk in in and in such worrying and abusive conduct whereby those with deep pocket attempt to financially bully dissent voice be unacceptable in our democracy the court must not be pawn in these underhand attempt to cover up corruption and wrongdoing slapp be modern day struggle between david and goliath we have individual journalist academic and author up against extremely wealthy individual and corporate with unlimited resource on their side we can not let this type of intimidation and harassment stand it be right that wrongdoing and dubious deal be lay bare for the world to see and those who expose such behaviour should not be afraid of the repercussion of do so that be why the government listen and introduce the economic crime and corporate transparency act to tackle slapp claim connect to financial misdeed that act mean we be the first country in the world to legislate against slapp at national level although we can argue over whether it be overdue we be certainly the first to do it and we ought to take pride in the fact that this legislature act fast than most the act give cover to only small part of the slapp regime and it target only one part of economic crime which be why this private member bill seek to address the gap it will make sure that the definition of slapp be more comprehensive the hon member for tiverton and honiton richard foord raise the issue of behaviour in the test of objectivity and subjectivity the issue of subjectivity be not unusual and the court will consider all evidence before it come to an assessment include an explanation from the claimant as to why their claim be reasonable the court be of course well verse in take that information into account the test of subjectivity or intent be not unusual and it be well establish in our court system clause give specific example of slapp type behaviour believe there be careful balance between the standard practice of intent and tighten thing up to give objective guidance to the judiciary on what constitute slapp type behaviour the bill follow the economic crime and corporate transparency act in establish cost protection regime that limit legal cost in slapp claim protect defendant from the obscene cost run up by claimant to increase the intimidatory effect of their claim this will also help to address the glare inequality of arm between the party in these case of course one of the big step forward be the ability to secure early dismissal so that these case do not rumble on and rack up fee particularly for defendant the ability to strike out case at an early stage be big part of the cost protection armoury our reform also have to ensure balance between defend people from slapp type behaviour and protect access to justice which be fundamental part of our system it be for the court and the judiciary to determine whether case be slapp and whether it have merit we have act to remove the level of fear and risk that these case can engender the government be glad to welcome and support this bill which build on the important progress already make thank the hon member for caerphilly for seize the moment to introduce private member bill this be an opportune time to build on what we have do so far and to make it more comprehensive as he outline so well the government have find that the scourge of slapp be unfortunately spread into new area such as sexual harassment clinical negligence and landlord and tenant dispute the purpose of this bill be to tackle such behaviour if the behaviour look like duck and quack like duck it slapp interruption sorry that be rather clumsy english be sure hansard will correct this bill be major step forward and it be time to legislate the majority of slapp be think to be link to economic crime but it be time to move on and make the definition more all encompass will cover couple of point raise by hon member my hon friend the member for west bromwich east nicola richards raise the belton case again information from all slapp case form part of the call for evidence so can reassure she that the activity in the belton case will be part of the foundation of this bill my hon friend the member for heywood and middleton chris clarkson speak about forum shopping which will look at and be sure he will raise it in his customary fashion in committee be sure the hon member for caerphilly will urge he not to talk quite as much as he promise it be credit to this parliament that member of all party have rally to support action on this issue and to introduce new law to help ensure the integrity of our justice system and to support the freedom and protection that we all cherish in some way private member bill be the most fitting way to complete what the government start have speak about the work we be do with the solicitors regulation authority to ensure that it tighten up its regulation and we will continue to engage with it pay tribute to the uk anti slapp coalition which have be an enormously effective stakeholder the coalition have support the government effort and thank it for its consistent engagement and clarity on this issue the department for culture media and sport launch the slapps taskforce last september with remit to develop non legislative recommendation to tackle slapp good progress be be make on number of front and thank the secretary of state for her tireless commitment internationally the uk be represent as an expert member of the council of europe working group on slapp which conclude its mandate in december the draft recommendation which be produce over the course of two year will now make its way to the committee of ministers and we trust that it will be eventually adopt in all member state the government act last october by legislate against slapp because we must not allow our court to be abuse and our legal system manipulate we be therefore pleased to support the bill and will continue to ensure that those who speak out against corruption who hold the powerful to account and who guard our freedom through their voice be protect let again thank the hon member for caerphilly for promote the bill also thank the official at the ministry of justice for provide all the necessary support as we move forward with the leave of the house be very pleased that we have have such good debate it be laudable that so many member in all part of the house have take the time to attend and to make such excellent contribution also pay tribute to people and organisation outside the house notably the uk anti slapp coalition it have work tirelessly on this issue for some time and its input have be of tremendous value thank the ministry of justice and its civil servant for their assistance its briefing and its constructive engagement at all time there be number of issue that many member consider particularly important such as the so call issue of subjective test be inclined to agree with what the minister say in sum up the debate but accept that there be room for further discussion and we will be able to deal with it in some detail if the bill go into committee agree that cost be fundamental issue number of member have cite example in which it be enormously important in ensure that justice be do and be see to be do in her evidence to select committee the author catherine belton say that in london single letter cost as much as address concern that have be express by number of people if one letter cost we all know how much an entire case could cost surely that can not be right in democratic country which pride itself on freedom of speech in which freedom of speech be pivotal and which allow justice for all hope very much that the bill will continue its progress through the house and will reach the statute book because think that that would be huge step forward for parliamentary democracy question put and agree to bill accordingly read second time to stand committed to public bill committee standing order no space industry indemnities bill second read beg to move that the bill be now read second time be delighted to be here to introduce bill that will help to support our thriving and dynamic space sector it will amend section of the space industry act to make clear in legislation that all spaceflight operator licence must specify limit on the amount of the licensee liability under section of the act the act enable commercial spaceflight activity which include launch spacecraft and operate satellite in orbit for example and other activity such as the operation of spaceport and management of range to be carry out under licence in the united kingdom the act set out the broad licensing and regulatory framework for carry out such activity and be underpin with more detailed provision in the space industry regulations united nations space treaty place obligation and responsibility on state for activity in outer space in particular un space treaty make state liable for damage or injury cause by their space activity or those of their national section of the act require person carry out spaceflight activity to indemnify the uk government and number of name public body against any claim bring against the government or body in respect of damage or loss arise out of or in connection with those spaceflight activity however that be subject to any limit on the amount of an operator liability specify in their licence except in prescribed circumstance such as where the operator be liable in respect of gross negligence or wilful misconduct the act currently provide power for the regulator to specify limit on the amount of the operator liability in their licence but the act do not make it mandatory currently section of that act provide that an operator licence may specify limit on the amount of licensee liability to indemnify under section but this contrast with regulation of the space industry regulations make under power in section of the act whereby an operator licence must specify limit on the amount of licensee liability for damage or injury to third party it also contrast with section of the outer space act which regulate uk national scottish firm and body incorporate under the law of any part of the uk that carry on space activity from outside the uk these require licence to specify the maximum amount of the licensee liability to indemnify the government under section of that act through response to the government consultation on spaceflight liability insurance and charging the government be aware that operator hold unlimited liability could be barrier to conduct spaceflight activity from the uk the same consultation confirm that other launch nation limit liability or provide state guarantee for spaceflight activity conduct from their territory current government policy and guidance be that all spaceflight operator licence will contain limit on the amount of the operator liability and the amount of insurance that they be require to hold so that no operator will face unlimited liability however industry operator continue to lobby for legislative certainty and have raise that for spaceflight activity in the uk to be commercially viable there need to be clear mandatory cap on the amount of liability to indemnify under section of the act the bill will provide legislative certainty by amend may to must in section of the act so that an operator licence must specify limit on the amount of the operator liability under section the bill make small amendment to section of the act the propose amendment to the act will meet key ask of the space sector on regulatory improvement to provide assurance to investor that limit on the amount of an operator liability will be include in licence the bill will also address recommendation make by the taskforce on innovation growth and regulatory reform there have be parliamentary scrutiny the science and technology committee raise the question of operator certainty on liability cap in its second report of the session uk space strategy and uk satellite infrastructure publish on november the taskforce on innovation growth and regulatory reform consider current requirement and view they as discourage investment and make the uk uncompetitive recommendation be to amend the space industry act to cap liability and indemnity requirement for licence applicant to launch and operate satellite from the uk there have also be consultation on october the government publish consultation on spaceflight liability insurance and charge respondent raise concern about the wording of section of the space industry act under which licence only may contain limit of liability with respect to claim make under section of the act on march in response to the consultation the government say in their regulation and guidance on spaceport and spaceflight activity if another suitable piece of primary legislation be bring forward the government may seek to amend the wording in section from may to must we all benefit from the service provide by satellite we might pay for our morning coffee use contactless payment google pay or even cash withdraw from an atm none of that would be possible without satellite satellite provide precise reference for navigation communication to remote place and picture of our change planet not to mention the support they provide to the defence and security of the united kingdom satellite datum space technology and space application be use to enhance our everyday life the space sector be hugely valuable to the uk economy it be worth over billion and directly employ more than people it support over job across the supply chain the uk be already one of the world strong centre of advanced satellite manufacturing thank to this government it be now possible to launch satellite from uk spaceport rather than rely solely on overseas spaceport to launch uk build satellite into orbit last year an historical first launch from uk soil be make by virgin orbit at spaceport cornwall in december saxavord spaceport in the shetland islands become the uk first license vertical launch spaceport with more to follow new launch company such as orbex and skyrora have build factory in scotland create hundred of new job ready to take advantage of the new opportunity that the government have create in preparation for this debate have be ask question by several member and will address those now have be ask what effect the bill will have on public expenditure and can assure the house that it will not entail any additional expenditure as the amendment be in line with government policy have be ask whether there be any transitional arrangement there be not clause provide that the bill will come into force two month to the day on which it be pass transitional arrangement be not require because no licence have be grant that do not have limit on liability specify in they by virtue of the government policy on limit liability have be ask whether have ensure compatibility with the european convention on human right as this be private member bill no statement of compatibility be require however as record in the explanatory note the department for transport consider that the provision of the bill be compatible with the convention have be ask whether it be compatible with environmental law again as it be private member bill no statement under section of the environment act be require but as the explanatory note say the department for transport be of the view that the bill do not contain provision that if enact would be environmental law for the purpose of section this be narrowly focused bill address what the space sector have ask for hope that no further amendment will be table as it would be shame to be unable to progress or deliver this key ask from our increasingly important space industry because of amendment or addition let give final summary of the purpose of the bill why think it be important and how it will benefit our space industry before company can operate satellite in orbit or carry out launch mission from the uk it must first obtain spaceflight operator licence under the space industry act the licence process ensure that spaceflight activity be undertake safely securely and in accordance with the uk international obligation under united nations space treaty the state be ultimately liable for any damage or injury that may be cause by its space activity even when undertake by commercial space operator the space industry act contain provision to help mitigate potential cost to uk taxpayer arise from uk commercial spaceflight activity that include requirement for operator to hold insurance and under section to indemnify the uk government and other name public body against any claim bring against the government or body in respect of damage or loss it be recognise however that unlimited liability on commercial space activity would be barrier to their operating in the united kingdom other space nation such as france and the united states of america limit liability or provide state guarantee for the launch activity that take place from their territory the space industry act contain power to specify in spaceflight operator licence limit on the amount of an operator liability in order to indemnify the government and other public body government policy be that the regulator should use those power to specify limit on the amount of the operator liability in the licence so that no operator will face unlimited liability it be essentially form of risk sharing between the commercial operator and government this policy be set out in guidance and understand that all spaceflight operator licence issue under the space industry act to date contain limit on the amount of an operator liability however the industry have make it very clear in response to consultation and in other forum that it would welcome legal certainty that it will not face unlimited liability when launch or operate satellite from the uk set that clear requirement in law would provide uk industry and those look to invest in the uk with great certainty and would carry more force than reliance on policy statement and guidance this bill will provide that legal certainty by amend section of the space industry act so that spaceflight operator licence must specify limit on the amount of the operator liability under section of that act as such the bill will provide vital further boost to our burgeon uk space industry be particularly mindful of the benefit it will bring to grow and innovative company such as surrey satellite technology ltd on the surrey research park many of whose past and current employee live in my constituency of woking our uk space industry be thrive but this measure be vital to secure an equally exciting and dynamic future it be company such as surrey satellite technology ltd just outside my constituency and many of whose employee live in my constituency that will benefit other firm large medium and small will grow in the uk and come to the uk if this measure be pass to ensure that exciting and dynamic future commend the bill to the house rise to speak in support of the bill in my capacity as chair of the all party parliamentary group for space before get to the thrust of my speech draw the house attention to my entry in the register of members financial interests my interest be both financial and non financial and have number of outside role that be relevant to the uk space industry congratulate my hon friend the member for woking mr lord on introduce bill that appear extraordinarily simple but as we hear from his well thought through and well deliver speech would actually have profound impact on lot of technical area in the space sector it show great deal of skill on his part that he can do something quite so complex in such straightforward intelligent and elegant way as my hon friend say the bill seek to enhance the uk position in the space industry by make change to liability for spaceflight risk that be wholly pragmatic and welcome change the bill purpose be to make the uk an even well place to operate space business from and it follow on from the space strategy publish two or three year ago the bill seek to resolve some technical anomaly in the insurance sector in goo and sensible way importantly it clarify aspect of risk in way that should provide comfort to those financial wizard support our superb space innovator many of whom have meet be delighted to say that many come to parliament for one of the regular space sector showcase run by the all party parliamentary group for space the next one which will be in the attlee suite on the morning of march be on the sustainability and future of space activity all member and members staff be welcome to come along to hear about that fascinating area the space sector be incredibly important people do not realise that every time they use cashpoint their transaction be confirm through position navigation and timing that come from navigation satellite pass overhead we can do an amazing number of thing we can analyse country economic activity through heat sensor from earth observation satellite which can tell we whether city port or railway station be busy we can look at any number of different thing we can predict the use of crop fertiliser plant and distressed crop through earth observation satellite be delighted to say that chair the advisory board of the space energy initiative this be non financial interest and we be look at whether beam energy from space can be part of the future of secure and safe planet what we can do be absolutely extraordinary in we first land man on the moon and we be do an enormous number of brilliant thing be delighted to say that number of uk space industry be now look to get involve in the artemis programme whereby nasa be look to take astronaut back to the moon possibly as early as next year this be very exciting time for space in wide range of area we can go wrong by focus specifically on the space sector itself would suggest that there be an increase benefit to the uk that go far than the space industry the space industry be important for number of reason one of which be that because of the high value of this type of activity it address exactly what adam smith propose in his book the wealth of nations nation should try to create great wealth by have great productivity this country have have productivity conundrum for number of year and concentrate on the space sector could increase our productivity and therefore benefit the whole of the country the bill also talk about the service sector the insurance industry member will be aware that before come to parliament be in financial service investment banking and small investment fund management so when look at the opportunity present by something such as the space sector tend to look at the many uk opportunity in the context not just of the direct beneficiary but of how the sector help the wide economy the uk have one of the good certainly the old wholesale insurance market locate in the city of london it must be the aim of the whole of government to ensure not just that spaceflight and operation be control from the uk but that all involve in the space industry come to london to seek insurance and other financial service from our financial service expert have argue for some time that the uk should do more to align the interest of our space industry with the interest of the uk financial market take inspiration from former chancellor of the exchequer when he be newly appoint chancellor after the general election many year ago the former member for kirkcaldy and cowdenbeath recognise the uk good but small film industry he choose to make small intervention in the tax system to incentivise investment into uk film as direct result he help to rebuild the uk film industry into the vibrant and innovative industry that it be today suspect that when we look at some great film direct thread can be trace between that intervention by the former right hon member for kirkcaldy and cowdenbeath back in the late and for example the success of the harry potter franchise right here in the uk harry potter be brilliant export and be always go to be great film success but be certain that without that intervention the hero of the harry potters may well have cast their spell with american accent think we can look to that dare say great former labour chancellor for the huge amount he do for the british film industry it may be the only time that the house hear say great and labour chancellor in the same sentence but he do an important job and we should recognise that of course there be little bit of abuse of the system by one or two people enjoy it but notwithstanding that the intervention have be important similar intervention can be make to support not just the space industry but our world class wholesale financial market it be important that the city of london do not just think about what it do today and whether it do market well it should be completely innovate the whole time to seek opportunity that come in the future we should not think about any industry only in term of what we can offer it we must think about our ambition in any sector with view to how it can enhance wide service sector in the case of financial service investment banker raise capital investment and insurance service secure risk cover for innovator or help investor to find way to maximise their opportunity in the sector we should be think how fiscal intervention might benefit all concerned after all our brilliant innovator research institution network of catapult accelerator and university and all the rest of it already attract great deal of international business to the uk that be very good thing we also need to appreciate that we need the good space industry financier in the world to come to the uk and locate their expertise right here in the city of london and the good insurance expert and the good space lawyer we need to seek to achieve in the space industry and the wide economy the uk be the good place to come for everything need to support space ambition believe the government be enthusiastic about this private member bill and thank my hon friend the member for woke for bring it forward it be truly innovative bill the city of london as think have mention need to remain relevant the city of london be an incredible jewel in the crown of this country it have have its problem but none the less it pay through taxation for an awful lot of hospital police officer and school lot of good thing come out of the city of london but it need to be relevant the whole time for the future we need to be make sure as we develop something like the space industry or ai or any of these other industry that we help the city of london to focus and be part of that so that there be symbiotic relationship between the financial service sector and these other sector that will benefit our economy be delighted to support the bill it be fantastic congratulate my hon friend the member for woking mr lord on bring forward this private member bill which rise in support of follow my hon friend the member for wyre forest mark garnier will take we from the city of london on which he make some brilliant and valid point to the space sector we be almost in danger of have some join up thinking in this place today one would not be surprised to see cornish mp rise on these benches when we be speak about space we have lot to say in cornwall about the space sector cornwall be in fact at the forefront of the uk develop space economy and be play an increasingly important role in the national space programme to ensure that as many people as possible contribute to and benefit from the economic growth cornwall data space and aerospace strategy ambition include mitigate and reverse environmental degradation restore nature and seek to protect business and community from the impact of climate change both locally and globally work with the government to grow the uk space economy as whole and grow the cornwall and isles of scilly economy to deliver job and international investment while offer an outstanding quality of life for its people cornwall and isles of scilly local enterprise partnership make space one of its main priority some time ago if the house will indulge would like to pay tribute to one of the key player mark duddridge who we lose suddenly last year mark use to be chair of the local enterprise partnership sadly matter of hour after be in zoom meeting with he from this place he tragically and suddenly die mark have leave hole in the industry and business community in cornwall and be very fondly remember new mp look for the people they can trust with knowledge in all these thing so that we can gain our own knowledge and learn about they and mark be certainly one of those people for mark say of the space industry we ve back cornwall spaceport bid from day one because we see the potential for cornwall to play vital role in the uk space economy ambition and create high value job the global space industry could triple in value to more than trillion by and what drive that be climate change security and telecom the facility we be help to fund at spaceport cornwall be already have catalytic effect and attract new space company to cornwall one of those be international space logistic company orbit which will establish satellite assembly integration and testing facility at spaceport cornwall centre for space technologies with support from the european space agency mark play key role in that and other be continue his work he be talented and passionate advocate for cornwall and have leave large hole thank my hon friend the member for woke for bring clarity to the industry as whole as he have mention where we have may we will now have must that be always important so that industry know what it be do member may not know that cornwall have more than business involve in the space industry and local and national partner in people in cornwall be employ in the space industry which be worth about million by we expect more than people to be employ in it with potential value of billion my hon friend have mention some of the business and service employ by the space industry let add to that list the marine protection area that we be deploy not just around uk water but globally because that be do via satellite how do we know how bad climate change be in different part of the world satellite do that for we when be cornwall councillor we have interesting debate about the benefit of the spaceport in cornwall some of our environmentalist be concern that we be send huge great jumbo jet off into space and that it would cause lot of pollution but my belief and that of lot of my constituent be that the good outweigh the bad give the amount of information that we can now get and that surely we in cornwall want to provide the job and infrastructure to allow that information to come back to earth so what else be cornwall do in the space industry there be artificial intelligence and professional service we have space lawyer in cornwall this legislation will be of great interest to they and how they can help their client and they be abreast of it all foot anstey be one such firm provide those service we recently have drone test over the bay of falmouth by company call open skies cornwall pay tribute to the falmouth harbour commissioner miles carden for spearhead that project when huge tanker be ashore in the bay of falmouth or if in high sea it be too dangerous even for pilot boat drone can take out medical supply and bit for the boat that could save life and could certainly save lot of money for those company so they be great investment another tech company farfield operate at mylor boat harbour with mylor boat hire it be test electric eco launch use low cost satellite network rather than wireless system so that check on the battery voltage of boat electric motor can be do via gps check can be do on bilge pump and all sort of other thing on boat all that be happen as part of the space industry which be not just about launch rocket into space and it be vital my hon friend the member for woking mention the newquay spaceport that be year of work again pay tribute to melissa quinn who spearhead much of that project despite what people have say in the press the newquay spaceport be huge success everything that newquay and cornwall do work perfectly cosmic girl run into issue sadly the mission be unsuccessful but newquay prove that we could have spaceport in the uk that be what matter to cornwall to reinforce that point it be rather peculiar thing about the british that we tend to look at failure as problem exactly this type of thing happen with the launch of the spacex starship the minute it clear the pad the mission have be entirely successful when that enormous rocket big than saturn rocket go spiral out of control and blow up the spacex team let out cheer because they have get it right we sometimes get it wrong in the uk as my hon friend mention there be problem with the rocket itself but the uk get it absolutely bang on the money in every single way the licensing and everything go perfectly right the fact that second stage fuel filter go wrong have nothing to do with newquay or the government the spaceport be real success story thank my hon friend for his intervention and will pass on his regard to the good people of cornwall he be absolutely right it be brilliant project from start to finish we have engagement locally and nationally and the local mp my hon friend the member for st austell and newquay steve double work with the project from start to finish let explain what it mean to the people of cornwall it have inspire whole generation of child in the county actually feel sorry for colleague who go into school to talk about mining and renewable and who try to inspire child to go into such career because melissa quinn go in and absolutely wipe the floor with they she have inspire whole generation to go into space career lot of kid and family in cornwall think because we live in cornwall this be for we but it absolutely be for we and our child because of the project we have see investment go into truro and penwith college which now have the facility to train engineer and to do virtual welding and all sort of thing have no idea what go on there but the facility be very shiny and fabulous martin tucker the principal have be fully engage with this project and other to ensure that the kid who be inspire in primary school at the beginning of it can carry out their training in cornwall and go into career in the county cornish mp have be fight for this for decade or more and it be start to happen now thank to that project cosmic girl run into problem newquay be only ever suppose to have one or two launch year be we go to get another one yes absolutely hope that we be but it be not just about work towards launch the project mean that we have the know how the supply chain and the knowledge to support other launch around the country and across the world it be fantastic that the spaceport be still there and we should keep it go know that the cornwall and isles of scilly local enterprise partnership and cornwall council be still very enthusiastic about ensure that we harness the expertise and do not let any of it go the other large company that members may or may not have hear of be sure my hon friend the member for woking have hear of it be goonhilly earth station when people drive right down into the west of cornwall and the constituency of my hon friend the member for st ives derek thomas they will look across the moorland see huge satellite dish and think my goodness what on earth be they do there goonhilly be fantastic the world first private deep space communication network it provide additional capacity to the nasa and european space agency network any deep space mission that member have hear of will have be support by goonhilly and the team there do not know whether member have see the australian movie the dish in which the character have small amount of time when they be the only one on earth support whatever deep space mission or moon landing mission be take place goonhilly start bit like that but it have develop so much more can not remember the figure off the top of my head but the capacity for the amount of datum that can be store at the facility be phenomenal ian jones who run the facility be always look for people to go and see what brilliant thing they be do such as radio astronomy support by cryogenically cool metre antenna it be part of the global space communication network on our ambition we hope that by cornwall and the isles of scilly will be leader in the national space programme exploit the physical digital and intellectual asset of the area and use satellite datum to overcome local and global challenge such as the impact of climate change which we have hear about by datum space and aerospace will have contribute an additional billion to the economic value of cornwall and the isles and scilly through increase productivity and job turnover create twice the average gross value add per capita of or more to facilitate those strategic ambition we have identify local and national strategic lead to support we in maintain awareness of the priority that be vital follow the aftermath of what happen at newquay as say this be still very much part of cornwall and the isles of scilly lep priority it be interlink with all the other industry we be try to promote in cornwall such as renewable and the resurgence of critical mineral critical mineral will need to come out of the ground in cornwall to ensure that we have all these satellite as mention early company be do all sort of amazing thing satellite that be only the size of ford fiesta can now be build and go up into space we be go to launch satellite hopefully this be still reality that take deep dive look from space at cornwall landscape and at what we be and be not do for example we have slightly different grade agricultural land grade land which be vulnerable to proposal for solar farm be actually the most fertile land we have in cornwall we be learn all that because of satellite could go on and on the change my hon friend the member for woking be introduce today may look like small change but it be huge it will bring clarity to all the company in the city of london that my hon friend the member for wyre forest talk about and to every single company have mention and more to ensure that there be level playing field for everybody that everything be clear and that they can continue to build and build and build this be very exciting future for our country and for cornwall thank my hon friend the member for woke for introduce the bill it be pleasure to follow my hon friend the member for truro and falmouth cherilyn mackrory there be few more intrepid voyager in this particular enterprise defiant in the face of adversity but also on voyage of discovery she make an excellent speech and pick up on what the bill be really about my hon friend rightly identify that this not just about put big shiny thing on rocket and fire they into the sky it be about unlock other important bit of the economy my hon friend the member for wyre forest mark garnier also make that point incredibly eloquently we can go back to adam smith and see the cosmic thread if you will we be open up new sector for the uk economy and empower our people be delighted by the idea of space lawyer promise not to go around wave my llb about but that sound awfully like the superhero name would end up give myself be really excited about this be member of the science innovation and technology committee so be very pleased to hear my hon friend the member for woking mr lord mention our report lot of love go into it we enjoy ourselves bit too much be not go to deny it find this entire sector incredibly fascinating and extremely exciting not just because of the aforementioned geekery but because of its potential think about kid in my constituency who be now be expose to opportunity and new horizon that simply be not on the radar of young people even five or six year ago apprentice in my patch be talk about work in this area some have go to work for airbus which be do fantastic thing with satellite recently go to its stevenage factory as part of my industry and parliament trust fellowship which be in space and aerospace one thing it purport to be do be transfer energy from space which will genuinely be game changer be flabbergast when that be explain to to monitor climate change satellite will tell we how much heat be transfer out of wood in forest so we know whether rainforest need to be reforest and whether we be face climate change at or that be mind bendingly brilliant stuff and it be now available to kid who five or six year ago might have be tell right once you finish school you either go work in the jjb sports factory down the road or in shop it be exciting fantastically valuable and hugely important for thing like our financial sector greater manchester have fairly sizable financial sector which be great for we we also have large legal sector know because use to work in it would love to be space lawyer let see how the rest of the year go might need to become one ultimately the bill be about empower we the other thing love about it again promise not to wave my llb about too much be its simplicity and elegance it be that coltrane sax solo so simple that it be brilliant change word effectively empower we to do so much more the power of that be inestimable that be why it be part of the report that the science innovation and technology committee put out at the moment we be disincentivise people from innovate and that be not what we should be about we be say instead that people should go out and take risk and we will ensure that they can be reward they will not be completely and utterly obliterate for have go even if the second stage fuel pump do not work it will not be the end of the business we need to be alive to that because we need risk taker as we do in every sector we need people who be willing to boldly go into the final frontier interruption have not finish yet when shout house everyone will know that have do they all fundamentally this be about ensure that britain future be not just here on earth but in the star and we have every right to be there as much as any other country thank my hon friend for allow to intervene especially give that have just ramble on for who know how long one thing do not mention that he might be interested in be the defence sector again when visit goonhilly there be huge amount go on there we talk about our maritime fleet be bother by the russians and the chinese on daily basis but our satellite and space be as well it be hugely important that we be at the forefront of this do he agree my hon friend be entirely correct like she have be on the armed force parliamentary scheme be restrain myself from mention culdrose when she be give her excellent speech but of course have now do it our defence sector be incredibly important again we be make this stuff here at bae systems and airbus and defence manufacturer in this country create job and opportunity that be hugely important and be absolutely delighted to support the bill love its technical merit my hon friend the member for woking have play an absolute blinder in do something quite sensible will give live example because quite frankly the empire would not have be able to build the second death star if it have be on the hook for the price of the first one my hon friend have stick the landing congratulate he and look forward to support the bill it be an honour to follow jean luc picard sorry mean the hon member for heywood and middleton chris clarkson that be pun central may have few of my own in this speech congratulate the hon member for woking mr lord on bring the bill this far it have be bring before we for second reading the aim of the bill be to help support our space sector as he eloquently say be bear in as it happen the same year we take one small step for man one giant leap for mankind as the hon member for wyre forest mark garnier say it feel with recent technological advance that we could be on the threshold of another such leap we wake up to the news today that odysseus have land on the lunar plain on the face of the moon the first private mission by the americans since we have always as species look to the star and hop one day to dwell among they and feel the enthusiasm in the house for that mission today the hon member also mention the artemis mission which will be the first staff space mission that will orbit the moon hopefully next year artemis be the goddess of the wilderness so the mission have be aptly name as we begin our new era of exploration of the star the bill amend the space industry act which be write with the purpose of regulate space activity sub orbital activity and associate activity carry out in the united kingdom the space industry and its trade body ukspace welcome the bill as we do the space industry act enable spaceflight activity from the uk such as operate satellite in orbit and enable launch to orbit from uk spaceport for the first time company that conduct spaceflight activity from the uk must hold insurance and indemnify the government against possible third party claim for damage currently the space industry act say that there be no limit to the amount of compensation that must be pay if anything go wrong with uk own satellite in space industry believe that address this will prevent satellite operator from register satellite in other country to get well liability deal space be become more congested it be right that we amend legislation as the industry develop we be now at key point in develop thriving and dynamic space industry an industry that we now know be worth billion to the uk employ up to people be speak recently to airbus which the hon member for heywood and middleton also mention as be sure member be aware airbus be the second big global space company and the large in the uk its representative tell that they operate over seven key site in the uk principally stevenage and portsmouth from stevenage to saturn have quite ring to it pardon the pun be just follow the pun of the hon member for heywood and middleton as he say why should this industry not feature in every sector and in every constituency we be develop the new atom valley in greater manchester to the north of the conurbation the supply chain be vast there be almost space supplier half of which be small and medium sized enterprise and it be vital that we support the industry here in the uk happen to know that in in my constituency million be spend with space supplier it be good to see procurement in the sector that benefit the bottom of the most deprived area of the land there be so many good reason to support the sector we want to remove barrier to new business set up here in the uk we want company to be incentivise to set up in the uk rather than take their business elsewhere whereupon they be likely to use supplier geographically local to themselves we do not want to lose out on these job we want these job of the future to be here in the uk interestingly one of the other main site that be strong in the space sector be newport as we hear from the hon member for truro and falmouth cherilyn mackrory job have be at risk in that area because of the tata steel plant unite the union and my own union community tell that well pay highly skilled unionised steel job be at risk in the area so we must ensure that these area be not de industrialised so that there be opportunity available for our worker and for our young people we also want our own sme to be part of the supply chain encourage business be what we should be all about the bill address what happen if anything be to go wrong from launch failure to satellite crash however this be not just about uk launch but uk ownership as the government have the final liability on any space item that be own by the uk government congratulate the hon member for woke on bring his bill to the house today thank the hon member for wyre forest for his work with the all party parliamentary group for space he quote the the wealth of nations which be much favour by conservative members remind he of smith treatise the invisible hand in which he say that economic activity should enrich the whole community we know that space can do that congratulate the hon member for truro and falmouth be intrigue by what she say our nation contain number of leave behind area include be not try to make party political point some of our coastal area market town and suburb through an agglomeration of the maritime aviation and space sector we can really begin to think about how we can regenerate those area by give people opportunity just as when be young councillor in manchester in the we create legal sector banking sector and media sector people will not have to leave their community when they turn or turn and get their degree because those technological job of the future will be in the area in which they grow up and that think be one of the great hope that we politician can give our young people this be what the space sector provide through the supply chain across the country but particularly in the south west and the shetland islands diverse geographical spread to the hon member for heywood and middleton say thank for all the pun and wish he good luck with his career as space lawyer after well whatever happen at the general election wish he well industrialist tell we that the bill will give they confidence and will encourage investment in the uk provide highly pay highly skilled and yes unionised job throughout the nation and on that basis we support it may say how privileged be to be chair this debate once host the astronaut nicole stott and the crew of discovery in the public gallery and then take they over to no downing street be also honour and privileged to have meet eugene cernan the last man to walk on the moon on two occasion once here and once at cape canaveral and have see few launch so space be very important to this be probably the most enjoyable debate have ever take part in particularly after wednesday night activity it be nice to have debate of cross party nature in term of its support and enthusiasm resign he have go and spoilt it all mr deputy speaker few month ago go to see the show the moon walkers with narration by tom hanks about the man and they be all man who have walk on the moon it be remarkable exhibition and highly recommend it to everyone particularly you mr deputy speaker if you be interested in space it be about an age of adventure an extraordinary era year ago when people be walk on another celestial body we think it be the dawn of whole new era and that mankind and womankind would carry on and explore the rest of the universe but that do not happen and no one have be back to the moon since yesterday however the united states return there for the first time for year as the shadow minister say although it be not person but the odysseus robot that land near the moon south pole the real significance of this event however be not the year gap but the fact that intuitive machines houston base company send that robot to the moon the space age have enter completely new era which be not about state and government of big country try to prove how powerful and effective they be for the purpose of national pride but about real commercial opportunity many of my hon friend have mention all the commercial opportunity that be out there people be do this not for reason of national pride but because it be so useful to humankind and so important for communication sense geographical information and all the other element that have be mention this be now properly base commercial opportunity for the uk and that be why want to thank my hon friend the member for woking mr lord for bring this short but impactful and timely bill to the house also greatly enjoy the contribution from all the other member who have speak be pleased to confirm that the bill have the government full support let briefly explain why as my hon friend and other have say the uk have thrive space sector in fact learn this morning that cornwall have space company we have far more thriving space sector than most people realise do you know mr deputy speaker that the satellite capital of europe be glasgow and that more small satellite be build there than anywhere outside california the uk be now the second most attractive destination for commercial space investment after the united states we get more space investment in the uk than any other country in the world apart from the united states give your interest in space mr deputy speaker do you realise that no rocket have ever be launch into orbit from european soil we have european space agency which have launch rocket into space but it do so largely from french guyana in south america rockets have be launch into space from kazakhstan but never from european soil we now have spaceport in the shetlands prepare to do just that saxavord which many hon member have mention we might end up with one from cornwall as well but shetlands might be the first that will be truly historic moment let clarify that rocket be launch into space from europe but they be suborbital from norway and sweden they go around the earth once or maybe twice and then come back down to earth never have rocket be launch into sustained orbit from european soil the uk plan to be the first european nation to do that which mark huge opportunity we set up the regulatory and licensing regime to license the spaceport because not just in the uk but in other european country company be make satellite and rocket that they want to launch into space it will be far easy and cheap for they to do it from european soil than have to transport the rocket to america french guyana or kazakhstan on more of technical point if the minister do not mind know that we have do an awful lot in very short space of time to get our regulatory system up to scratch how do we compare with the other european nation or europe as whole this have be brexit opportunity dare say leave the eu enable we to set up whole new regulatory regime in great detail other european country have regime for space activity but none with the same detail or launch opportunity as the uk in the uk we be bless with our geography for various reason to launch rocket in space it need to be launch from somewhere where there be not lot of people and with trajectory so that if the rocket have splashdown it will not land on any other people cornwall be obviously very interesting as be the north of shetland if rocket be launch into orbit from there it go north and through the bering strait the first land it would hit would be new zealand but hopefully it will be up in orbit by that time not many other european country have such geographical opportunity it would be very difficult for switzerland or germany to do that we be bless with our geography another difference and why there be an opportunity for the uk be that if we go back couple of decade the main focus be on big rocket launch satellite into geostationary orbit which be mile out where they stay above the same point of land as the earth rotate very big rocket be need to get satellite up there and into place it be far easy to do that if the rocket be launch close to and in the direction of the equator the european space agency launch site be in french guyana because it be close to the equator we now do not send geostationary satellite that far out into space all the interest be in low earth orbit satellite all the satellite launch by spacex for its internet service be low orbit satellite it be easy to do that over the north pole the change technical nature of the use of space and satellite represent huge opportunity for the uk the satellite themselves be get lot small go back or year the satellite be the size of bus whereas now they can be the size of fridge or microwave they require much small rocket to launch they into space hope you enjoy all that explanation mr deputy speaker as we have hear from various hon member and the shadow minister the hon member for wythenshawe and sale east mike kane the uk space industry support an industrial base of over space company and provide highly skilled high quality job across the uk with over of employee hold at least primary degree we hear about job in cornwall and manchester this be true levelling up also mention space job in glasgow and at saxavord in the shetlands in orbex another scottish company open new facility in forres incorporate design and manufacturing facility for its prime launch vehicle the prime project have create more than highly skilled job in the local area so far with many more anticipated as the company continue to grow highlands and islands enterprise anticipate that the sutherland spaceport will support around full time equivalent post throughout the wide highlands and islands include an estimate full time equivalent post on the site saxavord anticipate that by the end of this year its spaceport site could support job in scotland include locally and across the wide shetland region as we hear spaceport cornwall anticipate that its project will deliver direct job and indirect job by be little bit anxious that the minister will forget airbus which be in newport west be sure that he be go to mention it as the shadow minister say it be really important for cyber security and tech job in south wales it be vital part of our network and want to remind he about it the challenge be that there be so many business and company involve in aerospace in the uk and in the space industry generally that can not list they all the shadow minister mention airbus clearly airbus and british aerospace be the two really big aerospace company but the industry be not just about those two giant there be many thousand of small and medium sized company and there be whole supply chain create job value and economic opportunity for the uk which the legislation be design to help enable build on the success of the uk space sector the government have set out bold spaceflight ambition the text be give by official be definitely bold in our national space strategy the uk be boldly go where no country have go before hon member hooray the pun be not stop that include make the uk the lead provider of commercial small satellite launch in europe by as say the small satellite present the opportunity not the big one to achieve our ambition the government have invest over million so far through the launch uk programme to grow new uk market for small satellite launch and suborbital spaceflight before come to the regulatory aspect of the bill let say that many hon friend have talk about the commercial opportunity will not talk only about that but the choice to land the odysseus robot on the moon yesterday be interesting why go to the moon be try to paint big picture rather than concentrate on the immediate commercial opportunity because lot of people see opportunity for further space development elon musk who have few achievement under his belt have say that he want to die on mars do not know how realistic that is but he have launch tesla or one of his car into orbit there be plan to send human back to the moon next year and plan to send human to mars human have look to the sky since time immemorial and dream about what be up there human instinct be to go and explore which be why we go around the earth in polynesian culture people go from one island to another they set forth in their boat without necessarily realise what they would find when they arrive the human instinct be to explore the universe we do not know what we will find there or what the opportunity will be although do not think we will find the clangers or the soup dragon on some other planet never think would intervene on the word clangers but there we be chair the all party parliamentary group for critical mineral obviously critical mineral be another huge industry in cornwall as we know globally we still do not have enough supply for the future certainly not from friendly nation that we can trust do my hon friend agree that in future generation space could be another source of critical mineral that we need for our supply chain absolutely thank my hon friend for that point which be very well make the odysseus robot go to the south pole of the moon because that be where the supply of water be water be obviously not critical mineral but it be source material for energy and oxygen we can get hydrogen out of it but the reason why commercial company and indeed government be interested in the moon and mars be exactly that critical mineral we have limited supply of those mineral on earth but we may be able to find they in other place while we be wait to get to infinity and beyond it be important to highlight other very innovative british company that be look at do extraordinary thing in the area of critical mineral they be seek to take the lunar regolith moondust which be metal oxide and use robot to create printing powder which could be use to print moon base through additive printing the by product of the powder be oxygen keep in mind that it cost million per kilogram to get payload to the surface of the moon and that we need not just breathe oxygen but energy and oxidant for propulsion it be extraordinary what british company be do to make it possible to not only get to the moon and occupy it but use it as launchpad to get to further place such as mars speak of elon musk ambition the americans need we think we should remember that my hon friend have expound very important point we be critical to the space industry and to space exploration more generally come back to the issue of regulation come down to earth from our big vision the clangers and so on the government have be fund the industry we put in place the space industry act which my hon friend the member for woking talk about and appoint the civil aviation authority as spaceflight regulator that be why be answer this debate as transport minister rather than someone from the department for science innovation and technology get into space and orbit be dft responsibility the civil aviation regulator which have license saxavord for example enable the licensing of spaceflight activity from the uk such as operate satellite in orbit and enable launch to orbit from uk spaceport for the first time the government recognise that the issue of liability and insurance be of the utmost concern to the space sector and they be obviously the entire point of the bill the industry make clear in its response to the consultation on the then draft space industry regulation in and in response to the government call for evidence to inform orbital liability and insurance policy in october that hold unlimited liability will have an adverse effect on the uk space flight industry people sometimes object to private member bills because they be not base on consultation but this issue have be endlessly consult on and negotiate with industry and the industry be call for this bill the industry have advise that it be impossible not just difficult to obtain insurance for an unlimited amount member might ask why be that if the chance of something happen be infinitesimally small the reason be that it be impossible for the actuary to quantify it with infinity over infinity one could come up with any value also insurer be require by regulation to show that they have the capital to meet any claim on they clearly insurer can not have unlimited capital so it be regulatorily and legally impossible for insurance company to insure to an unlimited amount it be very difficult for the industry to say to investor please give money to fund the launch of rocket even though may not be able to insure it we need liability limitation so that launch company and other space operator can get insurance and so can get the investment that they need if spaceflight company can not get unlimited insurance it obviously can not get full insurance as number of hon member have say if the government do not limit spaceflight operator liability spaceflight company and investor would instead look to more favourable regulatory regime in other country where government share the risk involve by limit an operator liability and offer state guarantee the united states already do this as do france with french guiana as my hon friend the member for woking have explain there be power in the space industry act that we can and do use to limit spaceflight operator liability when carry out spaceflight activity from the uk government policy be that the regulator should use those power and specify limit on operator liability in the licence so that no operator face unlimited liability however the law set out that the government may do that rather than must the government fully support the bill for two key reason it be consistent with our policy that all spaceflight operator licence should have limit on liability it will not therefore impose any additional liability or risk on uk taxpayer my hon friend make that point the government also recognise the value that the industry place on legislative certainty on this matter as point out if investor be to make an investment in space company they need to know that the company will be able to get insurance the report by the taskforce on innovation growth and regulatory reform the tigrr report for short publish in may express concern from the space sector over the use of the word may in section of the space industry act the bill would replace that may with must thank all hon member for their contribution my hon friend the member for wyre forest mark garnier explain his great interest in space and mention financial service which want to come on to the point be well make that before the uk be spacefaring nation we be seafaring nation london be the big port in the world for more than year which lead to whole maritime industry with insurance around it include lloyd of london and lawyer we have huge maritime industry in london as result of have maritime fleet and we now have the same opportunity with space we can have space investor have meet some of they as well as space lawyer space insurance company regulatory expert and so on it be huge opportunity the government and the regulator need to ensure that the industry have the right incentive the minister mention port obviously quite few of our maritime asset be consider critical national infrastructure have any discussion be have on whether our space asset will also fall into that category that apply particularly if we be to launch printer so that we can build on the moon which be apparently the only place where the liberal democrats will not try to block house building my hon friend ask an interesting question will raise it with official and come back to he with an answer my hon friend the member for truro and falmouth cherilyn mackrory give the most fantastic and enthusiastic speech about the space opportunity for cornwall bet most people in britain do not realise quite how important space be for cornwall there be different company have no idea that cornwall have its own space lawyer so that be great insight we also hear about the use of satellite for the maritime sector and various other issue to do with cornwall want to make sure that my hon friend know that as the government minister responsible fully agree that the cornish launch which be before my time as minister be absolutely success from regulatory and investor point of view agree that the whole regime work my hon friend the member for wyre forest make the point that we in this country tend to overemphasise the negative and we always look at the bad thing that happen think be right in say that the first three launch from spacex do not get into space but be actually see as success because they contribute to the whole launch operation lot of thing be learn from those launch and the same be true of the cornish launch do not think say early that the cornish launch do actually make it to space it be during the secondary bit that the fuel problem happen and it go wrong however we do launch successfully from british soil and do make it to space would not want to malign the cornish space launch in that way so fully accept my hon friend point it be great to hear that cornish child be so inspire by space now as we have hear there be huge commercial and job opportunity and be sure there will be many great career that will come from child have an interest in space thank my hon friend the member for heywood and middleton chris clarkson for his general huge enthusiasm and countless pun which have liven up this day we could all do with bit of levity thank the shadow minister for his great speech and for some of his pun as well as his call for to be grateful for the opposition support for the bill be grateful to my hon friend the member for woke for his bill which would amend section of the space industry act and meet key request from the sector as well as address recommendation make by the taskforce on innovation growth and regulatory reform indeed by turn that one word may into must the bill will enable britain space industry to reach the final frontier and beyond thank honourable member on both side of the house for attend the debate and for their support in particular thank my hon friend the member for wyre forest mark garnier who so ably and knowledgeably chair the all party parliamentary group for space in his wise and interesting speech he touch on many thing but in particular how important the grow space industry be and can be to our financial and insurance sector think that be very interesting point to bring out my hon friend the member for truro and falmouth cherilyn mackrory make passionate and eloquent speech particularly pertain to how the space industry be already change cornwall for the well add to the cornish economy and with huge amount of scope for future growth and engagement be particularly take by her point about how schoolchildren and student be be enthuse by the space industry thank she for her support my hon friend the member for heywood and middleton chris clarkson in very witty and engaging speech alight on number of interesting and important point but particularly how our legal service industry the legal sector can and will benefit from grow space industry be also extremely grateful to the shadow minister and the minister for their support for the bill as we would expect they be master of their brief and speak with great insight but also enthusiasm about this grow industry and the help that the bill will give it for that dynamic innovative and grow future for our space industry urge the house to support the bill question put and agree to bill accordingly read second time to stand committed to public bill committee standing order no do not know if that make you space lord now mr lord but congratulation unauthorised entry to football matches bill second read beg to move that the bill be now read second time yes it again early be play up front but be back at the back for this debate and hope to be back on the front bench later if my bill make the progress that hope it will after second reading on sunday july the final of the man euros football tournament at wembley could have result in not just the sad loss for the english football team but in tragic loss of life that be the finding of the independent review that be conduct by baroness louise casey into the event of that day suggest that we narrowly escape disaster that could have result in fatality or irreversible injury for everyone here the mere think that such catastrophe be still possible in this country at football match in the century after the tragedy of the latter part of the last century be profoundly unsettling some member of this house be present at the euro final which take place in and witness at first hand the reckless behaviour of some people seek to enter the stadium without ticket admit that be genuinely shocked to discover when the house of commons culture media and sport committee of which be member at the time undertake an inquiry follow the euros that enter or attempt to enter football match without ticket be not specific criminal offence that be why that committee acknowledge the need for my bill in recommendation in its safety at major sporting event report publish in december that demonstrate the broad cross party recognition of this problem and the consensus on the need for legislative action to put it right if hon member take glance at the bill they will see that all the member of that select committee with seat within its territorial scope wales and england be name co sponsor so it have the full support of that committee my bill would bring into law recommendation that come out of the select committee finding and the baroness casey review by amend the football offences act to introduce new offence of unauthorised or attempt unauthorised entry to football match it be estimate that at the euro final somewhere between and ticketless individual be able to gain entry many people will have see the disorder the overcrowding and the safety hazard that result from those event those action not only compromise the safety and security of steward police officer spectator player and official but greatly tarnish the reputation of the sport and this country the thing that really surprise be that wembley be not just your average stadium it be purpose build stadium that we would expect to have the good security yet that number of people be able to get through as my hon friend say that could potentially have cause the loss of life my right hon friend be absolutely right we be all shock that those event be able to take place at relatively new flagship national stadium so we must think about how stadium be design wembley have particular feature the long wembley way which go back to when the stadium be originally open in traditionally lot of fan approach in that direction in very large number one thing that my bill do that might address my right hon friend concern be to make it possible for the offence to be enforce not just at the turnstile but around the premise on private land so an outer security cordon can enforce the offence that the bill create that should help in place like wembley as he say it be shocking to see the number of people who be able to get past the steward and rush entry into the ground support the hon gentleman bill and think he be right to introduce it so say this in the spirit of scrutinise legislation he be use what happen at the euros as justifiable reason for his bill go along with that but by increase its scope to include area that the explanatory note seem to suggest include bar and car park it seem that he be make someone try to blag their way into car park the same offence as try to tailgate their way into the semi final of the euros do he really think that those two thing should be treat in the same way welcome the hon gentleman intervention he be always assiduous in his scrutiny of legislation and rightly so in isolation it will not be an offence to try to get into car park but the bill reflect the reality of the area around football ground cardiff city stadium which be locate in my constituency be build few year ago to replace the old ninian park stadium across the road like lot of new stadium it be in slightly more out of town location surround by car park that specifically serve those attend match in some instance to enforce the intention of this new offence it might be necessary to set up an outer cordon immediately outside the premise of the stadium itself which be the purpose of the provision there may be other hospitality setting close to the stadium but outside the turnstile in that instance if another security cordon need to be set up my bill could be enforce to prevent people who come along not with ticket and with the intention of attend the match but simply to try to jib their way into the ground from do so such action compromise the safety of individual and potentially tarnish the country reputation the euros be return in and we can not afford replay of those event the current legal framework do not address the problem those catch enter stadium without authorisation face no legal repercussion those attempt to enter be simply move on and often try to gain entry multiple time there be no consequence for their selfish action which risk jeopardise match and could recklessly endanger the safety and life of other the bill be intend to respond directly to those challenge by make unauthorised entry into football match specific offence the aim be to deter people from attempt to enter stadium without valid ticket before the debate do an interview with among other martin keown the former arsenal footballer on talksport there be feeling in our discussion that the deterrent effect be significant part of this measure fine of up to might be deterrent but under the bill conviction for this offence could lead to court impose football ban order under the football spectators act and the football offences act which would prevent person from attend football match for specify period of between three and year that would be an even great deterrent this bill seek to address all form of unauthorised entry recognise the broad spectrum of tactic employ to gain illicit access to stadium that raise the question of why the bill be design only to apply to football the same thing could apply to rugby world cup final at twickenham the olympics we might have they again in the future or any other big sporting event be this problem unique to football be there any reason why the bill should not apply to any major sporting event that might have the same problem the hon gentleman make valid point have speak to the football supporters association about this bill and it be concerned about any legislation that single out football in this way the reality be that the current legislative framework include significant suite of legislation that apply particularly to football bear of the event of the latter part of the last century we have move on hugely and think we all think that we have move on permanently from the sort of scene that be witness at the euros final because there have be problem at other type of event in recent year accept that there be case for take wide look at the issue of gain illicit entry to venue whether for music concert festival or another type of sporting event the government and his majesty opposition if they be to become the next government shortly should look far into the good way to achieve that outcome in the relatively narrow confine of my private member bill when there be the opportunity to amend legislation already on the statute book and when significant football event be imminent think it be justify to bring forward measure that apply specifically to football but the hon gentleman broad point be absolutely valid the scope of the bill extend across the top tier of domestic football we be not talk about the local park match the bill include the premier league the championship league one and two the national league the woman super league and championship and the cymru premier competition as well as international match in england and wales my hon friend be make an excellent speech and be glad he have clarify that the top tier will be include although we hear about the super league and all the rest of it team like my own beloved newport county be important too although they might not be in the very top tier they be obviously as good as those club but they be in slightly low tier it be important that we have clarification that they will be include because it be important to they my hon friend be absolutely right someone chuckle when she say newport county be as good as the top tier but the fright they give manchester united in their recent fa cup tie confirm the veracity of her judgment remember as young man who grow up only mile up the road from the old somerton park they play at different ground now often sneak away without tell my mother on the bus to watch newport county play it be always at on saturday afternoon because of the proximity to the llanwern steelwork it allow the steelworker finish their shift to attend the match when the result be read out those of we who be old enough might remember that newport county home game be always late kick off rather than be announce at in the usual way my hon friend be absolutely right the bill will apply to newport county and right down as far as the national league in the man game in england and the other league mention in fact cardiff city stadium which as have say be in my constituency host the home game not just of cardiff city but the welsh national team and it would be remiss of not to mention the impeccable behaviour of welsh fan attend match there and the crack atmosphere they create with their passionate rendition of song such as hen wlad fy nhadau and yma hyd the vast majority of football fan across the country support club such as my team cardiff city or any other do so in the right spirit it be important that they feel safe and secure when support their football team make it clear that the intention of the bill be to support real football fan and to keep they safe and secure while they be enjoy the spectacle of support their team football be big part of our culture as member know represent welsh constituency and be bear and bring up in wales we be often associate with rugby and hope after today debate to hop over to dublin for the wales ireland rugby match in the six nations at the weekend however in recent year football have grow ever more important in the national culture of wales and it have always be of huge importance across the rest of the uk bring together individual from all walk of life in share support of their team the action of few should not be allow to compromise the safety and security of the majority in draft the bill thank civil servant for their help in that have be mindful of the balance between enhance security and maintain the open and inclusive nature of football match the intention be not to criminalise fan or create barrier to genuine supporter enjoy the game instead the focus be on prevent those who would seek to cause disorder and harm from enter stadium thus ensure safe environment for all by strengthen the legal framework we can deter unauthorised entry reduce the risk of disorder and violence and ensure that football continue to be source of joy and community for everyone urge the house to give the bill second reading rise before finish my remark give way to the hon gentleman who have just successfully get his bill through second reading and will be sure want to reciprocate for this one be highly supportive of the bill and congratulate the hon gentleman on introduce it back in have another successful private member bill which be now the sports grounds safety authority act his bill be another in that fine tradition of improve safety at our sport ground for fan and people in the area if hear he correctly the territorial extent do not include scotland and northern ireland if his bill succeed will he and the minister share their learning with colleague in scotland and northern ireland we be all delighted that we have northern ireland assembly again so that if they host future euro and world cup event they have this sort of excellent measure in place as england and wales will congratulate the hon gentleman on get his bill through its second reading his second such bill which be quite an achievement and hope that he get it through its remain stage before the general election do not usually approve of lords but he be an elect lord so approve of his bill go through he be absolutely right that my bill apply to england and wales because that be the scope of the legislation that be seek to amend scotland and northern ireland have their own law on safety at football match and so on but certainly encourage they to take look at my measure be big believer in devolution so would not tell they what to do but they might find some useful idea in it he be right to point that out to the house we can from all side of the house come together to send strong message that such behaviour will not be tolerate and that the safety and security of people attend and work at football match be of absolute importance the bill reflect our collective responsibility to address the challenge face the sport and to ensure that football remain positive and uniting force in our society thank the english football association and the football association of wales the culture media and sport committee civil servant clerks and so on for their support in draft the bill also thank mary in the members tea room with whom discuss my bill this morning she give it her full support show that it pass the common sense test commend it to the house it be pleasure to follow the hon member for cardiff west kevin brennan be delighted that he manage to get common sense in before the end of his speech because my wife would not have forgive if have not mention common sense in my speech and he give perfect opportunity to do so for which thank he rise to support the hon gentleman bill which be important and worthwhile and to wish it safe passage through both houses of parliament however as you know mr deputy speaker take my role on fridays very seriously the danger with private member bills be that they start with worthy sentiment but end up go through both houses with very little scrutiny because everybody agree with that sentiment so we end up with bad legislation and unintended consequence raise couple of point with the hon gentleman early and want to test they and maybe another point or two bit far it will be interesting to get the minister view when he respond and the hon gentleman view when he wind up the debate on whether or not it may well be that the answer be amendment may be consider in committee or on report to improve the bill or take out something that be not intend do not intend to speak for long which will be huge relief to everybody particularly on friday make my remark genuinely and in the spirit of try to be constructive and raise potential issue it be important that they be consider even if they be then dismiss the hon gentleman set out in his opening remark why the bill be important it be about what happen at the euros final where it be estimate that to people without ticket gain entry they do not just try to gain entry they actually do it through mass forced entry at turnstile do not think that they necessarily gain entry by tailgating it be through the deliberate ploy of force their way into the stadium of course the hon gentleman be absolutely right about the problem that such behaviour cause it be unfair because people might end up sit in seat that other have legitimately pay for and ticket holder can not get to their seat that be bad enough but there be also massive issue with safety and security tragically we have see in the past what can happen at football stadium when thing be not as they should be on that basis he be absolutely right to introduce the bill and would not want to gainsay any of what he say although accept that my concern be minor they be genuine would not want to see rule that be design to tackle very bad behaviour be apply excessively to people who do not think the bill be necessarily aim at talk about people blagge their way into car park and be slightly concerned about the way the bill be write do not know what you think mr deputy speaker but have always consider the hon gentleman to be bit of cheeky chappie he look like the type of person who before his political career not today as he be serious politician may well have try to blag his way in somewhere he just have that look about he the hon gentleman be very astute individual first attend twickenham in when be very young indeed to go and watch gareth edwards win his cap for the welsh rugby team and three of my friend get into the ground by virtue of note for which we be give change even though we do not have ticket be very young but should confess that as he have raise it be sure we be all very grateful for that intervention it be amazing what you find out on friday be it mr deputy speaker it be like confessional perhaps other member will want to give way so that they can declare their interest as well we have probably accidentally find out why the bill apply only to football and not to any other sport my point be that there be world of difference between group of people who have deliberate strategy of engage in public disorder to force their way into an event through sheer weight of number cause all sort of potentially serious repercussion and people who be desperate to get into an event who do not have ticket and who cheekily try to blag their way in through one mean or another think most people would accept that there be world of difference between the two what would not want to see be the full weight of the law clamp down on the second group in the same way as it would on the first my slight fear be that that that could happen give the way the bill be write young person who try to cheekily blag their way into an event could find themselves face the same repercussion as other do not think that anybody would want that to happen be not sure whether there be legal way to differentiate between those two thing it may well be that we say it be for court to make that adjudication but would not want somebody who try to cheekily blag their way into an event to find themselves treat as severely as criminal make forced entry with public disorder design it would be nice if we could at least think about how we could do that the explanatory note make clear that the penalty be fine not exceed we could argue with justification that the fine should be vary accord to the situation so that minor offence would be reflect in the fine however the explanatory note go on to state court must not may but must also issue football ban order follow conviction for the offence they go on to state unless it consider that there be particular circumstance that would make it unjust accept that but in effect they be say that ordinarily whatever the scale of the offence that be what the court should do it do not even say that it should do that but that it must do so the hon gentleman be absolutely right that that be the way the legislation currently operate but there be discretion available to the court not to issue ban order in exactly the sort of circumstance he describe where somebody be not intent on cause serious disorder but what might be refer to colloquially as cheeky bit of attempt jibbing would envisage that in those circumstance someone might at first get turn away but that if they be persistent they could be subject to the offence in the bill be very grateful for that clarification which be genuinely useful the other point want to spend very few minute on which raise in my intervention on the hon gentleman be about other event if such unauthorised entry be an issue it should not apply just to football match would be very interested to hear what the minister and the shadow minister have to say about that this country be renowned for host world lead sport event across the piece the rugby world cup the rugby league world cup the olympics athletic and so on most of those event have ticket that be very much seek after and oversubscribed we be sport love nation the bill have be bring forward largely as result as the hon gentleman say of what happen at the euros the uefa european football championship often in this place we pass legislation as result of something happen something go wrong and we think something must be do so we pass legislation reactively to deal with an issue that have already happen to the good of my knowledge what the bill address have not happen it may well have happen but be not aware of it other people with more expertise will know at the rugby world cup final or the rugby league world cup final so nobody have bring forward any legislation on that it might seem unusual be unusual before you get in there first mr deputy speaker but rather than just always pass legislation reactively perhaps we might sometimes have crack at pass legislation proactively and try to anticipate thing that might happen and nip they in the bud beforehand the hon gentleman have bring forward the basis of bill which we could use to do something bit more proactive be there any reason why the provision in the bill could not apply to range of other major event in particular major sporting event so that we do not have to wait for such thing to happen before we do something about it we could actually get in there first and try to stop they from happen in the first place or at least make sure we have appropriate penalty the hon gentleman be renowned for his huge support for the music industry and commend he for everything he do for that industry he be one of its great champion in the house be not an expert in the way that he be may be enthusiastic but do not possess the same expertise however as layman should have think that this would be more of an issue at music event than at sporting event could be completely wrong about that but suspect be right will certainly bow to the hon gentleman great expertise if be wrong there may well be exist legislation to deal with these matter at music event admit my ignorance in that regard but it seem to that legislation of this kind must be just as important for big music event such as concert which by the way be often hold in stadium and other location that be also use for sporting event such as wembley so why be we restrict ourselves to football genuinely do not understand why this be see as just football issue although suspect that it be because of the reaction to what happen at the euros surely we in this place must be able to use our wit to say it have be problem in this location while also anticipate that it could well be problem at similar event whether sporting or musical may just ask the hon gentleman and the minister who know will continue to take great interest in all these issue anyway and also the shadow minister to give this some thought if we be so adamant that the bill be necessary in this regard and think it be as have say support it with couple of reservation urge all those with far more influence than to think about whether we could introduce similar legislation if necessary to cover other big sporting event and perhaps music event as well thank the hon member for cardiff west kevin brennan for introduce the bill he have do great job in set out the reason for it and be happy to say that support it my hon friend the member for shipley philip davies ask couple of question and want to ask couple in similar vein but let first explain why think the bill be important people who aggressively try to enter event without ticket be not just put their fellow attender at risk but potentially put the steward at risk at the euros as we see extra security staff be draft in they be often people who have have only basic level of training from their company and when face with ten if not hundred of people individual who be try to do the right thing and protect the establishment be put at risk during those event apart from the potential risk to attender pose by overcrowding let we never forget the tragedy that be hillsborough although as we now know it be not connect with the issue of non ticket fan large group of people in small space be frightening prospect and can lead to tragic loss of life want everyone to understand that we need to look out for those who be seek to uphold the rule as well as those who have pay for their ticket there be however couple of exception that hope can be explore in committee do not think that either the hon member for newport west ruth jones or the hon member for nottingham north alex norris subscribe to the manchester united fan club as do suspect that the hon member for nottingham north may even be manchester city fan which probably explain his positive reaction to the totally under control newport game that take place early in the season arguably be united fan in recent year have be triumph of loyalty over pleasure or enjoyment just as an aside let say that not so long ago my father and take my nephew to watch united at old trafford and we discover that he be the fifth generation of fletcher to do so can be accuse of be very many thing but glory supporter be not one of they united be experiment with change ticket from paper or plastic card to qr code although this be happen only in the premier league it be likely to roll down to the low league quite famously there be problem with that ticketing system member can look back at the press report will make confession to the house in the spirit of the admission make by the hon member for cardiff west be in possession of valid ticket for that game but the failure of the system lead to huge number of fan be lock out there be big press of people so along with hundred of other hop over the turnstile do so partly in fear of the crush of people behind they could not hear what be go on and do not understand why people be not flow through the turnstile as normal perhaps the minister could comment on that incident seek assurance that we will not criminalise people such as myself who although in possession of valid ticket do not make the most legitimate entry to the ground but do so through genuine reason of fear for personal safety and desire to watch united lose again would be grateful if the minister could respond to that and provide some assurance that that consideration will be take on board should the bill reach committee stage as hope it do finally be member of the stretford end hear chat and noise in particular have hear how people have be accidentally catch up in football ban order let just say this for the record it be absolutely abhorrent when people go to football game to cause trouble to have fight and to put people at risk football have transform over my lifetime in the past child could not be take to football because it be not safe for they but that be no long the case it be now family friendly activity that people can enjoy it have some edge to it but do not want to see that go football be almost the acceptable face of the iron age tribal system writ large think it be arrigo sacchi who say it be the most important of the not important thing there have be instance of people who be just bystander to trouble be sanction by club or give football ban order if we be seek to extend those order from people commit violence to people try to get into ground without ticket which agree be important be we confident that those who both evaluate and issue those football ban order uphold the level and standard of evidence that we would expect to see as part of law who have the final say what be the mechanism of appeal we need some clarity on that understand the point that the hon member for cardiff be make about include car park especially at out of town stadium but what threshold of evidence would be use be somebody hop into car park to get an autograph the same as somebody aggressively try to knock down turnstile how do we make sure that we find the right level of justice my hon friend be make very serious and very good point on more humorous level could it not be argue that give the way that manchester united have be play in the past few year ban order would be reward rather than punishment when my hon friend next come over to watch manchester united at old trafford we should make sure to check his passport as he come over the top manchester united be one of the great and most important club it be important to remember the busby babes and this year important anniversary of the munich air disaster however concede that future peak be to be scale by our magnificent team and will support they all the way let give an honourable mention to sir jim ratcliffe who this week get final confirmation of his purchase and support of the club on serious note how be leeds do these day bradford city man never mind good leave there have always enjoy the colour of the kit mustard be such an aggressive colour to go to battle in semi seriously my hon friend make very good point football be about fun banter and local pride people seek to aggressively get into ground without ticket put all that enjoyment at risk support this legislation but perhaps we could get some clarity to make sure that the enthusiastic kid as my hon friend say or perhaps the overenthusiastic tourist be not catch up by it crucially if someone be catch by this law and want to appeal can we make sure that they get the right level of justice go to see manchester united may not be the most edify experience at the moment but be accidentally ban for life would be travesty and we should make sure that do not happen call the shadow minister it be pleasure to speak for the opposition congratulate my hon friend the member for cardiff west kevin brennan on his bill which support he be skilled parliamentarian but he have demonstrate as the hon member for woking mr lord do who be no long in his place that the good skill be to be draw in the private member ballot it be also skill to choose bill that have chance of succeed keep it narrow short and cheap be generally good way to do that my hon friend bill have pass those test britain do sport event really well we have great infrastructure and stadium and volunteer flock to be part of those event who could forget that have see the olympic game whether it be the olympics the champion league final or game every weekend we do they very well we also do football well than any other place on the planet huge part of brand britain be the global tv product but the beauty be in the fact that every weekend this weekend will be no exception for the premier league alone half million people make journey short long and in some case very long across the country to see their team share allegiance perhaps swear at other fan and sing song with incredible creativity there be real beauty in that it be very british and very special those two thing together that success in hold major event and that love of football do well make what we see in at the final of euro even more shocking we do not want to see to people jib in as my hon friend say it be dangerous as we read in the independent report it be very lucky that great harm be not cause what my hon friend propose be good smart way of address that want to cover some of the point make by he and other hon member what my hon friend say on the radio early about the deterrent effect be exactly right and what he predict be likely to be the case it can not be overstate that the maximum fine of be lot of money by anyone standard the ban order in particular will get people attention because that be really serious sanction for fan support their club become big part of their identity for fan who go to match at home and away that be huge part of their lifestyle and involve their friendship group that get people attention so it be good sanction let address couple of point make by the hon member for shipley philip davies share lot of his view when it come to sport he know what he be talk about he be match go fan and he talk lot of sense on sport his point about scrutiny on fridays be important we owe it to our constituent to perform that scrutiny as well as we can whatever day of the week it be because the intention be for these bills to become the law of the land we always have to keep in mind the test hard case make bad law always think about that particularly on fridays but think the hon gentleman have pass the test today the hon gentleman make point about intend consequence propose new clause to the football offences act should give quite lot of comfort in that regard the explanatory note be very comprehensive about what the bill be not intend to do and certainly give comfort particularly about propose new subsection year old use an ticket be breach of term and condition and they probably should not do it but the law should not criminalise that individual the club can manage that with sanction which be likely to be short internal ban that be the right level so think that the right balance have be find might disagree with the hon gentleman on the cheekiness point though these be big stadium as the hon member for south ribble katherine fletcher say we be talk about large concentration of human being in one place the capacity at wembley be the hon member for shipley and may agree lot on sport but suspect we disagree quite lot on health and safety legislation on its effectiveness and necessity in this space health and safety be exceptionally important and for stadium to be even one person over capacity be dangerous agree with his sentiment that someone just try their luck should not have criminal record and face really significant sanction but we should not encourage such behaviour in general people need to know that it be dangerous and that they should not do such thing turn to the hon member for shipley point about breadth my view be that the approach take in the bill be good and right for football it follow that in those other example he mention it would be good and right too understand and agree with the approach that my hon friend the member for cardiff west have take keep the bill narrow and base it on legislation that be already on the statute book be the good way to ensure that the bill succeed go broad may imperil the bill as venture but it be incumbent on both the government and the opposition to look at what approach could be take to broaden it of course we will need to follow the evidence and consult relevant organisation but the basic principle apply people enter an event for which they have no ticket which be really dangerous health and safety breach be bad whether at the football or elsewhere as the hon member for shipley point out football fan often get rough ride they should not be unduly single out think everyone have say that but we should make that point the contribution of the hon member for south ribble again show the cultural hegemony of football and its importance in british life the first conversation that have with she near the doorway to the chamber be about football it be very pleasant way to be welcome into the behind the scene bipartisanship that be not always visible to the public think it be important to get that on the record even if the hon gentleman do support totally the wrong football team absolutely agree my friendship with the right hon member for staffordshire moorlands dame karen bradley come about because she go to city as do that be something we talk about and as do the hon member for crewe and nantwich dr mullan in fact can name every city fan in parliament with absolute certainty and reckon could do pretty well at name everybody team although not that of the right hon member for tonbridge and malling tom tugendhat will the hon gentleman give way be look forward to this be absolutely shocked that the hon gentleman be not an avid follower of the tonbridge angels there we go will resist the temptation to ask the right hon member who their leave back be because think that could expose he risk the wrath of my colleague on the science innovation and technology committee the hon member for blackley and broughton graham stringer if do not mention that he be united fan can name similar miscreant on our benches very well my hon friend the member for ellesmere port and neston justin madders be the first who spring to mind football be part of our cultural life it be part of the bond that bring we together that be why it be important that it be safeguard and do properly and safely think quite lot about the point that the hon member for south ribble make about security staff and will talk later about recent experience at football that have really concern those staff who be generally not permanent employee of the club they be probably third party contractor and not necessarily well pay be in dangerous circumstance frankly worry less about those near the pitch than those who have to steward near the toilet again will talk about that shortly the hon lady make important point about what the bill be and be not design to deter and she use her own example we can take comfort from the fact that she would have have defence under propose new section of the act as she have ticket as she say that be not desirable way for entry to happen but she would not have commit an offence under the bill which speak to the effectiveness of its drafting in closing it be important that we do not demonise football fan be no match go fan though be for bit think we be all legacy fan though do not take kindly to that term however my love of manchester city be huge part of my life and personality my wife might say it be much big part of it than it ought to be from the third tier to the champions league final have be there and see it all every so often on my social medium feed apologise in advance to the hon member for south ribble the gündoğan goal in last year fa cup final will pop up and can not go past it be incapable of do that will watch it at least half dozen time because it be just such great moment football fan be have tough time they be mess around with kick off time and be ask to take long journey city fan will be at bournemouth on saturday for game that will end at nearly at night and then have to get back to manchester that be very difficult there be also still some stigmatisation which be not good some of these challenge be present in other sport too so it be important that football fan be not single out think that we have find the right balance but there be an issue come down the line that either this government or future government will have to address some of the thing that be happen at football match what happen at that euros final do not happen in isolation social medium can skew our perception of these thing but we see video that show that behaviour be change as say this year have witness some thing in toilet both away at brentford and at home to chelsea that really shock illegal act generally centre around drug poor steward be leave to try to deal with that there be behaviour at football match that should not be condone people go to have fun and we know that they be go to shout swear and drink all that be fine but the law of the land must still apply whether in public or in the toilet of football stadium it behove we to look at some of that but what we do must be evidence base and we must work with the football supporters association which do such good work to ensure that intervention be proportionate the bill be absolutely proportionate intervention and give it my full support it be huge honour to be here under your chairship madam deputy speaker and huge pleasure to speak about bill on what must admit be not what would have immediately think be my specialist subject resign hang on that be bit harsh the bill raise very important security consideration so it have be an enormous pleasure to read about the bill and the impressive work do by the hon member for cardiff west kevin brennan the debate have show quite simply that the passion in the house for what have always be know as the beautiful game twin with the passion for it in our country though it do not always attract the affection of everybody in the chamber know that disappoint some in the tonbridge angels when say that though many other sport club be obviously spar the pain of my support it really do bring people together when travel or serve overseas be often touch by the fact that community of brits from any part of our country could immediately find an easy conversation and bond over various football team which some may support and other may vigorously and majestically oppose do not know why find myself look at my hon friend the member for south ribble katherine fletcher as manchester united fan but for some reason manchester united seem to come up quite lot as divisive subject like the minister have live and work around the world he make humorous point about the opportunity for bonding but would say that it happen not just with brits live and work in africa at that time the first word out the mouth of people there be bobby charlton and the second word be david beckham although jumper for goalpost be often use and can be trite phrase have have conversation with people whose language could speak not jot but we be unite by the language of football do the minister agree and be that perhaps something he have experience funnily enough agree that it be something have witness have always struggle to join the conversation recently find myself in new york at the funeral of henry kissinger and few people there be discuss his passion for arsenal football club and ask about the late season in london football have to confess that find myself slightly want for word but it be an environment in which many other be able to supply they so be delighted to stay silent as the prowess of the various football team be discuss as we be discuss arsenal among the research have be do into the bill it turn out that cardiff city win the fa cup in by beat arsenal which be remarkable achievement one nil one nil believe hughie ferguson be the goal scorer there you go it amazing what you can get help with if you ask the right question be it that game be on st george day as well how be that for triple it be absolutely true that football bind people together around the world the number of conversation that one can have travel and meet head of state heads of government ministers official and indeed taxi driver and folk around the world be extraordinary because football really do unite that be why the bill be so important will start with one of the point raise by the hon member for shipley philip davies raise when he ask why do this apply only to football and not other sport the reality be that football be hugely dominant in term of sporting appearance and interest in the united kingdom it be clear that over the past few decade football have dominate that sport appeal for spectator it have be so dominant and sadly that have cause problem do not want to blame fan that would not be right but when large crowd gather there be challenge with manage those crowd sadly other sport be yet to attract quite the same interest understand the point the minister make but last year at the grand national at aintree we see lot of people enter the racecourse without ticket whose only purpose be to cause as much destruction and misery as possible and it lead to quite lot of disorder could be wrong but my understanding be that nobody have be punish for that particular outrage and carnage which also lead to animal welfare issue gently say to he that this issue apply to more than just football and if he want to look for another sport horserace what happen at the grand national at aintree last year and may well happen again this year would be good case in point be grateful to my hon friend for raise that point will certainly look into it will ensure that we have proper scrub of other sporting event that might qualify the point be make be that the vast majority of such situation be football event but he be right that there be standalone sporting event like aintree that attract huge crowd as one off be delighted to be at the fantastic market rasen ground and at lingfield not long ago but the reality be that the crowd be not quite the same it be not quite the same pressure that my hon friend describe but take his point and he be right to make it the hon member for cardiff west have make an extraordinary effort to bring together hon member from across the house and to ensure that previous work be summarise into this short bill to keep fan safe be very grateful that he have do that because as member have demonstrate the word he have choose have reach across the house and united people when we think about our own sporting event we know that those precious moment of family time can be threaten by individual who might disrupt they the hon gentleman carefully make the point that automatic ban be not within the scope of the bill such ban can be issue only by court follow conviction for football relate offence and be cover by other legislation in reality the bill be constrain as my hon friend the member for shipley say the key to good legislation be to write it in way that work not so that it expand and this be tight piece of legislation that do exactly what it be suppose do the bill will not do some of the thing that be fear my hon friend the member for south ribble raise question about whether it would criminalise those who be in possession of valid ticket as she be in her leapfrogging day it certainly will not do that those who be in possession of valid ticket be free to enter ground and should be able to access the ground the fact that the turnstile do not work really be test of her athletic not of the law be delighted to say that have no doubt that she would vault it again be the same situation to arise question be ask about whether an offence be commit only if person be attempt to attend football match the bill do not cover those try to get into pub or car park unless they be part of the control zone as we all know some football stadium have control zone other do not anybody who have be to the army and navy rugby match will know that the car park be the most important part of that control zone in fact have have the great privilege over many year of attend the army and navy rugby match have be on half dozen to dozen occasion and in that time be proud to say that have watch minute of rugby in total although should acknowledge that it be security nightmare it be the most extraordinary reunion and the car park of twickenham stadium become gathering of people who have not see each other since iraq afghanistan or wherever it might be it be extraordinary how many formerly terrify sergeant major or general seem to be somewhat more friendly shortly before kick off be sure it have absolutely nothing to do with extremely generous sponsorship of pimm greene king or any of the other supplier who ensure those event go with the passion and drive hon member would anticipate on more serious point the minister have prompt to think more about the subject of car park maybe be dwell on this too much but if somebody have valid match ticket but do not have valid car park ticket would they be commit an offence the bill say that an offence be commit only if they do not have match ticket at the time of entry so it seem to that they may have match ticket but they could still be try to enter place that they be not entitle to enter just wonder whether that be by design or problem in the bill that need to be iron out at the risk of be correct by official be go to say that clearly this be about the match ticket not about the car park ticket the reason be that the match ticket allow access to the stadium to the event and that be what be be criminalise the access to the car park as long as it be not within the control zone or an area that would otherwise be impermissible without match ticket be not cover by the bill car park ticket can usually mostly be buy later in this circumstance we be not seek to criminalise that we be seek to make sure that the bill allow those who have valid right of access to the event to get into the event without allow those who think they have ground for disruption tailgating or whatever it may be to exploit loophole in the law to get away with jump over wall push through turnstile or whatever it may be the minister be be very generous and his explanation make great deal of sense but if he wish to come to bradford city on any match day as part of his research for the bill he would be very welcome will let he come with and will make sure he have valid ticket so that he do not fall foul of the legislation what he would find at bradford city be that there be limited car parking which be often at premium and people would very much like to take advantage of it there might be an issue with lot of people try to tailgate in and barge their way into the car parking even though they have match ticket it would still cause quite problem but they would not fall foul of the bill because they have match ticket would be delighted to take up my hon friend invitation have never see football play in bradford neither have he will ignore the contribution from the hon member for cardiff west who be very disparaging about bradford city be sure bradford city would offer fantastic afternoon and would very much enjoy it simply can not believe that my hon friend would not be back winner give his reputation so will stay silent on that accusation the bill deliberately do not go into car parking as my hon friend will be well aware in many area car parking be very different some stadium have car parking available and some have car parking on the street or in neighbouring car park which would be cover by local government ordinance and so on it would add complication and not clarity to the bill to his eternal point occam razor be to get to the heart of the matter he would rightly be the first critic of any bill that start to be expansive and to look like it might include supermarket car park or indeed any other kind of car park that be why the bill be write and draft as tightly as it be and why so many of we support it the bill have give we the space to focus on that part of the offence that be actually important the bill have be very carefully draft to set out this new offence of unauthorised entry or attempt unauthorised entry to designate football match in england and wales in practice designate football match really mean elite football match for these purpose that do include manchester the bill will also enable court to impose football ban order against person convict of this offence ban order provide an effective tool to combat football relate disorder by prevent disruptive individual from attend regulated match for between three and year would like to pay my own tribute to baroness casey and her extraordinary work not just on this issue but in reform and review various other aspect of our national life that have require attention her independent review of the appalling disorder that occur during the euro final result in clear recommendation that action need to be take to deter the practice of tailgating which be the phenomenon that we have be cover of ticketless person follow legitimate entrant into the stadium of course the bill be draft in this way because tailgating be not the only problematic behaviour there be many other route to attempt entry into football match such as jump over wall which we have see at some stadium or hang down from building and jump through window we have occasionally see video of that happen abroad that be extremely concern not least because it can lead to enormous personal harm and can encourage people to take extremely unwise risk it can also lead to crush within the building that could cause harm not just to fan but to those work in the stadium as we know stadium these day be major business and many employ large number of people on match day estimate suggest that somewhere in the region of to england fan without ticket gain entry to the euro final largely through mass force entry witness speak of be terrify by their reckless and aggressive behaviour despite my own lack of passion in this regard have take my child to football match and have enjoy the day with they must admit that my child be much more impressed with the game than ever be but enjoy the experience very much the opportunity to see it through their eye be great blessing find it enormously warm very modern parent thank you very much it would be concern this be why the bill be so important if football be close off to family because people feel threaten and wish to keep their kid away from such event like they use to be exactly my hon friend correctly point out that they use to be suspect that that be one of the reason we be not encourage to attend when be child despite my uncle great passion for tottenham hotspur in fact happy birthday to he it be his birthday today he be in the other place so maybe if we shout loudly enough he will hear it the reality be that at that point in our national life football be disrupt by significant violence indeed some area appear to be almost lawless be very grateful not only to the football association but to police force around the united kingdom and the various organisation that contribute to make football safe even at the tonbridge angels which be not traditionally hotbed of dissent the family welcome be remarkable that be extremely important there be other unauthorised method of entry at football match range from surreptitious entry include as the hon member for cardiff west say bribe club staff to various form of deception be therefore very pleased that the bill seek to make all form of unauthorised or attempt entry an offence that be eminently sensible give that all attempt at unauthorised entry draw upon stadium security resource and can result in individual with dangerous disruptive intent gain access to the stadium and to spectator and that overcrowding have health and safety risk and implication this be therefore an important change in the law it be also right that the bill include not just the entrance point but the outer perimeter security as the hon gentleman set out clearly it be about prevent concertina effect whereby pressure on one area have repercussion on other he be correct that the bill set out carefully why that be so we can not tolerate decent law abide football fan be leave frightened or distressed and neither would it be acceptable for football stadium to become unsafe because of selfish minority the government be clear that the safety of those attend sporting event be of the high importance and it be imperative that football fan be able to enjoy the sport safe in the knowledge that those who attempt to cause disorder will be deal with swiftly the bill will help to achieve that which be why we support it it be right and proper that those who engage in unacceptable criminal behaviour face the full force of the law and the introduction of new football specific offence will send deterrent message to would be perpetrator the measure enable the court to impose football ban order against offender and remind the house that football ban order have historically prove successful in prevent know troublemaker from continue to offend and in deter other from offend as such the government wholeheartedly support their use in the context of unauthorised entry to match the minister speak with great passion and know this subject be close to his heart who among we have not enjoy matinee performance by england rovers at the oval must press he on technical detail raise by the shadow minister who play leave back for tonbridge angels discretion be important at such moment as my hon friend will be aware tonbridge angels have recently buy few new player it be far too early for to start pick the team which be the manager job after all he would not thank minister of the crown for step on his hallowed turf it may be helpful for member to be aware that both the police and the football association be similarly supportive of the bill and have contribute helpfully once again thank the hon member for cardiff west for introduce the bill also thank the hon member for nottingham north alex norris and the opposition for their approach hope the bill set an example that be adopt by other assemblies which seem appropriate give the importance of football in the national life of scotland and northern ireland thank everyone who have contribute to this debate this important measure will ensure that the perpetrator of these disruptive and dangerous offence face justice and it should provide strong deterrent effect therefore join the hon member for cardiff west in urge the house to get behind the bill with the leave of the house will briefly sum up thank all hon member who have contribute and intervene this debate have give an extremely useful airing to the issue relate to bill the hon member for shipley philip davies raise some very valid point some of which be subsequently address in

we be always thankful to mary and everyone else who look after we in the members tea room especially on friday question put and agree to bill accordingly read second time to stand committed to public bill committee standing order no community and suspend sentences notification of details bill second read beg to move that the bill be now read second time be delighted to rise to bring this bill to the house today it be an important but focus bill that will amend the sentencing code to create duty on offender to notify the responsible officer of any change of name or contact detail if they be sentence to community order suspend sentence order youth rehabilitation order or referral order the bill will place new duty on offender who be serve sentence in the community and who be be supervise by the probation service or youth offend team to ensure that any change of name or contact detail be notify to the relevant responsible officer that capture not just any formal legal change of name but the use of an online alias offender will need to notify their responsible officer of any change as soon as be practicable my bill will apply to adult and child offender alike so that we can create some form of consistency across all offender who be on licence importantly it will extend to offender serve community sentence in secondary legislation be pass require offender on licence to inform their probation officer if they change their name or contact detail the bill will help to ensure consistency across the sentencing framework and that offender serve community sentence have their risk manage effectively for those offender who be serve community order youth rehabilitation order and referral order the requirement contain in the bill will last for the whole duration of the order while the offender remain supervise by probation or their youth offend team until it reach the end date set by the court or be otherwise terminate for suspend sentence order this requirement will last for the period when the offender must keep in touch with probation once the offender be no long require to keep in touch with probation or the youth offend team this requirement will also end failure to comply with the duty will be treat the same as failure to comply with the requirement of the order an offender could be take back to court when an order be return to court the court can make the requirement of the order more onerous impose fine or even sentence the individual to custody the management of offender in the community be of the utmost importance to protect people in newport west and across the united kingdom and to reduce reoffende it be vital that probation and youth offending team have the information require to be able to effectively manage offender in the community and the ability to take swift enforcement action where need the bill will improve the ability of probation and youth offend team to monitor offender it will help to protect the public by ensure that while an offender be serve sentence in the community the responsible officer have the information they need to keep an eye on that individual as have note that requirement already apply to offender release from custody so believe it be important to ensure that the same requirement apply to offender serve sentence in our community as co chair of the all party parliamentary group on safeguarding in faith community have hear harrowing account of offender who have change their name legitimately at present by deed poll and then go on to commit harrowing offence again and again that be not acceptable the people of newport west elect to this place in april and since then have sit through many friday sitting listen to detailed and on occasion lengthy opening remark on second reading in the hope of get this bill speedily through to the next stage of its journey in this house with support from colleague on all side will bring my remark to close shortly in support the bill this house have an opportunity to improve the ability of probation and youth offend team to monitor and support offender in the community as effectively as possible most importantly for it allow we all to well protect the people who send we here the british people keep our people safe from newport west to north down and from newcastle upon tyne central to north devon be our most important responsibility as member of parliament with that in mind urge colleague from all part of the house to give the bill their full support today be very pleased to be support the bill introduce by the hon member for newport west ruth jones be what would be typically refer to as tory wet which mean that do not think lock up everybody be always panacea for everything community centre have an important role to play not only do we have particularly crowded prison estate as it be but the prison estate be not the good place for the rehabilitation of offender who have short sentence because their crime be their first offence or relatively minor if we be talk about proper lag or villain then let we lock they up for year but fundamentally we should be try to get people into the habit of improve their life we should be create productive citizen support the bill very much the hon lady have alight on an important point when somebody leave custodial sentence there be rule and regulation in place to ensure that they do not change their identity or somehow get around the system in order to reoffend although there will be some who go on to reoffend there will sadly also be those who go on to reoffend after have have one of these non custodial sentence by apply to they the same regime that apply to people who have be in the prison estate we be not introduce new special punishment and they be not under any extra burden they be be ask to comply with perfectly sensible regime therefore very much welcome what the hon lady have do we will all know of at least one or two heartbreaking case from our constituency where the system have not work quite as it should when first start in this place meet the family of constituent who have be murder by somebody who be out on parole there have be similar issue with identity document have be lose meeting be not take place this man have basically just disappear into the ether of the system can not guarantee that have the safeguard in the bill be in place it would have save my constituent life but it certainly would have make it much less likely that little boy be leave without his dad and parent be leave without their son congratulate the hon lady on introduce this bill and look forward to support it too thank the hon member for newport west ruth jones for bring this important bill to the house today and congratulate she on its second reading what my constituent in truro and falmouth want and care about above all else be the ability to live in safe and hospitable community the way that we deal with those who break that safety or our law and disrupt our town and village be incredibly important to they it be one of the most important thing that they need to feel safe and it come up time and again when be out and about talk to my community however not everybody who commit crime be consider dangerous and be therefore pleased that we have level of punishment that be appropriate to each crime before go on to what this bill might mean to the people of truro and falmouth and cornwall and beyond want to say little about woman prisoner and offender and why the bill will be so important to they in cornwall the near woman prison be his majesty prison eastwood park which be in south west gloucestershire for those who be not from the south west that may sound close but in actual fact it be nearly mile away from cornwall low level woman offender who happen to have small baby or child or be pregnant will potentially have to move mile away from her child court understand that these day and they want to keep woman who be not danger to society nearer their family level up the submitting of name and contact detail as offender would if they be in prison be therefore another safeguard that court will have in their back pocket in case where they wish to give low level sentence to somebody who for whatever reason they need to keep track of maternity imprisonment impact an average of child each year by keep criminal with sentence of less than month in the community we be able to prevent hundred of child from be bring into our prison and grow up in those unsuitable and unstable environment it be much well for child across the south west to live in their community and grow up with parent who have clearly give back to the community albeit through an impose sentence make clear connection between crime the community and the local who be affect mean that both parent and child will be more aware of the impact of crime it be no coincidence that our police and crime commissioner alison hernandez be lead the charge in devon cornwall police with combine treatment order which deal directly with mental health issue alcoholism and drug addiction for those with community sentence they keep people out of toxic prison environment where such flaw be likely to be exploit and make unmanageable and instead support the criminal in the community with regular treatment and programme tackle these factor be essential to reduce reoffende rate and repair the route of addiction that may have contribute to people find themselves in position where lawbreaking become an option help to rebuild life be the good way of ensure that they continue to feed back into their local community the south west be the first region to secure funding for mental health treatment requirement as part of community order that be because we work as team in the area again lead by alison hernandez the work of the plymouth team in particular as part of the original pilot scheme have be hold up as good practice to the rest of the country there be an opportunity for community payback to expand hopefully under the immediate justice funding of about that will come to devon cornwall later this year our police and crime commissioner be determined to get offender fill pothole again we will be work as region and we think that it will be rewarding work build on the precedent achieve in devon where it have be do by volunteer people may think that this do not matter to life in general but community order be see as be important to the community in other way in cornwall everyone know everyone else and if someone be see to be have to pay back to their local community there be slight issue of peer pressure people do not want to be see do this so it can be use as deterrent it be different in city where people do not know other in their locality to the same extent st agnes parish council one of the proactive parish council on the north coast of my constituency have take advantage of payback scheme to improve local amenity people have be sweep the library building and litter picking weed and hedge cut around the library car park and on the verge they have be paint bench cut back the ivy on building own by the parish council clean noticeboard and bus stop pressure washing to deal with slippery pavement paint toilet block and the lych gate at the garden of rest cut grass paint the equipment in beaconsfield play park implement the installation of water pipe and maintain the allotment site at mount hawke those be really useful job and fabulously innovative when parish council be strapped for cash local people who have fall foul of the law but be not danger to society be do something brilliant for the local community however as say early the bill will level thing up so that these people be still recognise as be under sentence albeit not custodial one hope that the bill will also help those who be cover by clare law people who be convict of domestic violence but not see as danger to the rest of society be often not give custodial sentence which be quite frustrating for and for other in my position under clare law they must be on register but sometimes as we know they change their identity and move to another part of the country or their locality should like to know from the minister whether the bill will help to strengthen clare law for those who might otherwise fall through the crack this be very useful little bill it be hard to argue with any of it and be grateful to the hon member for newport west ruth jones for introduce it when be read about the bill immediately think of case that have encounter couple of year ago be already member of parliament at that time which resonate with element of it that case originate in an email from an individual the name that come up on my computer be different from the email address which be itself different from the name use in the sign off let we just say that the email in question be not necessarily sympathetic to what think be the fine work that be do in north norfolk as fairly nice chap which consider myself to be write back to the individual and say of course will meet you do my own bit of research mps security be very pertinent at the moment to discover from the three different name that be give who that individual be do not want to give too much away do so would reveal that person identity but find out who they be and they have serve prison sentence for crime and be now out shall not go into the nature of their crime but it immediately ring alarm bell and contact the police to request their presence at my surgery when read about the bill and how people on community sentence be weave into it think that that case be pertinent there be individual out there who be hide behind alias effectively try to be anonymous to contact and meet mps and other public official so this be good bill it be ironic and incredible that in today life in which everything we do be track by our smartwatch mobile phone and alexa other brand be out there people can not be find of course if someone be use an alias and try not to be detect those thing can clearly happen one reason think this bill so important be that it remind of the experience of my friend in the probation service in his remark will the minister set out whether the probation service can cope with the additional workload require by the bill tomorrow be the second anniversary of the russian invasion of ukraine year ago take generator to ukraine it take about nine hour of solid driving to get from north norfolk all the way across to ukraine when drive transit van that far one get to know one cab mate pretty well be sit with friend who be probation officer after hour on end when every other possible conversation between two bloke have be exhaust many of which can not be repeat in the house we start to talk about his life in the probation service it make realise just how tough and important role that be in my previous career will openly admit that be an accountant have absolutely no idea about the criminal justice system and do not until become an mp the comment from my hon friend the member for heywood and middleton chris clarkson about be tory wet be really interesting be probably bit of tory wet but do not realise it before be an mp certainly be not but now have learn about the criminal justice system have far more awareness of just what the hard work man and woman in our prison service do and they be quite phenomenal in their role after that small conversation about the probation service with my friend while travel to ukraine year ago and with much more understanding of the criminal justice system today have far great awareness of and respect for what those man and woman do my first trip of this year on january when we be in recess be visit to hmp bure category man prison in my constituency right on the border it be home to prisoner and be run by governor rhoden and the other fine man and woman who work there all the strand have talk about today be conceptualise when go on that visit because realise just how tough job those work in prison do and that rehabilitation be so important have be completely unaware of what those incredibly hard work and decent man and woman do behind the scene for few hour get to see what prison life be like what prisoner do and how their rehabilitation work admit that have not take into account that would see prisoner on bicycle mechanic course art course and weld course which prepare they for life outside prison and give they skillset so that they can find employment again want to place on the record have say it few time my thank to the hard work man and woman at hmp bure they be not respect enough in society or pay enough for the hard work they do and the condition be not always good one of their big concern be their retirement age there be campaign to lower it from perhaps the minister could comment on that be it in the public interest or fair that police officer retire at one age and prison officer at another much old age which be for new intake these people be on their foot all day long and often put themselves at high risk in civilised society we need to look at their retirement age be astounded to hear that it take only nine hour to get from norfolk to ukraine give that it take five hour to get from westminster to cornwall but that be different matter agree with all my hon friend point about prison officer do he agree that ask somebody who need to use their physical strength in their job to work until they be be often quite big ask do which be why the retirement age need to be look at properly in the context of the retirement age for those in similar role in society such as police officer get from norfolk to ukraine involve nine hour drive day over about two and half day my apology if do not make that clear go through holland germany and elsewhere it be long way let put it like that will finish there again thank the hon member for newport west for introduce very interesting bill it feel like complete common sense and hope it be support be back again this time on the front bench for third outing today apologise for my ubiquity it be pleasure to support this bill which be present by my hon friend the member for newport west ruth jones congratulate she on her success in the private member bill ballot it really be great day for the welsh by the sound of it this will be the third bill from welsh labour member of parliament to gain support from across the house and receive its second reading today for those who say that mps from the devolved nation do not play role in this place the proof that they do be the fact that these three bills have reach this stage today thank everyone across the house for their support for our bills and it be pleasure to support my hon friend bill from the front bench thank member who have contribute to the debate include the hon member for truro and falmouth cherilyn mackrory the hon member for heywood and middleton chris clarkson who like have be on his foot lot today and the hon member for north norfolk duncan baker who would never have guess be an accountant in previous life as he reveal in the debate he speak with lot of compassion and sense and he mention probation which relate to point that want to make in my brief remark twenty year ago be here the last labour government introduce community order and suspend sentence order in their current form they be design to be robust alternative to prison in case of less serious offending it have be disappointing to note that the use of community sentence have decline sharply particularly in the last decade and particularly between and in survey of magistrate find that over third be not confident that community sentence be an effective alternative to custody and two third be not confident that they cut crime it be plain to see that more must be do to strengthen the confidence of the court and the public that sentence serve in the community be effective appropriate and above all safe that be particularly press give the government proposal in the sentencing bill we be wait for committee of the whole house hopefully soon for new presumption that all sentence of less than year will be suspend unless there be exceptional circumstance such as the breach of previous order or risk to an individual the bill before we make an important contribution to that effort it will require offender serve community or suspend sentence to alert their probation officer or youth offend team if they change their name or contact detail the question be how these necessary measure will be properly enforce while the government continue to load more and more pressure on to the probation service without give it any additional resource sentence serve in the community can be effective only if there be function probation service root in the area that can enforce sentence and keep offender on the right track be sure that the minister can see that our probation service be already critically understaffed undervalue and overstretch probation workload be soar almost working day among probation staff have be lose to distress with of probation officer rat their case load as unmanageable more and more experienced prison officer who be also mention be leave the service and there be over vacancy for probation staff recent watchdog report warn that such understaffing be have devastating effect on deliver the good outcome that the bill be intend to support in september the annual report of his majesty inspectorate of probation say that inspection of probation delivery unit have be complete since the probation service be reunify in and only one unit be find to be good the rest be rat either require improvement or inadequate thank my hon friend the member for newport west for bring forward the bill and urge all member to support it as necessary step forward challenge the government to ensure that the probation service be give the resource that it need to ensure that the reform be successful and that the public remain protect as they and the court expect call on the government to affirm their commitment to enforce the crucial measure in the bill when it become law thank the hon member for newport west ruth jones for bring forward the bill be grateful for the support of the opposition will address some of the comment that the hon member for cardiff west kevin brennan make although do not necessarily agree with his characterisation of the probation service let start with the main thrust of the bill it will place new duty on offender who be serve sentence in the community and who be be supervise by probation or youth offend team require they to inform the responsible officer if they begin use different name or change their contact information include telephone number or email address we have separate youth justice system but it be of equal if not great importance that youth offend team be able to keep tab on child and have the right information about they to do their job we welcome the fact that this policy apply equally to offender of all age and will create consistency across offender on licence and offender serve sentence in the community who be oversee by probation service or youth offend team the offender will be require to comply with the requirement while their order be in effect and have not be revoke or discharge for suspend sentence order the requirement will last for the period for which the offender must keep in touch with probation for offender serve community order youth rehabilitation order and referral order the requirement will last for the whole duration of the order while the offender be supervise by probation or their youth offend team until the end date set by the court be reach or the order be otherwise terminate sentencing in individual case be matter for our independent judiciary and the court have broad range of sentence power to deal effectively and appropriately with offender they can impose discharge fine community sentence suspend sentence and imprisonment this government be clear that deliver public protection mean impose custodial sentence when the offence be so serious that custody be justify it be worth note however that even when that threshold be meet the court should consider whether community sentence would be more suitable in particular case my hon friend the member for truro and falmouth cherilyn mackrory talk about some of the challenge on the woman prison estate include the prison distance from home clearly that be factor that the judiciary can take into account my hon friend also mention clare law my understanding be that the bill do cover those cover by that law but will double check so that do not mislead she or the house will write to she and place copy of the letter in the house of commons library in many case there be persuasive evidence that suspend and community sentence can be more effective than short custodial sentence in reduce reoffende more than half of people give custodial sentence of less than month reoffend within year for offender punish with suspend sentence order that be serve in the community the reoffende rate be much low think that my hon friend the member for heywood and middleton chris clarkson be make that point when he say that sometimes prison do not work and in fact make thing bad under our sentencing framework there be the flexibility to choose from and balance range of community base requirement such as unpaid work drug and alcohol treatment curfew and electronic monitoring with the intent of punish the offender ensure reparation to the community and address any criminogenic that be new word for or rehabilitative need of the offender that might give rise to an increase likelihood of reoffende rigorous community offender management be vital to build confidence in the order make and to deliver effective rehabilitation while keep the public safe the shadow minister mention the probation service can reassure he that we share his commitment to make sure that the probation service be effective and be fund appropriately we value its work which be why we be invest an additional million year in the service so that it can recruit record level of staff and be invest up to million in community payback as way of compliment that would like to reassure my hon friend the member for north norfolk duncan baker who raise the same point in december recruitment number for band probation officer be up on the previous year and the number for band probation officer be up over the same period we be confident that our probation service can deal with this issue however must point out that in the bill the duty be on the offender not the probation service colleague will see the word duty of offender repeat throughout the bill it be loud and clear that it be the responsibility of the offender to comply and if they do not they will have to bear the consequence as well as the investment in the probation service there have be million invest through the department of health and social care to increase substance misuse treatment provision in all local authority in england of course that will be devolve in wales dedicated criminal justice staff have be recruit to increase the quality of treatment and assessment delivery we believe that this approach dovetail with ensure that community sentence support people with other issue the effectiveness of community sentence rely on probation and youth offend team be able to manage offender in the community successfully that mean have the right information about they we agree that the bill help to strengthen the mean that probation and youth offend team service have at their disposal to monitor offender but reiterate that in the bill the duty rest with the offender the bill build on secondary legislation pass in require offender on licence to inform their probation officer if they change their name or contact detail we welcome the bill from the hon member for newport west and we will continue to do all we can to assist its passage in my view these provision be robust and while the name or contact detail change could be for valid reason they require any difference from what be be keep on file to be report they capture not just formal legal change of name by deed poll but for example the use of an online alias another issue that my hon friend the member for north norfolk highlight as have set out we recognise the importance of ensure that the public be protect that rehabilitation can be effective and that there be confidence in non custodial sentence that mean ensure that offender manage in the community be be properly monitor by the probation service with the ability for that service to take robust enforcement action where necessary we agree that this bill will make sure that our probation and youth offend team undertake that monitoring effectively by ensure that while an offender be serve sentence in the community the responsible officer have the information that they need to keep tab on that individual will end by again congratulate the hon member for newport west on bring this bill before the house be grateful to the official opposition for their support of the bill and place on record my thank to the official at the ministry of justice for assist the hon lady in draft it with the leave of the house rise to close the debate thank everybody who have take part today for the atmosphere of co operation and consensual politic it be very different from what happen early this week start by thank the hon member for heywood and middleton chris clarkson agree with he that the lock they up philosophy be not always the way forward and community sentence be vital part of our punishment option be recently fortunate enough to go to cardiff prison with the welsh affairs committee where we see for ourselves prisoner who might be in for just seven day seven day be not long enough to do anything useful in term of rehab or break the cycle of offending so the point that the hon member make be very important thank the hon member for truro and falmouth cherilyn mackrory for her very important point about female offender and the distance involve we do not have single prison for woman in wales be not say that we should have one but like her constituent those woman in wales have long way to travel that mean woman be apart from their family that be disruptive and it be very costly to visit if anyone be in any doubt about female prisoner they should watch time with jodie whittaker it be very powerful series the hon member for north norfolk duncan baker make an important point about alias and social medium be sure we have all have issue with people who have have different name on email it be concern that share he also highlight the importance of staff work in the criminal justice system too pay tribute to those staff and thank they for all their effort thank the shadow minister my hon friend the member for cardiff west kevin brennan hope he can put his foot up on the plane to dublin after this because he have be very busy today also thank the minister and the team in the department the minister rightly highlight that the responsibility for report change of detail be on the offender it be very important that we know that finally thank the whips the public bill office and adam jogee in my office this week have see our parliament the mother of parliaments at low point but wish the medium could be here to see and feel the atmosphere today be not fan of adversarial politic believe consensual politic be the way forward that have be the case today and thank the house for it thank the hon lady for her remark question put and agree to bill accordingly read second time to stand committed to public bill committee standing order no hereditary titles female succession bill second read beg to move that the bill be now read second time think this be my third attempt to make progress on this issue in this house want to end the constitutional sexism that mean that an eighth of the seat in the other place be reserve for man only pay tribute to my hon friend the member for shipley philip davies who try to introduce the bill in march he be champion of true equality pay tribute to charlotte carew pole of daughters right who help to keep this just cause alive in this place our former colleague mary macleod also try to bring in similar bill even though this be this bill second reading it be not the second time that the issue have come up in the commons and it will keep come up until thing change be grateful to my hon friend for give way and for her good kind word this have be long battle thank she for her persistence on the issue it be battle worth fighting and hope that she will continue to fight for it do she agree that the issue we be discuss be completely and utterly unacceptable one of the last bastion of unacceptable discrimination and that this house should have nothing to do with it any long thank my hon friend for his endorsement agree as do almost everyone have meet and will go through some of that agreement in my remark as someone who have have the privilege to be both foreign office minister and the chair of the british group inter parliamentary union find it hard to meet parliamentarian from other part of the world and say that our unwritten constitution have create great outcome for woman in this parliament because we still have this anomaly of inbuilt sexism for over year our country be grace by female sovereign who be the perfect embodiment of the benefit of female succession that be probably one of the reason why this place change the succession to the crown in the succession to the crown act mean that the firstborn child of prince george will be in line to succeed he the act end male primogeniture for the crown but we leave undo any wide reform to make male primogeniture in the united kingdom part of history as result in this very parliament quarter of the way through the century we still have situation where an eighth of the seat in the other place be reserve for man only will repeat that because find it so shocking an eighth of the seat in the upper house of this parliament be permanently reserve for man only through the system of reserve seat for hereditary peerage whatever our view of the other place or of hereditary peerage more generally personally value the contribution that they make and the perspective they bring but understand that there be other point of view hope we can all agree that in embed sex discrimination be simply not acceptable woman be be treat unfairly for no reason other than that they be woman that have terrible real world consequence in fact of the land in the uk be own by woman and be own by man boy be twice as likely as girl to inherit the family business if we can not change inequality at the top of our society we will never be able to change inequality for the whole of our society put simply daughter should be treat the same as son across society if it be good enough for succession to the crown it should be good enough for everyone else hereditary peerage in the other place should go automatically to the eld child which at the moment very rarely happen have listen to many point of view on this topic since first introduce the bill and have reflect on those comment and change it it be not the same bill that present last time hop that by make these change might persuade the government to support it clause provide that succession to hereditary peerage only do not depend on sex have deliberately narrow the scope of the bill to focus on peerage because of the constitutional implication as they be eligible to be elect to our upper house on the register to stand as hereditary peer there be people who wish to put themselves forward should there be by election and understand that of those people only one be female that demonstrate that it be already possible to be female hereditary peer but under the current system it do not happen as routinely as it do for man unlike my early bill the scope do not include baronetcy and other title in order to address the objection that the bill have too wide scope and would intrude into the private life of those to family who would never be in our legislature have do that with some reluctance but in order to get the government to support my bill clause would phase the provision in gradually and again listen to comment from people when there be already an identify male heir in the line of succession the change would take place at the next point of succession that would gradually phase in the change which be another concession be make to get the government support clause make it clear again in response to objection that the bill be entirely about the title and that any decision about will property or inheritance be completely distinct from the issue of the title clause again address an objection would exempt the peerage and title that be still hold by the crown have therefore go long way in this new version of the bill to address the concern have hear as conservative stand for equality of opportunity we should want every person bear in this country to enjoy the same chance to make difference to thrive and to prosper personally will not give up until this posh glass ceiling be break another concern that hear raise be what about their lordship what might they do if lord forbid this bill should reach the other place want to put on record my gratitude to the earl of devon no less who have agree to take the bill through the other place fortunately we have some recent comment from hansard that reflect the mood in the other place because on february lord northbrook secure second reading of his succession to peerages and baronetcies bill which take different approach it would allow female succession only if no man be available no comment need lord northbrook say as say in understand that section of the human rights act now make it illegal to discriminate on the basis of sex where both sex may perform the function require this would apply to peerage the noble lord lord pannick mention to at the time that if legitimate female issue where the peerage would otherwise become extinct refer case to the european court of human rights they could well have chance of success would perfectly well understand if some heir might wish to take this route official report house of lords february vol male primogeniture could therefore be illegal anyway in some case if test by the court on second reading in the other place the following supportive point be make about my bill the earl of sandwich say the campaign for female succession must be encourage and have have approval if not support from within government at high level harriett baldwin private member bill in another place attract lot of attention while as the noble earl lord russell mention penny mordaunt the leader of the house refer to this as posh glass ceiling even our own noble lord lord true seem to be sympathetic though could not actually support the bill let we see if his majesty government can look more favourably on it this time viscount astor say that lord northbrook bill do not go far enough it should be bill that bring the peerage into line with the crown official report house of lords february vol lord lucas say share the vision that woman be equal with man in every respect and would very much like to see that apply to peerage inheritance official report house of lords february vol lord addington say however if we be go to do this we should follow the example of the royal family the old child be the only way you can really make this equal go forward it lord northbrook bill could be interpret as an attempt at small step forward but it be out of date and out of time official report house of lords february vol baroness noakes be supportive of the way forward be inheritance by the eld child and of course baroness chapman for the opposition be supportive too in fact have personally contact every single one of the hereditary peer and not have single person object if there be objection they be well hide in the other place in fact have have the following supportive reply lord hampton tell that he support the principle behind my bill earl howe say be very much in favour of the principle behind your bill lord willoughby de broke say will certainly support it if only because two of our good monarch have be queens and it absurd that girl be exclude by male primogeniture what be the government objection and why be they not supportive of the bill because fear that will be talk out many member of the government be supportive and be sorry that the collective decision of the government be not supportive one this be miss opportunity for the government to champion wide support for woman with another step forward commend my hon friend for all her extensive consultation on this issue it seem from what she say that no logical reason have be give to be against the measure in the bill other than self interest and pure old sexism those seem to be the only two possible way someone could oppose the bill give that encourage she to keep go with this bill and to find further date down the line in the meantime we can hopefully encourage the government and opposition to find their way to support the bill and it can then be nod through at later date such wonderfully encouraging word from my hon friend believe that by make the change have to the substance of the bill have address any substantive concern that the government might have have hear the objection that it be just too complicated too time consume basically faff for which there be not enough parliamentary time have be tell that it be not doorstep issue or retail issue and it be true that few people would ever raise it with on the doorstep be sure that colleague would say the same however it be important because when we mention what it be about people immediately understand how pernicious it be if sexism be embed in our legislature in this way may take this opportunity to put it on the record that the hon member be do an amazing job on an important subject it be quite depressing as relative newcomer to this house that in we be still have to make these argument perhaps will be the year when these thing be finally hear have hear concern that the bill could be use to abolish hereditary peerage altogether with an amendment in the other place but the primary advocate of that lord grocott have assure that he will not use this bill for that purpose will conclude my remark by say that my only interest in the issue be as female parliamentarian the woman ever elect to this place in our nation history my hon friend refer to the number of female mps ever elect be elect in and be no her experience show in the number she attribute to her name there be mp in this place yet we still have not get to woman ever sit on these green benches do she agree that that be the context in which her speech should be see be encourage to hear government parliamentary private secretary no less make supportive remark in this debate and agree with my hon friend want to say for the record that be not posh this bill do not affect at all care passionately about equality equality of opportunity girl get great education woman succeed in the workplace and in their life and achieve parliament in my lifetime congratulate my hon friend on introduce this bill lord trefgarne one of the most distinguished peer live in my constituency of woking be long stand opponent of my hon friend proposal but he be very agreeable and thoughtful man and be sure he would be delighted to meet she to discuss it be very grateful to my hon friend for find someone who object to the principle of the bill have not yet have reply to my inquiry of lord trefgarne so will certainly follow that up in due course want to end my remark with an inspiring quotation that hear this week which sum up why be persist with this issue be very inspired to hear these word by nora ephron the great us screenwriter whatever you choose however many road you travel hope that you choose not to be lady hope you will find some way to break the rule and make little trouble out there and also hope that you will choose to make some of that trouble on behalf of woman so say to my government come on will continue to make little trouble on this subject until you let this bill pass alternatively we could agree today to make this small and symbolic change for our country sake and for the sake of equality between future generation of man and woman congratulate my hon friend the member for west worcestershire harriett baldwin on her dog determination sometimes we just have to keep go with these thing and she be entirely right that this be private member bill whose time have come try to justify to anybody that we reserve portion of seat exclusively to one sex or the other in either part of our legislature be sticky wicket certainly could not make good fist of it woman have have to fight for the same treatment as man not well treatment or different treatment at every stage of the way be extremely proud that one of my forebear be chain to the front of this building with mrs pankhurst appreciate my hon friend supportive tone note for hansard that he be the parliamentary private secretary to the leader of the house of lords that be not the first time have be out my hon friend be absolutely right spend quite bit of time at the other end of the building with their lordship in fact the current chief whip in the house of lord be my sponsor for my parliamentary assessment board must say that be not the child of peer or in line to inherit peerage the run joke be that have be treat the pps job as an apprenticeship for the past three year however see the immense value of what happen in the other place and the quality of some of the people there it be baffle to that we have system design to filter people entirely base on whether they have chromosome we have already reach the determination that our royal family do not need to follow that precedent and we reach it in conjunction with all the other commonwealth realm also have canadian heritage so the king be my monarch twice over be very happy to know that at some point there will be crown princess or princess of wales who will be the substantive holder of that title be very thankful to my hon friend for take on some of the feedback she receive about the previous iteration of the bill on grandfathere in some of these title my hon friend the member for west worcestershire say that people have say that this be not retail issue it do not come up on the doorstep do my hon friend the member for heywood and middleton agree that it do not matter whether it come up on the doorstep or not as she say woman here be be discriminate against simply because they be woman and that should not stand whether it come up on the doorstep or not my hon friend be entirely correct however the idea that say actually we should bother about woman be treat differently in any walk of life would not get reaction on the doorstep be bonker especially when it come to female voter who we certainly rely on let not kid ourselves in the conservative party would not be able to justify say that be shocked to hear that my hon friend the member for west worcestershire be tell that the bill be too much of faff to carry out on that subject the good way to find out if there be any objection would be to give the bill second reading today send it to the other end and find out what be in that can of worm then we can move forward on that basis as with many thing in life the good way be to suck it and see so absolutely order be truly sorry to interrupt the hon gentleman and the hon lady in the middle of such an interesting and important debate but be require to do so the debate stand adjourn standing order no order that the debate be resume on friday june business

amend in the public bill committee object bill to be consider on friday march nhs property services motion make and question propose that this house do now morrissey my aim during this adjournment debate be to get plain answer to one simple question to whom do nhs property services answer that be crucial question because the organisation be in possession of an estate of more than property with value of more than billion the company be responsible for roughly of all nhs facility yet there be need for clarity on how it be oversee aim to unpack some of the key question that need answer and outline some way in which we can improve the situation we find ourselves in specifically in relation to seaton community hospital in my constituency what exactly be nhs property services have to answer this question myself several month ago when learn of plan by nhs devon to hand back part of seaton community hospital to nhs property services from which nhs devon have be rent the building have little idea why nhs property services be the nominal owner of full wing at seaton hospital that be in spite of the fact that the wing be fund entirely through donation raise by the local community before the hospital be build and open in nhs property services be government own company with one single shareholder the secretary of state for health and social care to that imply that minister be ultimately responsible for the oversight of that company even though accept that the day to day run of the organisation be delegate yet ask minister about this as have and member might hear rather different story each minister who have ask question of have simply say that they can not get involve in the decision make process in nhs property services in any meaningful way can understand ministers not want to tinker in operational decision but there be some principle at stake in relation to seaton hospital that mean it be not just an operational matter surely company should be accountable to its shareholder how otherwise can the company and its board be hold accountable for their action that be the paradox we have company worth billion that be solely own by the government yet minister protest that they can have almost nothing to do with it far from be entirely detach from government the framework within which nhs property services operate be set by the department of health and social care when talk to regional representative from nhs property services as have several time they make it plain to in what they say and what they do not that they be bind by policy emanate from whitehall that affect everything from how the organisation be establish to its current operating framework include how much nhs property services charge as rent for space that it let to local nhs organisation such as integrate care board that be key barrier in the fight to save seaton hospital as one single entity the current per square metre market rent put the embattle wing far out of the price range of any local community base organisation that want to take over the space and use it for the improvement of health and wellbee in the axe valley that be crazy price it be well over double what one would have to pay for office space here in westminster and trust real estate price in seaton should not be comparable with those in westminster my concern be that on the one hand the rent be extortionate because it be base on clinical rate and yet on the other hand the property director the people charge with run nhs property services have background in infrastructure and estate and want to get the maximum income they can from the estate they be run so they pay little heed to the health context will talk little about the health context to bring this seaton hospital case study to life the chief medical officer sir chris whitty in his annual report last october call health in an ageing society write specifically about the tendency of old people to retire and move to rural area and specifically to coastal area such as seaton he say we ve really get to get serious about the area of the country where ageing be happen very fast and we ve get to do it now it possible to compress the period of time that people spend in ill health because otherwise we will end up with large number of people lead much more dependent life the report recommend provide service and environment suitable for old adult in these area as an absolute priority sir chris whitty say that specifically we need policy to reduce disease to reduce disability and to help people to exercise eat well and stay fit that be the chief medical officer and will also refer to report write just couple of week ago by beccy baird from the king fund it call for radical refocusing of health and care with primary care and community service at its core the report say that progress have be hamper by an incorrect belief that move care into the community will result in short term cash saving other factor include lack of datum about primary and community service lead to cycle of invisibility with urgent challenge such as waiting time and plan care backlog become the priority for politician tempt by quick fix instead of fundamental improvement sir chris whitty and beccy baird be up against some in the public sector who be tempt to treat all estate management matter as the same the head of the national audit office gareth davies talk in parliament in january about asset management be one of the main area of financial opportunity for the government would caution the national audit office and nhs property services to read the whitty and baird report rather than simply seek to divest all property in the nhs for as much as property services can get seaton hospital be transfer to nhs property services in the purpose of property services at that time be to centralise the holding of various strategic health authority and primary care trust under one umbrella organisation the aim be to remove the burden from local nhs organisation and offer great financial security by hold all those property centrally it be intend to provide well management of these important space so as to ensure value for money and quality facility use economy of scale and of scope fast forward to and it be clear that the model be break rather than ensure that our local health service get the space they need we seem to be make perverse false economy the government give money to integrate care board only to have government own nhs property services recoup large portion of that money in rental fee for the building that icb use at rent set and advise by market rent auditor this offer very little flexibility or security for our local nhs service which as in the case of seaton community hospital be leave in scenario in which the icb be force to cut service while still be lumber with bill for the space those service use to occupy we lose the clinical bed we have at seaton hospital in and the space have since remain vacant the only way to remove this item from the budget line be to turn over the space to nhs property services which become liable for the amount charge in rent as hon member can see this system be not only complex but incredibly backwards the government be effectively rent these building from themselves despite the fact that many be previously directly own by local health body they be not even rent out at fair price despite the state commitment to achieve fair market rate these facility be rent out as clinical space even when they be not use for clinical purpose this be base on an evaluation that must have be completely off the scale when it be make in seaton hospital be evaluate by the assessor montagu evans and do not know who it could possibly have talk to if it think that seaton hospital be worth rent year why we might ask be the rent not adjust to reflect the building current status so far as can gather it be because the government rental framework do not allow it it place huge roadblock in the way of community group and hospital friend organisation that seek to convert such space into new setting aim at provide non clinical service of the sort to which sir chris whitty and beccy baird be refer instead the system seem analogous to self lick lollipop or dog blindly chase its evasive tail without ever stop to think why it can not catch it during my many conversation with nhs property services in recent month individual employee have seek to be helpful however they find themselves handcuff by government policy they be unable to deviate from the government framework which through the consolidated charge policy first introduce in set the rate that icb and now community organisation need to pay the rate be introduce when the right hon member for south west surrey jeremy hunt who be now chancellor of the exchequer be health secretary in effect the government own all nhs facility and have the power to direct the arrangement under which they be rent out include the wing of seaton community hospital that be fund in whole by local villager townspeople and the seaton and district hospital league of friends charity what on paper might seem like prudent way to manage nhs facility and to make sure that they be properly maintain mean in reality that in place like seaton the community no long have stake or say in how its local hospital be use that beg the question who be in charge the answer should be the secretary of state and ministers report to she but give her department attempt to point the finger at this operational body and to divest itself of responsibility it seem that nobody be in charge people be point in several direction and can not identify exactly who be set the market rate simply put the government have let go of the wheel and be content to let the car spin out of control so that they do not have to take responsibility that be not good enough our nhs be the envy of the world and one of our country great achievement when the great liberal thinker william beveridge conceive of service that be free at the point of use all those year ago it be revolutionary and re shape the way in which modern democracy have approach public health we can not allow it to be erode because of the unwillingness of the government to face up to the challenge the mark of leadership be honesty and accountability would like to see that from ministers rather than the government say this be an operational matter for nhs property services not would much rather someone from this conservative government admit that they know what the so call market rent be why it be charge at that rate and why the community must pay if it want to use that space well still that community should be give concessionary rate in recognition that clinical activity be not go on in that wing of the building at this stage the community ought to be able to hire the space for much more affordable rent have three question for the minister first be the department for health and social care responsible for set the amount that nhs property services charge local nhs service such as icb to rent the space secondly could the consolidated charge policy which understand set out those price be change by the secretary of state or ministers thirdly if the answer to those question be yes why have be tell repeatedly that ministers can not so they say get involve in operational matter relate to nhs property services many icb be struggle to balance the book nhs devon be no different in that respect and be seek to downsize the space that they rent to make end meet this situation be not specific to seaton although think it be good case study because of the way in which local people buy brick and build the hospital themselves with many small donation the situation face our local community hospital strike as an illustration of why change be need have be campaign with the seaton and district hospital league of friends charity which support seaton hospital to change the charge policy so that nhs property services can have flexibility on rental fee want the company to enable underused space in nhs facility to be rent out to local community group that want to invest in preventive health and community wellbee and that want to fulfil some of the vision that sir chris write about in his annual report last october ultimately would like an affordable concessionary rate to be offer to seaton and district hospital league of friends and the work group that work with they that would be of benefit to rural and coastal community such as seaton we need to know how to ensure accountability for the current arrangement and hope that there can be concession for local community such as the one that represent in the axe valley look forward to the minister response to my question and hope that he be willing to engage with to enact meaningful change that will benefit community and constituent such as those in my tiverton and honiton constituency congratulate the hon member for tiverton and honiton richard foord on secure the debate be grateful for the opportunity to set out the role of nhs property services this subject be understandably of great interest to right hon and hon member across the house the hon gentleman raise the issue of the future of seaton community hospital will come to that in the latter part of my speech but let say for the record that completely understand his desire to protect much love community health facility as the member of parliament for pendle successfully fight to keep open pendle community hospital in nelson and in the neighbouring constituency of ribble valley the new million clitheroe community hospital open in may so recognise the importance of community hospital not just in offer in patient care but in act as hub for other healthcare service it will be most useful for to first set out to the house why and how nhs property services come into being under the health and social care act the coalition government abolish primary care trust and transfer their commission responsibility to clinical commission group their property interest transfer to either nhs trust or nhs property services which be establish in for this purpose that decision be make because it allow commissioner to focus on provide care for patient rather than manage property nhs property services take ownership of nearly local facility such as community hospital health centre gp surgery and care home in the past year nhs property services have reduce the size of that estate by fifth save over half billion pound of taxpayer money every penny of which have be reinveste into the nhs understand the minister point about reinveste the proceed from sell what might have be regard as excess nhs property but my concern relate to where that money go my understanding be that follow sale half the money might go back to the integrate care board which would be devon in this case the problem with that situation be that it do not take account of the fact that local community donate the money to build the infrastructure in the first place that be certainly the case in the axe valley with seaton community hospital appreciate the hon gentleman concern hope to provide reassurance in the latter part of my speech that the sale of seaton community hospital be certainly not on the card and be exceptionally unlikely however appreciate that when property be sell there be always tension between how much of that money will be reinveste in local community many of which have stake in have create the facility in the first place and how much go into the general nhs pot the important point for to land today be that all the money remain within the health service and none return to the treasury so any sale of property from this portfolio be not way for the government to generate income but simply way of ensure that the property estate be manage in the most effective fashion nhs property services be establish as limited company and be lead by board of executive and non executive director who be appoint for their property and healthcare expertise include departmental shareholder representative the board director all have the usual responsibility relate to the proper governance of limited company with certain shareholder matter reserve such as share issue or senior appointment the board must work within the wide framework across government such as the treasury guidance on manage public money which rightly set out the strict rule for deliver value for taxpayer money the company therefore work with the department to agree fiscal target to work within and be rightly hold accountable for its use of public money however it be important to emphasise that my department be not responsible for operational decision which be take by the board and its executive management team one reason for the creation of nhs property services be to ensure that decision could be take without political interference although appreciate that the hon member and other across the house may be of the view that my noble friend lord markham who have ministerial responsibility for nhs property services can intervene to reduce the rent for unoccupied space at seaton community hospital or similar facility across the country it would simply not be appropriate for he or any other minister to intervene in any individual case the coalition government establish nhs property services through the cost recovery principle which be the broad framework that the organisation work under this mean that it be fund through charge its cost to the occupier of its building and the recipient of its service as such every pound it spend and do not recover be pound that can not be spend on deliver frontline care the devon property be transfer to nhs property services on the basis that their ongoing running cost would be fund through rent at market rate and service charge this approach be take to give real incentive to local commissioner to take the tough decision on which property be most suitable for deliver their clinical strategy look at area as whole and move away from situation whereby subside property cost could lead to less effective approach accept that that can sometimes lead to tension about how reasonable charge be set but the aim be that nhs body and other voluntary and charitable organisation that wish to occupy nhs premise must factor in the full cost of occupy and maintain specialist facility in their decision making will now turn to the future of community hospital in devon include seaton community hospital as the hon gentleman set out in his adjournment debate in november seaton hospital be part of group of community hospital that transfer to nhs property services in when large part of seaton hospital and other in devon be already vacant the clinical commissioning group carry out consultation on the model of community care and new model of care be introduce make it more integrated and more community base with more people receive care at home that result in significant reduction in the number of community hospital bed require across devon since then progress have be make to identify sustainable alternative healthcare use for vacant space in community hospital in devon such as ottery st mary and axminster in addition nhs property services and devon icb have work with the voluntary sector to support local initiative in some property such as as the hon gentleman will know the waffle café at seaton hospital understand that seaton hospital and some other hospital still have significant amount of vacant space despite their good effort nhs property services commissioner have be unable to identify relevant service that could fill this gap nhs property services have continue to manage the property with the cost of the vacant space be charge to the icb to ensure the cost attribute to the property be fully recover but recently the financial challenge face devon icb have call the sustainability of that position into question and it have explore option for alleviate those cost however as explain simply seek to pass those cost back to nhs property services would not result in the department have any more money to spend on local healthcare service in devon as be sure the hon gentleman will appreciate the responsibility for decision about where to locate clinical service in devon be matter for the icb it be not matter for ministers however nhs property services be work closely with local leader to identify option that would help to mitigate the cost pressure arise due to seaton community hospital not operate at full capacity if and only if the icb determine the property be wholly surplus to its requirement nhs property services would have the responsibility for sell the asset follow treasury guideline but it be important to stress that the site remain an operational site and nhs property services therefore have no plan to sell it as have be mention in the local medium the idea of partial demolition of the hospital have be float again there be no plan for that course of action which would very much be last resort in any event believe the site have now be list as an asset of community value which mean that such drastic step be exceedingly unlikely to be support by the local planning authority or other local stakeholder it be true that the property have be register as an asset of community value to my mind that give it stay of execution rather than that it be inevitable that it will be preserve intact nhs property services talk through the very many option think option on the table for the vacant space at seaton hospital one of that long list of option be indeed sell off the redundant ward which could be demolish and use for house do the minister not know that know the idea of demolition have be float in meeting but have be assure that there be certainly no plan for demolition as the hon gentleman will know an asset of community value nomination be accept by the local authority and as an acv nomination remain live for five year it will expire in january although be pretty sure that local community group and other would campaign for that to be extend it be certainly much more than stay of execution hope that have provide suitable reassurance to the local community that the threat of demolition be exceedingly remote because the local planning authority and other local stakeholder simply would not agree to the demolition of this much value community asset fully recognise that the local community have invest in the building of the hospital in the first place and therefore be key stakeholder in its future the icb and nhs property services continue in ongoing dialogue with range of community group about potential future us and the community have be invite by the icb to develop business case for the future use of the property by the end of june any future decision on the future of seaton hospital will be take follow evaluation of that business case sincerely hope that financially sustainable solution can be find locally and in the good interest of the people of devon question put and agree to house adjourn
