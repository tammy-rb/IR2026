business bank which will make it lot easy for business to access the finance they need to start up and scale up as many hospitality business continue to point out the significant crime and antisocial behaviour in town centre the extra police officer that we have recruit and our commitment to recruit still more will make it easy to bear down on shoplifting and other antisocial behaviour labour lead west suffolk district council now charge cafés and restaurant for pavement licence for table and chair in front of their premise their justification for the cost be that the process for grant pavement licence be more complex than it may initially appear as it involve number of check with highway authority the police and counter terrorism adviser will the minister look at pavement licence as an example of where we can deregulate the hon gentleman make an interesting point about what further measure we can take to bear down on the cost of regulation for small business it be one reason the chancellor set up licensing taskforce that have bring forward series of recommendation and will shortly publish its conclusion which the government will respond to quickly we be absolutely determined to do what we can to bear down on the cost of regulation for sme refer the house to my registered interest as small business owner retailer in my constituency include city centre retailer tell that

across the country call the shadow minister at the heart of every high street be wonderful hospitality sme pub cafés restaurant bar and coffee shop yet the budget be hammer blow to they with billion of extra cost one in restaurant face closure this year indeed labour budget have already cost hospitality job for context in the same period the previous year hospitality create new job can the minister assure the house that business that be hang on by thread will not face hard landing this winter the hon gentleman be one of those conservative front benchers who have yet to tell we if they do not like the increase in national insurance contribution how they would pay for the extra investment in hospital school and our police force gently say that the difficult decision the chancellor of the exchequer have to take in the budget last year be direct result of the billion black hole leave to we by the conservatives our small business strategy will set out further measure that we will take to have the back of british entrepreneur that answer be simply not good enough for the of employee in the hospitality sector whose job be on the line yet we now read in the press that the government appear set on force restaurateur to monitor customer calorie consumption another crippling blow of red tape on top of national insurance hike minimum wage hike and the regulatory firestorm of the employment rights bill jeremy clarkson be not wrong when he say that the chancellor be use machine gun on publican can the minister really look hospitality sme on our high street and beyond in the eye and say that this be somehow good for business one reason the hon gentleman party lose the confidence of business be that it promise many many time that it would reform business rate and never do the chancellor of the exchequer have set out our commitment to permanently low business rate for the hospitality sector we have already take step in that regard and she will set out our plan to do even more that be one way in which we be back up our commitment to sme in the hospitality sector and more generally capital and export finance sme what step his department be take to ensure that sme in buckingham and bletchley constituency can access capital and export finance as part of the uk recent trade agreement on june the department publish our trade strategy announce the expansion of uk export finance capacity to billion we also announce measure to give small firm include those in buckingham and bletchley well access to export protection insurance the significant increase in the capacity of the british business bank will also help to improve access to capital for sme include potentially in my hon friend constituency innovative high growth company such as envisics in bletchley

other incentive for they to relocate will the minister set out in more detail how his department be work across whitehall to ensure that domestic financial institution include government back entity be help company like envisic to firmly anchor their innovation here in the uk we hear during our sme consultation that one of the big issue face small and medium sized business that want to scale up relate to access to finance indeed since the stock of bank lending to sme relative to gdp have fall by around which graphically demonstrate the significance of my hon friend point we have be work closely with treasury colleague in particular and when we launch the industrial strategy we also launch funding arrangement for the british business bank that will provide billion of capital to our high growth innovative business to ensure that they remain anchored in the uk and be able to scale up here industrial strategy cornwall what assessment he have make of the potential impact of the

resource and enhance international collaboration as the secretary of state mention with its vast renewable energy and critical mineral resource cornwall be uniquely position to become key driver of uk

immense industrial potential must not be overlook and can he reassure that unleash the cornish celtic tiger with the economic investment that we need be not contingent on join mayoral combine authority can give my hon friend that assurance be dismay this morning to wake up and hear the reform party actively argue for less investment in britain and tell business they should not invest in the uk find that absolutely absurd there be whole range of tool for local area to shape their economy in the industrial strategy some relate to mayor but many do not it have the mix of tool that be require to unleash the potential of every part of the country include his own far to that very encouraging response from the secretary of state do he acknowledge that cornwall be the poor region in the united kingdom it have great opportunity as the hon member for camborne and redruth perran moon point out but it have be hamper since lose the high level of eu structural aid if we be go to take the opportunity and overcome the challenge that cornwall face would the secretary of state be prepared to meet the hon member for camborne and redruth and other cornish members to establish bespoke strategy for cornwall to drive the private and public investment need first let say that as someone who use to spend their family holiday in cornwall must protest have have two question from cornish colleague and not single invite to visit cornwall over the summer holiday really think that be unacceptable the economic history of cornwall be particularly interesting have have this discussion with my hon friend the member for camborne and redruth perran moon and recognise some of the specific issue that the hon member for st ives andrew george have identify there of course be always willing to meet he either in cornwall or here in parliament to have that discussion believe there be key part of the industrial strategy that will deliver the opportunity and the tool require to unleash what

only bababing but many other sme across the country due to the decision they make in the budget last year to increase employer national insurance and the minimum wage and the employment rights bill which be come down the line do the government recognise that they be stifle growth and if so what be they do about it welcome the establishment of bababing in the hon member constituency recognise that difficult decision have to be take in the budget be sure he have point out to the owner of bababing that those difficult decision be take as direct result of the billion black hole that his party

scottish town centre very much sympathise with my hon friend frustration about what both the snp and the conservatives have do to free parking in his constituency sympathise because the tory run council in my constituency have take similar step to curtail free parking which have undoubtedly have an impact on the town centre hope that the concern my hon friend have articulate today will be hear loud and clear in his constituency and that action will be take our sme strategy will set out range of step that we be determined to take to back small business and help entrepreneur across britain call the liberal democrat spokesperson the value that hospitality business bring to their local community go far beyond their economic contribution they also provide vital social value and essential entry level job flexible hour and condition in the sector help those with other responsibility such as carer and new parent to access work while also offer many young people their first job

include an election bill that will be introduce in due course through this strategy we will usher in new chapter in our democracy that reflect our principle and restore faith in our politic look forward to work with colleague from across the house on this very important agenda call the shadow minister yesterday the department give notice of write ministerial statement on the government new strategy for election which be significant policy document on change to election law and political finance law something that affect we all in this house instead of the minister use this democratic chamber to announce new and wide range strategy on democracy the government choose to announce it to the press in monday no lobby briefing typical government by press release in fact it have just be announce on bbc news there will be no opportunity for parliamentary scrutiny until september due to the pende recess why do the minister not choose to come to the house to announce this policy despite we have be give word through write ministerial statement that the government would do so why do she not think it right to come here of her own accord to announce it why have there be no consultation of political party to date this be contrary to the approach of the last government who actively consult on change this strategy have finally reveal the government ambition to allow year old to vote in an election but not to stand in it probably because young people be abandon the labour party in drove why do they think year old should be able vote but not be allow to buy lottery ticket or an alcoholic drink marry go to war or even stand in the election they be vote in be not the government position on the age of majority just hopelessly confused do the minister agree that while foreign donation be already illegal and should remain so step should be take to tighten the law to prevent donation from those who be not properly on the electoral roll include the funnelling of money from impermissible source we welcome the turn on not scrap voter id but will use bank card not undermine the security of the ballot box and what security measure will she bring in now that automatic registration have be announce finally what step will the minister take to tackle the important issue of intimidation in public life will the government still abide by the long stand convention that the government of the day do not unilaterally impose measure directly affect political party without proper engagement and discussion and will they stop announce constitutional policy by press release this government be elect on manifesto that commit we to grant year old the right to vote and protect our democracy from foreign money remind the hon gentleman that his party lose the general election in the bad general election defeat for decade so it be no wonder that the conservatives be scared of the electorate the truth be that young people deserve to have stake and have say in the future of our democracy young people can vote for any party they like and it speak volume that he would prefer they to be silence remind the house that the hon gentleman party sit in government for year and do nothing to close the gap loophole allow foreign interference and foreign money to enter our system despite independent expert call for change the intelligence and security committee russia report expose malign effort to channel foreign money into uk politic both the committee on standards in public life and the electoral commission have call for strengthened regulation and great transparency in political donation alongside modernise enforcement we make no apology for finally take the tough choice and protect britain democracy from malign foreign interference the real question for the hon gentleman be whether the conservatives will finally end their addiction to donation from shell company under the new law they will not have choice and we will not stop there because they will finally have to update their weak due diligence check and conduct enhance check we will give the electoral commission the power to administer hefty fine of up to maximum of to deter bad behaviour instead of point the finger the hon gentleman should be welcome these change and take the opportunity to finally clean up his party we have publish the election strategy and we have lay write statement have respond in the public administration and constitutional affairs committee and the speaker committee on the electoral commission will continue to engage with parliamentary colleague in the come day over the summer recess and in the autumn we want to make series of change and be determined to make sure we get as much cross party agreement as possible look forward to work with the hon gentleman because believe that there be common ground on range of issue he know all too well the harassment and intimidation and threat to our life that many of we have face it be really important that we work on these agenda together on move towards automated voter registration which the hon gentleman mention we will carefully consider how we implement those change to ensure they be do safely and look forward to work with colleague on that we have retain the voter id change make under the previous government but we recognise that certain group of legitimate voter particularly disabled voter be exclude we need to address that gap and know his party recognise that challenge so we will ensure that we do not exclude legitimate voter look forward to work with he on issue of common interest and agreement call the chair of the housing communities and local government committee thank the minister for the write statement and for her work behind the scene we should welcome the opportunity for more people to be enfranchise we should be very clear that one person lose the right to vote at the ballot box be one person too many it be really important that we look at the issue around voter id and ensure more opportunity for people to have other form of voter id at the ballot box it be important that we enfranchise our young people to vote they participate in public life already so they should also be entitle to vote it be really important to have system where it be easy to be register to vote when you move home before you have even unpack you get council tax bill the council already have your detail so it be good that we be look at system to ensure people be register to vote for far too long we have knock on door and people have say that they be interested but not register to vote so that be vital on ensure candidate still feel safe this be big challenge and threat to democracy will my hon friend outline what work she will be do with the electoral commission on the intimidation and abuse face by candidate order we do need question and answer to be short thank my hon friend for her question she do important work in her committee the change we be introduce will ensure that elect representative candidate campaigner and electoral staff who play unique role in our democracy be properly protect we will give court the power to increase sentence for those who be hostile to candidate an aggravate factor for intimidatory offence will be introduce allow court to pass tough sentence we will also remove the requirement to publish candidate address we will consult with the crown prosecution service the sentencing council and other judicial body call the liberal democrat spokesperson we be very pleased that the government have publish the strategy many aspect of which have the support of the liberal democrats we have for many year champion vote at and we be really glad that the government have listen to those call we also welcome the measure to tackle dark and illicit money in our politic and the recent plan to introduce supplementary voting for mayoral election however be concerned that the strategy show nowhere near the kind of ambition that we need to fix system of election that have leave large swathe of the public feeling like their vote simply do not count as member across the house will know last year general election turn out the most disproportionate result in history with nearly of people who vote not represent in parliament by the candidate they vote for this opportunity can not be waste will the government go far will they look at scrap voter id in its entirety will they look at introduce further measure to ensure that foreign oligarch such as elon musk be not able to interfere in british politic include through party funding and will they finally scrap first past the post and introduce fair vote via proportional representation the hon lady have lot of question the government have no plan to change the electoral system for uk parliamentary and local election her party in the coalition government have the opportunity through referendum to campaign and institute the appropriate change our focus be on ensure we address the manifesto commitment we make include voting age of be grateful to she and her party for their support we be also take action to tackle illicit finance and foreign interference very much hope that she and her colleague will work with we on that very important agenda declare an interest as member of the speaker conference which be look at the security of mps candidate and election do my hon friend agree that wide number of behaviour in our democratic system be intimidate candidate and indeed member of this house and that that be detrimental to our value and democracy will she expand on the measure in the strategy that will seek to alleviate those very serious problem thank my hon friend for his question in the year have be member of parliament we have see rise in hatred and hostility towards candidate and elect official and have sadly face the loss of our dear colleague jo cox and sir david amess this government be determined to ensure that elect representative candidate and election official be protect because this trend be have devastating chilling effect on our democracy we need to work together to protect our democracy while protect freedom of speech would be happy to speak to my hon friend on the specific proposal as we proceed with their implementation thank the minister for her statement but have not hear she say anything about the work of the boundary commission for local government and constituency think they should form part of this discussion particularly to ensure that constituency can be make up of genuine community by get rid of the pointless rule that constituency can not go beyond certain region area of essex near my constituency for instance can not be include within romford which only go into london similarly local council ward would surely be well if they be one member ward whereby they could be like mini constituency look after particular community would that not be well way forward and would the minister consider it as part of the review the hon gentleman will understand the process and work of the boundary commission this strategy be focus on the theme that speak to early and that be what we will be focus on as the chair of the all party parliamentary group for fair election warmly welcome this policy paper think my hon friend the minister and be much more poorly equip to vote when we be than today year old so warmly welcome that measure also welcome the english devolution and community empowerment bill introduce last week with the government say that first past the post can lead to individual be elect with only small proportion of the total vote cast and that mayors and police and crime commissioner should be elect with great consensus among their elector the government have also claim that this change will give the local electorate an increase voice and will well support the democratic mandate of people elect to such position give the flawed nature of first past the post will the minister consider also review the system for election to this place be grateful to my hon friend for his work with the appg he be aware of the policy of the labour party and this government on first past the post refer he to my previous answer on that question fair election must be election that we can all trust the most important element of our electoral system be that it be secret ballot and that it should be down to the individual to make up their own mind be therefore deeply concerned that the widespread use of postal voting across the country be allow dangerous fraud with many voter still intimidate and coerce into use postal vote on the instruction of somebody else the review cover many practical aspect of postal voting but what step be the government take to ensure the accuracy and honesty of the postal voting system the hon gentleman will be aware that his party introduce series of change include on voter id and other check as elector register to vote be all too aware of the area that need particular focus we have retain the protection on postal voting the hon gentleman be aware of number of issue around postal vote but reassure he that there be law to ensure that forgery and personation do not happen we will retain the appropriate check and safeguard that be introduce in the past may put on record my profound thank to the minister for her personal commitment to ensure that we renew confidence in democracy warmly welcome proposal around move away from the first past the post system in regional election and restore that part of our democracy will she outline how she will tackle the illicit finance that be flow into our democracy have real concern about how foreign influence damage our democracy and would be grateful for more information on how this strategy will deliver for our country be grateful to my hon friend for her work in this area as mention the intelligence and security committee russia report expose malign effort to channel foreign money into our politic we be ensure that the electoral commission will have the appropriate power to support political party make sure that they do know your donor check where party fail in this area fine of up to can be apply we will apply that fine proportionately in recognition of the resource issue of small party very much welcome what be in the government policy particularly vote for and year old we already have this in scotland for the scottish parliamentary election and have also campaign for the change to be make for general election will the minister confirm that this will be in place in time for the next general election and how the information will be pass out to and year old that they will now be able to vote in general election thank the hon lady for her support we be look very closely at the work in scotland and wales we want to make sure that we take the time to implement the appropriate change in time for the next general election but we will work with the relevant institution include the electoral commission education establishment the department for education charity youth organisation and other interested body to make sure that we get this right welcome the measure to take out dark money from our politic but they will mean nothing unless we move forward aggressively to ban cryptocurrency donation in british politic they be use for money laundering and to disguise dark money they have no role in british politic will the minister confirm that the election bill will ban cryptocurrency donation be grateful to my right hon friend for his work in this area through his committee and for raise these issue there be already number of rule in place on political donation and they must be abide by regardless of the type of donation make include cryptocurrency donation our reform of political finance to far strengthen our democracy will also apply to all donation include those in cryptocurrency democracy be fragile and here in the united kingdom our democracy be strongly in the crosshair of nefarious state include russia and china which do not share our value we be see increase activity online particularly to distort the outcome of election via platform include tiktok which have link to communist regime in china can the minister update the house on what step be be take in particular to protect our democracy from misinformation that vehemently seek to distort the outcome of election thank the hon gentleman for that important question he will be aware that the defend democracy taskforce be lead the work on range of issue include of course in relation to the point that he have make we be take action to bear down on those issue with cross government approach the online safety act be important in relation to some of the point that he have make as have point out we be also aware of the danger of foreign interference and foreign state actor and these reform be really important to protect the integrity of our system and our democracy as member of the speaker conference have hear evidence that have shock to my core so know how much need these reform be this week have hold my first summer school with and year old this week twenty of they have be learn about how they can make change not only in their community but in the country they live in do the minister agree that they deserve to have their voice hear at the ballot box too thank my hon friend for her work to support young people to participate in our democracy young people can work at pay taxis and join the army there be no reason that they should not have the right to say in who represent they and the right to shape their future they be passionate about the issue affect their community and country know that at first hand from the work have do over the year to support young people in their leadership journey and in participate in our election the snp welcome that the uk government be catch up to scotland where we have have vote for year old for the last nine year however it be clear that real change also require look at this parliament electoral system recent poll have show that the lead party currently would win majority of seat in the next election on less than of the vote be it not long overdue that this government reform the uk parliament break electoral system and introduce proportional representation as welsh labour be do in the senedd refer the hon gentleman to my previous answer the government have no plan to change the electoral system for uk parliamentary or local election welcome this announcement and can only speculate about why the conservatives do not decide to clean up party funding when they be in government want to echo some of the comment about proportional representation personally feel that it be at the heart of many of the problem the country have face in recent time absolutely accept that proportional representation be not part of the government proposal but will the minister keep an open mind and look at how other strong democracy around the world have be able to use pr to both strengthen their democracy and create more collaborative political culture refer my hon friend to my previous answer on the labour party position the government have no plan to change the electoral system he be of course right that we should always learn from international experience we be certainly do that on range of different agenda include some of the theme of this strategy and we will continue to do so the prime minister have previously talk about extend the franchise to include additional foreign national will the government take this opportunity to rule out ever extend the franchise to foreign national beyond exist rule the focus of this strategy be on eligible voter in this country the minister will be aware that the joint committee on the national security strategy which chair have be do lot of work on defend democracy be sure we will welcome the proposal particularly on illicit finance and crack down on unincorporated association gently urge she to look closely at cryptocurrencie which be clearly the currency of choice for criminal and rogue state for example one individual have rout million into political organisation in this country through such currency my hon friend be right to be concern about new challenge in relation to crypto and refer he to my previous answer on this point we will look very closely at these issue to make sure that loophole be closed but reassure he that the current power cover donation through crypto and the change we be make will also include crypto there be lot in the strategy that the liberal democrats and welcome could the minister explain why there be difference between westminster election and combine mayoral election we know that the majority of the british public want to see the scrapping of first past the post and we know from when we have ten minute rule bill on this subject during this parliament that the majority of member in this place want to see the scrapping of first past the post indeed we know that majority of labour members want to see the scrapping of first past the post so why be there difference between the different type of election the hon member may have critique of the first past the post system but it provide direct relationship between member of the legislature and local constituency which be really important the liberal democrats in coalition with the conservatives for five year have the opportunity to introduce referendum but they lose that referendum the supplementary voting system be implement on the introduction of both mayoral and police and crime commissioner election we believe that it be more appropriate for select single person executive declare former interest as lawyer specialise in election law can say from that previous life that the previous tory government leave our election law in an unfair and dangerous state unfair in that they make it hard for people to vote and dangerous in that they do nothing to prevent foreign actor from spend million of pound rouble or dollar to interfere with our democracy do the minister agree that it be high time to take robust action to make our democracy safe and fair for everyone and will she assure the house that this will be speedy and fair process look forward to use the expertise of colleague not only in my party but in other so that we get this right it be in all our interest to close the loophole that be so dangerous and damaging for our democracy there be much to welcome in these proposal to enhance our democracy particularly on the safety of candidate reform be very much against vote for and year old who it be interesting to note be completely split down the middle on this issue however urge the minister to consider our grave concern with particular regard to postal voting its security and the risk of personation have see people carry bag load of postal vote to polling station on election day surely that be completely wrong reassure the hon gentleman that we take those issue very seriously personate another voter be deliberate act of fraud it completely undermine our democracy and be serious criminal offence that will continue to be prosecute if he have example he should report they to the police for year young people in my constituency be frustrate by politician who simply do not listen to their concern on affordable housing on the climate crisis or on good local job do the minister agree that listen to young people and engage they in the process be key first step in rebuild some of the damage do to our democracy over the year of incompetence we see from the tories my hon friend make powerful case for give young people from the age of the right to vote and participate in our democracy young people be the future and it be vital that we all work together to ensure that they learn about and can participate in our political system and our democracy that be how we will ensure that our democracy be appreciate and that its value and influence both in this country and globally be share by the next generation the conservative government seemingly try to do everything possible to destroy trust in politic and to make it hard for people to vote in my constituency that lead to just turnout at the last election will the minister set out more about how the announcement will make it easy for people to engage in our democracy and how the government will give the next generation say in the future of our country through give vote at it be crucial that we engage elector both young elector and the million who be not register to vote we will do careful work to move towards automate voter registration and to ensure that it be success it be about make sure that every citizen who be eligible to vote register and be able to vote previous parliamentary inquiry into the funding of northern ireland political party express concern about the lack of visibility on how cross border party the like of sinn féin manage their fundraising and the difficulty for regulator in verify that no republic of ireland or indeed us base fund be use in uk election it recommend strong audit requirement and clear separation of cross jurisdictional finance will the minister assure that these measure will apply equally across all part of the united kingdom and that regulator outside the united kingdom will work together to ensure that we do not have those cross jurisdictional money can reassure the hon gentleman that we be work through the interministerial group which include the relevant northern ireland minister to ensure that we introduce change that be consistent with the good friday agreement and that recognise specific issue affect different part of the united kingdom would be very happy to discuss our proposal far with he in scotland where we have vote for and year old in council and scottish parliament election have find that some of the most engaging respectful and search question have come from those in that age group whereas in general election or year old response be often go and see if my mum or dad be in or occasionally my dad tell to tell you that he not in give how

extra work risk an extra tax bill of thousand of pound when raise this in april the minister retort that could have ask about the impact on service of cancel the strike well will do so now as the strike be back on it will be the senior doctor who have to pick up the slack the very doctor who be avoid extra shift for fear of the tax if they will not take on the extra work for fear of the heavy tax burden we have huge problem this should be priority for the government especially as we plan for winter pressure what will the minister do to remedy the situation with rss what will she do regard rpss minister can not just announce new deadline and then miss they so would she be kind enough to publish delivery plan finally she say that the government have faith in the nhs business services authority be that still the case will she demand that the pensions regulator step up and expedite its investigation give that the referral be make in december in the end doctor be count on she and so be their patient as outline in my initial response and far to the write ministerial statement we have ask for an independent review of the process and will report back as soon as possible with realistic deadline for that with regard to the strike we will continue to be open to discuss the avoidance of those strike and hope that the opposition will support we in that give that the summer recess be imminent will the minister use this opportunity to update the house on the number of additional appointment and more importantly the number by which the nhs waiting list have fall under this government do she agree that it would be very nice if the conservative party address the crisis in which they leave our nhs it be mess that this labour government be proud to be clear up thank my hon friend who be superb advocate for his constituent meet he again yesterday as he advocate for service in his constituency that be the focus of labour members he be absolutely right as say in my statement this be part of the overall mess that we inherit from the conservatives as say in my previous response on this issue the problem outline by lord darzi be wide and deep it be still shocking after year in government to be face with the level of disaster that be leave to we after complete abdication of responsibility for sort out the problem we will continue to focus on get more of the appointment that people so need and on reduce waiting list which be what our constituent expect call the liberal democrat spokesperson thank the minister for come to the house to answer this urgent question these administrative delay be deeply worrying they make financial planning for those affect very difficult and more importantly stop doctor take on additional work for the nhs as they could face large and unknown tax penalty that be highlight at the start of the year when nhs staff miss out on pension tax compensation after administrative failing this be have direct impact on patient care so how will the minister reassure nhs staff regard their pension entitlement and when can they expect to see the compensation the minister mention to encourage they back into the workforce can she assure the house that the government be take step to prevent doctor with miss pension record from be unfairly penalise can she tell we how the government will address the year of miss pension datum for gps finally will the major reorganisation of the nhs especially the cut to the organisation that oversee local health service potentially compound this problem thank the hon lady for those question she highlight number of important issue regard the complexity for the nhs business services authority of deal with this there be large number of high earner in this scheme with regard to tax liability that make the system complex as do the movement of doctor throughout the system in their career one issue discuss with the independent reviewer yesterday be the need to ensure there be technical look at solution to issue such as missing year the hon lady be right to highlight that change make difference to follow people career through the system there be wide lesson which have already start to discuss with the reviewer about how we make the good use of technology so that we can track people through their career and give confidence to the current workforce that we be address this not just for the cohort who have immediate issue but for the future that be the sort of action this government be take we do not do stick plaster we be look at this very seriously declare an interest as trustee of the parliamentary contributory pension fund many people in the public sector receive significant pension contribution but they be not aware of its value the pension schemes bill currently go through parliament present an opportunity to place on someone pay cheque and pay offer the annual value of that incredibly important contribution to public sector pension fund that be something that very few people in the private sector be now able to enjoy and it feel like it be undervalue by those who benefit from it will she consider take that opportunity thank the hon lady for that really constructive suggestion in my discussion with the nhsbsa the reviewer and official at the department have raise similar issue be member of the nhs pension scheme and the parliamentary pension scheme tell my young people that this be really valuable asset and encourage my constituent who be look for job in the nhs to consider the pension scheme because people sometimes do not look at it immediately we should look at way to encourage people to take part in the pension scheme particularly for low earner it be really valuable and stable contribution and the value of it from the public purse should be well know be not across the detail of the hon lady point on the pension schemes bill but will talk with my colleague across government about how we can look to do that and come back to she because agree that it be really valuable thing it reward the contribution of public service and we should make the most of it would like to take this opportunity to put my thank on the record to the minister have speak to she outside this place about the money we have secure for remove reinforce autoclaved aerate concrete at harrogate district hospital which have be campaign on for year it be great have state of the art hospital facility but if we do not have the staff there it be all bit moot want to press the minister on the concern raise by colleague that people might not come back or take on additional hour in the nhs as result of this issue will she commit to update member throughout the recess on progress on this matter congratulate the hon gentleman on yet again shoehorn in reference to his local hospital for which he do great job people be determined to work in and support the national health service we take remedy confidence in pension seriously will not

forward to work in the nhs be matter of choice for individual and we particularly want to work with consultant to ensure that their career progression be the good it can be we very much value their work in the service with the british medical association set to strike and with the health secretary reduce to plead with it not to thousand of patient be set to have their appointment cancel can the minister assure the house that she will grip this issue so that senior doctor do not also reduce their hour and will she rule out bonus for nhs business services authority executive we be work very closely to ensure that resident doctor do not go on strike we be very clear that we can not negotiate on pay this year but we will work with everybody to improve condition some of those condition be shocking and we want to work constructively with they to avoid disruptive strike action the daily telegraph report in april that quarter of doctor have reduce their overtime to avoid potential five figure tax bill and nhs capacity have be reduce by about as result this have be raise many time when have be out and about door knock across keighley and ilkley what step will the government take to rectify this absurd situation which be prevent doctor from work more to reduce waiting list the hon gentleman highlight yet another mess that we inherit due to his party lack of proper engagement with the workforce over the last decade to resolve the disincentive to make the system work more effectively make the system work more efficiently and more effectively be key part of our year plan announce

that everyone want to pull together to ensure that the incentive be right for staff at all level over million of they to make the nhs fit for the future and that be what we be focus on the minister know that have keen interest in nhs reorganisation and the impact on frontline service particularly in mid bedfordshire give the failure of nhsbsa have consideration be give to reorganise that authority also repeat the question ask by my hon friend the member for north west norfolk james wild give the failure will the minister rule out bonus for the nhsbsa leadership be totally focused on remedy this situation and learn from the mistake if further action be require will happily update the house at that point my absolute focus at the moment be on get everybody in that organisation and the independent review focus on sort out the pension situation for those who have already lose out as always thank the minister very much for her answer recently read an article that refer to the mechanism of the nhs pension scheme as ponzi scheme which give great concern about the scheme ability to cope in year time how do the government and the minister intend to convert the transitional arrangement in place since of top up pension from another source into permanent and transparent arrangement so that we can stop rob peter to pay paul and ensure that those who be work hour week in have real pension and retirement fund in the hon gentleman tempt to stray far from the urgent question but he raise an important point far to the one raise by the hon member for west worcestershire dame harriett baldwin who be trustee of the parliamentary contributory pension fund the nhs pension scheme be an extremely important part of the reward package that nhs staff at all level absolutely deserve we want to ensure that it like the rest of the nhs be fit for the future if hon member have suggestion for how to make it work well as part of ongoing discussion be happy to hear they business

house of commons more seriously this be welcome development as it will give guidance to colleague and their family and be sure it will be widely welcome across the house so thank she for that understand that robert gibbs the act director of catering service will be leave on friday after year in this house one shudder to think of the thousand of member of the house of commons and their staff whose life will have be enrich by the joy of eat the food of the catering service under his command and we thank he very much for his service be sure that the whole house will want to join in thank he for his work we be get close to the end of term and want to thank all the staff for their service and of course you madam deputy speaker the speaker and the other deputy speakers and the clerks for the resilience courage determination and poker face that they have keep through all the business question that we have have since the beginning of the year it may come as slightly more of surprise to the house that also want to thank the leader of the house no one who have not hold that position understand the amount of work that be involve in scheduling and manage the business of this house let alone the amount of work involve in scheduling and manage the prime minister and cabinet colleague the leader of the house distinguish herself with her very graceful response to my remark about my father some month ago and thank she again for that also thank she for her engagement and humour and must say more than few groan induce pun of which we will undoubtedly see considerably more this morning and with which she have deal with question from colleague across all part of this house hope may register that it be slight sadness to that the leader of the house have not be willing to answer my own question in the same spirit ask these question not in personal capacity but as the spokesman for his majesty official opposition whose function be after all to hold the government to account the refusal to answer genuine sensible question be actually discourtesy not just to the house but to our wide constitutional framework and ultimately the supreme source of sovereign authority in this country the king in parliament think any fair minded person review our exchange would conclude that my question be almost always direct at some public purpose and it would undoubtedly improve business question and the accountability and authority of the leader of the house if she be able to engage with they in the same spirit will raise some serious question about what the government position be with regard to northern ireland veteran as the leader of the house will know hundred and thousand of man and woman go to northern ireland not of their own accord but under order and in chain of command on the queen business to combat the most serious terrorist organisation in the world at the time and to protect human life and human society many of those veteran include many member of the special force can not respond to the terrible injustice be do to they almost exactly year ago barely three week after the election the government decide to abandon the appeal to the supreme court to uphold the key section of the legacy act against high court judgment in northern ireland in the veteran debate on monday the secretary of state for northern ireland say that those section be unlawful as result of the judgment yesterday in prime minister question the prime minister himself say twice that the legacy act have be strike down unfortunately those statement be both untrue and misleading there can be no doubt what the law be on this topic succession of the most senior judge in recent british history judges steyn hope bingham hale and reed among they have make it absolutely clear that declaration of incompatibility do not mean that the law be unlawful or have be strike down as the then senior law lord lord bingham say in in such case the validity of the law remain unaffected the secretary of state for northern ireland be no lawyer but he should understand that basic point give his job the prime minister however have be barrister for year and human right lawyer for most of that time it be inconceivable that he do not understand the distinction to that extent he be whether deliberately or inadvertently mislead the house the secretary of state appear to say that he have abandon these appeal on political ground it be plain that the government be split and have be unable to develop satisfactory legal remedy in the month since they abandon the appeal leave thousand of veteran many in their and old expose to legal harassment anxiety and trauma put two serious and substantive question to the leader of the house as the leader of the house in uphold the practice tradition and honour of this house will she ask the secretary of state for northern ireland and the prime minister to correct those false and misleading statement to the house when will we see legislation to address the legal gap that the government decision to abandon these legacy act appeal have create before the leader of the house respond in case misheard let say that the shadow leader of the house know we do not accuse colleague of mislead the house inadvertent be the language be very pleased to announce the recess date for the whole of the next academic year that be one modernisation that say would bring in to give colleague more certainty year in advance and be pleased that we have be able to announce those date today as the house go into recess next week join the shadow leader of the house in thank you madam deputy speaker as well as mr speaker the other deputy speakers and all the house staff for all the incredible work they do for we all year round in the spirit of the shadow leader of the house comment also thank he we work closely behind the scene on number of board and committee and always find his contribution to be valuable and consider share his comment about robert gibbs as the shadow leader of the house say he be the act director of catering service and will be leave the house after year of service he have definitely keep we all very well feed perhaps at time too well feed and wish he all the good will also take this opportunity to mention that know many member across the house be deeply concerned by the use of super injunction that have the effect of keep important policy and government development from this house as leader of the house of commons the fact that this situation continue for so long make deeply uncomfortable and concerned we have long establish mechanism and committees for scrutinise secret and sensitive information in such case and as the prime minister say yesterday the previous government have some serious question to answer include about why the house be keep in the dark look forward to the defence committee and other committees look into these issue the shadow leader of the house ask to answer his question be always happy to do so when he bring they to and he have raise some question today about the northern ireland legacy act it be important that these issue be discuss sensitively and that we work together on they without raise the temperature or use irresponsible rhetoric about they because we all have profound respect for our veteran and owe debt to they this be complex situation and we need to resolve it the shadow leader of the house might disagree but the previous government legacy act be find to be unlawful and unworkable and be now subject to further court action that mean that currently no one be protect by that act neither do it give people the justice they want because there would be so much legal uncertainty about do so that be why our priority be find way forward that give veteran survivor and community confidence in the process we will take our time to do this and of course we will regularly update the house as we consider how to do so today mark the year anniversary of the first labour monarch speech in year the story of our labour government be tell through the legislation we have already bring in we be stand up for ordinary work people against the

to the major international port and airport in the region it be also dangerously congest the scheme would have address both of those problem and improve the journey of the approximately vehicle that

cancellation could severely hamper the building of an estimate new home in the area with labour pledge to build million new home by the end of this parliament this issue cut across party line while

peace in ukraine be possible and we must be ready for when that peace come since march the uk and france have lead the coalition of the willing on plan new security arrangement to support ukraine in any ceasefire more than military planner from nation have work intensively for week with ukraine that include work on reconnaissance in ukraine lead by uk personnel last week at the summit president

for ukraine to prevail call the shadow secretary of state be grateful to the secretary of state for advance sight of his statement it be less than month ago that the united states undertake bombing raid on iranian nuclear facility one of the most significant military action undertake anywhere in the world for year with such development understandably dominate the headline and almost three and half year have elapse since russia first launch its unprovoked and illegal all out invasion it be right that the government regularly update the house as we do on development in ukraine the reality be that there have be no let up in russian aggression as the secretary of state confirm july see the large drone attack of the war by russia and there be report yesterday of russia use drone to target energy infrastructure and city across ukraine that indiscriminate barbarism have inevitably lead to further civilian casualty but on the military side can the secretary of state confirm that russia have suffer by far the great loss he confirm that last month russian battlefield casualty surpass million do that not show the extent to which putin have nothing but callous disregard for the human impact of his action on either side be proud of the decisive assistance that we provide to ukraine when we be in office we continue to stand with the government in seek to provide all possible support but it be vital that all our ally play their part on france and what be previously call the coalition of the willing agree that we need to be ready for when that peace come so can the secretary of state confirm how many other nation will provide fighter jet to the multinational force ukraine can he confirm that there be no long any planning for land combat element to the mnfu we welcome the additional provision of military hardware by the us but the secretary of state say that we plan to play our full part will the uk therefore be purchase military equipment from the united states to pass on to ukraine the secretary of state do not mention potential sanction or tariff it have be widely report that president trump be consider tariff of on good enter the us from any country that import any product from russia have the government discuss this plan with the us and will the uk follow suit the times report today that andriy yermak senior adviser to president zelensky have state that the imposition of secondary sanction on nation buy oil and gas from russia could end the war before the end of this year do the secretary of state agree with that analysis and again would the uk join in any secondary sanction policy direct against country import russian oil and gas on germany we understand that the prime minister be meet chancellor merz today may urge the government to push their german counterpart on provision of taurus missile to ukraine alternatively give that the missile be we understand compatible with typhoon will the government backfill uk stock to enable the provision of more storm shadow missile turn to the impact of all this on the uk we understand that germany will today sign an agreement with the prime minister to come to each other aid in the event of an attack on the other will the secretary of state outline how that be different from nato article have have recent discussion with senior german parliamentarian on the impact on our nation of support ukraine and the germans believe as have be widely report that drone overflight of their military basis be link to nefarious russian activity in the context of recent threat to raf basis and drone overflight at suffolk raf basis and elsewhere last november can he update we at all appreciate the sensitivity of this on whether there be yet any indication of russian involvement in particular will he update we on progress on the review of security at uk basis which he launch last month when be minister for defence procurement strip out whole load of process and red tape to bring forward the in service date of our groundbreake dragonfire anti drone laser from to give the extraordinary potential for direct energy weapon will the secretary of state accelerate adoption even far and ensure rapid testing of anti drone defence for our military basis on drone more broadly in write answer in march ministers confirm that they have order just three military drone for our armed force since the election have table subsequent write question on progress and ministers be now say that they can not answer the question what be the late figure uk small and medium sized enterprise have provide some of the good drone and counter drone measure use on the live battlefield in ukraine so why be we not order the same kit in parallel for our own army at scale and at pace so that it can train today not year in the future in how war be fight right now in ukraine after three and half year of war we must keep remind the british public of the most important point for our national interest namely that the good way to defend our homeland right now be to give all possible support to ukraine so that the democracy triumph over the dictatorship and to prevent putin aggression from spread westward be grateful to the shadow secretary of state for his welcome for the update welcome the opposition continue backing for the step that we be take to support ukraine just as we give our backing to their government when we be in opposition the shadow secretary of state be right to point out that the massive scale of russian casualty show the contempt that president putin have for the life of his own people as well as for the life of those in ukraine he be also right to point out that russian casualty far outnumber those in ukraine on the coalition of the willing nation be involve in the planning the military planning be now complete and we will keep it refresh until renew ceasefire negotiation which we hope to see soon under the plan there will be land force and activity in the air and on the sea be pleased to hear the shadow secretary of state back the aid that we be put into ukraine he ask about the coalition of the willing but really can not recall and have check he back the coalition do his party support britain leadership of the multinational force ukraine discussion on the trump nato plan will be develop on monday at the ukraine defence contact group meeting which will co chair will boris pistorius if sanction and economic measure play part in the action that the international community need to take to bring putin to the negotiating table we will of course use they the shadow secretary of state government have good record we have go lot far in the past year since july we have introduce over new sanction against individual entity and ship across all the regime and as nation we have now sanction over vessel in the russian shadow fleet on base security will update the house when the full base security review be complete on dragonfire the shadow secretary of state be right to say that he be instrumental in the uk take its first step on that technology but he leave the programme largely unfunded we be already accelerate it and will put that technology into four of our naval vessel not just the one that he plan to put it in on drone the hon gentleman know that what he keep cite be very specific answer to very specific question he know that follow the strategic defence review we be double to more than billion the amount of money in this parliament that we will invest in autonomy and drone he know that we will establish new drone centre of excellence this will mean we can accelerate the use of uncrewed system or drone in every service the army for instance will train thousand of operator this summer we will start roll out strike drone that will be follow by more than surveillance drone and we will equip every section with drone for the future that be what we mean in the strategic defence review when we talk about combine the power of new technology with the heavy metal of platform like tank plane and ship to make britain the most innovative armed force in nato as the member for aldershot know how deeply people in my constituency understand the cost of conflict and the value of standing by our ally so welcome this statement and thank the secretary of state for his leadership on this issue do he agree that the outcome in ukraine matter for not just european security but the uk stand as reliable defence partner and that for we to maintain this reputation long term investment in british capability and industry in constituency like mine where incidentally dragonfire be create be essential to sustain our support and deter further aggression my hon friend be entirely right the uk have be the most reliable ally for ukraine since before the full scale invasion almost three and half year ago she be also right to say that test of this nation be whether we be willing to step up the leadership on ukraine as we have whether we be ready to step up the leadership in nato as we have and underpin all whether we be ready to step up the level of defence investment in this country which we have the prime minister announce in february that this country would invest of gdp in defence by alongside the billion extra in defence this year labour first year in government this be the large increase in defence investment since the end of the cold war call the liberal democrat spokesperson thank the defence secretary for advance sight of his statement we welcome the additional support to ukraine because we must continue to support ukraine to defend europe russia increase attack be devastating and we recognise the resilience of the ukrainians and support they president trump only now seem to be realise what have always be clear that russia brutal dictator have no interest in peace while be surprised and relieve to see the president announce potential secondary sanction if no ceasefire be agree within day we all know that he be as changeable as the wind no one have forget the humiliating ambush he lay for president zelensky in the oval office and there be no guarantee he will not soon revert to praise putin again day deadline could even encourage putin to escalate his attack in the meantime that be why the uk must go far to support ukraine and increase pressure on the kremlin could the defence secretary update the house on progress towards seize the billion in frozen russian asset here in the uk and deploy they to ukraine what discussion be under way with european partner especially belgium and germany on do the same across the continent more must be do to cut off the oil revenue fuel russia war machine the secretary of state speak about the shadow fleet but will the government expand the uk designation of vessel in russia shadow fleet include those that be already sanction by the eu canada and the us finally turn to the announcement on the multinational force ukraine we welcome the conclusion of this first phase of planning and the uk lead role in shape the future security architecture for ukraine but we need clarity on what this mean in practical term can the defence secretary confirm what the specific uk armed force contribution will be to the multinational force ukraine will there be any plan deployment of uk personnel on land at sea or in the air once the mission be operational and if so what role will the uk play in that deployment first we stand ready to expand sanction on the russian shadow fleet secondly the hon lady ask about the coalition of the willing the military planning be complete with the prospect of ceasefire which we hope to see soon but can not see immediately the commitment and the detail will be firm up and they will be report appropriately to the house at that stage finally the hon lady ask about the use of frozen asset she will know the complexity of this challenge and the interest and will of the government to work on this but she will also recognise that the majority of those asset be hold outside the uk so any action on this front must be take with and alongside other therein lie the complexity of the discussion at present thank the secretary of state for this statement and for express his and indeed this house unwavere commitment to the ukrainian people against putin illegal war welcome the drone that the uk have send to ukraine and express my admiration for the ukrainian people who be fight on behalf of all of we no one predict the role of drone in this conflict and the astounding speed of the evolution of that technology in ukraine but also in russia and china what step be the secretary of state take with our ally to ensure that we maintain or develop technological advantage in key defence capability and get it to the frontline my hon friend be entirely right for the first time in human conflict history drone be kill far more and cause far more casualty than heavy artillery she ask the challenging question that be at the heart of the strategic defence review that we publish at the beginning of last month in learn lesson from ukraine how do we recognise the way that the change in warfare be accelerate by the rapidly advance technology that be the reason we be make billion investment in this parliament alone in the drone technology that she cite and the potential of autonomy to reinforce the warfighting readiness of our force and therefore the deterrence that we can provide as nation within nato operation orbital be the uk training programme for the ukrainian military can the secretary of state confirm that that personal and personnel datum be safe at the ministry of defence he mention there be drone attack over the last four month and he reference meeting with germans to look at counter drone munition and capability but of course ukrainians be be attack right now today what thought have be give to the use of the raf tucano aircraft which think be now out of service wonder where they be could they be redeploy could variant of the grob turboprop trainer perhaps be provide these slow fly aircraft could interdict shahed drone for example and they be low cost and low maintenance be not familiar with the tucano aircraft if they be still in our inventory they have not come across my desk but will certainly look into that and write to the right hon gentleman on the orbital training programme be confident that the datum relate to those personnel be secure be proud of that programme it do not just follow putin full scale invasion in february three and half year ago it be in place after russia first take crimea and have proxy force move into donetsk and luhansk there be uk canadian training programme support ukrainians well before putin invasion and since then we have train more than ukrainian force through the uk lead multinational training programme do the secretary of state agree that the action of russia on july when it launch the large aerial bombardment of the war to date show that ukrainian civilian and military be still in fight for their life and the future of their country and that this house our government and our country must do everything possible to stand with they in that fight do and my hon friend be right to remind the house and the public these russian attack be direct not just at ukrainian frontline force but at ukrainian city ukrainian civilian and ukrainian civilian infrastructure that be harsh reminder of putin character his brutal illegal invasion be entirely contemptuous of the life of his own people and he be attack civilian and civilian infrastructure fully support the work of the uk government in provide military assistance to ukraine like so many voluntary group

mining so be very pleased to hear those mention his statement be about our support for ukraine but for the long term security of our own country and the whole of europe what lesson be the ministry of defence and the uk defence industry learn from ukraine innovation in defence my hon friend be one of the most energetic and ceaseless supporter of ukraine and not just in this house know he have go out with supply to support civilian and comrade in ukraine be glad that he be at the ukraine recovery conference in italy last week if he be look for the lesson that the uk ministry of defence be pull from ukraine will send he personal copy of the strategic defence review these plan for so call coalition of the willing be contingency plan they be design for time when putin agree to ceasefire in ukraine which as the secretary of state acknowledge he show no sign of do how do the prospect of ukraine ally such as the uk deploy armed force to ukraine after ceasefire incentivise the kremlin to sue for peace one of the signal that the coalition of the willing underline to president putin be that large number of deeply commit democratic country be willing to stand with ukraine in its fight against his invasion and be willing to stand alongside ukraine in any peace to secure long last and just settlement the single message that putin should take be that ukraine will keep fight that we will keep support it and that the good way for he be now to accept that he need to come to the negotiating table to talk and put an end to this fighting thank my right hon friend for his important update it be clear that russia grow aggression undermine our security at home do he agree that the outcome of the war in ukraine matter deeply to every one of my constituent in cowdenbeath and

two nation within nato social media misinformation and algorithms science innovation and technology committee select committee statement we now come to the first select committee statement on behalf of the science innovation and technology committee dame chi onwurah will speak for up to minute during which no intervention may be take at the conclusion of her statement will call member to ask question on the subject of the statement these should be brief question not full speech emphasise that question should be direct to the select committee chair and not the relevant government minister although front benchers may take part in questioning call dame chi onwurah be grateful to the backbench business committee for allocate time for this statement today speak on behalf of the science innovation and technology committee but also the hundred of thousand of people whose life be profoundly affect by last year riot as well as everyone impact by the long shadow of social medium misinformation want to put on the record my thank to the committee clerks and specialist who have support this inquiry and the many witness who give evidence they have help to shape our report and we be very grateful particularly to those who share their real life experience of the riot and the online hate that accompany they the committee would also like to extend our deep sympathy to the family of the three little girl murder in southport and everyone affect like many nation the uk be grapple with the immense challenge of regulate global tech giant company whose platform shape our society economy and democracy often with resource that dwarf those of government for example the uk entire public sector budget be about equal to meta market capitalisation as the representative of the british people it be essential that parliament understand the impact of these company and be able to scrutinise their action and regulate they in the public interest where necessary however the committee experience significant challenge in seek to do that during the course of the inquiry we be reassure by statement from google meta tiktok and in our evidence session that they accept their responsibility to be accountable to the british people through parliament and we hope to see that in practice as our work in this area continue the horrific attack in southport on july and the violent unrest that follow be stark reminder of the real world consequence of the viral spread of online misinformation hateful and misleading content spread rapidly amplify by opaque recommendation algorithm protest turn violent often target muslim and migrant community drive in part by the spread of these message these event provide snapshot of how online activity can contribute to real world violence and hate many part of the long await online safety act be not fully in force at the time of the riot but the committee find little evidence that they would have make difference if they be moreover the act be out of date it regulate at technology and content level rather than on principle or outcome and therefore fail to adequately address generative artificial intelligence chatgpt deep fake and synthetic misinformation even as it become cheap and easy to access generative ai will make the next misinformation crisis much more dangerous have spend six year work for ofcom before enter parliament believe strongly that regulate technology do not work our online safety regime should be base on principle that remain sound in the face of technological development social medium have make many important and positive contribution help to democratise access to public voice and connect people far and wide it also have significant risk the advertisement base business model of most social medium company mean that they promote engage content often regardless of its authenticity that spill out across the entire internet via the unclear under regulate digital advertising market incentivise the creation of content that will perform well on social medium as we see during the unrest this be not just social media problem it be systemic issue that promote harmful content and undermine public trust our concern be exacerbate when we question representative of regulator and the government we be meet with confusion and contradiction at high level and it become evident that the uk online safety regime have some major hole after four public session more than write submission and extensive deliberation our finding be clear the british people be not adequately protect from online harm we have identify five key principle that we believe be crucial for the regulation of social medium and related technology and drive our recommendation to government our first principle be public safety algorithmically enhance misinformation be danger that company government law enforcement and security service need to work together to address that be basically say that misinformation be harmful which may sound obvious but it have not be recognise as such as consequence platform should be compel to demote fact check misinformation and establish process to take more stringent measure during crisis we propose that the government carry out research into how platform should tackle misinformation and how far recommendation algorithm spread harm furthermore all ai content should be visibly label our second principle be free and safe expression step to tackle amplify misinformation should be in line with the fundamental right to free expression and measure to meet misinformation must align with that right our third principle be responsibility user should be hold liable for what they post online but the platform on which they post be also responsible and should be hold accountable for the impact of the amplification of harmful content that may sound obvious indeed it be not the first time that select committee have say this yet widespread uncertainty remain as to whether platform have responsibility for the legal content that they host and distribute the report recommend that platform be oblige to undertake risk assessment and report on content that be legal but harmful new regulatory oversight clear and enforceable standard and proportionate penalty be need to cover the process of digital advertising our fourth principle be control critically user should have control over both their personal datum and what they see online we recommend that user have right to reset the datum use by platform recommendation algorithm our fifth and final principle be transparency the technology use by social medium company include recommendation algorithm and generative ai should be transparent accessible and explainable to public authority transparency be need for participant in the digital advertising market basically if we can not explain it we can not understand the harm it may do be tech evangelist believe that technology like politic be an engine of progress but that do not mean we have to accept it as it be our report set out detailed recommendation to ensure that we do not have repeat of the violent and harmful riot last year we urge the government to acknowledge that the online safety act be not fit for purpose to adopt these five principle to build strong future proof online safety regime with clear enforceable standard for social medium platform and to implement our recommendation without action it be only matter of time before we face another crisis like the southport riot or even bad thank the hon lady and the select committee that she chair for deliver this important review also thank she for her statement to the house which have highlight the scale of the challenge we face in relation to the proliferation of mislead and harmful content online join she in put out my prayer and sympathy to all those affect by the horror in southport last year give the report finding that young people be particularly susceptible to misleading and harmful content and online radicalisation due to the stage of their cognitive development do the hon lady consider that the government should commit to conduct review of the evidential case for raise the digital age of consent for social medium platform from to thank the hon member for his comment also thank he for highlight the particular issue of young people their cognitive development and the lack of protection they enjoy from misinformation as consequence the committee do not recommend that the government should commit to review but we be consider further inquiry into the impact on the cognitive development of young people be sure that we will have recommendation with regard to that as consequence thank my hon friend and her committee for highlight the challenge we face in scrutinise powerful technology company as she know be particularly concerned about suicide and self harm relate content in more than three quarter of the individual survey by samaritans say that they first see self harm content online at the age of or young often without search for it worryingly say that they self harm more severely after view such content online we have take important step forward by implement the online safety act but we still face the challenge of regulate emerge technology as well as small and risky platform do she share my concern about this issue what be her committee view on how we can tackle and monitor it thank my hon friend and constituency neighbour for highlight this incredibly important issue and for the work that she do in this area she be absolutely right to say that the committee hear very moving and distressing evidence that suicide and self harm content can be and have be amplify by social medium algorithm and that that can play role in suicide and self harm include by young people promote suicide be illegal and the online safety act introduce an offence of promote self harm but it do not do enough to tackle legal content that promote suicide or self harm as with the rest of legal but harmful content such as misinformation the committee recommendation that platform should be hold accountable for the algorithmic amplification of misinformation would address part of what my hon friend be concerned about we hope that in implement those recommendation the government would set out how they would fully address her concern be member of the select committee over which the hon lady preside as chair and thank she and all the staff who help with this report and inquiry know that many of we in this place wear not one but multiple hat also sit on the joint committee on human rights and we be do an inquiry into ai and human right some of the work from this report will be helpful and inform we in look at some of the key issue so with another hat on thank she for that one of the evidence session that have stick with from work on the report be when we have social medium company boss in front of we they talk about how they remove most of the content within minute in of case but they do not accept responsibility for the proliferation of that datum information and content outside their own sphere what worry be that at time when we have advance technology and great pace of change and we need to maintain regulation at breakneck pace company particularly social medium company be unravel and unpick their content note their monitoring and how they look for and remove information that might be harmful do the chair of the science innovation and technology committee agree that we need to do more in regulate current approach and ensure that the company do not backslide on their obligation thank the hon gentleman my fellow committee member for that question as well as for his contribution to this report and the work of the committee which have be exceedingly valuable he have raise really important point we hear evidence from meta about facebook content check and how outside the uk and the us it be move from fact check to community note which have also do the committee have recommend adopt the principle that platform be hold accountable which must go hand in hand with those platform set out how they can demonstrate that accountability the report also recommend that the government undertake research into what effective fact check look like and how misinformation be spread because one of the thing that the committee which be scientific committee observe be the lack of real evidence in thar area that be partly because the algorithm and platform be so opaque and secretive about how they operate thank my hon friend the chair of the select committee of which be also member this report make vital recommendation to government and social medium community about how we can make the online world safe be particularly concerned about the impact on young people do my hon friend agree that harm be happen today young people will be go home from school with harmful content be push at they do she agree that social medium company should not wait for government to implement these recommendation but should get on with implement they today to stop that harm happen to child across this country thank my hon friend both for his outstanding contribution to the report and the committee work and for his question he be absolutely right we should not have to force the online company to take action they can see the evidence and they can read this report they know what be happen to the brain of young people they should be able to implement the recommendation of the report without wait for government action although very much believe that government action will be necessary to ensure those recommendation be implement across all platform our committee evidence support the conclusion that social medium business model particularly the use of recommendation algorithm that push user to see more extreme content and misinformation incentivise the spread of dangerous content and consequently behaviour as both member of the committee and co chair of the all party parliamentary group on artificial intelligence be another member who wear many hat welcome our committee conclusion that user and social medium platform should be hold accountable for the impact that their amplification cause do my hon friend agree that the report provide clear recommendation to the government and regulator as to how those platform should be hold accountable include labelling of all ai generate content and new regulatory oversight with clear enforceable standard and penalty accountability must have tooth thank my hon friend for her contribution to the committee report her understanding and knowledge of ai have be invaluable she be absolutely right that ai content must be label and that the platform and content generator must take action to address this issue now because the risk be only go to increase look forward to the government ensure that enforcement have tooth for those platform that do not take action or be too reckless in the action they take thank my hon friend for her committee report and the team behind it who have draft it the report contain concern and recommendation about digital marketing whatsapp be direct communication tool for good and for bad which very few people engage with as though it be classic social medium platform such as facebook instagram or it be place for private conversation and meta pride itself on its datum be encrypt and secure have say that it would not do so meta will now start serve up ad under the guise of advertiser want to go where their audience be which translate as organisation want to make more money through target marketing include meta which have billion user of whatsapp worldwide if we have our whatsapp connect to facebook and instagram we may get more personalised ad never have want to disconnect my whatsapp from my instagram and facebook more already when we click on instagram it follow we to our facebook feed there be no escape it so view be be shape and influence relentlessly by the organisation that drive the most revenue to the platform owner with reference to the recommendation in this report about control digital advertising do my hon friend agree that we should be able to communicate with our love one without be constantly sell to and influence and that we should always have option to opt out for the sake of our own mental health thank my hon friend for champion safe and effective technology and for the point she have make she be absolutely right first it be essential that the technology be properly regulate and that regulation be base on principle so whatsapp and user to user communication should be subject to the same principle base regulatory environment as content communication secondly we must be able to opt out and to reset the algorithm that drive the advertising we receive thirdly and finally digital advertising be unfortunately free for all with very little regulation or control if consumer be to be adequately protect that need to change accountability for daesh crimes joint committee on human rights select committee statement we now come to the second select committee statement on behalf of the joint committee on human rights tom gordon will speak for up to minute during which time no intervention may be take at the conclusion of his statement will call member to ask question on the subject of the statement these should be brief question not full speech emphasise that question should be direct to the select committee member not to the relevant government minister front benchers may also take part in questioning be grateful to the government for engage with the joint committee on human rights report accountability for daesh crime and for the response they have provide there be some area of welcome agreement for instance the government have reiterate their commitment to ensure justice for survivor they rightly agree that where there be evidence of international crime such as genocide individual should be prosecute for those crime not merely for terrorism offence that fail to capture the full horror and scale of what have take place however let be clear for all the government assurance we be still leave with the sobering reality that not one single daesh fighter have yet be prosecute in the uk for genocide crime against humanity or war crime of any sort the uk be signatory to the genocide convention we be one of its founding champion we can not continue to rely on theoretical commitment to it while outsource accountability to other jurisdiction or to international court with limited reach and resource the government response repeatedly emphasise that prosecution be well pursue close to where crime occur but where that be not happen and in many case it be not the uk can not and must not turn blind eye if british national take part in genocide abroad and return to the uk they should face justice here there must be no safe haven for perpetrator of international crime especially not on uk soil turn to universal jurisdiction be disappointed that the government have reject the recommendation to amend the international criminal court act to remove the limitation base on nationality and residency what be recommend be not radical departure from established practice this be about close clear loophole that allow perpetrator of genocide and other international crime to escape justice simply because of where they be from the uk exercise universal jurisdiction for torture and for grave breach of the geneva convention so why not for genocide this be not just legal oversight it be failure of political will that continue to undermine survivor access to justice the government claim that sufficient co ordination exist between the crown prosecution service and the war crime team but despite the structure have be in place since we be yet to see any meaningful outcome structure alone be not enough survivor want justice not process co ordination must be measure by result and so far the result be zero prosecution for international crime be also deeply concerned by the government stance on citizenship deprivation the assertion that there be sufficient transparency do not hold up to scrutiny the public deserve regular accessible reporting and parliament deserve the ability to scrutinise use of this powerful and exceptional tool deprivation of citizenship should never be substitute for due process or way of quietly absolve ourselves of responsibility for british national be involve in atrocity crime overseas finally come to british national include child detain in north east syria we note the government repeat statement about the practical challenge and acknowledge the complexity of the security environment but the absence of precise public datum the slow pace of repatriation and the ambiguity around the next step on those detain and potential prosecution remain deeply troubling these child be british national some be orphan and other be at risk of radicalisation and violence leave they in indefinite limbo in unsafe camp be moral and strategic failure the uk should lead with humanity clarity and resolve if we be serious about uphold the rule of law if we mean what we say about the genocide convention and if we truly honour the memory and suffering of yazidi survivor and other victim of daesh crime we must go far than warm word and procedural reassurance we need action prosecution and leadership the government have the opportunity to turn rhetoric into reality urge ministers to reconsider the case for universal jurisdiction for great transparency and for clear more co ordinate path to justice that be our moral and legal obligation and we owe nothing less to survivor bill presented planning and development community infrastructure bill presentation and first reading standing order no ben maguire present bill to require housing developer to construct any planned community infrastructure before commence construction of housing with which the plan community infrastructure be associate and for connected purpose bill read the first time to be read second time on friday september and to be print bill backbench business global plastics treaty relevant document oral evidence take before the environment food and rural affairs committee on july on prevent waste and enable circular economy hc correspondence between the environment food and rural affairs committee and the parliamentary under secretary of state for environment food and rural affairs on the global plastics treaty report to the house on july beg to move that this house have consider the global plastics treaty thank the backbench business committee for make time available for this debate and for allocate the debate to the main chamber that be an important signal that the house be in political consensus on the issue and we attach great deal of importance to that thank those member who support the application for the debate to the backbench business committee in particular my hon friend the member for south cotswolds dr savage she have long and distinguished record of campaign on this issue but be unfortunately unable to be here also express my appreciation for the support of the various campaigner organisation and individual who have keep this issue in the public consciousness for so long not always in the easy of circumstance at this turn of the wheel particularly thank greenpeace uk for the assistance of its campaigner rudy schulkind but in the past have private member bill on the subject and that be support by whole range of organisation from the woman institute through to friend of the earth we have to call that broad base consensus this debate be timely the next round of talk on the un global plastic treaty will be hold in geneva between and august the government be happy to acknowledge have good story to tell and in fairness they inherit the record of the previous government who also accord some political importance to this issue the message want the chamber to send today be that the government have to do all that they can not just in present the uk case but in support other for those of we who like come from island and coastal community the growth of plastic pollution have be obvious for year ahead of this debate get an email just couple of day ago from constituent of mine jim chalmers who say can remember as child beachcombe around the south end of stronsay and come across the occasional unfamiliar plastic bottle and be intrigue by its novelty it might have be an empty washing up liquid bottle of kind unknown in our household or even have word in foreign language fast forward to and the position be very different on the beach of the orkney and shetland coastline and right around the coastline of all european country even when we go out on beach that look pretty clear and pristine if we start pick up the small piece of plastic or minute later we have carrier bag full of they in orkney and shetland we have great range of community initiative to tackle this issue in orkney we have the bag the bruck campaign every year in shetland we have da voar redd up despite the community effort and people take responsibility for stretch of coastline and pick up the rubbish week later it be as if almost nobody have ever be there the tipping point for public consciousness on this issue be the blue planet series by sir david attenborough few year ago that create sufficient public pressure so that in there be decision by country to develop an internationally legally bind instrument to address the problem of plastic pollution that matter on so many level and it be why the word global be central to the treaty plastic as an industry emit more carbon than the entire global aviation and shipping industry the question we should ask ourselves be what exactly do good look like at the conclusion of the talk in geneva can not improve on the fine summary in the briefing from the environmental investigation agency and greenpeace ahead of today debate they state that we should be look for global target to reduce production of primary plastic polymer and related element such as reporting and national measure reduce production be critical will return to that in minute or two they also call for clear and legally bind obligation to phase out the most harmful plastic product and chemical of concern in plastic binding obligation to improve the design of plastic product and ensure they cause minimum environmental impact and safeguard human health include support reuse provision of ambitious finance effective mean of implementation in particular for least developed countries and small island developing states finally they call for use regular un procedure for decision make if all effort at consensus have be exhaust if we can achieve something along those line in geneva we will have some cause for optimism congratulate the right hon gentleman on secure this important debate he have outline the important global action that we need to take on plastic do he agree that this government action to bring forward deposit return scheme will help address some of these issue it will ensure that we can recycle plastic and that will take they off the street and beach where they be end up yes if it be properly construct nationwide deposit return scheme the experience in scotland be shall we say not everything that it might have be properly construct scheme will be critical see the under secretary of state for environment food and rural affairs the hon member for coventry east mary creagh on the front bench and know she have tremendous personal commitment to this issue this be about create circular economy know there be genuine commitment to that in the department for environment food and rural affairs and deposit return scheme would very much sit within that we talk about such measure be somehow in conflict with business importantly the fundamental truth be that the good opportunity for business come from have circular economy we can make not just an environmental and social case for that but business case ensure that the treaty have the strong possible reduction target will be absolutely critical that be where the contention have arise in previous round of talk and we can anticipate that the same argument will be rehearse the most important point to address however be the idea that somehow the whole thing will be fix by recycle and that we can just keep produce virgin plastic at an exponential rate we reckon that the current exceptionally high level will treble by if we do not do anything to arrest the increase we can not manage to fix it all by recycle and the people who advance that idea particularly those who work for the big plastic company and the petrochemical company be downright disingenuous give the vast number of different plastic that be available and the different polymer combination they know just how difficult it be to actually recycle plastic this country have good record on collect plastic for recycling but the truth of the matter be that we recycle very little of it we export horrible amount of it think we export million kilogram for recycle in of course once it be export we do not know if it get recycle or not and we completely lose control of it then we have the growth of incineration the number of incinerator have grow from to in the last five year alone drive by the growth in plastic be afraid the idea that recycle alone be go to be the silver bullet will not lead to the meaningful reduction that we know we need so we need cap on production we also understand that one of the big barrier in geneva be go to be the role of the plastic industry itself it be exceptionally well resource and it be root downstream of the oil and gas industry personally be pragmatic about the use of oil and gas until we have other technology that can take its place it be foolish to push our oil and gas industry off the shelf but be afraid see little to commend in its behaviour have the industry representative all come as one delegation to the last round of talk in korea it would have be the large delegation at the talk be pleased to say that the uk delegation be the gold standard in this space it be well resource and be well inform by scientific adviser but that be not cause for complacency or smugness we have to see that it give we an opportunity to help and support other the environment food and rural affairs committee which chair take evidence on the global plastic treaty just last week on july and some of what hear be genuinely shocking professor richard thompson obe who be fellow of the royal society and professor of marine biology at the university of plymouth say moreover scientist work with have be threaten on un premise as part of these negotiation almost what would consider fundamental right to science and to access science be be deny it particularly fall on some of the small nation defra be very well bless in that it can afford to send big delegation of highly train scientist which be fantastic but they stand alongside small island develop nation which perhaps only have one individual there the need for science mechanism be actually mandate in unea and we need it really urgently to address this issue it be one of those moment when have to stop and say just second do you say what think you say there even after we have explain to he his position as an eminent scientist give evidence to select committee of the house of commons with all the protection of privilege he be not comfortable call out in detail what be happen the fact of the matter be that we know that it be happen if we be to get this treaty across the line uk need to be robust not just in present our own case but in support and protect those who be less fortunate than we be the small island nation the campaigner and the scientist who be there on their own finance my final ask be that there should be ministerial presence at the negotiation in geneva which would be really important signal that the government could send about the seriousness of their intent madam deputy speaker you say would speak for minute and think have have so will return to the email that get from jim chalmers he go on to say sure have reputation as that weird guy that carry bag with he when he out with the dog pick up litter call it recyclate however know fine urinate into the wind he do not actually say urinating as have no control whatsoever over the source of the stuff and the force that encourage and permit its grow release appreciate that the of this month be not good time for you to be away from orkney there be never good time to be away from orkney but if you can somehow bring any influence to bear would feel my effort be totally in vain it be for people like my constituent mr chalmers and his like right across this country that we be here today we pin our hope and their hope on the effort of the government and like minded country to get the treaty that we know we need and that our planet deserve thank the right hon member for orkney and shetland mr carmichael for secure this debate know he be deeply committed to this issue want to draw attention to part of this crisis that be often overlook but no less urgent microplastic which know the minister be passionate about too these tiny fragment much small than grain of rice be everywhere they have reach the depth of our ocean and the high mountain peak and the harm they cause be far from small we know from science that microplastic be be eat by fish bird and insect they harm wildlife from the inside out by disrupt feeding damage organ and carry toxic chemical and the impact do not just stay in the wild it spread through ecosystem and food chain and into our own body what trouble the most be that microplastic be largely invisible we can not see they but we be live with they every day this be not just global problem it be local one too in stafford we be really lucky to have place such as the doxey marsh staffordshire and worcestershire canal and the river sow which weave through our town and village these be place where family walk their dog child paddle in the water angler fish and wildlife thrive they be not just part of our landscape but part of who we be my hon friend be give an incredibly powerful speech microplastic be also part of what we be wear and microfibre be key part of the problem with plastic wonder if like she be interested in what the french have do to get company to disclose when microfibre be part of the material use in clothing in order to tackle the fast fashion crisis people need to understand what they be wear and the damage that microplastic can do to our environment be not familiar with the legislation that france have pass when buy clothe try to make sure that buy natural fibre which can be tough to do find that really have to search for they we could look at introduce similar legislation which sound like very sensible piece of work the space be talk about be now under threat when talk to resident in my constituency from eccleshall and gnosall to baswich they all tell that they be really worried they want their child and grandchild to grow up enjoy clean water healthy wildlife and safe green space so they be right to demand action that be why think microplastic must be core part of any global plastic treaty it be not enough to tackle the waste we can see we also need to tackle the waste we can not see welcome the work of the environment food and rural affairs committee and look forward to its recommendation know be speak to ministers who listen very carefully on this subject and consider it incredibly important but urge they to continue to act because we have responsibility to lead and duty to protect the place we call home we owe it to future generation to make sure that the river penk still support life that our farmland remain healthy and that the natural beauty of stafford and other place too do not become victim of short term decision this be our chance now so let we not waste it the world produce over million tonne of plastic each year on our current trajectory plastic pollution be set to triple by and every year million tonne of plastic go into our ocean in devon this picture be very obvious accord to the marine conservation society datum an average of litter item be find per metre of beach in devon the vast majority be single use plastic and packaging and anyone take the very wise decision to have holiday in devon this year will see from it themselves have see it for myself when wander along the beach of sidmouth seaton and beer see bottle and wrapper wash up with the tide wedge between pebble and entangle in seaweed we be very fortunate to have some fantastic volunteer with group such as the sidmouth plastic warriors who give freely of their time to clean our beach on its most recent outing last month people pick up an incredible bag of litter their work be extraordinary but there should not be bag of plastic litter on the beach of sidmouth of course the problem do not start on the beach it start in how we produce and consume plastic in the first place but there be serious shortcoming in the uk recycling we be sell myth that if we just spend little bit of time each week sort our rubbish the problem would take care of itself however in cleanhub report that the uk export tonne of plastic waste to country around the world to be recycle and these place do not have the infrastructure to recycle properly much of this be burn or dump and we have see evidence that it be pollute other country ecosystem while we tick box and say it have be recycle on this important point about the capacity of different country to hit certain standard the hon gentleman may have reprocessor company that take plastic waste and repurpose it in his constituency an important part of this debate have to be about packaging recovery note and package export recovery note which provide an equivalence but waste be often take to country such as turkey that have much low standard than in this country which be bad not only for british business but for the global environment think the government be work on that and would love to hear bit more about that from the minister but what do the hon gentleman have to say about it the hon member make very good point the business of our standard be very different be one we should look at first these note plainly need to be look at and we will have to go about some international negotiation to try to improve standard elsewhere the uk have high recycling standard internationally but it be not acceptable to simply offshore the problem which do not serve any of we well not only be plastic waste hazard to people but it be kill seabird as well as hundred of thousand of sea mammal turtle and fish and it be have devastating impact on our environment more broadly do the hon member agree that the government ban of disposable plastic vape be another way we can help reduce this plastic waste the hon member make an excellent point vote in favour of that initiative when it come before we and the banning of disposable plastic vape be very welcome too much waste still end up in incinerator sometimes what we think will be repurpose or recycle be in fact burn the number of incinerator in the uk have rise from to in the last five year this be the dirty form of energy production release more greenhouse gas than any other method while my constituent may have be enjoy their ice cream at seaton or walk the south west coast path during the recent heatwave these hotter summer be stark reminder of our collective failure to tackle climate change if we can increase the amount of plastic we reuse and create the circular economy that my right hon friend the member for orkney and shetland mr carmichael mention we can use less disposable plastic and less single use plastic and therefore reduce carbon emission germany be the lead recycler of municipal waste in the european union which be partly down to its deposit refund scheme recycle rate on plastic bottle have reach an outstanding in germany have to acknowledge that it be thank to the measure the government introduce in january that deposit return scheme for plastic and metal container will go live in the uk in this scheme which will offer small refund for return bottle and can in the uk be practical step towards reuse plastic although national action be welcome we need to match our own uk action with international action and the uk can be real leader in this space we can press for our ambition to be match by other country in the global plastic treaty negotiation we must push for legally bind target to reduce plastic production elsewhere not just voluntary pledge we offshore lot of our production include to china which account for of the world plastic production we know that the carbon emission produce as result be staggering and we must do something about they if the government be serious about deepen tie with beijing they must also be serious about hold it to account and that start with apply pressure at the global plastic treaty negotiation next month as we know the us president have never be great advocate for tackle climate change or reduce plastic waste he make that abundantly clear in his attention seek stunt in february when he proudly bring back plastic straw at the head of delegation meet early this month the us backtrack on its previous position it walk away from early commitment on control measure and financing and come out firmly against plastic production cap the prime minister have explicitly cite family value as foundation of his strong relationship with the us president could the minister urge the prime minister to leverage that personal connection and ask the president to consider not just global leadership but the world that his own family will inherit we have to consider young people in this picture and for that we will need serious and concrete commitment at the global plastic treaty negotiation the hon gentleman be make very good speech much of which agree with be sure that he like visit many school do he agree that when he visit they and speak to young people they be very very concerned about the environment and in particular plastic pollution in many way our great hope be that their laser focus on this issue will be reflect in the policy of future generation and that plastic production be reduce the hon gentleman be dead right child from sidmouth primary school write to early in the year urge to advocate for reduce plastic use and for cut down our plastic use quote they in debate and the minister for nature who be no long in her place sum up the debate with their word let we be honest voluntary effort have fail the world wildlife fund report that in the past five year plastic pollution have increase by despite rise in national and voluntary initiative the treaty must therefore tackle the source of the problem the production of plastic and confront the power of the fossil fuel lobby which be desperately try to water down the talk at last year round of negotiation fossil fuel lobbyist be present in busan their goal be to protect their own profit not the planet we can not allow short term commercial interest to derail the long term health of our ocean and community plastic production be forecast to triple by if we do not act no recycling scheme will be enough will hand my last paragraph to the child at sidmouth primary school they want to see deed not word it be pleasure to follow the hon member for honiton and sidmouth richard foord we usually sit together on the foreign affairs committee nowhere be global co operation more important than on climate work thank the right hon member for orkney and shetland mr carmichael for secure this important debate and for his brilliant speech which eloquently set out why this issue be so important my hon friend the member for stafford not to be confuse with ingham speak about microplastic last year my hon friend the member for stroud dr opher have debate on that very topic in which many of we speak follow that last november ahead of the previous round of treaty negotiation in busan hon member come together to debate the same issue now at the final round of negotiation we have come back together country be on the verge of finalise potentially powerful international agreement but its impact will be limit unless it address the root of the problem plastic production un estimate suggest that in the two and half year since the treaty negotiation start globally we have produce over billion metric tonne of plastic the scale be staggering and almost unimaginable but one thing be clear no amount of recycling and reuse can keep up with the scale of plastic waste we be produce if we do not act collectively and urgently the crisis will only escalate plastic production be project to triple by our climate our ecosystem and our planet can not cope the right hon member for orkney and shetland mention the impact on our ecosystem and our beach and my hon friend the member for ealing southall deirdre costigan mention single use item such as disposable vape and disposable fan one be dump in britain every second most end up in the global south in landfill risk massive environmental damage be proud to have sit on the committee lead by the minister that consider the legislation to ban this that be the labour government take real action there be interest group work to undermine our ambition have participate in international biodiversity and climate talk both in my previous role before enter this house and since have see at first hand what that look like voice in the room determine to stall talk and undermine global and national ambition as we have hear the shocking truth be that fossil fuel lobbyist be present at the last round of talk on the plastic treaty take together fossil fuel and chemical industry lobbyist would have be the single large delegation present large than the eu and all its member state delegation and large than all those for latin america the fossil fuel industry outnumber delegate from the pacific small island state two to one those nation already see the effect of marine plastic pollution and be already pay the price for our inaction we can not allow the voice of the fossil fuel industry to be loud than the cry of our planet or more influential than the testimony of science we can not allow it to be more powerful than the voice of our constituent and those want to create more sustainable future for generation to come in london we have show that another future be possible it require bold leadership and we be one such example of that we be the world lead city in eliminate single use plastic from large sport and music venue include abba voyage in my constituency and locally lead movement like plastic free forest gate which work with business on the high street to get rid of single use plastic item and plastic free roman road also have some eco warrior in one of my local school in maryland last week meet group of constituent from stratford and bow at the climate coalition lobby in parliament mary tell that she be there to lobby for an end to our dependency on fossil fuel she be there for her four grandchild for their future my constituent be clear the time to act be now we must put the people on our planet before the pollute industry my constituency be home to an earthshot prize win company notpla the last time mention notpla in parliament it have single handedly remove million item of single use plastic and count use its innovative seaweed base alternative today that number have rise to million item the ambition exist but we all need to seize this moment the cost of inaction be mass climate displacement environmental destruction and worsen global instability thank the minister and the government for their continue commitment to the uk global leadership in push for an ambitious treaty join members from across the house in call for all member state to agree to legally bind measure to address the production and consumption of plastic and finally to deliver treaty that meet the scale of the crisis for our planet thank my right hon friend the member for orkney and shetland mr carmichael for bring forward this valuable and important debate use to work as wiltshire councillor on the issue of plastic recycling my constituency like all our constituency can be blight by the sight of waste plastic by the roadside it be clear that bold action be need to tackle the sheer amount of plastic pollution that we have create both at home and abroad that be why we must join and support the global plastic treaty in an international effort to reduce plastic waste to promote sustainable eco friendly production and to protect our ocean and wildlife for future generation in the spirit of embrace such bold action we must embrace innovation chemical recycling for instance give we way to break down plastic into their fundamental building block create new plastic circular economy mura technology be just one of number of company do that today in the uk however such innovation need to be pay for on the basis of the polluter pay principle plastic producer must be tax so that the problem they produce can be fix for user of plastic product whether it be the film use to cover our cucumber or the plastic that contain our crisp or wrap our chocolate bar small tax need to be add to ensure that wrapper do not become blight on the environment we create the problem and believe we can fix it number of my constituent in south derbyshire have write to deeply distressed over the crisis of plastic pollution in south derbyshire waterway include in the river trent and the foremark and staunton harold reservoir and in our farmland where farmer already deal with increase flood due to the climate crisis be leave to deal with waste to give credit where it be due my constituent be also pleased to see responsible action to reduce plastic use at bearded theory music festival hold at catton hall in walton on trent the organiser use only reusable polypropylene cup that be take off site to be wash and reuse year after year pollution be global problem there be not one corner of the world that have not be affect by the over production of plastic microplastic be ubiquitous they have even be find in antarctica yet plastic production be project to triple by only of plastic globally be recycle most of the uk plastic be incinerate with the number of incinerator surge from to in the past five year incineration be the dirty form of energy production in the uk contribute to greenhouse gas that heat our planet and release toxic fume that have serious and harmful health impact in south derbyshire we be expect the result of an appeal into the propose swadlincote incinerator at stanton by the end of july stand with my constituent in oppose the building of new incinerator but we also need to reduce our waste the east midland be the second bad region in the country for waste with derbyshire the bad offender if we have less plastic we would have less waste and there would be no justification at all for any new incinerator ahead of the next round of talk on the un plastic treaty in geneva in august urge the government to continue to be ambitious in cut plastic production we will fail future generation if we accept water down agreement call on the government to introduce immediately uk wide moratorium on new incineration capacity and to secure strong global target to cut plastic production at the un plastic treaty negotiation public support for action could not be strong more than people across the uk take part in the big plastic count last year remarkable display of citizen science which lay bare just how pervasive and persistent plastic be in our daily life more than people have sign greenpeace uk petition call for strong meaningful treaty that be public mandate that this house can not ignore as members of parliament we have duty to act both for the constituent whom we represent today and for future generation to come plastic pollution choke our ocean poison wildlife and break down into microplastic that we find in our soil our food and our body urge the government to reject half measure let we seize this moment to put people and planet before plastic let we use this opportunity for green job investment and move far towards circular economy that necessitate less packaging and secure legacy that future generation will thank we for instead of the one that leave so many young people fearful for their future we can not let they down thank my right hon friend the member for orkney and shetland mr carmichael for secure this debate let highlight one point that he make about the circular economy he say that if we get the regulation and the incentive right it would be good not only for the environment but for business and the economy that be an important point to keep emphasise would like to use the short amount of time that have to talk about how we can connect this global issue to our local community let start with the global problem every year more than million tonne of plastic be dump in our ocean do hear million tonne from my right hon friend whichever it be it be obviously on huge scale this be not just statistic it represent an utter crisis one that affect marine life ecosystem and ultimately we as well to many people un treaty might seem bit abstract and remote some will even go as far as say that it be not worth the debate time in this chamber because it be too hard to imagine the average person bring it up on the doorstep however do not think that be right because it matter and the population have show that they care about this issue my right hon friend mention the popularity of attenborough tv documentary and how that have ignite people interest certainly have this issue raise time and again with people have also notice the impact on their local environment unlike my right hon friend do not have ocean anywhere near my london constituency but have beautiful chalk stream that run all the way through it people see the litter and they care about it and they see the plastic damage in particular we have introduce new monitoring system to understand the damage that some of these microplastic can do people be incredibly proud of their local surrounding and it be not too big step for they to think about the ocean across the world when they be think about their local area as have already be mention not just adult be start to care more this be totemic issue for the next generation recently receive bundle of passionate letter from year class at culvers house primary school say passionate because at time think they be little harsh on will not take it personally because think they be direct their anger at politician in general they be at pain to point out that we be not do enough or move fast enough they be quite clear about their demand and they go into lot of detail they tell about their concern for our ocean for the turtle and fish that be harm by plastic and for the future of the planet read their letter one afternoon find they pretty powerful and it remind of the duty that we all have to act now when we talk about the global plastic treaty it be important that we keep make it relevant to our local community it be clearly once in generation opportunity to create legally bind agreement that tackle plastic processing at every stage of the lifecycle for the agreement to work it have to be ambitious enforceable and support by everybody take the public with we on this issue be go to get more difficult there be people even in this chamber who will push back against it say that it be waste of time that it be problem to be solve by other elsewhere but we will have to keep build that support in do so we have to reverse where the pressure be bring to bear for long time the pressure have be on all of we to be more responsible consumer consumer have play their part they have be willing to put up with recycle yoghurt pot wash they out in the sink they have take on wooden fork and spoon they have even put up with paper straw they have do so despite the pain that all of those thing can be compare with what we have before they have play their part and now it be our turn in this place to put the pressure back on to producer to make sure that they play their part as well that do not mean that we should not listen to producer when they highlight problem with the scheme we create for instance the government extend producer responsibility scheme which be mean to introduce financial responsibility across the full lifecycle of product there be sometimes issue with the implementation of scheme be hear from pub and the hospitality industry about the undue burden that can be place on small business and we need to work out mechanism for correct unintended consequence of such policy the hon member be make very good speech agree with he about the need to take the public and business with we in scotland we have real challenge with the deposit return scheme that the scottish government try to impose because business be up in arm about it and it be go to impact on the internal market do he agree that that be an example of where it can go very badly wrong if we do not take the public and business with we do agree if we close our ear we will miss these problem frustrate the public and lose their support if we listen hard we can fix the scheme and rescue the action we want to take in this place to help the whole environment if we do not do that the other side will win the argument and shut down the sort of initiative we need to see we need to keep listen as we introduce these scheme and make sure that the public and small business do not feel fatigued by they hope be make clear that this be not just about treaty and target but about protect our river and ocean across the world it be about link to our community and maintain their support and listen to the voice of young people like those in year at culvers house primary school want to end with something that have definitely steal from work experience student this week she say to that we be burden future generation with plastic debt and it be about time we start pay it back thank the right hon member for orkney and shetland mr carmichael for bring forward this important debate plastic pollution be global problem that require international co ordination and think everyone in this house be agree on that it be serious issue and as be the case with many member it be one that my constituent really care about particularly young people who have contact about this issue over recent week this uk government have already set out plan to end our throwaway society and stop the avalanche of rubbish that be fill our street river and ocean if may want to talk briefly about some action that the welsh labour government have take to tackle plastic pollution wales become the first nation in the uk to ban single use plastic in as part of the government effort to tackle the climate and nature crisis and reduce plastic pollution item such as polystyrene cup balloon stick and cotton bud stick can no long be sell or supply in wales the welsh government have also announce plan to go far and ban wet wipe that contain plastic that have target date of december be delighted that the welsh government have just agree to accelerate plan for deposit return scheme as it will enable scheme to be bring forward on uk wide basis at the same time wales be rank second in the world for recycle rate which we be all very proud of want to put on record my thank to some of the organisation in my constituency that have do stellar job in raise awareness of issue around plastic pollution and tackle behaviour change thank the plastic free communities initiative in betws coed and the village around there and thank the north wales wildlife trust which organise an annual beach clean up trash free trails have also do lot of work in this area also want to mention bangor university where the plastic research centre of wales be base which have do lot of work on our microplastic as mention by my hon friend the members for south derbyshire samantha niblett and for stafford leigh ingham microplastic be huge issue they have even be find on remote lake near the top of yr wyddfa mount snowdon it be super topic that the centre be dedicate to carry out research on do my hon friend agree that the work of community group such as the three town clean up crew in my constituency and think about plastic arran be crucial to fight the blight of plastic pollution and the terrible effect it be have on marine life and the wide environment absolutely agree with my hon friend community group across the country whether in wales scotland or england all play vital role in raise awareness and clean up beach that be really important for wildlife which be often the victim of plastic pollution piece of research publish by bangor university this year show that the combined effect of ocean warming and microplastic pollution could severely damage marine ecosystem in particular with significant consequence not just for the climate but food security professor christian dunn co author of this research say this be wake up call but also call to action we be all agree that we need urgent global action to guard against plastic pollution and that we need to work together to find solution look forward to the minister comment particularly ahead of the vital meeting that will happen in geneva next month be delighted to hear about all the work go on in the hon lady community that be also happen across the country dawlish against plastic and plastic free newton abbot be in my constituency however the marine conservation society write to to say that plastic pollution on uk beach rise by between and indeed in devon an average of item of plastic be pick up on every metre of beach do she agree that we must deal with the situation not only in our community but internationally agree perhaps the minister could address that issue when he respond to the debate make my comment in the context of my declaration in the register of members financial interests thank the right hon member for orkney and shetland mr carmichael for secure the debate it be on an issue that resonate strongly with many resident in edinburgh south west it be not an overstatement to say that be inundate with email on it plastic be everywhere as we have already hear they be in construction healthcare clothing and furniture it be estimate that about million tonne of microplastic be lie on the ocean floor right now and the fashion industry be among the big source my former colleague at heriot watt university in my constituency dr mark hartl be part of team who find microplastic in green mussel sell in traditional seafood market in jakarta they estimate that the human intake of microplastic from mussel ingestion range from to microplastic item per person per year mark be also part of team that identify microplastic in seagrass in the deerness sound area of the constituency of the right hon member for orkney and shetland it be find adhere to the blade of the seagrass in some case elsewhere in heriot watt university small team head by dr lisa macintyre an associate professor of textile at the university school of textile and design in galashiels in the constituency of the hon member for berwickshire roxburgh and selkirk john lamont who be also in his place have oversee painstaking research to co develop the world first visual fibre fragmentation scale that be really important work because fashion designer be not sure how many of they we have in the chamber can use it when select fabric for their design to understand how likely it be that those small fibre will fall off we know that clothing be not the only problem global plastic production be set to triple over the next three decade as we have hear but our waste management structure be ill prepared to deal with that loom threat it be therefore right that we take the plastic treaty seriously do my hon friend share my horror that global plastic production will double by he say that his constituent in edinburgh south west feel strongly about this can assure he that people across edinburgh do will he join in call for global plastic treaty that the government should take forward as priority agree with my hon friend know that it be important to his constituency because can remember how people be really concerned about plastic cotton bud get wash up on portobello beach thankfully through change that be now much rare but it be still an issue in scotland alone it be estimate that we generate around tonne of plastic packaging item annually and as of we be recycle only about tonne of that each month scotland export about tonne of waste to different part of the uk and right across the world that be an export that be not proud of poor planning on the part of the scottish government mean that by the start of next year tonne of waste day will be move from scotland to england to be process that be clearly not sustainable but it seem that we have become all too comfortable recycling be matter of out of sight out of mind we have to remember that once we lose sight of our waste in many case we also lose control of what be happen to it many resident write to about that even if we be to develop the processing capacity at home deal with plastic will always be problem so long as our consumption remain high so much strong focus need to be place on reuse and develop circular economy as we hear early not just in scotland but throughout the uk in my constituency be proud to say that have several organisation that promote reuse range from share library to repair and reuse charity recently spend an afternoon tour one such venture call the forge pop up community maker space base in renovated shipping container on site in fountainbridge next to the canal and just along from my office it provide tool facility and training to people from all walk of life include student artist do it yourself enthusiast and homeless people when visit there be young man make hat block think it be for he to store his hat on but he intend to make pirate hat for pirate festival of all thing try to google where the pirate festival be but it turn out that pirate festival be quite common so it could have be almost anywhere arrr thank you as well as the hat block also see table chest of drawer and even kitchen utensil be make we could drastically cut our overreliance on plastic if we have more such initiative they empower we to create our own long last alternative reuse material and develop lifelong skill in the process another charity in edinburgh south west one that be under little bit of pressure just now be four square edinburgh furniture initiative it largely sell use furniture and household item and it use its income non trivial amount of money to help solve edinburgh housing crisis it be an absolutely fantastic project as note the plastic consumption and processing economy operate across border make this an issue that require truly join up approach that be why fully support deposit return scheme that cover the entirety of the uk look forward to its introduction in that may not be quick enough for some people and respect that but we have to balance the press need for change with the economic reality for small business which will have to adapt to the new regulation as other have say if hon member want to see how not to do this they should just look to the scottish government its scheme be an absolute embarrassment proper consultation be important and think scotland have show that on global level be proud that the government have fully recognise the importance of tackle plastic pollution through internationally bind treaty at the un talk hold in south korea last year we support draft text on legally bind global reduction in plastic production and on phase out certain harmful chemical and single use plastic unfortunately consensus could not be reach largely due to the usual suspect china and russia among they all push back against those target the negotiation will remain highly contentious as long as those country whose economy be heavily reliant on plastic want to hang on to it have read dr lindner evidence to the environment food and rural affairs committee early this week think an inclusive two tier model could go some way towards resolve those disagreement if we can not get those country to be as bold and ambitious as hope the uk be some may see that as compromise that let major polluter off the hook but believe that international co operation be vital and similar model have work well in get those nation sign up to some kind of baseline target it would help break the deadlock and allow high ambition state like hope the uk to set and hit bold target lead by example something be well than nothing we must make progress on this issue and global treaty be essential if we want to protect our planet and the health of future generation be delighted to see that my hon friend the minister with whom serve in the shadow department for environment food and rural affairs team for three year will respond to the debate look forward to that with less than one month to go until the next round of the un plastic treaty talk in geneva we must ensure that the international and domestic focus keep we on track we must also ensure that the uk delegation priority be clear so thank everybody for take part in today debate keep on track be difficult when the number of fossil fuel lobbyist present at the talk rise in each and every round those lobbyist seek to derail the talk and to prevent any limit to plastic production be agree we have see this before with the tobacco industry we can not allow private interest that be damaging to health to take precedence and we can not allow the mismanagement of plastic plastic leakage into the environment and the associated colossal greenhouse gas emission towards the end of my time on the environmental audit committee we undertake an inquiry on plastic waste this be in in the three year since it be publish little have change recycle plastic be difficult globally only of plastic have ever be recycle furthermore the carbon emission associate with plastic outstrip those from the entire global aviation and shipping industry approximately of the plastic packaging waste generate in the uk be export for recycling or so we think that be what we call the uk plastic recycling capacity gap the uk have one of the high per capita plastic waste level in the world cheap single use packaging be incentivise over unpackaged product or investment into reuse and recycling and wide circular economy initiative which the government be seek to champion on the eac we find that much export waste be just be dump with no prospect of recycling people diligently recycle at home in the uk would be rightly appal if they see what be happen to the plastic they put in their bin green bin in leeds for recycling to support our uk delegation and address this issue head on the uk should take lead on the international stage in secure global legally bind target to cut plastic production our recycling and waste treatment industry be hugely supportive of the propose treaty set out at the discussion and support bind target to reduce global virgin plastic production the government need to support the policy measure necessary to make that workable in practice if the government develop clear road map for implement the policy require to deliver domestic circular economy for plastic they could set binding viable target for reduce virgin plastic production they could also set out clear policy intervention to stimulate end market demand for recycle plastic and create the condition for major new investment in plastic sort and reprocess infrastructure so that we end the plastic recycling capacity gap in the uk create job in plastic reprocess ensure quality and ensure that plastic be be recycle not just dump that would be great british plastic initiative the uk export approximately of its plastic packaging waste we must set out proposal for clamp down on illegitimate export of plastic waste be dump overseas while the vast majority of plastic waste export from the uk be for reprocessing which be manage in an environmentally sound manner there have be instance in the past few year where illegitimate export of low grade plastic have be dump or burn overseas robust and properly resource regulator could be empower to enforce the right standard and clamp down on illegal waste export we must end plastic dumping the uk government have already implement strong step to improve the quantity and quality of plastic send for recycling however government need to address fossil fuel influence in politic particularly in the international plastic treaty negotiation that be the only way we can deliver circular economy for plastic there need to be sustainable long term demand for any recycled product create otherwise we will carry on with the unsustainable practice of use virgin plastic and the fossil fuel industry will continue to have an international influence on our un process call the liberal democrat spokesperson warmly congratulate my right hon friend the member for orkney and shetland mr carmichael on secure this important debate and thank all member who have contribute rarely do have the privilege of be part of debate in which there be such consensus though we have not hear from the conservative front benchers yet assume that there be broad consensus that should give the government strong hand allow it to be tough negotiator in the global plastic treaty talk global plastic production and waste have double in the last year most of what be say have already be say that be the beauty of wind up speech accord to my hon friend the member for carshalton and wallington bobby dean the figure stand at million tonne of plastic have another statistic for he in the bbc report that there be more than trillion piece of plastic float in the world ocean that be no way to treat our precious planet indeed it put countless specie at risk of extinction the global plastic treaty offer unique opportunity for global united nations lead treaty through which all country be hold to high common standard on plastic consumption the treaty would create level playing field incentivise and support international action and forge clear path toward future free from plastic pollution we liberal democrats have be instrumental in the campaign to finalise the treaty and be look towards next month negotiation in geneva in which we will hope reach breakthrough it be not just in this chamber that there be great consensus on this issue the majority of the uk public the majority of member state government the business community and civil society be all push in the same direction more than country support legally bind global target to cut plastic production the uk must retain its ambition on this key issue be one of mp who have sign greenpeace pledge which state support strong global target to cut plastic production last year quarter of million people take part in the big plastic count an initiative run by greenpeace and everyday plastic to count each piece of plastic and show the scale of the crisis in the uk we have hear from many member about how concerned the public be about this issue and about their constituent take part in clean up action greenpeace be rightly concerned that in each further round of talk more fossil fuel lobbyist seek to derail negotiation and prevent any limit to plastic production from be agree the government should look closely at precedent for how to prevent the influence of lobbyist over international agreement the framework convention on tobacco control for example recognise the lobby tactic of the tobacco industry and require party to act to protect these policy from commercial and other vested interest government across the globe must address the influence of fossil fuel in politic and put the interest of people before polluter we must also address funding sustainable treaty that be build to last for generation must include strong dedicated multilateral fund without substantial financial package the treaty will impose obligation on country particularly those in the global south with which they will struggle to comply the reality of the climate crisis globally mean that country will have to find money to clean up the mess that polluter have create the government should look for way to place that financial burden mainly on the plastic industry which have make billion in profit recognise that it be important to work with industry but this be ultimately about the polluter pay principle though of course we need to bring industry with we to create practical and workable solution that do not flop will touch on one issue that have not be mention but which constituent have raise with plastic pollution from chew gum be alert to it by keir carnie one of my bath constituent the founder of plant base chew gum company nuud gum many of we be completely unaware that chew gum be in fact single use plastic it commonly contain synthetic polymer plastic material derive from fossil fuel and find in product such as carrier bag glue and car tyre in the uk over billion piece of plastic gum be consume annually the majority of which end up as biodegradable plastic pollution that gum break down into microplastic contaminate soil waterway and wildlife gum pollution be also one of the uk most pervasive type of litter and cost local council over million per year in removal effort be sure that every one of we remember an annoying moment when we have to pick off piece of gum from under our shoe despite its similarity to other ban single use plastic such as straw and cotton bud chew gum have evade regulation as with single use vape the uk have great opportunity to lead again in environmental and public health protection urge the government to look into this issue and be happy to put they in contact with my constituent who could provide evidence and support on what can be do we be at pivotal moment the scale and urgency of the plastic pollution crisis demand bold co ordinate global action the treaty must be not only ambitious but fair with proper funding and protection against vested interest the uk must show leadership in the upcoming talk champion strong new global treaty that tackle plastic pollution at every stage of its lifecycle so that future generation can enjoy the beautiful planet that we still enjoy just about today call the shadow minister begin my remark by acknowledge an interest in this area my family own and operate plastic recycling business though make it clear to the house that be not directly involve in the management of the business nor do have any financial interest in it thank the right hon member for orkney and shetland mr carmichael for secure this really important debate all member have make hugely valuable contribution the right hon member speak about the importance of responsibility for not only stakeholder but wide industry and indeed policymaker in the light of the upcoming negotiation on the global plastic treaty it be an important time to have this debate before come to the potential treaty it be worth take moment to consider some of the domestic context to our national relationship with plastic and that bring on to the other contribution the hon member for stafford leigh ingham rightly raise concern about microplastic which have be mention by many member in this house the hon member for honiton and sidmouth richard foord talk about the challenge of plastic litter and plastic waste in his constituency and he rightly call on the government to hold china to account in their global discussion my hon friend the member for berwickshire roxburgh and selkirk john lamont rightly raise the importance that young people place on reduce plastic usage and he mention the concern and letter that have be submit to he by various school in his constituency as do the hon member for carshalton and wallington bobby dean the hon member for stratford and bow uma kumaran who be not in her place raise the importance of ban single use vape and the work of local business and organisation in her constituency include abba voyage which have see and note its work to reduce plastic waste the hon member for melksham and devizes brian mathew focus on regulation and the importance of this place have an influence on the global plastic treaty the hon member for south derbyshire samantha niblett rightly raise her staunch objection to the incineration of plastic waste and agree with she in my constituency of keighley and ilkley planning application for an incinerator be approve by labour run bradford council have be staunchly against that and wish she well in her local campaign the hon member for bangor aberconwy claire hughes talk about research undertake by professor christian dunn at bangor university which hope the minister will look at the hon member for edinburgh south west dr arthur and his neighbour the hon member for edinburgh east and musselburgh chris murray talk about the importance of progress conversation on the global plastic treaty and the need for great focus on the concern of their constituent raise today by the strong voice of their edinburgh representative the hon member for leeds central and headingley alex sobel talk about the importance of reduce virgin plastic production and the need for real focus on increase recycling rate finally the hon member for north ayrshire and arran irene campbell reference the importance of local group that drive forward change for decade we have use plastic in ever more role and in ever great amount indeed plastic have replace many everyday item that once be make from paper glass or metal plastic may have be the way forward then but that do not mean it need be the way forward now for everything for that reason welcome the important step that be take by the previous conservative government plastic straw drink stirrer and single use plastic bag be all notorious for pollute our natural environment and it be therefore right that effort be take to ban they in fact the plastic bag charge have successfully see plastic bag usage reduce by other restriction on single use plastic cutlery cup tray plate and many other item be now in force with the ban have an important effect on reduce residual waste residual waste be key we know that the uk produce huge amount of plastic waste as much as the second most per capita globally but we also know that due to strong environmental protection very little of that waste be now handle irresponsibly of course there be always more to be do for comparison of the plastic in the ocean originate from asia compare with just from europe reduce residual waste must be the key pillar of any international treaty on plastic waste the previous government understand that when they legislate in the environment act to halve residual waste and trust that the minister will be able to reassure we that it remain the key goal of this government the hon gentleman be talk well about the general state of plastic in the world but we be debate the global plastic treaty can he confirm whether his party support the uk be signatory will come on to those point but first want to outline the nature of the debate because it be important to recognise the contribution that have be make we know that reduce our plastic use be vital for two key reason the first be the impact on the environment it be estimate that as many as million seabird die each year as result of entanglement in plastic in fact at current rate of increase the weight of plastic in the ocean will outweigh all fish by plastic also pollute our inland waterway have detrimental impact on nearby area especially when we consider the long term chemical effect of decomposition the second reason be the grow body of research show that long term exposure to plastic be bad for our health particularly microplastic as the hon member for stafford mention everything from hair loss to fatigue heart condition and stroke have be link to microplastic what be most concern be that while the health link may not yet be fully understand we know that microplastic persist for century not only in the environment but in our body as we use more plastic through our life these level build potentially increase the risk that be precisely why secure an effective global framework to reduce plastic use be key the resolution pass in be an encouraging first step and show clearly that country across the world recognise the challenge and wish to tackle it crucially this global support for progress on plastic be key to ensure that standard be raise uniformly and that the risk that plastic waste be simply offshore be significantly reduce we simply must not offshore our responsibility equally we must be realistic about how we manage plastic we must recognise that unilaterally ban or heavily restrict many type of plastic will leave we uncompetitive on the global stage we must work with other nation and bring those that be sceptical along with we that scepticism be precisely why we must use the negotiation on this treaty to take these matter forward and to make they concrete we can not simply have goal or aspiration we must have verifiable target that can be measure so that we can hold organisation and stakeholder to account naturally we should then expect all signatory to fulfil those obligation hope the government be able to confirm that they will push for the inclusion of these measure in the treaty as they continue to negotiate to ensure compliance by ourselves and other partner we must continue to work not only on the global plastic treaty but to improve our plastic waste record at home we must continue to invest in our sort and volume capacity within the recycling sector to ensure that the amount of recycling continue to go up and to reduce the amount go to landfill plastic pollution be not go away many plastic will be with we for thousand of year so it be vital that we act to stop the flow of waste into our environment when discussion be reopen next month in geneva hope that the minister will be in attendance and that the government will be successful in secure the robust and practical treaty that we all hope to see it be pleasure to respond to the debate so ably introduce by the right hon member for orkney and shetland mr carmichael he along with every member from across the chamber who make contribution point out the seriousness of the issue and the urgent need for action plastic pollution be one of the big environmental issue that we face today once hail as miracle of modern invention plastic be now one of our planet most persistent threat its great strength durability have become its dark flaw these material be design to last and do just that for century they do not simply disappear but break down into tiny fragment as my hon friend the member for stafford leigh ingham so ably point out and these microplastic invade our beach river field and even our body from the depth of the ocean to the cell of living creature plastic pollution be everywhere for too long plastic have litter our ocean and threaten our wildlife amount of plastic enter the ocean be predict to triple by compare with that be unacceptable plastic pollution do not respect boundary we urgently need to agree plastic treaty to enable global action to address this so with that in mind thank the right hon member for orkney and shetland and his committee for their recent inquiry into the treaty and for their letter of recommendation for the forthcoming negotiation on an international treaty to end plastic pollution it be very timely input and read it with interest as we finalise our preparation for the negotiation look forward to respond more fully in due course but the committee can be assure that this government be take every step to ensure that we secure an ambitious and effective global plastic pollution treaty this will be both tool for move towards circular economy and an opportunity to showcase some of the domestic action that the uk have take circular economy be key to deliver our government plan for change to grow the economy increase environmental resilience and improve the life of hard work people around the country that be why our circular economy taskforce have bring together expert from across government industry academia and civil society to develop the first circular economy strategy for england it will include road map on chemical and plastic deliver growth and fundamentally shift our relationship with the good that we use every day end our throwaway society and stop the avalanche of rubbish that be fill up our high street countryside and ocean make reuse and repair the norm and end the throwaway society circular economy be an opportunity to grow our economy and make it more resilient to improve life in every part of the united kingdom and to protect our environment for generation to come domestically the government be already work with the devolve government to legislate across the uk for the ban on wet wipe contain plastic from june this year the sale and supply of single use vape be ban across the uk the deposit return scheme for single use plastic and metal drink container in england northern ireland and scotland will launch in october which will drive our effort to stop litter fill up our street river and ocean be grateful for the point make by my hon friend the member for edinburgh south west dr arthur about the story in scotland additionally the extend producer responsibility for packaging come into effect on january this year it will move the full cost of deal with household packaging waste away from local taxpayer and on to the packaging producer themselves be pleased to hear the comment make by my hon friend the member for bangor aberconwy claire hughes about the great success of the labour government work with people in wales on issue around recycling the epr scheme be obviously welcome and liberal democrat members know the intention but the scheme appear to have some unintended effect the scheme will not only impact producer but small business hospitality business in particular who have raise their concern will the minister continue to listen to those business and try to adjust the scheme so it work for they as well of course absolutely we be always work in collaboration and we will do everything we can to ensure that it be an important principle that have be establish and be determined to ensure that it be successful next month at the resume fifth session of the intergovernmental negotiating committee we will have once in lifetime opportunity to agree an ambitious and effective international agreement to end plastic pollution we want treaty that tackle the full life cycle of plastic and promote circular economy the uk have be key advocate for an effective treaty throughout and be found member of the high ambition coalition to end plastic pollution coalition of nearly country from across all region of the world at the uk join over other ambitious country to make clear the weight of support for an ambitious treaty recently at the un ocean conference in nice we join nearly country in sign the nice wake up call for an ambitious international treaty to end plastic pollution those demonstrate the commitment to reach an agreement at in august and the weight of support for an ambitious treaty be proud of the leadership role that the uk have take in the negotiation and we continue to take significant action to drive ambition and demonstrate leadership the minister be right to highlight the lead role that the uk have play in this matter under both the current government and in particular the previous government the last negotiation and progress towards the treaty come to halt because russia iran and saudi arabia basically impose time limit which mean that the treaty could not be agree what discussion be take place behind the scene to ensure that country like those three will not do the same and stall our agreement on the treaty this time be grateful for the hon gentleman well inform intervention assure he that negotiation and discussion be ongoing and we be determined to ensure that we get good outcome as well as lead early work to develop criterion for problematic plastic product since the second negotiating session the uk be co lead work with chile to progress discussion on product design and co lead work

this issue my hon friend the member for kingston upon hull west and haltemprice emma hardy recently co host ministerial event at the un ocean conference to bring together minister from range of country represent all region and ambition level to discuss the most challenging issue as we look forward to august it be clear that divergent view remain on key issue such as phase out problematic product how we approach the production of plastic and finance the treaty however it be our sense that the majority of country want to reach an agreement at and there have be substantial discussion of how the treaty address plastic production many party believe that plastic production be outside the scope of the agreement however the uk have be clear that the treaty should address the full life cycle of plastic include sustainable production and consumption at we will continue to work on that basis to ensure that the treaty send signal to spur investment in the market for recycled plastic and to collect the datum we need to ensure that the treaty work provision on problematic plastic product will be one of the core treaty provision and the uk have work with brazil to carry out technical work to support that provision the uk have also support the call from country in busan for clear legally bind obligation to phase out the most harmful plastic product and chemical of concern in plastic good progress be make at on text that provide basis for further discussion the key will be strike the right balance between national measure and harmonised global approach and ensure that measure be base on science we be work with chile to promote an effective provision on the design of plastic product to keep they in use for long and make they easy to recycle we recognise the importance of mobilise support for the country most in need of agreement implementation that be an essential element of an effective treaty the uk support the use of the global environment facility to support the implementation of the treaty that will avoid further fragmentation of the environmental financial architecture and allow for synergy with funding for climate and nature as we have hear plastic pollution be broad issue with huge variety of actor across the plastic value chain to mobilise the resource need at scale we must draw on an equally broad range of funding source public and private domestic and international the uk be the large donor to the global plastic action partnership contribute some million that partnership bring together government business and civil society to tackle plastic pollution and increase investment in the circular economy in country eligible for official development assistance to end plastic pollution we need all actor in the plastic value chain to act and we need to bring everyone along with we that include the marginalised undervalue and unrecognised waste picker most of whom be woman they handle more than half the world plastic waste for recycling so it be really important that their voice be hear it be essential that the treaty we agree be responsive to change and emerge evidence it can not operate effectively if one member have de facto veto as such we need effective decision make process include the possibility of vote on conference of the party decision and amendment to annex once all option for achieve consensus have be exhaust one thing be clear address the problem of plastic pollution require joint effort between government industry academia and civil society we have partner with the ocean plastics leadership network to run the uk treaty dialogue ahead of each round of negotiation those dialogue have include actor at all stage of the plastic value chain as well as academia and environmental non governmental organisation they have help we to understand diverse view on the treaty which in turn have inform our approach to negotiation in june my ministerial colleague and hon friend the member for kingston upon hull west and haltemprice host business roundtable to discuss how the private sector can support an ambitious plastic pollution treaty it be the second plastic treaty business roundtable and bring together business from across the plastic value chain those roundtable be attend by his excellency ambassador vayas the inc chair twenty lead business have now sign statement call for an effective treaty and four non private sector organisation have endorse that statement the government be also clear that any treaty must be inform by science and note the comment make on that topic by my hon friend the member for stratford and bow uma kumaran in that regard we be deeply concerned to hear of the threat face by scientist an issue that have be raise by number of contributor to this debate those threat be unacceptable we remain steadfast in our commitment to the multilateral system and to an open transparent and inclusive process this have be timely debate as we approach final negotiation in geneva while there be many challenge to overcome vast amount of work be under way to find solution to the many remain issue hear the strong call from my hon friend the member for south derbyshire samantha niblett and my hon friend the member for leeds central and headingley alex sobel and be confident that we can secure robust and effective treaty that be what the uk team will be push for in geneva again thank the right hon member for orkney and shetland for secure this debate thank everybody who have take part in this debate it have be quite remarkable exercise and an enormously valuable one every contribution have be truly excellent we have hear from member represent constituency in scotland wales and england we have not have anybody from northern ireland but should place on the record that have see on the annunciator that the hon member for strangford jim shannon have be in westminster hall this afternoon it have also be noteworthy for the fact that at time of year when we all get bit tired and scratchy we have have remarkable consensus and good natured debate in closing want to address myself to not just the people in the chamber but those who might be watch from outside the evidence session that our select committee hold last week be not an easy one to pull together especially when it come to bring in corporate interest coca cola turn up and to its credit have decent story to tell ineo turn up and might or might not have have good story to tell it could not quite remember the people who we really want to get be from unilever but apparently everybody in unilever have go to india for the day so they could not appear before the committee we will return to this they can run but they can not hide in the past we have see not just the national but the corporate influence that have stand in the way of progress if those corporate interest be watch our proceeding today they should hear very loud and clear message that we be watch they if they again stand in the way of make progress on something that matter to this house and to the people who send we here we will see they and there will be commercial price for they to pay for stand in the way of progress question put and agree to resolve that this house have consider the global plastics treaty future of the church of england motion make and question propose that this house do now mather it be an honour to stand here in this empty chamber to speak about the original purpose of this space when it be chapel in the church of england the old chamber of the house of commons on which this space be model after the great fire of be st stephen chapel formerly royal church it be give by the heir of henry viii to parliament to serve as its debating chamber madam deputy speaker your chair stand on the altar step the table with the dispatch boxes be where the lectern stand mention that because the link between this place and the church of england be not merely ceremonial the prayers we say here at the start of every day be not just nod to tradition our democracy be found on christian faith this parliament remain the law give power of the church of england we in this place have the responsibility to approve or disapprove the doctrine and the rule of the church and that be as it should be because the church of england be not some private club or just another eccentric denomination the church be chaplain to the nation and through the parish system in which every square inch of england have its local church and its local priest we be all member we all belong even if you never set foot in your church from one year to the next and even if you do not believe in its teaching it be your church and you be its member when speak of the church of england today be not speak about the internal politic of the anglican sect speak of the common creed of our country the official religion of the english and the british nation and the institution old than the monarchy and much old than parliament which make this country it be no surprise that both the church and the country itself be in bad way divide internally confused and badly lead the church be rive by deep dispute over doctrine and governance and be literally leaderless with even the process of choose the next archbishop of canterbury unclear confused and contend the country itself reflect that unclear in its doctrine and its governance profoundly precarious chronically expose to threat from without and within it be at risk economically culturally socially and would say morally last month in the space of three day in one infamous week this house authorise the killing of unborn child of nine month old baby and it pass bill to allow the killing of the elderly and disabled describe those law in those stark term not to provoke further controversy but because those be the fact we give our consent to the great crime the killing of the weak and most defenceless human being it be great sin if stand here have any power to repent on behalf of this house hereby repent of what we do in the reaction to these vote and all around we in reaction to the state of the country and the world something else be happen there be great hunger in society for well way of living and want to use this opportunity to explain what that well way be and why we here in england have the mean to follow it the jewish and christian god be god of nation he be interested in people as individual but also as group as community not only of kinship but of common worship with common god uniquely among the nation of the world this nation england from which the united kingdom grow be found and create consciously on the basis of the bible and the story of the hebrew people in that sense england be the old christian country and the prototype of nation across the west the story of england be the story of christianity operate on people to make the institution and culture that have be uniquely stable and successful the western model be forge and refine in england over thousand year from the to the century what be that model it be simply this that power should arrange itself for the benefit of all the people under it and specifically for the poor and weak that the law be there to protect the ordinary person against the abuse of power and that every individual have equal dignity and freedom include crucially the freedom of conscience religion and belief which make space for other religion under the christian shield secular space indeed the idea of secular space be christian concept that be meaningful only in christian world these be idea that only make sense if one accept that we have some intrinsic value value that be give to we and be not of our own making or invention throughout the long year from the time of alfred to the time of victoria it be assume that nation be community of common worship and that our community this country worship the christian god then in the century another idea arise that it be possible for country to be neutral about god that the public square be empty of any metaphysics and that the route to freedom lay through the desert of materialism and individual hell below we above we only sky that idea be wrong the horror of the century attest to that not least in the west where we escape totalitarianism but have suffer our own catastrophe of social breakdown social injustice loneliness and emptiness on chronic scale ugly and aggressive new threat be now arise because we have find that in the absence of the christian god we do not have pluralism and tolerance with everyone be nice to each other in godless world all politic be religious and in abandon one religion we simply create space for other to move into my hon friend be make very moving and powerful speech our head of state who be also the head of the church of england represent the right of all people to live in free society and to worship freely it be because our head of state be also the head of our establish church that there be protection for all religion and denomination in our constitution the cross be on the top of the crown that he wear which demonstrate that the christian faith be the basis of our constitution our custom our heritage and our british way of life do my hon friend agree my hon friend will not be surprised to hear that do agree with he he make the point very well and absolutely acknowledge it the paradox of our constitution be that under monarchy we have system with the most developed political freedom in the world and that under an establish church we have tradition of freedom of conscience and belief in which all religion can be accommodate it be because the cross be at the centre and notice that the cross be above your chair too madam deputy speaker as be say in abandon one religion we simply create space for other to move into as the dominant faith there be two religion move into the space from which christianity have be eject and one be islam in debate yesterday say how much find myself in agreement with muslim colleague in parliament on moral and social matter but as have be say this be christian country if it be country at all and can not be indifferent to the extent of the growth of islam in recent decade it be the other religion that worry even more this other religion be hybrid of old and new idea and it do not have proper name do not think that woke do justice to its seriousness it be combination of ancient paganism christian heresy and the cult of modernism all mash up into deeply mistaken and deeply dangerous ideology of power that be hostile to the essential object of our affection and our loyalty family community and nation it be explicitly and most passionately hostile to christianity as the wellspring of the west that religion unlike islam must simply be destroy at least as public doctrine it must be banish from public life from school and university and from business and public service it need to be send back to the fringe of eccentricity like the modern druid who invest stonehenge in my constituency with theology that be see as mad but harmless because its follower be so few and no one serious take they seriously we can no long pretend as people do in the century that we can be neutral or indifferent to god or to the public square be godless desert the fact be that the strong god be back and we have to choose which god to worship suggest we worship the god who come in the weak form jesus christ this god be jealous god it be he or nothing and we have to own our christian story or repudiate it not to own it be to repudiate it and to repudiate christianity be not only to sever ourselves from our past but to cut off the source of all the thing we value now and that we need in the future such as freedom tolerance individual dignity and human right without the christian god in whose teach these thing have their source these be invention mere non existent aspiration to worship human right be to worship fairy but if we own our story and remember the real source of our civilisation we can have these thing and make they real real freedom and tolerance and dignity culture of love and crucially culture of humanity we be in the age of the machine and great choice confront we whether to make machine in the image of fallen man bent on exploitation and domination with mankind in its sight or to make they what they properly be the servant of mankind able to help we make well world to conclude wind be blow storm be come and when it hit we be go to learn if our house be build on rock or on sand but we have be here before the reformer of the and the century the puritans in the century the evangelicals in the century all bring this country back from the edge from idolatry error or just plain indifference and from all the social and political crisis that indifference to christianity bring about and they each in their generation restore this country to itself new restoration be need now with revival of the faith recovery of christian politic and re founding of this nation on the teaching that alfred make the basis of the common law of england all those century ago this be mission for the church under its next leader whoever that be it be mission for this place the old chapel that become the wellspring of western democracy and for we its members and it be mission for our whole country it be the route to prosperous modernity found on respect for human dignity responsibility for the create world and the worship of god thank the hon member for east wiltshire danny kruger for secure this important debate on the future of the church of england be grateful for the opportunity to respond on behalf of the government the hon member have often speak very powerfully about the importance of faith its role in public life and the benefit it bring today he have speak eloquently on the positive role that christianity play in our wide society which believe be sentiment share across the house anyone involve in local life know just how essential be christian place of worship and the people who support they they run school and toddler group support food bank and reach out to those face homelessness they offer comfort and companionship to those who be isolate grieve or just struggle to cope the truth be simple without they much of our local life simply would not function their contribution be not just appreciate but indispensable the christian faith have play central role in public life and it continue to do so the hon member be but one of number of example of good public servant motivate by their christian faith in the cause of the common good our society be enrich by those contribution it be equally enrich by people from wide range of background heritage and indeed faith and belief right across this house see member of the protestant catholic like myself jewish muslim and sikh faith community and those of other faith and indeed none who be all motivated towards the betterment of the people we serve for the benefit of the house will briefly outline the constitutional arrangement between the establish church parliament and the executive these arrangement have deep root and have evolve over many century much of our constitution be base on combination of common law statute convention and principle as the establish church the church of england have historically be subject to parliamentary legislation however since the enable act of the church of england assembly powers act much of its governance have be delegate to its own body the general synod while the synod manage its internal affair its measures still require parliament approval and royal assent as hon member will know the lords spiritual bishop of the church sit in the house of lords by right the government believe they offer unique and value spiritual perspective there be still many way in which the church and parliament remain closely connected the government reflect that great example be the lords spiritual women act extension act which be skilfully steer through the house last year by the parliamentary secretary cabinet office my hon friend the member for erith and thamesmead ms oppong asare the act request by the church of england extend for five more year the arrangement allow female bishop to sit in the house of lords as lords spiritual in fact it recently enable the right sophie jelley the new bishop of coventry to take her seat in the other place the church also have presence in this house through the second church estates commissioner be pleased that the second church estates commissioner my hon friend the member for battersea marsha de cordova do so much work in that regard serve as vital link between parliament and the church and ensure that the church commissioners remain accountable to the house the executive in particular the prime minister and the lord chancellor play key role in appoint senior clergy while bishop be formally appoint by the sovereign that be do on the prime minister advice follow recommendation from the crown nominations commission the sovereign as supreme governor of the church of england remain central to those arrangement in highlight some of the way the church parliament and the executive be intertwine hope to provide assurance to the hon member for east wiltshire that on the importance of the church of england and the christian faith more generally parliament and the executive be by no means wash their hand the church be streamline its national governance with plan approve by the synod early this week the proposal will soon come before parliament this mark another step in process begin in to create well governance structure that well support the church mission and its work regard the church future its day to day operation be of course not matter for the government however the government look forward to the church continue to evolve to meet the challenge of our time and to play an active role in public debate on the most important issue we face as nation my hon friend the member for east wiltshire danny kruger refer to the importance of the local parish across england the parish be central to everything the church and the local vicar be part of our community in fact we be very lucky in romford to have the church of st edward the confessor we have new vicar the jordan palmer who have just join our church do the minister agree that the parish be vital it be not just about the church community the member of the church it have wide responsibility to all people of all religion and no religion not just church of england member the church of england should cherish the importance of the parish as part of all our community in the constituency we represent believe that very strongly actually even member who be not church attender will take part in civic life at local level that be closely link to their local parish church think about remembrance sunday and the role parish church play in those reflection think about our own mayoral sunday which be celebrate every year where the mayor of the borough of oldham be the honorary church warden in the parish church regardless of individual faith and belief think it be accept and celebrate that parish church be significant part of local identity and place for all people to come together welcome the hon gentleman new church leader on that basis that be reflection of the value that we as parliament place on the church of england which be why bring the debate to the house today be so important thank the hon member for east wiltshire for do just that and hope he appreciate the response on behalf of the government question put and agree to house adjourn
