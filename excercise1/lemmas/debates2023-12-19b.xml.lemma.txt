on farm budget for the financial year very merry christmas mr speaker the government guarantee to maintain the billion annual budget for farmer across the uk for every year of this parliament as agriculture be devolve it be ultimately for the scottish government to decide how to allocate that money to farm in scotland the minister will be aware of the frustration that be feel by many farmer and crofter in scotland that the million that be give to the scottish government for specific purpose as part of the bew review have be defer hitherto what will she do in future to ensure that where money be give for the express purpose of support scottish agriculture it be in fact use for that purpose the right hon member raise an excellent question the snp government be yet to clarify when this ringfenced money will be return hope they will do so this afternoon at the budget call the snp spokesperson may echo your comment mr speaker with christmas wish for all the house staff your staff and member the uk government attempt to overhaul the eu subsidy scheme have leave english farmer bad off in cash term than in while the scottish government have seek to protect our farmer payment can the

question nor that of the right hon member for orkney and shetland mr carmichael about when the ringfenced money will be return order question be normally to the minister not the other way around very good point but still maintain that the hon member need to clarify that matter it be up to the scottish government if they would like at any point to top up the amount that go to scottish farming encourage they to do so this afternoon at the budget do not think any scottish farmer will be reassure by what the minister have just say just say that the scottish government be protect those farmer payment while english farmer be lose out as we know what we do not have from the uk government be detail on what they will be do after if we have remain in the european union we would know that figure for farming subsidy so that the scottish government could make plan to help farmer plan ahead can the minister apologise for that situation and guarantee that in the early month of next year we will have clarity on farming payment the uk government have lay out plan for the agriculture transition in england that go beyond the current spending review give farmer increase certainty over policy and spending intent for year to come the scottish government could decide to provide farmer in scotland with similar certainty if they choose to do so small business fiscal support what fiscal step his

autumn statement be huge success for small business across the country with the federation of small businesses describe it as game changer will my hon friend outline to the house how the autumn statement package will benefit those small business in my constituency on which my town and village rely thank my hon friend for his continue support for small business in his constituency measure in the autumn statement to help they include extend the retail hospitality and leisure relief for another year which will support around property in england that tax cut be worth nearly billion meanwhile by freeze the small business multipli for fourth consecutive year we will be protect more than million property from multipli increase other announcement that could benefit his constituent include the help to grow management and make smarter programme and move to tackle late payment the new day payment rule will apply to only few hundred company contract by the government yet microbusinesse which do not typically have government contract wait on average day for payment those business make up the majority of small business across our country why will the government not back the micro business alliance pay in day campaign as mention we be well aware of the issue of late payment and we be in constant dialogue with the key stakeholder in this area as well as colleague at the department for business and trade we will always keep an eye on the measure but the move we have already make to tackle late payment as announce recently will make big difference reduce taxes what step his department be take to reduce taxis what step his department be take to reduce taxis what step his department be take to reduce taxis thank to the difficult decision the government have take on inflation and debt the autumn statement this year be able to deliver the big package of tax cut to be score since very much welcome the tax cut recently announce by the chancellor and hope to see more announce soon especially rise in the high rate threshold as the conservatives look to reduce the tax burden on work people do the chancellor share my concern that billion year unfunded spending commitment would likely see taxis rise and lead to high interest rate if labour be ever in government it be not just but paul johnson of the institute for fiscal studies who when talk about labour plan have say that additional borrowing drive up interest rate which be of course back door tax rise on family with mortgage but as it be christmas perhaps could explain it this way if santa borrow billion he might have more toy to give out this year but he would also have debt interest to pay and few toy to give out next year record funding be go in to support the cost of childcare to allow more parent to stay in the workforce this be very welcome but the tax burden on single earner household put the choice to be stay at home parent beyond the reach of too many raise the young generation must count as top investment so may ask my right hon friend the chancellor what recent analysis have be undertake on the transferable allowance at up to per annum it be currently not design to facilitate that choice thank my hon friend for her question as she know the marriage allowance be currently per year and it have be fix at of the personal allowance since it be introduce in on this side of the house we believe it should be woman choice and we want to make that choice as real as possible for every family for that reason we think the good thing we can do be to bring down the taxis pay by work people to put more money into the family budget and we be happy to make start on that in the autumn statement like many of we in this place be big supporter of small business saturday and it be important to remember that small business be the backbone of local community all year round many be unlikely to be able to take advantage of the chancellor very generous and welcome expensing package so what additional measure will he continue to consider to support all business great and small include perhaps even corporation tax reduction thank my right hon friend for her question she will know that of trading business only pay the low corporation tax rate of that cover the vast majority of small business use to run my own business run it for year before come into parliament could not agree with her more small business be the backbone of the british economy which be why we be tackle the scourge of low payment and we roll over the discount on retail hospitality and leisure business rate in the autumn statement will the chancellor confirm how much high the tax burden be forecast to be at the end compare with at the start of this parliament what can confirm be that as result of the measure take in the autumn statement it will be low at the end of the scorecard period than it would otherwise have be and lot low than it would be under any labour government may ask the chancellor how many middle income taxpayer have be pay the high rate of tax since be happy to write to the hon gentleman with the exact number but for people on low income people be pay the low legally payable wage their post tax real income have go up by since because the conservative party believe in make work pay why be the fiscal situation strong enough to cut national insurance but not strong enough to return the overseas aid budget to of gni because the way we return the overseas aid budget to be to grow the economy by cut national insurance we put nearly more people into the national workforce fill nearly one in vacancy in company up and down the country banking services access what recent step he have take to help ensure people have access to banking service the government believe that all customer should have appropriate access to banking service which be why we have legislate to protect access to cash we also support the fca bank branch closure guidance as well as industry initiative to provide in person access include share banking hub at post office and access via digital mean more than bank branch have close since sadly the lloyds bank in withington village will join the many more branch close in the come month and leave withington without bank branch but by the end of the year the industry will have deliver only share banking hub do the minister think that the pace and scale of that roll out be good enough first it be worth state that as the hon gentleman know the decision on whether to open or close branch be commercial one and the government do not interfere with that however we have legislate to protect access for cash the bank need to abide by the financial conduct authority guidance with the late guidance publish only last week in relation to share banking hub we should indeed increase the pace at which they be roll out and be talk with the industry about how to do that it be pretty clear that most legacy bank do not give stuff about their customer and just want to screw as much money out of people as possible after the scandal of coutts debanking of nigel farage the government act swiftly to try to make that much more difficult for other customer but many business face the same problem what will the government do to stop business be debanke in the same way as individual be not sure that quite accept my hon friend characterisation of the banking industry but be happy to meet he and discuss the problem he outline in relation to specific business and access to bank account call the shadow minister before

banking hub be up and fully run that have leave countless people financially exclude and affect lot of small business ask the minister once again will he accelerate the roll out of banking hub properly why be his government not do anything to reverse the decline of the great british high street agree with the hon lady word about lord darling and echo the word of my right hon friend the chancellor on bank branch will repeat my position it be important that the government do not decide when branch open and when it close but it be concern when community be leave without appropriate access to cash that be why we be the first government to legislate for access to cash as we do early this year and that be why believe we should speed up the roll out of banking hub be work with the industry on way in which we can do that if the minister be serious about protect the future of the great british high street will he back labour pledge which have be welcome by cash access uk and the wide sector to guarantee face to face banking in every community and give the fca the power it need to roll out hundred of banking hub across the country as the hon lady know the industry lead the roll out of banking hub we be support it say this again to speed that up as much as possible have not see the labour pledge suspect that will not support it but it be important that the industry hear the view of constituent and member from across the house and that we speed up the roll out of banking hub in community that need they pension scheme incentivising uk investment what step his

kingdom what step can be take to ensure uk wide investment by pension scheme in cut edge business such as wrightbus and thales there be couple of thing that we need to do we need to ensure that the

of affordable rental property have price out worker particularly in the hospitality sector result in business reduce their opening hour and therefore their tax contribution to the treasury can my hon

put pressure on ministerial colleague to change planning law to make short term let separate category of planning use so that community in the lake and the dale can prevent the collapse of their

rates what recent assessment he have make of the potential impact of change in mortgage interest rate over the course of this parliament on household income as the hon lady know the path to lower interest rate be through low inflation and the independent bank of england have the government full support as it take action to return inflation to target the government mortgage charter broker by my right hon friend the chancellor early in the year be available to of borrower real disposable income per person be about high than the office for budget responsibility predict in its march forecast the expiry of million fix rate mortgage deal next year will mean even more people pay sky high cost it come at time when many be suffer increase financial hardship and personal debt which be have an impact on their mental and physical health do the minister think it fair that family be pay hundred of pound more each month to cover the cost of the government mini budget disaster mortgage cost and interest rate have go up throughout the world and we be in more or less the middle of the pack they be high in the united states for example but what will definitely make thing hard for the hon lady

people do not even receive the legal minimum to which they be entitle if the hon gentleman can give individual example ask he please to let we know it be obviously extremely important that we enforce this but should point out that we will increase the level by next year which will make significant difference to household up and down the country be not the more fundamental problem with the question

to know why so many billion of pound of their taxis have be waste by this government baroness mone have claim today that conservative ministers know about her personal connection to the company ppe medpro from the very beginning so why do the government not correct the record when misleading picture be be paint in the medium about baroness mone personal connection to ppe medpro in the first place be not go to comment on allegation by baroness mone or indeed on the individual case but let say this we put together taskforce of more than people that open investigation and so far have make more arrest so we will stop at nothing to tackle fraud and bring to justice anyone who be responsible for wrongdoing but what we do in moment of extreme crisis be to make sure that we get personal protective equipment to the frontline as quickly as we could and have we not do so many more life would have be lose we all know that baroness mone enrichment via ppe medpro be subject to an investigation but that do not allow ministers to refuse to answer question here in the house today so let ask another baroness mone husband doug barrowman allege that in november he be approach by government official ask if they would pay more for the other matter to go away be that specific and incredibly serious claim now be investigate and if so by whom if the hon gentleman have any evidence of people behave improperly or illegally he should tell the police and he will get the full support of this government and the whole house in bring the matter to justice but let just say to he that any responsible opposition should understand that in crisis there be trade off between speed and take long to prevent fraud and we take the right decision to save as many life as possible be hear from

in gaza be shocking be particularly disturb to hear about the situation of civilian trap in the holy family church complex in gaza city the lack of water and food and report of sniper fire cause civilian death inside the complex although israel have the right to defend itself against terror restore its security and bring the hostage home it must abide by international law and take all possible measure to protect civilian no one want to see this conflict go on for moment long than necessary we recognise the sheer scale of the suffering and be appal at the impact on civilian we urgently need more humanitarian pause to get all the hostage out and lifesave aid in we welcome the recent opening of the kerem shalom cross to help achieve that but it be not enough our immediate priority be to secure the release of british hostage to show solidarity with israel in defend itself against hamas while comply with international humanitarian law and to call for such pause both at the un and directly with israel to ensure that emergency aid can be distribute in gaza include fuel water and medicine the foreign secretary will discuss the situation in gaza with regional leader this week in his visit to egypt and jordan the government have recently announce an additional million of british aid triple the uk aid budget for the occupied palestinian territories this financial year to date we have deliver tonne of aid but there be still more to do casualty number be far too high and we be call on hamas to release each and every kidnap hostage we be also actively explore other route for aid into gaza include maritime option of course as both the prime minister and the foreign secretary have say ultimately this must end we of course want to see an end to the fighting but it must be sustainable ceasefire mean that hamas must stop launch rocket into israel and must release the hostage more than hostage be still unaccounted for they must be release immediately and return to their family to achieve long term peace in the middle east viable two state solution be need leave hamas in power in gaza would be permanent roadblock on the path to that no one can be

clean water and the update that have last night be that they be down to their last can of corn be tell that after pressure food have be deliver but they have not see it when this begin week ago the israel defence forces soldier order those civilian to evacuate against their will can the government confirm that they see the forcible displacement of civilian as unacceptable the people in the church be civilian they have nothing to do with hamas they be nun orphan and disabled people they be small christian community and they know everyone as the pope have say and as my family can confirm it be categorically untrue to say that hamas be operate from there the situation have be condemn by many will the government condemn it it be important to stress that the suffering be not confine to just that church just last week we see the utterly tragic death of three israeli hostage other be report to have be murder by hamas and be still in captivity that be also unacceptable seventy three day on in this conflict the death toll be only rise it be time for the international community to say that this violence be now make peace hard not easy the uk government talk now of sustainable ceasefire and although and the liberal democrats welcome the change in tone it be unclear whether that be in fact change in position will the government demand an immediate bilateral ceasefire will they change how they vote at the un security council as result when will the prime minister accept that the only route to peace be political not military that there be one way to get rid of hamas and end the humanitarian catastrophe and it be not this when will the united kingdom fulfil its historical obligation to the region and recognise palestine as first step towards deliver the two state which be the only way to guarantee security and dignity for israelis and palestinians thank the hon lady for her comment understand how deeply distress this be for she with her family catch up in the

clarity from israel as to how long the occupation will last and the death toll be mount do the minister agree that without concerted international intervention the conflict will escalate be appalled to hear about the way in which my right hon friend be treat on his way into the house of commons we be stress the importance of more surgical approach by the israeli defence forces and be work towards more sustainable cessation of hostility we recognise that there be too many casualty and we be press forward on what be the policy of both the government and the opposition more extensive humanitarian pause so that aid can get into gaza call the shadow foreign secretary be grateful to the hon member for oxford west and abingdon layla moran for secure this very important urgent question may say how

peace have become scene of fear and death it be one example of the ongoing humanitarian catastrophe confront civilian across gaza and reminder of the urgent imperative to address this crisis and help bring about the condition for sustainable ceasefire it come at moment of grow concern that this conflict could escalate with hezbollah in the north more violence in the west bank and houthi threat in the red sea we support effort to maintain regional security and labour welcome the uk participation in the new maritime security effort we thank our armed force personnel for their service and professionalism today the united nations security council be vote once again on resolution this be crucial chance to address the urgent and catastrophic situation in gaza let be clear labour want resolution to pass one that can protect civilian life that demand that hostage be release and that can act as stepping stone towards sustainable ceasefire and provide renew impetus towards two state solution the time have come for the united kingdom to support our international ally at this critical moment thank the shadow foreign secretary for his comment we be as he know very committed to try to make sure that there be no escalation thank he for his welcome for the us lead work to secure maritime security and also thank he for his comment particularly at this time of year about our armed force have already comment on the un security council resolution which hope will be vote on this afternoon like he hope that agreement can be reach on the issue of the humanitarian catastrophe to which the shadow foreign secretary refer can tell he that there be some movement this week there be world food programme truck ready at allenby bridge to travel through israel to kerem shalom and if sign off that will provide new route through to gaza we have make available some money to the world food programme it be available today to enhance that route if it open all of we abhor the loss of innocent civilian life in israel and gaza but talk of sustainable ceasefire be unhelpful all it do be give succour to israel enemy at the time of its great need this be country that fall to its knee just few week ago and suffer the bad tragedy since the holocaust now it be try to eliminate hamas and to free the hostage some of whom be british citizen let it finish the job let it protect israeli security and in do so let israel protect our security as well while it be true that weapon have be discover in incubator in hospital in gaza nevertheless do not agree with my right hon friend we be work towards sustainable ceasefire we be not there yet but we should all of we be work towards that in the meanwhile on the pathway to sustainable ceasefire we need urgently to get these humanitarian pause so that humanitarian relief can enter gaza call the snp spokesperson too send my very good wish to the family of the hon member for oxford west and abingdon layla moran as we know later today the government call for sustainable ceasefire will be test at the un security council if the government again decide to abdicate their responsibility to humanity and abstain they will be give netanyahu the political cover he need to prosecute war in which ten of thousand have already be kill and in which at the weekend accord to the latin patriarch of jerusalem sniper of the idf murder two woman inside the holy family parish in gaza if the uk be unable to support ceasefire now when will it what have to happen before this government say enough be enough and that the indiscriminate killing of innocent the blanket bombing of civilian infrastructure and the killing of journalist have to stop now how many more breach of international humanitarian law will it take for this government to find the moral courage to say this have to stop and it have to stop now do not think this be an issue of moral courage the government with the support of those on the opposition front bench be do what we believe to be right we have be very clear that israel have right to defend itself but it must do more to diminish and minimise the number of civilian casualty on the point the hon member make about the united nations resolution which we hope will be pass this afternoon as have say skilled british diplomat in new york be engage in talk throughout the united nations to try to make sure that that resolution land in the way both he and want welcome the call from the foreign secretary for sustainable ceasefire and welcome my right hon friend word from the dispatch box today over the weekend the foreign secretary receive two letter one from back benchers on this side of the house and another from group of foreign policy expert call for permanent ceasefire the last truce result in over hostage be release and hundred of life be save do my right hon friend accept that permanent ceasefire would reap similar result it be true that the foreign secretary receive letter over the weekend sign by colleague which state it be widely accept across the world that last security for israel peace for the palestinians an end to the killing and the defeat of hamas can only be achieve through politic and diplomacy and the establishment of two state that be very much the view of the government as well the minster have clearly see the communiqué from the latin patriarch of jerusalem point out the atrocity commit in the ground of the holy family church with two people murder and at least seven wounded that show shocking lack of fire control discipline by the israeli force will the minister raise with the israeli force my grave concern and those of many colleague across the house that that be not acceptable there be no need for to raise it with the israeli force because they be themselves conduct an inquiry into the matter at gaza kamal adwan hospital last weekend approximately hamas fighter be arrest some of whom take part in the october massacre weaponry hamas intelligence and military and technological equipment be recover and report suggest that hospital staff direct the israel defence forces to weapon that hamas have store inside incubator for premature baby will my right hon friend join in condemn hamas for those appalling war crime and do he agree that that incident underline hamas disregard for civilian human life in gaza my hon friend be right to point to those report as mention early there have be report of weapon find in incubator in particular in kamal adwan hospital be sure that every member of this house condemn without qualification the appalling event perpetrate by hamas start on october do the minister agree with cardinal vincent nichols version of event that take place in the compound of the holy family church the right hon lady will understand that be not in position to make that judgment but have hear with great respect what the cardinal archbishop of westminster have say all of we be deeply sympathetic to the plight of our jewish brother after the october pogrom and most of we accept the argument that an immediate ceasefire would have play into the hand of hamas but think on these bench the mood be change frankly what israel be do be totally unacceptable this be indiscriminate bombing of vast civilian population leave aside the outrage at the holy family church it be simply not in the long term interest of israel that it radicalise whole generation of arab youth it be not in our interest either to be involve in any way on the side of israel do that we must up the rhetoric and condemn that unequivocally my right hon friend will have see the article co author by the foreign secretary and his german counterpart he be right to refer to the pogrom that be instigate in october and also to the importance of sustainable ceasefire and respect for international humanitarian law in my view the answer to his final point be that the moment there be an opportunity to advance political track it must be seize by the region and britain will do everything it can to support that we should all thank the hon member for oxford west and abingdon layla moran for her steadfastness and for secure this urgent question eighteen thousand people have now die across the gaza strip and israel be use food water and medicine as weapon of war against civilian population there be miss people under the rubble as she say political solution be require not military one can the minister assure the house that the vote today will bring about ceasefire and that it will stop the escalation of the war into the red sea and the mediterranean and start to address the underlying issue which be of course israel occupation of the west bank the refugee all around the world and the continued siege of gaza which have go on for decade we must have the start of long term process that bring about real justice for the palestinian people or we will be back here again with more war crime more death more destruction and the horror for decade to come the right hon gentleman be entirely right to focus on the united nations security council resolution which we hope will be pass this afternoon that be the way we move the situation forward towards the political track that both he and want to see as rapidly as possible we all welcome the humanitarian pause that see the release of number of hostage and aid deliver into gaza on december the seven day pause collapse follow the firing of rocket into israel from gaza hamas also fail to provide daily list of hostage to be release by am in further violation of the truce will the minister join in criticise hamas for violate the truce agreement once again prove that they be no partner for last peace between israelis and palestinians the house will note what the hon gentleman have say assure he that we be do everything we can to get humanitarian support into gaza include focus specifically on any maritime opportunity the royal fleet auxiliary lyme bay be load with supply in cyprus and be ready to sail once we can be assure that the support can be receive and deliver with almost death in gaza my constituent in bolton be ask when be enough enough with country vote for ceasefire when be sustainable ceasefire ceasefire that happen now member of noorul islam mosque in bolton recently visit egypt to try to get aid across the border into gaza will the minister meet to discuss way that we can work with the egyptian government and other partner to ensure that aid can get from bolton into gaza thank my hon friend for what he have say today and for the information and work from his community in bolton that he be make available to the foreign office of course shall be pleased to see he at mutually convenient time last week attend briefing with professor ghassan abu sitta heroic british palestinian doctor who have just return from gaza because the israeli siege prevent medical supply from enter gaza he tell we he have to use vinegar and wash up liquid to sterilise wound even on the night when he perform amputation on six child he recount their scream and the desperation of their parent pay tribute to professor ghassan but it will forever shame this house that the dying and the wound who he treat be bomb and maim by israel with the approval of this place will the government finally listen to the grow global call and demand an immediate ceasefire the hon lady eloquent intervention underline the importance of achieve sustainable ceasefire in the way set out by the foreign secretary in his article at the weekend over the weekend the israelis uncover the large ever hamas tunnel at mile long the brother of hamas leader have be see drive through the tunnel as he hide beneath gaza civilian population the minister have already speak about hamas fighter surrender at hospital where there be firearm in incubator for premature baby do he agree that those be important reminder of hamas appalling use of human shield of why hamas must no long brutalise gaza population and terrorise israelis and of why the uk would be completely wrong to call for ceasefire before the threat of hamas be remove thank my right hon and learn friend for his comment suspect that on both side of the house there be no need for reminder of the horrific event that hamas have perpetrate on october and since as he will understand we be try to ensure that the hostage be release as swiftly as possible that the rocket stop and that we be able to move to political process as soon as feasible hundred of british palestinians have see multiple generation of their relative kill their family home destroy and their future in gaza decimate put on record my thank to the hon member for oxford west and abingdon layla moran and my hon friend the member for bradford east imran hussain for organise the move event with professor ghassan abu sitta it be packed room and not single eye be dry as we listen to he speak about the horrific situation in the hospital have either the prime minister the foreign secretary or the minister meet any british palestinian family include those who have recently return from gaza to witness how they have be affect by israel indiscriminate strike my understanding be that both the foreign secretary and the prime minister have have access to that information the hon gentleman make plea for those difficulty to end and hope he will accept that the government be do everything we can to fulfil what he want to see and what we want to see there be nothing morally courageous about argue for the people who commit the atrocity on october the rapist and murderer who cross into israel on that day to remain in power which be what those who be demand ceasefire with hamas be ask for that be the reality fear sometimes listen to what be say here that some people hope israel do not succeed in achieve its aim of wipe out this horrendous terrorist cult while there may be letter from some colleague that barely reach double figure very many of we on the government benches have be proud of the strong stand and moral clarity that the government have have in support israel after what happen on october and hope that continue my hon friend make good point we be determined that we will end up with situation where the palestinians can run their own territory where the arab state be heavily involved and where political initiative be regionally lead lot of international work support and help be require but we have to get to point where we can see that political track take shape ahead of today un security council vote group of foreign policy and military expert include the former chief of the uk armed force general richards have call for the foreign secretary to support an immediate ceasefire at the un security council many have long argue for that but it can be achieve at the un security council only if the us stop vetoing resolution welcome what the minister have say about hop that the uk will support such resolution but can he say more about what our government be do in the next two hour to convince the us at the minimum to abstain on the resolution to allow it through or to support it the hon lady will know that britain always take lead role in the drafting and execution of these resolution can tell she that skilled british diplomat be use this time to try to secure an agreement on the security council resolution which hope may be pass tonight can give she no guarantee of that but can give she guarantee that british diplomat be work flat out to achieve it thank the hon member for oxford west and abingdon layla moran for her important urgent question hope that food will be take to the holy family church shortly thank the minister for his comment the united nations relief and works agency be look after million people in its camp which be more than half the population of gaza on my visit to palestine in may we hear that unrwa be struggle to find funding can we ensure that unrwa be receive the money and aid it need to provide humanitarian assistance to the palestinians now and in the future we be clear that unrwa be play critical role in gaza we be very careful to ensure that the british taxpayer money we spend to support unrwa be spend in the right way we have significantly increase our support to unrwa and the americans have re engage in support unrwa give the release of the late hamas video of three elderly male civilian hostage do the minister agree that in all the distress be experience about event in gaza it be important that these innocent hostage do not become the forget element of the conflict will the government continue to do all they can to ensure that their safe release be part of any negotiation design to bring an end to the violence can give the hon gentleman those assurance he will understand why it be unhelpful across the floor of the house to discuss the detail of the negotiation in respect of the hostage but he may rest assure that we be act in precisely the way he have set out there be horrific account of sexual violence be perpetrate against hostage in this conflict include the gang rape of woman and genital mutilation will the government stand firmly with the survivor of sexual violence which should never be use as tool of conflict and do all possible to strengthen their access to justice my hon friend will know that this government have make particular and important intervention to try to stop gender base violence and in particular the use of sexual crime in warfare can tell she that her view be well hear and well respected and we will continue to do just that can the minister assure the house that should vote on ceasefire be bring forward today at the un security council the government will not abdicate their responsibility to innocent child woman and man and will vote for that ceasefire and not abstain can reassure the hon gentleman that the government certainly will not abdicate our responsibility but how the government exercise our vote on the security council will depend on the text that be agree the entire bibas family include month old kfir bibas be kidnap on october do the minister agree that precondition for ceasefire must include both the military defeat of hamas and the return of all the hostage yes the challenge in secure sustainable ceasefire many of we have be call for ceasefire for some time be not just the immediate military concern but the allegation of war crime just in the past week alone the minister will have see houthi force attack shipping in the red sea he will have see the situation outline so powerfully by our colleague the hon member for oxford west and abingdon layla moran in the holy family church on december when ask the minister about this issue he tell the house that the government be continue to identify and look for mechanism for ensure that there can be no report december vol for anybody who commit war crime can he update we on whether he have identify such mechanism and what that might be the word use be absolutely precise the government have no tolerance of impunity for those who commit war crime there be legal mechanism and other mechanism that be available and that we see every day in our paper and the government of course support those process to ensure that there be not impunity for war crime one hundred and twenty nine hostage be still in captivity at the hand of the terrorist group hamas despite diplomatic effort the international red cross have still not be give access to they all we see be video come out at the same time the hamas leadership be meet in turkey with other terrorist group plan what they will do next irrespective of what the united nations say call for ceasefire just enable hamas to regroup and set about their evil doing once again my hon friend make very good point that be why it be the policy of the government and as understand it the opposition not to call for an immediate ceasefire hamas have make it clear that they will not respect or accept ceasefire indeed they want to repeat what happen on october israel have an absolute right of self defence to go after the people who perpetrate those terrible event on october human rights watch have warn that the israeli government be use the starvation of civilian as method of warfare in gaza let we be clear that be war crime amnesty have similarly warn of war crime as have the un high commissioner for human rights surely the government should not be stand by while israel commit war crime but should be call for an immediate ceasefire that could swiftly help prevent further such crime do the failure to do so not risk complicity in those war crime the government have hear the word of president herzog that israel will respect international humanitarian law and the government expect israel to abide by the word of the president my hon friend the member for harrow east bob blackman refer to meeting of hamas official include its deputy chairman and former leader in turkey recently where hamas set out their intent to carry on their brutal act far to the october massacre what assessment have my right hon friend the minister make of turkey role in facilitate hamas continue war crime and how will he pursue accountability for suppose nato ally and strategic partner the government make it clear to all country where we stand on this we do not think that ceasefire at this time be possible or practical we be seek humanitarian pause that be as long as possible to get aid in we be in favour when it be conceivably possible of sustainable ceasefire and we hope that time will come as soon as possible be the real reason why there be so many civilian casualty in gaza not that hamas have cruelly deliberately and wilfully use the civilian population as cover whether by operate from hospital fire from school store weapon in people house or hide among the civilian population be that not the reason why we must not allow this terrorist group to continue to have base from which to try to eliminate israel and why ceasefire at present would stop the israeli military fulfil its obligation to protect its people in the long run by eliminate hamas the right hon gentleman make very good point while israel use its military force to defend its civilian population hamas use their civilian population to defend hamas last week comment from the israeli ambassador which effectively rule out two state solution serve as further evidence of the difference that exist between our aspiration for the region and those of both the israeli government and of course hamas give the chasm that exist between those conflict objective be it not time to urgently press for permanent ceasefire to enable the diplomatic measure necessary to bring about consensus on last peace in respect of the comment make by the israeli ambassador to the uk the hon gentleman will have see the response of the british government and in particular the response of the foreign secretary on the second part of the hon gentleman question in respect of permanent ceasefire he will have hear not only what the government have say but what those on the opposition front bench have say will the united kingdom government urge the government of israel to ratify the rome statute and thus become state party to the international criminal court the right hon gentleman will know that britain be signatory to the international criminal court because we think that it be vital piece of the international architecture but it be for all country to make their own decision in that respect he will know that number of country include america have so far decline to join shot and kill for go to the toilet the hon member for oxford west and abingdon layla moran have describe just one example of what palestinians in gaza be go through our heart go out to she and her family but also to all the civilian in gaza who be affect by such appalling treatment at the moment many israeli leader have openly push for the expulsion of palestinians from the gaza strip and call for the second nakba in gaza will the minister reassure the house that the british government oppose any such attempt to forcibly expel and displace palestinians from gaza yes with such death devastation and destruction which we have all see unfold in real time constituent be ask whether there be any british fingerprint or funding to be find behind the bullet and bomb use in the horror show of gaza and the west bank the minister talk of two state solution but as have be point out the netanyahu regime and its ambassador to the uk have reject this how can we allow the present tactic to go on unabated when there be no clear picture on how and when this will end the hon lady point underline the vital importance of move to political track as soon as it be possible to do so britain must maintain that international law be follow on the international stage specifically the protection of civilian include innocent child do the minister agree that although the humanitarian pause be an important step test the negotiation and mediation of intermediary and of course the release of hostage only last ceasefire will bring about the condition for peace do he also agree we have hear it here in the chamber today that the israeli government have to accept that for they to have statehood and live in peace they must want the same for their neighbour too that be why the government be work towards sustainable ceasefire in the meantime we be anxious to secure the necessary pause so that aid can get into gaza as speedily as possible thank the hon member for oxford west and abingdon layla moran for secure this urgent question and you mr speaker for grant it my heart go out to her family and everybody else catch up in this dreadful conflict welcome the word of the foreign secretary call for sustainable ceasefire which must see all the hostage release and fight on both side end we need to get the aid in will the minister say more about how we will permanently end this cycle of violence how do we get two state solution thank the hon gentleman for his comment he be right that we be not call for ceasefire and hop that somehow it become more permanent what we be do be call for sustainable ceasefire that allow we to move towards the political track which will then deliver what he be call for thank the hon member for oxford west and abingdon layla moran as we all get ready to celebrate christmas with our family she will be think desperately about her family and think about all the family who will not be together this christmas pause be not enough to allow the rehabilitation of vital infrastructure due to repeat shutdown of communication and internet service gaza be now in danger of become an information vacuum transparency be absolutely essential for hold military force to account and prevent further humanitarian atrocity will the minister please update the house on how the uk be work to ensure that the power and communication infrastructure be restore so that we can get help and clarity for those in desperate need we be work to get to that point but we be not there at the moment we need to do everything we can to reconnect vital infrastructure that have be destroy it be not just about people suffer the effect of kinetic activity it be also about the effect of the lack of food and grow disease the hon lady may rest assure that in respect of the infrastructure to which she refer we will do everything we can when we get the opportunity would like to be able to welcome the incremental move in the foreign secretary joint statement at the weekend but give the desperate event in gaza and the position of the vast majority of the rest of the world these be just weasel word the government and those on the labour front bench be rightly quick to condemn the heinous war crime commit against civilian in ukraine and by hamas on october the minister have repeatedly say that israel need to abide by international law but he know that israel be not do so be the cold blooded killing of two civilian woman seek sanctuary in church war crime yes or no in order to give an answer to the hon gentleman question need to know the full fact and very much hope that the full fact will become available before too long the agenda of the netanyahu government be to save he from jail wreak revenge on all gazans for the crime of hamas and recreate the nakba in the occupy territory the uk government refusal to call for ceasefire give cover to this how many ten of thousand of palestinian civilian must be kill and how many million make refugee starve or terrorise before this government call for it to stop and to stop now do not agree with the hon gentleman that that be the government position we be not provide cover for anything we be insistent that international humanitarian law should be accept and respect and we will do everything we can to get to the position of sustainable ceasefire but as he will accept we be not there yet in the meanwhile it be important to press for opportunity to get humanitarian aid and support into gaza to help people who be in terrible position the humanitarian crisis in gaza be grave with woman and child sadly comprise the majority of civilian casualty israel prime minister netanyahu must understand that he can not attain last peace and security by raze gaza to the ground which must be condemn we do not just need an immediate cessation of fighting or temporary week long ceasefire like the one we have recently we need negotiation to enable an enduring and permanent ceasefire what be the uk government do to work with our international ally to enable just that the negotiation and discussion with prime minister netanyahu be widespread the hon member will know that there have be regular discussion between our prime minister and prime minister netanyahu and the foreign secretary have be part of they as well indeed think sir tony blair will also see prime minister netanyahu shortly so the hon member can rest assure that the urgency of the situation be be well ventilate by senior british politician last week too have the honour of meet the heroic professor abu sitta along with the hon member for oxford west and abingdon layla moran west and other colleague from across the house he give the most harrowing account of his experience work as surgeon have to perform amputation on child without proper painkiller and use only vinegar and washing up liquid to sterilise wound due to israel blockade on medical supply the doctor also speak of the war crime be commit with the israeli army drop white phosphoru which burn deep into the muscle and tissue of child and sniper kill palestinian doctor as they care for the injured and die will the minister meet the professor to hear for himself about the unspeakable pain and suffering be mete out to innocent people and explain to he why this government still refuse to condemn these heinous contravention of international humanitarian law either or another foreign office minister will certainly be pleased to meet the professor the harrowing evidence to which the hon member refer merely underline the critical importance of move towards sustainable ceasefire and in the immediate future secure the humanitarian pause that we be all seek while the government should be lead the call for an immediate complete and permanent ceasefire what assurance have the minister the foreign secretary or indeed the prime minister have that actor in the conflict will abide by today un security council resolution should it pass the hon member be ask to prophesy about the future let we see if we can secure un security council resolution and then we can move to try to ensure that everyone honour it the shooting of yotam haim alon shamriz and samer talalka the three israeli hostage who be carry white flag as well as the attack on the catholic church belie the idf claim that its action be precise and intelligence lead there be now strong evidence believe of war crime accept what the minister have say about call for ceasefire and hope that we get an immediate ceasefire ahead of christmas will he help with how two family have can get out of gaza alaa safi who have lose member of her family and enas alaloul who have nothing to do with hamas the hon member make an important intervention about the humanitarian effect of what be go on in gaza but as have repeatedly say that underline the importance of the government work day and night to try to deliver these pause and then sustainable ceasefire may impress on the minister my constituent strength of support on the need for an immediate ceasefire not only because of the starvation we be begin to see and the child be treat with washing up liquid and vinegar but because health worker have reportedly be detain with no information on their whereabouts or wellbee will the minister give the government assessment of the ability of the international committee of the red cross to access health worker detain by israeli force the position be unclear but the government focus be very clear it be to deliver the humanitarian pause that we require in order to secure the necessary humanitarian support inside gaza jabalia refugee camp shifa hospital omari mosque and the holy family church be all civilian target that have be obliterate by israeli bombing or attack by idf sniper there be nearly dead and nearly million displace un expert have warn that we be at risk of witness genocide in the making in gaza will the minister now use all diplomatic measure include sanction to compel israel and hamas to end allege breach of international law while also at last demand permanent immediate ceasefire alongside the release of those hostage the hon member will have hear what have say about the plausibility of an immediate and permanent ceasefire on his point about the civilian who be in such extreme jeopardy he will be aware that hamas quite deliberately use civilian to defend themselves and for military purpose that make the situation all the more difficult to reach the progress that we all want to see hope that the government can support un resolution today but we desperately need an immediate ceasefire to protect the civilian population in gaza and to create the space for dialogue for permanent ceasefire once we get to that point how do the minister see the uk role in get to the political solution on the ground and in particular ensure that the palestinian population be not permanently displace share with the hon member view that united nations security council resolution be urgently need and very much hope that it will be in form that we can support shortly with regard to ceasefire he will have hear what have be say from both the government and the opposition front benches about the plausibility of achieve that with regard to the role that britain will play once the sky clear and there be an opportunity for political track the foreign secretary be in the region today try to advance precisely that it have be seven day since the american president warn that israel be in danger of lose global support because of its indiscriminate bombing in gaza that warning clearly have not be heed note what the minister have say about no impunity for war crime but that come after the event what signal will the un send today to israel to say that the line have clearly be cross we can not support it and we do not condone what it have be do in gaza the hon lady be right to say that there have be far too many civilian casualty in this fighting and that more surgical approach be require that be very much what the prime minister and the british government have call for we will continue to work towards more sustainable cessation of hostility and sustainable ceasefire in the way that have describe the foreign commonwealth and development office website advise people who might be travel to ukraine if you travel to ukraine to fight or to assist other engage in the war your activity may amount to offence under uk legislation and you could be prosecute on your return to the uk why be there not similar statement on the advice for travel to israel because the two situation be not analogous quote from newspaper opinion column even if israel manage to destroy hamas similar movement will undoubtedly emerge from the destitution and despair of the gaza strip that be write by the then deputy prime minister nick clegg during israel operation protective edge in august what be the british government do to prevent the recurrence of the terrible violence we be see in another decade the hon member be right to point to the fact that this dispute have continue down the year he will also have notice that it be after the crisis of the yom kippur war that progress be make politically and then again after the first intifada we must all hope that after this dreadful situation move into sustainable ceasefire the political track be once again able to grip these issue and ensure that bright future await it be an issue that have poison the well of international opinion in the middle east and deserve resolution so that the child of those involve today can enjoy well life than their parent thank the minister for his response and for and his and the government stance on hamas which be clearly terrorist group they be the baby killer rapist and killer of innocent people not just israelis but innocent palestinians that be who hamas be and they must be destroy can the minister confirm on day of israel response to the hamas terrorist murder whether he believe that we have be able to exert any meaningful influence to bring positive step forward for the release of the hostage we be do everything we possibly can to get the hostage out the hon gentleman will understand that can not give the house run commentary on that in respect of his early comment thank he for his humanity and his wisdom wish happy christmas to he you mr speaker and the whole house ukraine urgent question to ask the secretary of state for defence to make statement on the war in ukraine since the minister for the armed forces last update the house on november the situation on the ground have remain largely unchanged ukraine have be fortify its border with belarus with dragon tooth razor wire and anti tank ditch and be pivot to more defensive posture follow ukrainian president volodymyr zelensky call on december for rapid fortification across the front on december kyivstar ukraine large mobile network operator suffer cyber attack the incident be likely one of the high impact disruptive cyber attack on ukrainian network since the start of russia full scale invasion the russian air force be highly likely to have carry out the first use of the killjoy air launch ballistic missile since august killjoy have almost certainly have mixed combat debut many of its launch have likely miss their intended target while ukraine have also succeed in shoot down example of the supposedly undefeatable system we will continue to support priority area for ukraine in the come month include air defence and harden critical national infrastructure site our foundational supply of critical artillery ammunition continue most recently on december the defence secretary announce that the uk will lead new maritime capability coalition alongside norway deliver ship and vehicle to strengthen ukraine ability to operate at sea this represent step change in the uk support for ukraine in both defend against russia illegal and unprovoked invasion and develop ukraine future maritime capability the new coalition will deliver long term support to ukraine include training equipment and infrastructure to bolster security in the black sea we could not be more clear as the prime minster have say we be in this for as much and as long as it take the maritime capability coalition initiative reinforce our collective long term commitment to ukraine and provide permanent mechanism through which we can support the development of ukraine maritime capability agree during recent meeting of the nation strong ukraine defence contact group it form part of series of capability coalition to strengthen ukraine operation in other domain include on land and in the air on and december the ministry of defence along with the department of business and trade successfully conduct the first uk trade mission to kyiv since the invasion in the mission enable discussion with and between uk and ukraine official and industry on opportunity for long term co operation and result in tangible agreement for industry the uk have commit billion of military support to date as we continue to donate significant amount of ammunition and matériel from our own stock as well as those purchase from across the globe in addition we have train more than soldier since the uk and our ally have be clear that we will not stand by as the kremlin persist in its disregard for the sovereignty of ukraine and international law that include the recognition of ukraine sovereignty over its territorial water which be establish in accordance with international maritime law thank the minister for his word but with due respect the house should hear from the defence secretary himself he may have urgent business today we understand that but he have be in post for four month and he have not make an oral statement in parliament on ukraine from the top to reassure ukrainians that britain will stand with they for as long as it take to win to warn president putin that britain remain resolute in confront russian aggression and to explain to people why the defence of the uk start in ukraine this be war in europe last week nearly two year on putin declare that his goal have not change if he prevail he will not stop at ukraine that be why the government have have and will continue to have labour full support for military aid to ukraine and for reinforce nato ally ukrainian face another winter with war and another tough year beyond yesterday top general say that they face ammunition shortage across the entire frontline at the very time ukraine need unfailing support the uk be fall behind other nation no new uk weaponry since july no uk military funding for next year and no plan for ukraine the uk be unite behind ukraine be proud of the uk leadership on ukraine but want to be proud in six month time when will the military aid funding for next year be agree will it be multi year when will the international fund for ukraine commit the half billion pound so far unspent how many next generation light anti tank weapon have be produce under the new contract sign month ago and deliver to ukraine another two minehunter ship be announce last week for ukraine the same ship pledge by ministers in june madam deputy speaker will be critical year for ukraine we must have the defence secretary himself in the house to set out the uk plan military economic and diplomatic to support ukraine through and beyond be extremely proud to stand here and defend the government very strong record in support ukraine the secretary of state give very important statement yesterday on the future of uk fast jet capability and the trade mission that we send to ukraine last week make it timely that stand here now the public understand the huge amount of support that we have give and it be important to emphasise that we now need to move to the next phase the long term of help ukraine industry to support itself work closely with ukrainian partner as procurement minister have that as an absolute priority as demonstrate in the last week by the trade mission on the right hon gentleman other point totally agree about the risk of putin prevail and be grateful for the cross party support on ammunition shortage he specifically ask about nlaw of course that be not the only anti tank weapon we have send in total we have send around anti tank weapon to ukraine plus about million small round ammo artillery shell self propel gun squadron of tank and huge amount of air defence system and uncrewed system the list go on helmet and train for over ukrainians in the uk to enable they to go back and fight for the freedom of their country be very proud of that record but the prime minister have be clear we know there be much more to do agree with my hon friend that we have send great deal of ammunition to ukraine the question be have we be able to replace that ammunition especially in the context of war that seem to be attritional and likely to go on for considerable amount of time my right hon friend be an expert in these matter and always ask pertinent question my constituent strongly support the effort we have undertake to give all the weapon we have to ukraine not all gift from this country it should be stress equally they want we to replenish those stock that be why we have already sign contract for nlaw and lightweight multi role missile and we have already take delivery of the archer which be the interim replacement for the gun it happen in parallel we have to keep support ukraine but absolutely we put the additional money from the budget to support the replenishment of our own armed force we be approach dangerous territory with regard to the west ongoing support for those who fight for our democracy and the rule of law in the trench and farm building of eastern ukraine we see putin plan to sit and wait while democracy lose interest in ukraine come to fruition in politically motivated budget wrangle in washington in the clientelism of hungarian president viktor orbán in the exhausted replenishment effort of the west defence industry and in the vagary of the west medium cycle the west must act decisively and with endurance to thwart putin plan and the snp stand fully behind the government action to deliver on that priority the foreign secretary have confirm that the uk will continue to support ukraine in the defence against putin what further detail can this defence minister provide about that and about what discussion the secretary of state for defence it be pity that he be not here have have with the foreign secretary about the continued support for ukraine what will it look like and what will be the scale of it finally can the uk government encourage through some mean the government and the prime minister of hungary to lift their block on eu funding for ukraine believe that until recently the hon gentleman be member of the defence committee and be grateful for that support from he and from his party he ask number of question but think the most important be the one about what we could say about the support we be provide for ukraine right now in my opening remark emphasise the importance of the maritime capability coalition and member will be more than aware of the importance of the black sea and get grain out of ukraine since that corridor reopen some million tonne of grain have be export and it be extremely important for we to retain that we should also recognise that ukraine have have significant success in push the russian fleet eastward to enable that to happen however we must not be complacent which be why we be provide this naval support we and norway be joint leader of the mcc and when visit norway last week it be clear that we be very strong naval partner because of the share threat to our home water that we face from russian submarine but we will keep on look at what more we can do and be grateful to member in all part of the house for their support in response to the question from the right hon member for wentworth and dearne john healey my hon friend refer to uk company help ukraine to build out its own defence capability that be obviously to be welcome but can he also reassure we that the work we be do to resupply ukraine be an opportunity we be seize to broaden and deepen uk defence capability so that in the bad case scenario we can enhance our own ability to restock ourselves and our ally it be pleasure to take question from my right hon friend he be an excellent minister for defence procurement and an excellent minister generally and always enjoy the many cobra meeting that be oversee by he but he speak with equal strength from the back benches and his question be very important when it come to opportunity for future industrial production in ukraine would like to see an opportunity for we to work together for our mutual benefit to create ordnance not just for ukraine but for ourselves because maximise that demand signal be the good way in which to secure the strong possible military industrial base readily acknowledge the support that we have give to ukraine to try and ensure that putin can not win that be an objective share in all part of the house but the scale of the conflict require more especially in the form of artillery and munition why do it take the government more than year to sign the contract for new capacity for shell production not only for ukraine but to restock our own supply the right hon gentleman be entirely right and he speak with experience as former defence minister but we have sign the contract on the shell as the prime minister announce last july that contract sit alongside many other include the lightweight multi role missile and starstreak contract this be of course for our own defence but as have say we recently deliver the artillery shell to ukraine and we should be proud of that effort it be clearly very important that we support our friend in ukraine but it be equally important that we support our nato ally in the region such as romania my hon friend have mention the support be give in the black sea the port of constanta be vital to the export of ukrainian grain and other produce so may ask what extra support the government be give to romania to ensure that this vital sea lane be keep free my hon friend have make an excellent point recently have the pleasure of meet my romanian counterpart in the main building at the ministry of defence and we speak about number of issue like we the romanians be absolutely committed to support ukraine think that romania be one of the country that be join the mcc but will check that and write to my hon friend we need to work closely with ally on these wide strategic issue last month be concerned to note that the chancellor barely mention ukraine in his autumn statement and since then he have make hardly any new commitment to support its people the government and the opposition have stand shoulder to shoulder with ukraine and the uk must not waver in its leadership on this issue can the minister reassure and more important can he reassure the family who have come from ukraine and settle in my constituency that the uk will be commit to support ukraine in the come month absolutely can send that message to the family and by the way the hon lady have also make an important point in remind we of the huge generosity that we have show by take in so many of those family number of whom be in my constituency can certainly reassure she on the basis of what have happen literally in the last week we should be judge not by word but by action have create maritime coalition that will support the crucial strategic interest of the black sea be talk about access to the black sea security and the ability to get grain in and out we have also continue to provide those crucial weapon include air defence system congratulate the government on their global leadership which we all recognise but couple of matter concern first the importance of supply basic kit have be stress by member on both side of the house the supply of and shell be critical and it need long term plan it be great that we have supply shell but the russians be use up to shell day and the ukrainians be respond with between and so this be massive artillery war secondly putin regime be gain ground politically because the russians be hold ground while they target western support so the long term supply be critical physically but it be also critical in term of the message we send that we be not cut and run but be in for the long haul my hon friend who of course serve in intelligence make some excellent point on the particular importance of artillery have already speak about the volume of shell and the gun that have be gift but should add the spare part to support they which be easy to forget about speak early about the ukraine defence contact group recently attend teams call with all my fellow ministers involve in that under us leadership country after country list its late gifting include artillery and many other munition however my hon friend be right to say that we need long term plan think there be huge determination across the west and all our ally to continue this effort of course it be challenge but that be why we need to bring in that additional element of ensure that ukrainian industry can start to rise to the occasion the language from the government remain robust but the detail of practical help military and otherwise be lack there be day leave of this year and we still do not have full schedule for what aid the government will provide for when can we expect to have it respect the hon gentleman with whom spend time at the ministry of justice but he have suggest that this be talk we be one of the key reason why ukraine be still free country it have regain about of the land take by russia and we play decisive role in that know that there be strong consensus on keep it go but hope that that can be recognise have already list the enormous amount of ordnance that we have provide artillery shell and million round of ammunition of course we want to keep on do that and we be have also explain how we will be support ukraine in the naval domain which believe will be crucial my constituency have warmly welcome many ukrainians to our community and we be supportive of the uk government ongoing effort to back ukraine and our nato ally can my hon friend update the house on the support for ukraine own military industrial capacity that too be an excellent question speak early about the visit last week why be that so important it be important because as say we know there be huge support across the country and indeed across parliament for the effort that we have undertake to support ukraine however we now need to help its industry to support it think that our defence industry which be world lead can play key role in that and be very pleased that major uk prime be out there last week already start to sign agreement with their ukrainian counterpart in july this year have the opportunity to visit ukraine with siobhan trust and the right hon member for chingford and woodford green sir iain duncan smith it be clear that many of the soldier be be injure and be not receive enough support and also that training be huge issue realise that there be sensitivity surround what western country can do when it come to provide training but can the minister explain what kind of help be be provide for soldier in term of recovery but also to ensure that they have proper support so that they be not go into conflict into war unprepared the hon lady ask an excellent question on training it be one of my most insightful visit as defence minister early on to go to salisbury plain and see the irish guards together with our new zealand and australian colleague train ukrainians who let we be frank would have some week of training then go out to experience pretty severe trench warfare be proud of the role we play in that but she be right to say that crucial part of it be the medical element believe that we have train around medical personnel but will check that detail and write to she because this be important recently the united states have be wobble over funding what assessment do our government make of that and of how we engage in ukraine this be the second christmas that many ukrainians will be experience in time not in peace could the minister send the government gratitude to organisation such as the ukrainian social and cultural centre in bolton head by yaroslaw tymchyshyn during what should be joyous time for family around the world but be difficult time for the ukrainian community my hon friend be absolutely right to champion the community group support ukraine on his other point about the us can only speak from my own experience refer to the contact group meeting we have on teams recently secretary austin lead that from the beginning to the end emphasise all the way through that as far as he be concern the us be in it for the long haul believe that that be the case this be about freedom freedom be at stake here we have fight this far to protect it and we have to keep do that job if we be to defend freedom across our continent in august this year the then defence secretary say that he would publish the action plan for ukraine in will it be publish before the end of the year simply say to the right hon lady as have be say throughout that we be deliver action every week in ukraine the amount of ordnance we have supply and continue to supply particularly in term of air defence which be now increasingly crucial be huge have list the many number some of it of course we can not talk about there be technology that we be test out there ensure that our munition be successful what can say be that if we look at the work of the defence science and technology laboratory for example as say can not talk about the detail we can see that it have have huge bearing on the impact of what we have donate into theatre welcome the support that the government have give and indeed the lead that they have take in ensure that while other be drag their foot we give support to ukraine in its vital defence of freedom as it be clear that the russians be now settle in for long war consolidate the ground that they have take and hop to sit out the west opposition to their invasion can the minister give we some indication whether he be ensure that we have the physical capacity to continue our support and that we be make the necessary financial commitment what plan do he have to launch diplomatic offensive to ensure that people stay in line on give support to ukraine we be try to do all those thing should like to put on record that it be an absolute pleasure to visit the right hon gentleman constituency to launch armed forces week back in the summer know that he be passionate supporter of our armed force and of our effort in ukraine and that he share my pride in the provision of nlaw which be make in belfast he be absolutely right on all those count and on the diplomatic one in particular there huge unity in the west we all know that the stake be incredibly high but we now have to persist we be all in it for the long haul it be clearly putin strategy to sit this out as long as be necessary in the hope that ukraine ally lose the political will to provide the support that have be there so far in that regard the foreign secretary indicate to the other place early this month that he be prepared to increase the amount of funding available to ukraine next year be the minister able to confirm that that be indeed the case and tell we how much additional funding will be in place the hon gentleman know perfectly well that these matter be still under discussion the prime minister have be clear about the strength of our commitment and go back to the previous point make by the right hon member for east antrim sammy wilson which back this up huge way in which we have ensure support and funding for ukraine be not just from what we have provide but by be convenor of an international effort we have play decisive role in that but of course there be more to do those of we on the snp benches remain steadfast in our support for ukraine in its defence against its unprovoked russian aggressor ukraine have be give substantial support by great many country particularly the uk and the usa but as we have hear that support be under threat how concerned be the minister about the rhetoric on ukraine aid that be come from the us republicans drive by donald trump who be too busy praise vladimir putin and about what that mean for the us aid to ukraine in the long term respect the point that the hon gentleman make but hear nothing but total support for ukraine from the us administration they recognise the strategic issue let we be clear about this to all voice in the us and elsewhere this be not just about ukraine as the shadow secretary of state say early we should not underestimate what the impact would have be have russia succeed early on in term of other strategic issue not least china and so on we have to see the big picture and that mean stand together as ally the minister be clear about the support for ukraine from the uk but do he agree that it be important that we keep full support from our nato ally two week ago at the transatlantic nato forum and other delegate be concern about the lukewarm response from certain member of congress on continue support what more can we do to get the message across to member of congress that the commitment be not only solid here but also back by cash with around billion come from the uk and the european institution be grateful to the right hon gentleman this follow on from the previous point as say when look at the us see steadfast support in the administration in term of the enormous amount of munition they have provide and in many other way include financially and hope that that can continue my observation from the contact group be that day to day they be lead that and ensure that we with they continue to convene other nation but the right hon gentleman be absolutely right we all need to be in it for the long haul the minister obfuscate and do not properly answer the question from my right hon friend the member for walsall south valerie vaz so let try again in bid to provide long term certainty of uk support for our friend in ukraine to help repel russia invasion the defence secretary predecessor last august promise action plan for ukraine but it be still nowhere to be see and there be less than two week of leave so minister why have this action plan not be publish and when will it be be not obfuscate be simply refer to the actual action we have be deliver on the ground day in day out in ukraine right from the beginning and before after all we have be train ukrainians since so yes we be deliver action on the ground and it have help to keep ukraine free country largely the signal that we send from this place be obviously important as be sure the minister will agree and in the message that we be hear from the eu and the us there be perhaps some wavering go on come back to the previous question and that of my right hon friend the member for walsall south will the minister commit today to publish the action plan for ukraine before the end of this year well of course this be the last sit day would simply might sound like stuck record but this be so important in this game what matter be what we actually do on the ground we have just announce maritime coalition we continue to send air defence system which be incredibly important we have send artillery shell thousand and thousand of helmet million piece of small arm ammo this be what matter this be the action that deliver we know there be more to do and we be go to keep play that role the russian energy giant gazprom earn million last year from the north sea sillimanite gas field which be partly underneath uk water gazprom be majority own by the russian state and be russia large taxpayer will the minister talk to his counterpart in the department for business and trade to avoid situation where uk defence be give generous military aid while the new office of trade sanctions implementation overlook the russian state funding of its aggression from the proceed of the sale of north sea gas be happy to look into that far two year in and the hardship and devastation continue for the people of ukraine especially as we enter the harsh winter month western official have repeatedly assess that russian force be currently fire artillery at rate five to seven time great than their ukrainian counterpart what more be the government do to ensure an adequate supply of ammunition for ukraine to win this war the hon lady be absolutely right to talk about the issue arise as we move into winter which obviously bring its own challenge have speak about the significant amount of ordnance supply to date as she know we do not talk about the specific of how it arrive in country needless to say we work strongly with our ally and of course with the ukrainian armed force the key point be that we continue to work strongly on supply munition into ukraine but our trade mission be one of the most important development because we now have to focus on help ukrainian industry to manufacture its own arm we want to do that jointly with ukraine we have strong track record of world lead defence business which be part of the key to this thank the minister for his positive response no one inside or outside this house can doubt the commitment of the united kingdom government and ministers to help ukraine as the hustle and bustle of christmas be upon we it be easy for we to forget that ukraine be still at war and hold its own against russian aggression can the minister update the house on how family with child be receive aid and education to ensure that we do not have lost generation of young adult with no learning and no vocational training as ever we save the good for last it be always pleasure to take question from the hon gentleman who always speak with such passion and compassion he be absolutely right about this important issue we have be talk about financial support and as he will be aware the totality of our support to ukraine not just military aid but humanitarian aid be billion of course we need to focus on the humanitarian side but ultimately feel most proud of our contribution when imagine what would have happen if ukraine have be totally conquer that do not bear think about deputy speaker statement we be about to proceed to the statement on housing before call the minister for housing planning and building safety to make the statement must say to the house that mr speaker be seriously concerned that the ministerial code may have be break it will be obvious to the house that the secretary of state for levelling up housing and communities be not here to make the statement which be not unusual the minister be here and we welcome he but remind the house of the follow provision of the ministerial code in paragraph when parliament be in session the most important announcement of government policy should be make in the first instance in parliament in paragraph every effort should be make to avoid leave significant announcement to the last day before recess the house may not be aware but mr speaker be aware that the secretary of state hold televise press conference just after today while this house be sit but while it be still deal with question as we always do between am and pm and that just after pm while the house be deal with question and some two hour before the minister come to the house the secretary of state make this statement to journalist several member have not surprisingly make very reasonable complaint to mr speaker about this very serious discourtesy to the house and it really must be note that it be not trivial matter senior secretary of state make an important policy announcement on television and now the minister place no blame upon the minister whom we welcome to the house be here two hour later this be gross discourtesy to this house on point of order madam deputy speaker can not take point of order until after the statement think it would be good to leave point of order unless they relate absolutely directly to what have just say it do madam deputy speaker then will take the right hon gentleman point of order do it not show contempt not only for member of parliament and this house but for our constituent on whose behalf we speak that the secretary of state make this statement to journalist rather than to this house thank the right hon gentleman for his point of order hope that be the point have just make to the house take it that he agree with what on behalf of mr speaker have just say it be gross contempt rise we will take point of order after the statement but it be only fair that we hear the minister long term plan for housing apologise on behalf of the department for the point you have just highlight madam deputy speaker with permission would like to make statement on the government commitment to house building and the planning policy reform we be make today this government want to build more home in the right place more quickly more beautifully and more sustainably we know that the right way to deliver this be through reform planning system today the secretary of state and be lay out our plan for that reform and we be clear that it be only through up to date local plan that local authority can deliver for community protect the land and the asset that matter most and create the condition for more home to be deliver have plan in place unlock land for home for hospital and general practitioner centre for school for power grid connection and more it lay the foundation for our economic growth and the levelling up of our community the first change we be make today be to update the national planning policy framework we consult on series of proposal last december and receive more than response which we have work through in detail the result update build on the levelling up and regeneration act and deliver on the intent set out by the secretary of state last year and it do so in way that will promote build the right home in the right place with the right infrastructure which will ensure that the environment be protect and give local people great say on where and where not to place new beautiful development will now summarise the key change be make to the framework today and hon member should refer to the consultation response and the framework itself for the publish policy first the standard method for assess local housing need figure have sometimes be difficult to apply in some area and have be blind to the exceptional characteristic of local community the new nppf make it clear that the outcome of the standard method be an advisory starting point in plan make for establish an area housing requirement the revise nppf also now provide more clarity on what may constitute exceptional circumstance for use an alternative method to assess housing need the framework be also clear that the urban uplift should be accommodate in the urban area in which it be apply and should not be export unless there be voluntary cross boundary agreement in place new home be most desperately need in urban area so it be essential that city council plan properly for local people secondly give the importance of the green belt to so many the new nppf be clear that there be generally no requirement on local authority to review or alter green belt boundary unlike labour plan to concrete over the countryside we will not impose top down release of green belt land against the wish of local community where relevant local planning authority choose to conduct review exist national policy will continue to expect that green belt boundary be alter only where exceptional circumstance be fully evidence and justify and this should only be through the preparation or updating of plan the government be make no change to the rule that govern what can and can not be build on green belt land but we be clarify in guidance where brownfield development can occur on the green belt provide that the openness of the green belt be not harm thirdly the government be clear that the character of an exist area should be respect particularly in the historic suburb of our great town and city the new nppf therefore recognise that there may be situation in plan make where significant uplift in urban residential density would be inappropriate as they would be wholly out of character with that exist area in these case authority need not plan for such development that will apply where there be design code that be adopt or will be adopt as part of the local plan know the shadow minister will sympathise with this change give that he recently oppose new home in his constituency due to the impact on greenwich local character fourthly where an up to date plan be in place plan less than five year old and contain deliverable five year supply of land when examine by the inspector authority will no long be require to update that supply annually this change provide those authority with additional protection from the presumption in favour of sustainable development we be also fully remove what be know as the and buffer which could be apply to an authority housing land supply transitional arrangement will ensure that decision make on live application be not affect thus avoid disruption to application in the system for authority that have not yet pass examination but be either at examination regulation or regulation stage and have both policy map and propose allocation there will be two year grace period in which they need to demonstrate only four year housing land supply for decision making that be strong incentive for council to now do the right thing and agree local plan fifthly local community that have work hard to put neighbourhood plan in place should not be penalise for the failure of their council to ensure an up to date local plan the new nppf therefore extend protection for neighbourhood plan from speculative development from two to five year where those plan allocate at least one housing site the update framework also give great support to self build custom build and community lead housing and to encourage the delivery of old people housing include retirement housing housing with care and care home next the nppf cement the role of beauty and placemake in the planning system it now expressly use the word beautiful in relation to well design place it also now require great visual clarity on design requirement set out in planning condition and support gentle density through the promotion of mansard roof development finally the new nppf also strengthen protection for agricultural land by be clear that consideration should be give to the availability of agricultural land for food production in development decision the nppf also support the government energy security strategy by give significant weight to the importance of energy efficiency in the adaptation of exist building while protect heritage with the update nppf now in place the other reform we be make today be focus on set high expectation for performance those who operationalise the system local authority the planning inspectorate and statutory consultees must live up to their responsibility to support that we be take action on four front first we will ensure great transparency because expose what be really go on in system spark action so we will publish new local authority performance dashboard in and pull back the veil on the use of extension of time agreement which in too many instance be conceal poor performance secondly we have be provide and will continue to provide additional financial support that include the increase planning fee that go live fortnight ago as well as range of fund to tackle backlog and improve capability thirdly we will tackle slow process with sam richards lead review into the statutory consultee system and great focus from the planning inspectorate where planning committee be see their decision overturn on appeal finally we will intervene where we need to the secretary of state have issue direction to seven of the bad authority in term of plan make require they to publish plan timetable within week of the publication of the new nppf should they fail we will consider further intervention we be also designate two additional authority for their decision make performance and we will review the threshold for designation to make sure to make sure we be not let off the hook authority that should be do well we be also take action in london because the home need by the capital be simply not be build and opportunity for urban brownfield regeneration go beg as result of the mayor anti housing policy and approach review launch today will identify where change to policy could speed up the delivery of much need home if direct change in london become necessary this government will do that in design these reform we have aim to facilitate desirable development constrain only by appropriate protection that be balance be confident we have strike call the shadow minister thank the minister for advance sight of his statement nothing scream long term housing plan quite like statement from the housing minister since outline the fourth set of change to the national planning policy framework in as many year as ever with this government the reality in no way match the rhetoric as we see with the headline announcement make to the press not this house over the past hour not only be they seemingly at odd with the government state wish to give local community more of say about the placement of new development the truth be that the ink will barely be dry on outline plan for the propose expansion of cambridge by the time the general election be call the punitive and nakedly political intervention that minister be work up for london ahead of the mayoral election will likewise do nothing in practice to resolve the constraint that they themselves have impose on house building in the capital not least by leave industry completely in the dark when it come to second staircase regulation for tall building at cost of thousand of new home when it come to meaningful support for small and medium sized house builder the government have be talk literally for year about the various way in which they need great support while preside over their continue decline far from unlock new generation of home building as the secretary of state have claim the detailed change be make to the nppf today will almost certainly far suppress collapse house building rate let we be clear although there have be minor tweak the change be make be those that the government in their weakness promise the so call planning concern group of tory back bencher they would enact back in december last year in order to stave off rebellion on the levelling up and regeneration bill that be precisely why the member of that group be so pleased with the compromise they have secure today have number of detailed question for the minister start with the impact of these change on overall housing supply whether it be the softening of land supply requirement or the listing of various local characteristic that would justify deviation from the now only advisory standard method can he confirm that the change make to the nppf take together will give those local authority that wish to take advantage of it the freedom to plan for less housing than their nominal local target imply if he dispute that that will be their effect what technical evidence can he provide to demonstrate that these change can be reconcile with boost to housing delivery turn to the government annual housing target which the secretary of state recommit himself to today how on earth do the minister imagine that the change that have be make to the rule around plan make will help the government finally meet that target particularly give that the arbitrary urban uplift have be retain but the requirement for local planning authority to try to meet it out of area in co operation with their neighbour if they can not do so alone have be remove can the minister finally provide convincing explanation of how and when the government home year target will be meet or be it the case that it remain alive in name only abandon in practice even if not formally abolish let turn to local plan coverage in many way the revise nppf speak to planning framework that do not actually exist because under this government we have local plan lead system in which only minority of local authority have up to date plan accord to the most recent figure just have local plan that have be adopt or review within the past five year and only new plan have be submit for examination this year in part this be because of the chilling effect of the government december concession yet only now in the die day of this government be ministers seemingly get bit more serious about intervene to drive up coverage in the times today the secretary of state announce new three month deadline for up to date local plan to be submit will the minister outline the thinking behind that timeframe and tell we what happen if multiple local authority fail to meet the new march deadline in his times interview the secretary of state suggest that local authority that miss that deadline will have development force on they and their power to delay application remove can the minister tell we precisely how that would be achieve the secretary of state also suggest that recalcitrant council will be strip of their planning responsibility can the minister tell we who will take they on give that the planning inspectorate clearly do not have the capacity to do so finally although it be the government contention that the change make today will boost local plan coverage surely the minister recognise that even if that be ultimately their effect it will be at the cost of overall housing supply because it will entail the enactment of numerous plan that will not meet the need of local community in full in short be the truth of the matter that today change entail deliberate shift from plan lead system focus on make at least some attempt to meet housing need to one gear toward provide only what the politic of any give area allow with all the implication that entail for the housing crisis and economic growth thank the opposition spokesperson for his comment which will address in turn he start by say that this be the fourth time we have update the guidance in the last few year if his criticism be that we be willing to listen be flexible and adaptable and recognise the difference between his constituency of greenwich and woolwich and the constituency of government back benchers then he be correct we be willing to be flexible and adaptable but we also recognise that we need to build more home we just want to ensure that they be build in the right place which be exactly what today update seek to do the difference between my party and that of the opposition spokesperson be that we recognise the nuance in the discussion within the nppf we be try to accommodate the fact that different area and part of the country have to be approach in different way while the policy of the hon gentleman party move backwards and forwards on different day of the week we will continue to ensure that we build more home in the right place with the right infrastructure and with the support of the community in the long run that will ensure that we make progress on housing in general the hon gentleman ask question about freedom to plan the housing need assessment will be make by all council but council can make case if there be an exceptional circumstance that apply in their local area if that be not possible there would be no exception for any council local authority or community anywhere which would be completely unnuanced however on macro level it remain the case that we will seek to build more house when council have plan in place they tend to deliver more house than when such plan be not in place so if we can get more plan in place we will have the opportunity to build more home that have the consent and support of the community in which they will be build the hon gentleman ask about urban uplift and the removal of co operation with neighbour we uplift the target and expectation on the basis that those house would go into city and would not be export into the countryside near city because the whole point be to acknowledge the infrastructure in those city there be school in london that be close because insufficient number of child be use they we do not want to export housing elsewhere we want to use that infrastructure include transport link and educational establishment as be intend when it be build this be not about whether we believe in plan lead system or not we clearly do it be about the fact that this government be get on with the hard job of strike balance recognise the nuance and ensure that more progress be be make versus the opposition state that they want to build house but then vote against that happen in relation to nutrient neutrality if they put their money where their mouth be and do what they say they will do they would have the ability to stand up and make such argument consistently they do not and as result will not listen to they call the father of the house before talk about the general policy may mention one small point in paragraph of his statement the minister talk about energy efficiency in heritage building in ambrose place in worthing include at the house of one of my neighbour where harold pinter live people be be tell that they can have only secondary glazing not double glazing because it be in conservation area hope that the minister will talk with expert and say that double glazing be acceptable in reasonable circumstance when people want to improve the energy efficiency of their home on the general point the minister mention the green belt accord to one calculation there be green belt in england none of which be in east sussex or west sussex interpret his word as mean green gap an expression use by the secretary of state when he comment on the problem of worthing where every single bit of grass the vineyard the golf course and the green field between worthing and its neighbour to the west be subject to planning application it be important that the inspector in his department do not come along as they do over the land north of goring station to chatsmore farm and the goring gap and say that even if worthe build on every bit of lawn in town it would not meet the full target and yet give permission to build on that farm which distinguish worthe from its neighbour it be also important to follow up the minister word about intense development in the centre of village town and city so that there be home in high density accommodation that elderly people can choose to live in so that their family home can be free for family the idea that most of the development on our green field be for family be for the bird it be for people on their second or third home think people who be my sort of age ought to have the choice to live securely in high thermal efficiency apartment with service that do not require car and where they can live more easily and happily my hon friend make an important point about energy efficiency which be happy to talk to he about in more detail he be champion for worthe west have family who live close to worthe and know the goring gap well he make strong point about the importance of preserve character and ensure community build the right home in the right place while recognise that there be place where that should not be the case be always happy to talk to he about that this morning the secretary of state complain about house price if the government be now rightly acknowledge the impact of spiral mortgage payment on our constituency when will they apologise for the cause of that their disastrous mini budget be glad to see that the talk point have already start from the opposition back benches despite choose not to acknowledge it the hon lady will know that interest rate have rise across the world follow by normalisation of interest rate for number of month as recognition of change economic circumstance if the hon lady and her party want to continue to make mischief and nuisance about that it be their right to do so but that do not accurately reflect what have happen this government will always try to work through those difficult situation and improve thing for the people of this country will my hon friend confirm that over the past month in writing and at the dispatch box ministers have consistently say that when make local plan planning authority will be able to take into account historically high house building level by lower the amount of housing they need to plan for basingstoke and deane borough council have deliver exceptional level of house building with new home for people over the last five decade how will the government now make good on their year long commitment to recognise basingstoke almost unique position by do whatever be need to support the planning authority to successfully agree revise local plan with significantly low overall house building figure because of the very high amount of house building over the last five decade my right hon friend be right that we consult on that subject in recognition of that consultation we have choose not to take forward the over supply point at this time but we be open to look at it and review it in the future accept basingstoke particular circumstance and have speak to she separately about the recognition that there have be substantial building in basingstoke over many decade be happy to talk to she about the exceptional circumstance provision and look at exactly how that may apply to basingstoke york be now the least affordable place to live in the country my constituent will have no confidence in what the minister and the secretary of state have set out today because they have be wait for local plan for year and counting the sticking point have be with the government department not the will of the labour council when will york receive its local plan be able to protect the precious space we have and build the tenure of housing we need as oppose to developer move in and build luxury flat that no one can afford we be keen to ensure that local plan progress as quickly as possible not just for york but for every other council that choose to pursue the process and we will continue to add support and capacity into the system to ensure that that happen in the write ministerial statement as oppose to the oral statement we have just hear there be strong suggestion that there will be review of london and the centre of london one challenge we face in suburban london be that planning application for high density very tall building normally comprise unit of two bedroom two bathroom and one shared live space be very suitable for young professional but totally useless for family there be shortage of family accommodation in outer london and people would welcome more house but not high density flat my hon friend be absolutely right balance must be strike we will review the situation in london we do not think that it be acceptable we do not think that the mayor have do his job in this regard and we will be review that we also recognise hope my comment early indicate this that there be place in urban area where character be very important and we need to make sure that there be an appropriate balance in that regard liberal democrat lead st albans city and district council be rightly press ahead with the development of its local plan after the previous conservative administration have its plan throw out by the inspector two year ago write to the government request additional funding so that we could accelerate our plan make process but the government say no then request that they allow we to charge developer the full cost of processing application but even with all the tinkering we be still not able to do that and taxpayer in st albans be still subsidise developer to the tune of million year to process their application today the government have ask our local council to publish timetable in the next week but if ministers and their official use google they would find it on the website apparently ministers have announce that the new protection apply to area with local plan but not to area with draft local plan that mean that in st albans village such as colney heath which be besiege by inappropriate development will not benefit from the protection will the minister confirm whether our local district council and planning inspector can firmly say no to inappropriate speculative development or be this just another empty promise from this government believe that the liberal democrats have be in charge of st albans city and district council since that be four and half year of opportunity to put local plan in place it be on the liberal democrats for fail to do so perhaps the liberal democrats could explain whether as part of that local plan they will take their share of the home that their conference say they need to build in the future may ask the minister for very clear answer on the controversial matter of housing target basically there be two way of do it we can have mandatory target where the man in whitehall know good and hand down to local authority target with which they have to comply whether or not it be sensible or we can have advisory target where the department can recommend target but if the locally elect councillor and the people whom they represent know that it be too high and can give strong reason why for instance if their district or borough have large amount of green belt they can legitimately push back in their plan and offer low number so there be the mandatory option which be the labour option and the advisory option which be the conservative option be my understanding correct be grateful to my right hon friend for his question for the first time ever the nppf say at paragraph the outcome of the standard method be an advisory starting point then there be potentially exceptional circumstance that can be discuss with representative of the government in this case the planning inspectorate and the case can be make and then discuss if that be accept an alternative approach can be take our country be face housing crisis and after more than long year the government have utterly fail the nation datum from glenigan publish this week show that planning consent be at record low down on last year and they be due to become the low in decade next year fifty eight local housing authority have scrap or delay their local plan as direct result of the secretary of state flip flopping on housing target last year do the minister agree that the government flip flopping and dither and delay be have significant downward effect on planning and housing delivery have the great of respect for the hon gentleman but we need to have serious conversation about this planning consent be down because planning application be down and that be due to the global economic challenge interruption labour front bench team do not want to accept that there be global economic challenge that just demonstrate why they be so unready for the government of this country we be try to make sure first that we work through the global financial challenge and secondly that we still build the home one way that we undermine the building of more home the kind of home that know the hon gentleman and would both like to see be by not take community with we what we seek to do today be inject more balance into the system so that we can take more community with we if we can get more plan in place it usually mean that more home be deliver in the first place thank the minister for recognise the hard work that local community such as hallow clifton upon teme kempsey and welland have do in my largely rural constituency to develop neighbourhood plan the strengthening of which have be announce today none the less those community be be let down by the fact that our council be run by the independent and greens who do not have local plan in place can he tell we whether the additional protection from speculative development will be immediate or retrospective when will they take effect be huge fan of neighbourhood plan as be many of my colleague across the house they give community the opportunity to get involve in the planning process and to get into the detail they also often demonstrate that have honest conversation with people about planning can take some of the challenge out of the system we be update the nppf with regard to neighbourhood plan and we be strengthen they as my hon friend outline the nppf be extant from the moment that it be upload there be some indication at the back of the plan where policy take priority at later date but we be commit to put neighbourhood planning at the centre of our planning policy because we think that it be very successful and helpful for our community be somewhat perplexed by the renew focus on strengthen local plan give the abolition of the mandatory housing target that underpin delivery against they indeed the minister appear to be outline situation in which local authority can game the system and deliberately plan to under deliver if they have an up to date local plan but local authority that be deliver can be strip of its planning power because its plan be not up to date if the minister be so committed to accelerate housing delivery why be he create situation in which we be both prevent greenfield building and stop significant increase to urban density we be not prevent increase of urban density indeed we want that to happen we recognise that there be consideration around thing such as second staircase which we be work at pace to resolve as quickly as possible we want more home we recognise that the infrastructure be often in place in urban area and we be keen to take up that infrastructure to be able to unlock those home for people who need they if may take the minister back to paragraph will he confirm that the inclusion for the very first time in the nppf of the word advisory starting point will have an impact on both the level of target set and the weight to be give to target how in practice will that change the approach take by planning inspector when they approve plan and decide on individual planning appeal it be absolutely the case that the purpose of amend the national planning policy framework today be so that this information and wording and the insertion of the advisory starting point and everything that follow be take into account in the process and it be important that the planning inspector do that obviously every single council be different and we have set out the reality that each individual council will need to go through this process but that should absolutely be take into account must say to the minister that we have be here before with housing target seem to remember mr john prescott lord prescott put this forward one of the problem we have be that in vast area that include place such as the somerset level exmoor and many other sometimes it be very difficult to build housing however where we have an irresponsible council liberal democrat obviously in mid devon we have another problem because they do not care they do not listen they be there just to cause trouble at every level the minister must make sure that the safeguard be there for people who live in these area not hope we need actual safeguard my hon friend be absolutely right that be one reason why we have be clear with number of council today that they need to get on with thing the whole point be that we put in place process and system that work and for those actor that do not go through it there be consequence in constituency such as mine the green belt be vital to protect we from the urban sprawl of birmingham so welcome the statement so far as it go with its protection for the green belt however can the minister provide great clarity on the matter of target it would be very helpful to have clear understanding of what be mean by the advisory starting point and its impact on any ongoing mechanism to impose the quota of other authority on neighbour on my right hon friend second point be grateful to she for raise it the duty to co operate have be supersede the point of the advisory starting point be to be very clear that individual circumstance might apply within the context of the need to build more home in the right place can not pre empt or suggest exactly what that will mean in all instance there be an example in the nppf of where we think that be likely to be relevant but obviously that will be discuss on case by case council by council basis thank my hon friend for his statement be encourage by his word on provision of care and retirement housing and his focus on design quality have no doubt that we need more home but green space and the green belt be of critical concern in harrogate and knaresborough can he tell little more about the safeguard for the green belt under the conservative party particularly compare with the labour party my hon friend be absolutely correct about the importance of old people housing we be currently in the process of support an old people housing taskforce and look forward to its recommendation about how to improve it for the long run the green belt protection remain today as they be yesterday what we be put around they be clear process about where the case for exceptional circumstance can be make it will be down to individual council with their individual circumstance individual beauty and individual environment to make that case where they feel it be appropriate to do so community in south ribble include eccleston mawdesley and croston be subject to chorley council understand that chorley be one of only two council designate for poor planning performance do the minister believe that that poor performance be due to chorley failure to produce local plan to protect south ribble resident from inappropriate planning application my hon friend be huge champion for her constituent in south ribble we need local plan in place see when first become an mp in north east derbyshire where the labour council fail to put local plan in place the huge issue that cause for community know there be other council all around the country that fail to do that and it cause so many issue we have speak about some of the challenge in south ribble and be keen to work with my hon friend and to talk more about they over the week ahead it be important that plan be put in place where council be not perform where they have not pass the threshold for the number of application they need to pass or have lose too many on appeal we will designate and we will be clear that change be need place on record my gratitude to the secretary of state for agree this time last year to put strong protection for land use in food production into the nppf and to my hon friend the minister for confirm today that they have survive the consultation period will he clarify first that the new language in the nppf be binary test where land be either use in food production or be not end the dancing on the head of pin lawyer paradise of argue about what be good and most versatile and secondly that the character test he speak of apply to rural character as well as in urban environment on my hon friend second point absolutely on his first point will read the footnote to paragraph of the nppf the availability of agricultural land use for food production should be consider hope that be helpful thank my hon friend for much of today announcement in seat such as mine it do not really matter what the target be when such high proportion of the home that be build be just use as short term holiday let this time year ago we agree to another consultation which finish this june ask again when might we have the result of that consultation and step to ensure that when we build home in community such as mine those home be affordable for the people who live and work there be grateful to my hon friend not just for her question which give we only few second to talk about the matter but for her adjournment debate few day ago when we have much long period to talk about it she make very important point know how important it be to colleague in the south east and elsewhere and although be not able to give she date today hope to have more on that very soon welcome what the minister say on the importance of neighbourhood plan on agricultural land and on brownfield development can he clarify what the consequence be if district council have already embark on consultation on local plan but have study the nppf in detail see stuff there that it want to embrace and choose to adopt element of the nppf which then lead to consequential delay there be long section at the end of the revise nppf that explain the arrangement for council that be in the process we be try to strike delicate balance ensure that council go through that process to the extent that they be able to while recognise that those in an early part of the process may want to consider some of the change it generally be the case if recall correctly that when council have pass the regulation stage the second consultation there be great expectation that they will stay in the process it be ultimately for they to make their own judgment but the government will be watch the result think overall that this be very good plan and very well deliver by the minister welcome in particular the remark on character on beauty on the importance of agricultural land on the importance of community support and on the fact that target be start point and not an end point those be significant change that mean that community can be listen to will the minister just confirm that the exceptional circumstance will be available perhaps even welcome for example include island separate by sea such as my isle of wight constituency the footnote to paragraph use as an example area that be island with no land bridge that have significant proportion of elderly resident hope my hon friend will welcome the fact that that sound very much like the isle of wight the prize for patience and perseverance with the last question of the year go to nigel mills it be privilege madam deputy speaker five year ago the export of house from derby make local plan in amber valley impossible but there be no reason for delay now do the minister agree that there be no reason for the labour run council not to have make more rapid progress with the pretty reasonable plan it inherit in may will he also confirm what the consequence will be if the week direction he have issue today do not result in rapid progress to ensure that resident in amber valley get local plan sometime soon be grateful to my hon friend and constituency neighbour who know speak up for his constituent labour win amber valley borough council and it now need to own ensure that the council deliver on its responsibility if labour have make promise to amber valley resident that it can not fulfil that be on labour ultimately it be the responsibility of council to make sure that they have plan in place and to do that at the early possible opportunity where labour council such as amber valley be fail to do that and be speak out of both side of their mouth it be right that he call that out amber valley need to get on with its plan point of order on point of order madam deputy speaker it be well know matter of parliamentary protocol that when hon member carry out visit and duty in another member seat they notify the member prior to their visit time and time again other hon member have visit my seat on official duty and not notify they include recently the hon member for sheffield heeley louise haigh and repeat unnotified visit by the right hon member for wentworth and dearne john healey perhaps the shadow transport secretary notification get delay just like the woeful bus service the mayor of south yorkshire be preside over and perhaps the shadow defence secretary do not want to announce come to brexit vote rother valley on the back of labour new plan for close military tie with the eu madam deputy speaker please can you confirm that mps on official visit to other members seat should always notify sit member before thank you very much we do not need any further intervention but will take further point of order if the right hon member for wentworth and dearne would like to make one far to that point of order madam deputy speaker unlike the hon gentleman and my family actually live in

frequently interruption will the hon member for rother valley please be quiet and allow to answer the question that he raise now will the right hon gentleman remove from his remark the mention of the hon gentleman family interruption think we be get little confused here largely because there be noise and when people shout can not hear what other people be say think there have be some confusion so

on private business but on party business or otherwise where that occur it should not for the guidance of members although know that the right hon member for wentworth and dearne do not need it

secretary to the treasury have refuse to correct the record so far would be grateful for your advice madam deputy speaker on whether there be any guidance available to ministers on the circumstance in which they should seek to make such correction be grateful to the hon gentleman for give notice of his point of order as mr speaker have say many time from this chair and have repeat the accuracy of ministers statement in the house be not matter for the chair the interpretation of statistic be matter of interpretation and it be very often the case that one member view statistic from one angle and another member view the same statistic from completely different angle the hon gentleman have make his point very clearly and be sure that those on the treasury bench will have hear it far to that point of order madam deputy speaker it may be helpful to the house if draw its attention once again to paragraph of the autumn statement document which outline exactly how that tax cut be calculate thank the hon lady for her point of order which think prove what have just say the hon gentleman and the hon lady be look at the same statistic and interpret they in slightly different way that be

order no beg to move that leave be give to bring in bill to pardon miner convict of certain offence commit during the miner strike welcome the opportunity to speak about matter of great importance to and many other in my midlothian constituency and beyond miner pardon would be powerful symbol of reconciliation it would show we be prepared to put the past behind we and move on the miner strike of be one of the most bitter and divisive event in british history it be time when miner who be fight for their job and their community be meet with the full force of the state thousand be arrest and many be convict of offence such as breach of the peace obstruction of the police and breach of bail condition those conviction be travesty of justice the miner be hero not criminal they be fight for their livelihood the scottish parliament have helpfully already pass law pardon miner who be convict in scotland during the strike believe that now be the time for the uk government to do the same for those miner in england and wales member may ask why scottish mp be bring in this bill it be not only because some miner may have move from my constituency to england and wales but because any kind of compensation scheme would require uk wide pardon to be in effect beyond that it be matter of justice the miner deserve to have their conviction wipe away they deserve to be remember as the hero they be in their community the miner strike be watershed moment in british history and it have profound impact on scotland especially the strike be national dispute but it be particularly hard fought in scotland where the coal industry be major employer and significant part of the culture and identity of many community have speak several time about the merit of uk wide inquiry into the miner strike of over that time have gather the view and memory of many of those who be involve at the height of the strike move to my now hometown of loanhead at the height of the strike in criminal record lose pension and social stigma be now the real world consequence of the action that many take many be still live with the aftermath today pardon and indeed public inquiry could be step on the way to get answer and redress for those affect by the many injustice cause by those event we need to heal the wound of the past in order to move forward do we learn from injustice and listen to the lesson or would we do it all again give the chance those be the question that need answer for the sake of community across the country especially my own in midlothian mining in midlothian date back all the way to the century when the monk of newbattle abbey first begin extract coal by the century mining be integral to my community way of life midlothian be home to range of pit from bilston glen and monktonhall to the first victorian super pit at the lady victoria colliery which be still home to the national mining museum scotland would welcome any hon member who want to visit at any time they can let know that they be come if they want but they can also come in their own time it be great visit by the mine mean miner strike token picket of six be maintain at monktonhall but bilston glen and loanhead see mass picketing and some of the most bitter conflict of the strike in scotland accord to professor jim murdoch miner story show without doubt that the criminal justice system all too often react in an arbitrary and disproportionate manner former miner at monktonhall colliery and former council colleague of mine alex bennett who sadly pass away in january this year tell the inquiry in scotland be snatch by one of the snatch squad they go for the union official and they know our name the original charge be for rioting but that be go to stick so they change it to breach of the peace the tactic be simply to use whatever mean necessary to get miner especially union official off the picket line and into the cell breach of the peace obstruct police officer breach of bail and theft all those charge and more be twist to justify the snatch squad style of policing these tactic would not look out of place in north korea or putin russia serious question remain about the extent of allege political interference in the policing of the strike arrest striker be sack and deny redundancy payment and pension right the scottish government rightly recognise the scale of the injustice back in when they commission an independent review lead by john scott kc of the impact of police on community but the campaign do not start only then pay tribute to former msp neil findlay who be campaign as far back as for an inquiry and compensation for the miner who be catch up in this that baton be pick up by richard leonard who ensure that the bill pass through the scottish parliament with the support of the scottish government have already mention former councillor alex bennett from danderhall who sadly die in january my predecessor david hamilton do so much to support the cause then there be those who take part in support the scottish government inquiry include independent review advisory panel member dennis canavan jim murdoch and kate thomson follow testimony from former miner police officer and mining community the review group make one single recommendation that the scottish government should introduce legislation to pardon miner convict for certain matter relate to the strike the miners strike pardons scotland act be welcome by the national union of mineworkers for remove the stigma of criminal record be delighted to say that it be pass unanimously by the scottish parliament in june it be never too late by follow the lead of the scottish government healing can start today for other part of these isle numerous clash between strike miner and police officer result in injury and arrest the uk government impose tight restriction on picketing make it difficult for miner to gather and protest lead to frustration and anger among many community the government bring in non union worker which be see by many miner as betrayal and lead to further violence and unrest the carnage of that time see job lose forever and the economic hardship cause by the strike lead to social problem such as poverty unemployment social deprivation and alcoholism that have have hard knock on effect on other community as industry and business that rely on coal be also force to close many struggle to make end meet in some way it all resemble civil war create huge division and strife among family and community the strike be see as full scale attack by the government and police on miner and their community it be only right that this place now take the chance to recognise the solidarity that miner and their community have and still have to this day by bring forward pardon it would be lasting symbol of recognition of what go wrong during the decline of the coal industry of the destruction of town village and their way of life by the government of the day the strike be still remember with great deal of bitterness in community like mine we could do the right thing by right the wrong of that time encourage all member to support the bill it be never too late

instal horizon accounting software but fault in the software lead to shortfall in branch account the post office demand that postmaster cover the shortfall and in many case wrongfully prosecute they for false accounting or theft attempt to protest their innocence fall on deaf ear and decent honest and hard work postmaster who serve at the heart of our community be subject to range of abject harm take the case of alan bates who be one of number of hero in this tale as many member will know mr bates be due to be immortalise on our screen on january in the itv series mr bates vs the post office which will make compelling view for many of we he be an innocent man who alongside his partner suzanne invest of life saving to start new life and run the post office branch in craig don on the north wales coast when shortfall begin to emerge mr bates be accuse by the post office of mismanagement and order to repay the difference immediately he protest his innocence and identify some of the suppose shortfall as the result of an overnight software update the post office continue to pursue payment meanwhile refuse mr bates the it access necessary to interrogate his own branch account his postmaster contract be subsequently terminate with mr bates lose his likelihood saving and reputation in his community in the process suspect that other postmaster may have suffer because of horizon issue mr bates launch his campaign website year later he gather enough evidence to successfully take the post office to court and expose the scandal like mr bates my constituent mr and mrs simpson run village shop and post office that suffer from the faulty software they have campaign for compensation through the justice for subpostmasters alliance and mr simpson himself give evidence at the public inquiry will the minister join in pay tribute to my constituent and their colleague without their determination and courage we would not be where we be today deliver this bill to support those victim thank my hon friend for his intervention and particularly thank mr and mrs simpson for their work of course number of people campaign so strongly on this tragedy pay tribute to his constituent and to many other like they who make sure we be here today deliver justice and indeed compensation for those postmaster alan bates case be one individual tragedy but he be only one among many over people have suffer in some way as result of this scandal for some that mean pay the post office money they do not owe for other it mean the loss of their livelihood their home their mental or physical health or their family relationship too many have die before get justice sad of all some of those death be suicide each horizon victim be personal tragedy and it be imperative that each and every one get the justice and compensation for which they have wait too long this government be commit to deliver justice for all horizon victim part of that justice will come from make sure that everyone know the truth about what happen which be why the government set up the statutory inquiry into the scandal chair by sir wyn williams the work of that inquiry to date be commendable it be do important work in expose the truth from that truth will follow corporate and individual accountability for which there be strong appetite in this house and beyond sympathise with hon member desire to see accountability right now but we must let justice take its course on the minister point about corporate responsibility have the chief executive of the post office come and apologise to one of the people have represent in this exercise the point make to he which hope the minister will also take on board be that the corporate behaviour of the post office have not be above criticism it have employ very expensive lawyer to make this process much more difficult for the victim than it need to be hope the government will continue to encourage the post office not to do that absolutely we want to make it as easy as possible thank my right hon friend for his campaigning on this matter too he be one of number of parliamentarian who have do fantastic work to make sure we be here today have refer to both corporate and individual responsibility corporate accountability be not enough where we find that individual be to blame they should be hold to account too any compensation must be fair and just and we have create horizon compensation advisory board to help we make sure that happen be very grateful to the right hon member for north durham mr jones both for his campaigning on this matter and his work on the advisory board he sit on the board alongside lord arbuthnot who be another great campaigner on this matter and two academic its report which be publish on have be invaluable in help we ensure that the scheme be work properly and deliver fairness as part of the post office process for compensation for overturn conviction it be by agreement with claimant lawyer appoint an independent assessor for the process whose role will be to ensure that fair compensation be pay the minister be right when he say that this be miscarriage of justice as have often say in this place be formerly postmaster and can remember when the till do not balance unlike the post office believe my staff that it be not their fault that there be an error luckily those error be not significant and we just write they off thank the minister for all he have do as well as my hon friend the member for sutton and cheam paul scully who have equally do an enormous amount the post office do not believe those innocent postmaster who be simply do their job but equally fujitsu supply the software that do not work properly yet never hear about whether that company be culpable can the minister tell what fujitsu have ever have to suffer from what have happen to everybody else thank my hon friend for his work on this issue as well as his direct experience he be one of the few people in this house who have that experience also pay tribute to my hon friend the member for sutton and cheam paul scully for all the work he do as my predecessor his comment about fujitsu and about make sure that it be not the taxpayer alone who pick up the tab be clearly on the record again where responsibility can be assign there should be accountability perhaps in the form of compensation pay by those company it be right though that the sir wyn williams inquiry be allow to take the time it need to report and to identify blame where it exist those matter can then be deal with at that time alongside introduce this bill my department publish revise version of the document for the group litigation order scheme which make clear than ever that the scheme exist to pay full fair and timely compensation if compensation can not be agree with my department decision will be make by panel of independent expert any glo postmaster who believe that the panel award fail that fairness test can ask the scheme independent reviewer sir ross cranston to look at their case between they those arrangement provide powerful and independent assurance that compensation be fair turn to compensation amount to date around million have be pay out to over claimant across the three compensation scheme establish by the post office and the government those figure be regularly update on the dedicated page so far conviction have be overturn we have see positive progress since my previous statement to the house on september which announce that postmaster who have have conviction on the basis of horizon evidence overturn be entitle to up front offer of as fix sum in full and final settlement of their claim can confirm that follow that announcement the first claimant have now settle their claim with the post office take the total to full and final settlement hope this will encourage other postmaster to submit claim should add that significant proportion of those claimant follow the fix sum award route the glo scheme administer by my department for the trailblaze postmaster who take the post office to court and expose the horizon scandal have already pay out roughly million across claimant postmaster who be neither convict nor member of the glo can apply to the post office run horizon shortfall scheme be pleased to say that every last one of the people who apply before the scheme original deadline have now receive initial offer of compensation and some million have be pay out the post office be now deal with late application and with those case where the initial offer be not accept turn now to the provision of the bill before we the post office horizon system compensation bill small bill of just two clause provide continue legal basis for the payment of compensation to victim of this appalling scandal principally it will enable the government to continue to pay compensation under the glo scheme that my department be currently administer compensation payment make under the scheme be currently pay under the sole authority of the successive appropriation act and parliament require all such payment to be make within two year period the first payment of interim compensation be make on august mean that with the law as it stand no glo payment can be make beyond august this bill remove that deadline this certainly do not mean we be take our foot off the gas we will still want to be able to pay compensation as quickly as possible my department be now committed to make an initial offer of compensation in of case within working day of receive fully complete glo claim and many claim will be deal with much more quickly however as sir wyn williams have note the resolution of compensation claim require action by postmaster their adviser and third party as well as by the government in his interim report which he provide to parliament in july sir wyn express concern that the august deadline could leave some postmaster time out of compensation or rush into make decision the government agree that this must not happen and the bill ensure that it will not happen all glo postmaster will get full and fair compensation and they will get it promptly without be unduly rush in conclusion until everyone have fair compensation the truth be know and the guilty be hold accountable member of this house and other will rightly continue to raise issue about this scandal in the meantime the house should know that this government be on the side of the postmaster and we will continue to give these issue our full attention and do our good to resolve they this bill be further example of that and commend it to the house call the shadow minister want to begin by pay tribute to member across the house who have work tirelessly on this campaign particularly my right hon friend the member for north durham mr jones for his work in campaign on this issue and lord arbuthnot for his many year of work in tackle this injustice of course as the minister have say we all pay particular tribute to alan bates for his pioneer work in this campaign and for work tirelessly to seek justice without his bravery and perseverance the campaign would not be where it be today the horizon scandal as we have hear from the minister be truly shocking miscarriage of justice and one of the most devastating in british history the scandal have bring devastation to the life of over falsely convict sub postmaster and year on they and their family be still suffer from the consequence and the trauma of all they have be put through want to pay tribute to their determination for pursue justice the wrongly accuse sub postmaster have have to endure unjust prison term family breakdown homelessness bankruptcy health consequence be ostracise from their own community and bad to say nothing of the mental health toll and the stress they have all carry while know that they have be wrongly convict do not think any of we can truly understand the scale of what they have suffer as of august the post office horizon it inquiry and the court case have hear that at least sub postmaster have die without see justice or receive compensation and at least four have tragically take their own life most recently tom brown constituent of my right hon friend the member for north durham sadly pass away he be the sub postmaster of several branch span year and he die without receive his full and final compensation my thought and be sure those of the whole house be with his family and friend at this time as well as with the many other who have lose love one affect by this horrific injustice many have suffer and continue to suffer because of this scandal tracy felstead be post office worker who be jail when she be just rubbina shaheen suffer prison sentence as result and have to sell her house and live in van seema misra be pregnant with her second child when she be convict of theft and send to jail in she say it be the bad thing it be so shameful as result she experience regular suicidal thought at the time those be just few of the example in tragically long list this be scandal that have destroy victim life and take everything from they but this case be beyond just be scandal it be an insidious injustice that have be devastating and have in some case claim people life the suffering of the sub postmaster can never come close to be repay but the very least the government can do be ensure that they receive their fair compensation as soon as possible many of those who sadly have pass away never live to see their innocence prove or to see the compensation that they deserve pay with further delay to the compensation the government run the risk of more sub postmaster not receive the compensation they deserve as soon as possible so it be vital that ministers act with urgency and speed my hon friend be make an excellent speech pay tribute to the campaigner particularly mr bates and indeed hon member from across the house the point she make about the government the post office and indeed fujitsu learn lesson from this appalling scandal be absolutely right and do hope that the minister when he speak later will be able to address those point do she agree with that it be very important that the government learn the lesson and help the post office learn the lesson of such awful incident thank my hon friend for his intervention and know that the minister will be keen to make sure that these mistake be never repeat and that the lesson be learn it be vital that we act with urgency and speed and look forward to the full publication of the post office horizon it inquiry so that we can ensure that those responsible be finally hold to account it can not be right that they have not be hold to account as yet when so much time have pass want to thank sir wyn williams and the inquiry team for their ongoing work the labour party will work with the government to do what we can to ensure that justice be deliver and as such we support the bill the government must now confirm how they will use the extra time that this bill grant to deliver justice as quickly as possible welcome some of the detail that the minister have provide in writing as well as what he have say today and hope that he ensure that the necessary action be take to ensure delivery and that the compensation be provide as quickly as possible once again pay tribute to all those who have work tirelessly to secure justice and commend this bill to the house thank you madam deputy speaker for give the opportunity to ease my way back on to the back benches and speak about this issue and number of other after nearly four year of deal with covid and its effect on the hospitality sector the online safety bill and gambling harm nothing have keep awake at night more than the plight of the sub postmaster who fall within the horizon scandal and the big miscarriage of justice in british court history welcome the bill and thank the minister for all his work in try to rectify the situation it be horrendously complex with many strand of compensation and lot of different compete need and demand it be lovely to see on the official bench some familiar face of those who have work tirelessly over many year include precede my time as minister this provision be not just to extend the time available and ensure that we be ahead of the process for august next year but be important in itself to keep this issue in the public eye mention have be make of mr bates vs the post office which be look forward to see in the new year with all the compete interest of what be happen in the middle east in ukraine and in people personal life here in the uk it be important that we remind ourselves of what can happen if one corporation overstep its reach we must always remind ourselves of that and we must drive our way through to solve this issue get the answer that the postmaster need and importantly restore their financial situation as good we can to where they be before the detriment occur remember how we pull lever when be minister and use the fact that the then prime minister boris johnson stand at the dispatch box and say in answer to question that he would happily look at public inquiry that give carte blanche to lean in and ensure that we use that authority and with the backing of official and my department we start what be originally non statutory inquiry that then become statutory it have to become statutory after we hear from the judge in the court of appeal at the time genuinely want it to be non statutory not because want to resile from anything that be happen but purely and simply for speed and ease it be so that we could concentrate on get the postmaster compensation and the answer they want rather than have layer of lawyer frankly we be see that at the covid inquiry at the moment look at other thing outside the narrow term of reference we clearly have to have statutory inquiry once the judge at the court of appeal outline his thought despite the complexity when first speak to sir wyn when appoint he at the beginning we be hop that the inquiry would be wrap up by now and it be frustrating that by necessity he be still go through the deliberation take evidence and work through hugely complex situation it be disappointing but understandable that compensation be take so long to get out for reason that the minister have already describe regard how we work through such complexity the shadow minister talk about how the minister might use the extra time beyond august hope we do not need that extra time and that it be there to get ahead of the process rather than say that we will extend the process because we have carte blanche permission to go beyond august and kick it into the long grass as we have hear people can not wait people be die people be take their own life people have be force out of their village indeed the constituent of one hon member be force out of the country for fear of the shame of something they have not do in the first place with hindsight if be back at the start of the process would like to run the compensation all in one go from the department interruption the right hon member for north durham mr jones be nod his head because he ask about that at the time very much take on board the work he have do not just as campaigner but on the advisory committee put lot of weight both on his word in the chamber and on those he say to informally outside it when we could talk in more depth about what be happen with his constituent and the other people we be speak about if we have run the compensation as one process within the department it could have help to narrow the focus of what need to be do be not ask the minister to go down that line but whatever happen in the month to come hope he will always look at provide flexibility and at what more we can do to keep the pressure on there be phrase in the civil service and in government about do thing at pace it be phrase never really hear outside government always hear it in government and the problem be who define what pace something be what we mean be quickly or more haste less speed as my old teacher use to say as have say this be the good thing will ever do in politic and the official in the department many of whom be here today have repeat that it have become very liberating because think we be all on the same page we all want to get this do now not only so that we can get people compensation but so that we can get answer and justice and put on the hook those who should be on the hook rather than the taxpayer it be also important to do that for the future of the post office see the hon member for motherwell and wishaw marion fellows the chair of the all party group on post office in her place if this be any other type of corporation or company the chance be that it would have go to the wall and go bust by now as the reputational damage would have be too big the post office be too important for the fabric of our society to allow it to go by the wayside to address its the future we have to tackle the past as well make sure that those two strand be run together be so important will leave it at that do not want to keep the house too long but remember tracy felstead janet skinner seema misra christopher head lee castleton and other people some of whom still keep in touch with what be happen usually on twitter or wish everyone in this house merry christmas hope that we all have good rest and happy new year but want those postmaster affect to have as good christmas and new year as they can want to make sure that christmas be an even well christmas and new year for they because by then hope we will have sort the compensation as well we can and bring this to close so that they can move on and so can the post office call the snp spokesman it be pleasure to follow the hon member for sutton and cheam paul scully in no way do want the speech be about to give to seem mean spirited but thing have to be say so will say they and hope in justifiable way while the bill be welcome to ensure that no horizon victim who be part of the group litigation order miss out on compensation we must ensure that despite the extension all effort be make to compensate victim fairly as soon as possible thank the minister for his remark on that in his opening speech it be hard to see why such bill which do nothing more than empower the secretary of state to pay compensation have take so long to get here concern be first publish in the medium in in the post office scrap its independent investigation into the system by second sight the day before the report be due to be publish post office ltd concede court case admit horizon fault more than four year ago on the day of the last general election move that seem to have be time to avoid scrutiny call for compensation have be clear and long this bill could have be pass in the first month of this parliament but it be not it be now come to the fag end of this parliament and we need to move on know that everyone be committed to that but fact be fact we still have no idea three and half year after settle why the situation be allow to go on for so long many victim as we be all well aware have sadly pass away and some by their own hand they never see proper justice and proper compensation for the year of trauma they endure at the hand of post office their family still suffer the ongoing inquiry have be blight by further delay and disclosure issue by post office each inquiry delay disgracefully delay justice and the payment of compensation there must be no further setback obstruct the delivery of justice the inquiry have uncover further scandal upon scandal and the pervasive culture throughout post office ltd between and today have be one of dishonesty incompetence and deceit raise further question over all post office conviction in this period not just those link to horizon the action of post office ltd employee at various level and in various department include those responsible for auditing and investigation and in the legal department have be bring to light in the most recent stage of the inquiry at every level there be clear culpability the boastful manner in which some of those responsible celebrate the conviction of innocent sub postmaster while know of horizon bug add insult to injury for victim the bill be too narrow in its scope and in the interest of justice it should be broaden to ensure that everyone who have be investigate and convict by post office ltd have their case investigate to ensure that no other miscarriage of justice have happen there be still question to be answer about the post office co operation with the inquiry and its relationship with fujitsu past and present in april post office ltd renew the contract with fujitsu which create and provide the horizon software for another year so far fujitsu have avoid any financial penalty as result of the faulty software with the burden fall on the government and post office but in january member of the other place say that fujitsu should dig into its pocket for do nothing while the scandal unfold in front of its eye the inquiry be investigate how much fujitsu be aware of the problem with its software the risk of false reporting and what could have be do to prevent the tragedy gareth jenkins the former chief architect at fujitsu be due to give evidence at the statutory public inquiry on and july this year so far he have not be able to do so some document include some that be significant to jenkins evidence be only receive from post office at pm on july allow no time for lawyer to analyse they he be schedule to give evidence after the summer break and he subsequently ask for guarantee that his testimony could not be give as evidence against he which be deny we be still wait to hear from he therefore support amendment table by the right hon member for north durham mr jones which would ensure that we know the whole truth about the allege error carry out by post office ltd beyond horizon all potential victim of the practice of post office ltd must get the justice they deserve beyond that real question need to be ask of successive uk government whether labour or tory who allow the scandal to fester under their watch as the sole shareholder in post office ltd successive uk government have utterly fail in their oversight of the company allow the most widespread miscarriage of justice to continue for two decade even in more recent time the current uk government have allow repeat scandal to occur with bonusgate be one of the many despicable recent episode that have bring yet more shame to once trust national institution the secretary of state for business and trade describe the debacle as news to we as ministers however document obtain through freedom of information request by campaigner eleanor shaikh show that ministers and official endorse the post office inquiry metric as part of their approval of its chief executive officer and chief financial officer in the transformation scheme letter request approval be send to the department for business energy and industrial strategy permanent secretary and accounting officer in july outline detail comprehensively the document be then send to the secretary of state for energy and industrial strategy and ministers give their endorsement five month after the inquiry become statutory likewise the uk government investments representative on the board be well aware of the inquiry sub metric it be absolutely clear that post office ltd current system of governance need to be address immediately to ensure great level of oversight and transparency in decision making by the government and the ukgi representative on the post office ltd board there be question to be answer about post office co operation with the inquiry and its past and present relationship with fujitsu the management of post office ltd have be expose and question remain over its continued stewardship of our post office network indeed become interested in post office because of the decline in the network know nothing of horizon at the time early this year london economics produce report show that the social value deliver by post office be and half time great than the financial input it receive from the government closure have pick away at the post office network as the hon member for sutton and cheam mention the department for business and trade must do more to protect community extend my sympathy to the victim of this scandal who still endure the trauma inflict by post office the minister be right we be all here today to make sure that people get the compensation they deserve however some of the figure be sober understand that some of the problem may be due to the difficulty of make claim in the first place and thank dan neidle for his exposure of that pay tribute to all the campaigner will also make special apology to alan bates because at one point when do not realise the significance of what have happen say that do not believe in witch hunt still do not believe in they but evidence be build against those who have make serious mistake and error and who in some case have hide fact be pleased to hear the minister talk about corporate and individual responsibility which be really important thank he for say that compensation claim will still be pursue vigorously this be really technical bill to allow payment to carry on and they must do so as speedily and efficiently as possible nothing can make up for the trauma that so many people have go through but we need to compensate those who have suffer and we need to compensate they properly well and timeously declare an interest as member of the horizon compensation advisory board rise to welcome the bill and the reasoning behind it as outline by the minister must say that the minister be commit to ensure that we make the scheme as fair and equitable as possible as he say it would have be unjust to have leave the sword of damocles that be the arbitrary deadline of next august hang over the head of potential claimant it be right that the bill be bring forward echo the hon member for sutton and cheam paul scully that we do not want to see delay in compensation but because of the trauma that individual be involve in and the complexity some case may take long than other may at this point put on the record my thank to the hon member for sutton and cheam have deal with the issue for more year than care to remember and must say have deal with succession of useless minister who literally accept what their civil servant say and continue to parrot that even when they know that the horizon system be at fault it be credit to he that he be the only one who grasp the situation and get to understand its complexity also welcome the private chat we have on some of the issue he be right that the scheme be not easy to implement but he be willing to question thing that be clearly wrong and to put it through would not want to make the minister blush but if people want an example of minister do his job and have something to look back on and be proud of they should look at his response to this matter do not want to downgrade the present minister who have pick up the baton and as the poacher turn gamekeeper that he be be follow through to ensure that the scheme and justice be deliver for those individual affect by horizon as have be mention first get involve because of constituent call tom brown who come to my surgery say to any new member in the house that if they ever get case in constituency surgery and think this sound complex but it just seem wrong they should dig into it and stick with it tom be sub postmaster in north kenton in newcastle he have work at other post office before that but he and his wife have buy sub post office in north kenton for which he see as an investment not only for he but for his family future he run it with his wife they have convenience store and it be successful until the horizon computer system come along like many victim he be give initial training on the system but it come out in the inquiry that it be completely inadequate not long after horizon be instal tom start have shortfall if they be small many people just make they up but in his case they get to he could not reconcile it despite go to the helpline and say look something wrong here the helpline just ignore he in november two post office employee come along to do branch audit which be when the nightmare for tom and his family begin he be accuse of steal the despite his effort to explain the shortfall in the system no one listen nor do they listen in the many other victim case tom have invest in property he have his business investment property and his own house he have the indignity not only of his name be in the local newspaper as someone who have steal but of have his home search by the post office look strangely enough for the as though he have it stuff under the bed the indignity of that be remarkable we must remember that these individual be pillar of the local community people look up to they and respect they in their community and that be suddenly all tear away in his witness statement to the inquiry tom describe the sensational medium wildfire which be disturb for he and for his family he be open in his statement that he consider suicide sadly we have hear that at least four people have take their own life he do not because of his strong family the irony of his situation be that when the post office prosecute he the case go to crown court only to be withdraw on the day it be hear he be find not guilty of false accounting because no evidence be put forward the judge say in his sum up sure you be take this far mr brown by that stage tom be leave bankrupt he be accuse of steal his name sully that lead to hardship not just for he but for his family he have to sell his property and his business after it flounder his son have to take he in and also get into financial difficulty borrow money to support his father and they end up in social housing in my constituency the family be completely break want to stress this aspect we talk about the individual victim but the effect on their family must be highlight and compensate some family member need counselling because of the effect on they and tom witness statement to the inquiry sum that up well sadly tom do not live to see the compensation he deserve nor to see his name clear and those involve in his case bring to justice he pass away few week ago add my condolence to his family his name be still there with alan bates who have be mention and the other who fight this case would we have get to where we be today without those people no we would not because even when the post office know that the system be flawed it spend million of taxpayer money defend the indefensible in court as result of the litigation bring by alan bates and the rest of the the tactic of the post office be very clear it be to use public money our money to outspend the postmaster who have take it to court that be outrageous give that it subsequently come to light during the inquiry and also in court that the post office know that it do not have leg to stand on it be force to settle out of court because it have run out of money which be the intention of the post office and the department that be in charge at the time do we need to get this system move yes we do have be on the advisory board understand the complexity of the scheme would we start where we be start now if we be start afresh no we would not but people have already die include tom and it be imperative now for we to try to get this compensation pay to their family and to the other postmaster the hon member for sutton and cheam also say that we would not have start here we now have the group litigation scheme the historical shortfall scheme and the overturn conviction scheme be it too late to try to pull those three into one personally think it be and do not know what the minister civil servant would do if we suggest it in any event do not think that it be the way forward one thing that do welcome be the appointment of sir ross cranston as the final arbitrator in the process if people be not happy about the level of compensation they receive there will be that final independent arbitrator there have always be this point about independence do any of those involve trust the post office no they do not do trust the post office no still do not trust it give the way in which it have handle this matter the right hon gentleman be make great speech and he have get to the crux of the situation by talk about trust the postmaster have have plenty of year of seemingly reassuring word that they can not trust and it be incumbent on all of we to act entirely agree and think that that be how the hon gentleman help in try to cut through the word but whatever say he say or anyone say be these people ever go to trust the post office in his statement to the inquiry tom say think the post office be the most corrupt organisation around have to say that do not disagree this be not about people make mistake in public administration people do make mistake this be clearly cover up conspiracy and think downright criminality on the part of certain individual will return shortly to how we be to get justice in respect of those individual but the bill be about compensation and think it important that we take this step forward want to pay tribute to some of those who have keep the fire burn over the year include lord arbuthnot james arbuthnot who have be tireless campaigner on this issue since he be in the house of commons nick wallis and karl flinders of computer weekly they have do great work in push the issue forward and they need to be thank for it also want to raise an important point in respect of the scheme we have now do not think that new development could come about but they have this be relevant to amendment which table but which be unfortunately not select for technical reason lo and behold few month ago learn that there have be another scheme which could almost be describe as son or daughter of horizon but which precede it it be trialle in the north east of england the only reason know about it be that be contact by the son of lady somewhere in the north east she do not want any publicity who want to come and see she when go to see she think this sound like horizon case but it can be because the date be wrong lo and behold we now learn that trial be do mainly in the north east before horizon that lady will not get compensation she be prosecute and understand that another case have now be find this also come out at the inquiry when all the publicity come out about horizon why do no one come forward and say by the way do you realise we have another system on the go at the beginning and we prosecute people under that system know the minister be on to this and be certain that the advisory board be as well there be potentially other people who be prosecute because of another fail system that be not horizon that need address as matter of urgency because there be people out there who be clearly innocent think the lady have just mention could be describe as have post traumatic stress disorder she be completely mentally scarred by the episode if we can get justice for that individual and other we should certainly do so commend the right hon gentleman for make that salient point be aware that there be many affect postmaster and family in northern ireland include some in my constituency what they be seek be timescale for when all postmaster in northern ireland and indeed across this great united kingdom can expect to receive their compensation and hope that the right hon gentleman be go to ask for that now those in my constituency have not receive any word about compensation yet do he agree that when the minister sum up the debate we want to be give the timescale for the compensation we want to know that right away yes we now have this bill and we have get the compensation scheme move and think we need to move very quickly to get the money pay out another issue relate to overturned conviction nearly people have be convict odd through the post office some of they in northern ireland and scotland be convict under different system some be prosecute by the dwp for example will not rehearse the argument now but only of those conviction have be overturn and that do not sit right with somebody ask why people have not come forward but they be never go to come forward they have be so scarred and traumatise by the court process that they will never go anywhere near court process again we need to tackle that and will cover that when speak to my amendment later welcome this bill my final point be on responsibility if this scandal have happen in the united states which take very different approach to financial crime and misdemeanour people would be in jail by now the evidence be all there and accept that sir wyn be slowly prise it out of the post office but there be individual such as paula vennells who ironically get cbe in for service to the post office even though she oversee all that be go on have write on numerous occasion to the honours forfeiture committee to get that take off she but have have no answer if there be one broad lesson to be learn from this scandal by ministers and future ministers it be that when the state do something like this that be so wrong there should be no hiding place for anyone who have be responsible sir wyn be do great job in his inquiry to unearth some of these thing fujitsu have be mention that be an organisation that definitely have some huge question to answer think there be two part to this first we have to get the compensation pay the minister have commit to try to put people in the position they would have be in if they have not be affect which be what we need to do will the compensation ever fully compensate they for what they have be through no it will not they will have scar but it will help the other important thing be that the people responsible should be bring to justice and have their day in court clearly they need to answer for it finish with the final line of tom brown evidence to the public inquiry at paragraph would like to find out who be responsible once and for all and to see someone take accountability for the wrong doing of the post office could not have put it well myself will be brief first want to congratulate the minister and his predecessor the hon member for sutton and cheam paul scully on the way they have progress this issue which have cause so much devastation for business family and individual right across the united kingdom people who think they have good business work at it invest in it and trust the post office to do right by they find that they be betray by those who know that mistake be be make and know that the system be faulty yet rather than admit to the failing decide to pursue innocent individual do not want to elaborate on the story we have hear today but this government body and its official wilfully pursue case that they know would destroy individual family and reputation as have be say postmaster and postmistress be often regard as pillar of society in their village or locality and they suddenly find themselves paint as if they be thief it be know from an early stage it would seem that the accusation be totally false one postmaster say to surely somebody in the post office must have know at an early stage that it be not one or two individual but hundred of people who have serve blamelessly for many year do they think virus have come into the system and turn they all into criminal somebody must have ask question it seem that someone do ask question and that as the inquiry have show it be know at an early stage that there be flaw in the system and the system be wrong even when it be find that these people be right ten of million of pound be spend on pursue they through the court as that be an easy way to shut they up rather than admit that mistake have be make welcome the three thing the minister have say today although he will have to come back on regular basis to reassure we the bill extend the period in which payment can be make but we can not keep delay compensation for the many who have be leave destitute have their reputation ruin and lose their business although the minister have indicate that technically all the bill will do be allow the compensation period to be extend in case that be need hope that provision will not be use accept his assurance that he do not intend for it to be to drag out the compensation scheme and that it be only for case with complexity that will take time to work out hope he will come back regularly between now and august to update we on the number of case that have be deal with settle and sort out welcome the point the minister make about corporate and individual responsibility we need to have that because it be clear that individual in the organisation know that what be be do to sub postmaster and sub postmistress be wrong and yet the corporate response be let not admit anything as result some people be drag through the court and finish up with prison sentence it do not really matter what level of compensation we give because how can we compensate for broken marriage ruin reputation wrongful imprisonment premature death and even drive people to suicide no level of monetary compensation will ever deal with that which be why it be important that those responsible be hold to account that there be no hiding place for they and that we do not see the affront we have have so far of the head of the post office at the time actually be reward indeed not so long ago member draw to the house attention the fact that the post office bonus scheme mean that individual in the post office be actually be give bonus for give information to the inquiry that they ought to have be give in any case what the minister say on that be important note the minister comment that taxpayer should not have to bear the burden of the money that have to be pay out fujitsu know that its system be flawed and it have not be hold to account the minister say that where responsibility can be assign the government would seek to have compensation draw from fujitsu the evidence give to the inquiry already show that large degree of responsibility can be assign to fujitsu if that be the case trust that the government will be rigorous in purse that company it seem odd that company that supply such system should have have its contract renew not so long ago we need great scrutiny of that and we certainly need to see not only individual hold responsible but the company that supply the faulty software hold responsible for make some of the financial compensation to these individual it be good that we have the minister and his predecessor the hon member for sutton and cheam here today they be to be congratulate on the rigorous way in which they have pursue this matter it give hope that at least this issue be not go to be ignore but it be important that we have regular update so that the public can have assurance that parliament and the government be not ignore it call gerald jones to make the last back bench contribution thank you mr deputy speaker rise to make brief contribution as we know the post office horizon scandal be one of the most insidious injustice our country have ever see the post office be one of britain most well know and trust brand but the sheer scale of false prosecution and the aggressive way in which they be pursue have destroy its reputation but more than that it destroy the reputation life and livelihood of former sub postmaster who have be upstanding member of their local community post office manager decide to aggressively pursue prosecution against sub postmaster even when they know that the horizon system have deep root fault the post office compound that by tell individual sub postmaster that they be the only one experience problem that be clearly not the case quite simply those cold calculate decision ruin life include those of some of my constituent in merthyr tydfil and rhymney have learn from they over number of year about the impact on their life livelihood mental health and wellbeing the fact that the post office be able to mount prosecution in such cavalier way be simply shocking today we be talk about compensation for former sub postmaster member from across the house be clear that the compensation be for wrongful and malicious prosecution and that get compensation to all victim as quickly as possible be vital if we be to right the wrong of that injustice as the shadow minister say labour will work with the government to do whatever be require to deliver justice and will support the bill however the government originally commit to resolve all compensation case by christmas it appear that that have not happen so will the minister explain why that target be miss and how the extra time provide in the bill will help to deliver justice to everyone as quickly as possible as we all know it simply can not come soon enough it be timely to be have the debate on the day we rise for christmas as we know that there will be many decent people affect who year on be spend yet another christmas without proper compensation it have be short but sobering debate on the victim of the horizon scandal and how the government intend to ensure justice be deliver be pleased to sit opposite the minister again and to hear his commitment to full and fair process and be pleased that the bill be go through this place however the need to extend government power to deliver the compensation scheme be of course disappointing news to those affect will not keep the house long to summarise our support for the bill to thank all those who have campaign for so long and to ask the minister to respond to some important point that have be raise as member have set out the bill extend the power for the government to deliver one of the compensation scheme for some of the victim of the horizon scandal beyond august join other in thank those who have get we to this point pay tribute to the justice for subpostmasters alliance which have campaign for decade for compensation and justice we could not have debate in this place on this topic without thank my right hon friend the member for north durham mr jones who have be tireless in his work thank lord arbuthnot for his work in this area and many other the horizon scandal be one of the most insidious injustice our country have ever see get compensation to all victim as quickly as possible be vital if we be to right this injustice as the shadow minister my hon friend the member for bethnal green and bow rushanara ali make clear at the start of the debate labour will work with the government to do whatever be require to deliver justice there be some good speech the hon member for sutton and cheam paul scully work hard as minister and be right to be proud of what he do in this area it be good to see that he have ease himself back into the back benches note his praise which be increasingly rare for boris johnson for start the process for the inquiry be sure the minister note his lesson that if we be do this from scratch the business department would perhaps have run all the compensation scheme in the first place the hon gentleman be right that we talk about do thing at pace in this place all the time but we just mean quickly we need to keep up the speed which have be sadly lack give that we be year on from the original scandal my right hon friend the member for north durham give full comprehensive and compelling speech his quote from his constituent tom brown be very move give that his constituent do not survive to receive his compensation my right hon friend spell out the indignity of his experience describe how he be the pillar of his community and how awful the situation have be for he and his family note my right hon friend suggestion about the need for counselling for some people because this have be extraordinarily impactful way beyond financial term my right hon friend also talk about the lesson that the government need to learn note his advice for ministers and future ministers without jump to any conclusion mr deputy speaker take that advice as do the shadow minister my hon friend the member for bethnal green and bow he talk compellingly about the clear evidence that the post office know what the problem be yet still spend all that money defend the indefensible he be right to make that point so powerfully question about fujitsu and other be well make by the right hon member for east antrim sammy wilson my hon friend the member for merthyr tydfil and rhymney gerald jones make good final speech in which he call on the minister to explain why the target have be miss and what more can be do this may be relatively straightforward simple piece of legislation but it do relate as all member have say to one of the uk most widespread miscarriage of justice we have hear tale of people who have be affect so many of they spend their birthday in prison as result of error other people lose their entire life saving repaying shortfall my hon friend the shadow minister talk about seema misra who be pregnant with her second child when she be convict she have an absolutely awful time local press report at the time describe she as pregnant thief which be horrific we need to keep those story at the heart of everything we do while we try to make sure that people get the compensation they deserve mr deputy speaker we support the passage of this bill but we do have some question that we would like the minister to address many of which have be set out today the key one be what the government will do in this extra time to ensure that compensation be deliver as quickly as possible the minister say that the government be set target of be complete within working day he use the expression promptly without be rush will he elaborate bit on what that mean in term of the resource and the capacity that will hopefully increase the number of case move through the system to get to happy conclusion alan bates who have be widely praise in this debate and who lead the justice for subpostmasters alliance be report as say it all well and good extend the deadline but the government have to try to meet the current deadline the life of the victim who have live with this for long time be not be extend that be good and sobering point it would be helpful if the minister say more about how he be go to speed up that work the minister also make broad remark can he clarify from his early remark how many people have reach settlement use the offer that he announce he say something about proportion but it would be helpful if he could give we number do he have any estimate of the proportion of victim that he consider to be fully compensate do he have timescale for the completion of compensation for those he consider not to be fully compensate when do he hope to have all this do by the minister have be ask how he will ensure that mistake like this be not make again obviously we have the inquiry which be carry on at its own pace do not know whether he have do any work on learn those lesson so that we do not make mistake like this again as we close the debate wish to end by again put on the record our thought for all the victim who have not have their case solve and who face another christmas without justice with the leave of the house it be pleasure to conclude this debate we have hear insightful contribution from right hon and hon member across the house many of whom have champion this cause and campaign for justice on behalf of postmaster for many year pay particular tribute to the right hon member for north durham mr jones my hon friend the member for telford lucy allan the hon member for jarrow kate osborne for kingston upon hull east karl turner for north west leicestershire andrew bridgen and for motherwell and wishaw marion fellows and other who have demonstrate the good of cross party campaigning in the interest of those affect by this scandal have address the house many time on the subject of the post office horizon scandal both as back bencher and now as the responsible minister and want to respond to the specific point raise in the debate the shadow minister who open the debate the hon member for bethnal green and bow rushanara ali rightly talk about further delay want to stress that this be not about further delay but about prevent an arbitrary date be set so that people whose claim have not be submit or be not at the stage where it have be complete or settle can still get compensation say to the other shadow minister the hon member for croydon central sarah jones as say in my early remark that the commitment be that we will get of offer out in working day we be do number of thing to expedite settlement and accept claim not least the fix sum award for overturn conviction she ask about the number of people who have take that route for confidentiality reason we do not think it be right to state the actual number but it be significant proportion so certainly it be route that many people think be the right one for they to take obviously that be matter for the individual and claimant can pursue the standard full assessment process if they feel that be their good option not everything be within our gift and that be one of the frustration that we have because these claim can be complex and require legal input from the claimant side it can take time for the claim to be compile before they be submit that be one of the reason why we think it be right to delay the long stop date of august next year the hon member for croydon central ask about the resource and about how we will expedite the settlement she may be aware that we have recently commit to additional resource for the post office part of that be to increase the resource commit towards the inquiry but another part be commit to compensation we think all the resource be there to get this money pay out within the timeframe we have set out pay tribute again to my hon friend the member for sutton and cheam paul scully for all of the work he do on this scheme it be perhaps little bit ironic that use to push he from the back benches and now he be push from the back benches on similar issue he be very sad loss to the front benches in this house he do fantastic job and he speak with great authority on this subject as he say the good work he do in the department he attribute to this particular area so thank he for all he have do my hon friend ask whether we need to extend this the long stop date and why it be very much long stop position we want to get the payment out before august but as sir wyn williams advise this be the right thing to do my hon friend also ask whether if we be to start again which do not think be the right thing to do we would do thing in this way with three different compensation scheme think sir wyn williams say something very similar we would not do it like that but all together in one single scheme however we be not there and it be right to push ahead now with the work we be do in this form the hon member for strangford jim shannon who be not in his place say that we need to go fast not slow we be not go slow we be go fast and that be what we be keen to do the same issue be raise by the right hon member for east antrim sammy wilson who rightly push we to make sure we be deliver this at pace my hon friend the member for sutton and cheam also talk about do thing at pace pace be word use lot in my department my official will probably support that remark so totally agree with he if may say so think the pace in department should be dictate by ministers so it be my responsibility to make sure that the scheme be deliver at pace my hon friend wish the house merry christmas be pleased and think we should all be pleased that family have have conviction overturn and may be able to enjoy their christmas little bit more than previous christmas their ability not only to receive compensation but to move on and move away from some of the trial and tribulation that they have face in get compensation and get justice be welcome by everyone in the house as always thank the hon member for motherwell and wishaw for the work she do on the all party parliamentary group on post office she point out the very significant value that post office have in community could not agree with she more that the disclosure area be unacceptable that should not have happen and we make that very clear to post office management agree with she entirely on fujitsu anybody who be show to be responsible for the scandal should be hold accountable and that may also include compensation we have state that on the floor of the house on number of occasion she refer to senior executive in term of the inquiry sub metric have repay bonus voluntarily those be not something we would want to see in future also agree with she and other include the right hon member for north durham about some of the people who have be instrumental in this matter outside this house she refer to dan neidle nick wallis karl flinders and tom witherow have also be important contributor in ensure that sub postmaster get the justice they deserve thank the right hon member for north durham again for all his work and for his work on the advisory board he talk about sword of damocles and be right to say that we be remove it he speak very movingly about tom brown and what happen to he the indignity of have his home search hardship bankruptcy the impact on his family and his reputation in the community all be intolerable situation he sadly pass away prior to receive compensation in my constituency sam harrison sub postmaster in nawton near helmsley go through similar set of circumstance certainly in relation to financial difficulty she sadly pass away early this year without receive compensation there be huge human cost as well as financial cost talk to the advisory board about potential counselling that might be make available to sub postmaster we also talk about restorative justice sir wyn williams have refer to that and it be something we be keen to look at the right hon gentleman mention predecessor to the horizon scheme in the north east if we be on the same page understand that be pilot scheme for horizon so we be confident that our current compensation scheme can deliver outcome and compensation for the individual he refer to but if he do not agree with that be very happy to have conversation with he that be welcome but think the minister know my view on the advisory board we need to try to find out exactly how many people be prosecute and in what circumstance it shock and think the minister too that even with all the publicity about horizon no one actually say by the way we have this scheme if it have not come out in the inquiry or have not intervene to see that individual in the north east would it just have be forget about those people will not be forget about be very happy to work with the right hon gentleman and the advisory

extant conviction relate to the horizon system be compensate on the same basis as those claimant with quash conviction with the exception of those claimant whose conviction be base on clear compelling and corroborated evidence mr kevan jones bring up and read the first time beg to move that the clause be read second time rise to speak to new clause which stand in my name and those of the hon member for motherwell and wishaw marion fellows the right hon member for haltemprice and howden mr davis and for east antrim sammy wilson and my hon friend the member for jarrow kate osborne the clause would do two thing first it would provide that all those with overturn conviction would receive compensation on the same basis include the so call public interest case secondly it would provide for all those with conviction that have not be overturn to receive compensation on the same basis as those with overturned conviction will deal with both issue in turn reference have already be make to the number of overturn conviction that have go through the court of appeal lord arbuthnot and approach the criminal case review body about year ago to highlight the injustice of these case in the criminal cases review commission start refer case to the court to overturn the conviction the number of post office horizon case send back to the court have already make this the most widespread miscarriage of justice see by the ccrc many of those case have be describe in quite lot of detail today with individual such as pregnant woman and other be send to prison include individual who have since have their conviction overturn in april former sub postmaster have their conviction quash by the court of appeal the court conclude that the post office should not have prosecute they in the first place and find the post office conduct to be an affront to the conscience of the court what have subsequently come out in the inquiry make wonder how on earth some of these people sleep at night know what they know at the time while pursue those individual in court early make reference to paula vennells who understand be also an ordain church of england priest she clearly do not extend her godliness and forgiveness to those who be clearly innocent but who she be quite content to see prosecute as far back as if not early she know that the post office system be not infallible as other thing possibly be in biblical sphere as the right hon member for east antrim say the idea that we suddenly have huge influx of kleptomaniac work for the post office that all these individual be somehow guilty be absurd it should have ring alarm bell but it do not the post office go on regardless not only do it pursue people and take they through the court but it take individual such as tom brown to court and then at the last minute supply no evidence have already ruin those people reputation and life as have be say individual have have their conviction overturn so far but there be many more people whose conviction remain unchallenged we have have some debate on the advisory board about the number think the figure for the post office be about but another odd case relate to horizon issue be prosecute by other body include the department for work and pensions it worry that only of the post office case have be overturn some people might ask why have these individual come forward have meet many of they those who have have their conviction overturn or other victim of the sub postmaster injustice think that they just want to close this chapter of their life they be not go to go anywhere near court and in some case they have pass away however urge anyone who be prosecute to please try to come forward although know how difficult that be for some individual it be to the credit of the minister and the department that they have try to reach out to some of these people but as say have meet they know that be not very easy come next to paragraph of new clause on compensation on the same basis where an appeal take place depend on where conviction be make if an individual be convict at the crown court they can go to the court of appeal and this do not require retrial however if an individual be convict in magistrate court the appeal be take to crown court and the case must be retry if the respondent in this case the post office do not volunteer to retry the case the judge could actually quash the conviction such public interest case receive low compensation than other overturned conviction because the post office deem that in many case people plead guilty on false confession and that be the basis of their conviction my hon friend the member for kingston upon hull east karl turner be not here today but we have hear before from he about how he represent one individual who be actually advise to plead guilty to get less sentence some individual do plead guilty but in many case that be do on legal advice we know that many sub postmaster have already be traumatise by have false accusation make against they and as say they be advise to plead guilty to get less punishment unfortunately in many case that do not lead to less punishment but it do not change the fact that those conviction be simply unsafe five individual have have conviction overturn so far on that basis yet despite have their conviction overturn in these so call public interest case they be entitle to less compensation than other think that injustice need to be address as the minister know the advisory board of which be member have address this in the minute of our september meeting we say that the approach fail to put these victim of overturn conviction in the position which they would have be have they not be prosecute the rationale for treat they differently in effect re victimise they and it be also contrary to the state intention not to run scheme on too legalistic basis it also go to the heart of what think the minister be commit to which be make sure that people be put back into the position they would have be in if they have not be involve in the horizon compensation scheme paragraph of new clause relate to sub postmaster who be convict but have yet to have their conviction overturn as have say there be about individual who be convict on the back of horizon relate issue and only of they have have they overturn that leave quite few hundred people who have be criminalise by the system and whose conviction have not be overturn they be therefore unable to get compensation even though this have not only devastate their life through have criminal conviction but cause related problem of loss of income and other thing overturn conviction take time and for many as have say it involve process that they will simply not pursue because that will reopen wound that be already deep when we speak to some of the individual they say they just want to close that part of the life in many case they be terrified of any form of publicity around these case because they do not want to be re victimise as have say new clause would entitle all those with horizon relate conviction to compensation on the same basis as those who have have their conviction overturn know that be possibly radical solution there will of course be small number of people who do wrong so it be right to exclude people when there be clear and compelling evidence of wrongdoing and not simply the guilty plea there be big difference between false confession guilty plea put forward on legal advice and someone who have clearly do something wrong would not want to suggest in any way that individual who have do something wrong when there be evidence behind that should receive compensation some people might think that be put the cart before the horse but it be important to bring the matter to the attention of the house do not accept think this be strong feeling among member of the advisory board that the other or people be somehow guilty of what they be accuse of again the advisory board raise that issue and its minute of an october meeting state clearly that as long as unjust conviction be maintain which clearly involve or people the mean of deliver any compensation be seemingly block this be itself major affront to civilised state that issue need address know that the minister will be meet the lord chancellor and those on the advisory body have ask to meet he as well there be broad issue around how the post office pursue some of the investigation when we talk about people who be responsible there be certainly question mark over some of the lawyer involve in the process who might have some professional question to answer think that automatically quash those conviction be the way forward accept that the new clause would put the minister behind the eight ball little bit see his official sweat in the box but would like he to address the issue have raise he be well verse in number of these question as we have go round they in the advisory board but if we be to bring closure to this issue leave the matter unresolved be not acceptable feel very strongly about that be not minded to press the new clause to vote but would like the minister to reply to my point if he can not give an answer today perhaps he could give we some idea of his thought on how we will resolve this issue thank my right hon friend the member for north durham mr jones for speak powerfully to new clause as the minister hear he raise the important point that conviction have already be overturn and there be hundred of other people who just do not have the bandwidth to face the trauma of have to go through the legal process it be imperative that the government ensure that we get ahead of this issue and do not have to come back to the house to consider how we support that group of people who do not have the appropriate compensation programme in place encourage the minister to consider the new clause seriously and to work with we to ensure that we address the issue that that group of sub postmaster face as my right hon friend point out many of those sub postmaster conviction be not build on sound evidence and they be base on guilty plea that they be advise to offer to reduce the sentence put before they for false reason as he also point out we see the spectre of the post office spending million of public money taxpayer money to go after those sub postmaster and cause the injustice that we be now try to correct it be therefore crucial that those who do not want to go through legal process because of the trauma they have face have the support of the government in deal with this issue separately through the department work my right hon friend be involve in that work with the minister his official and my party the new clause would ensure that the victim of all horizon relate conviction that have not be quash be entitle to compensation on the same basis as have be point out my right hon friend be not press the new clause to vote but hope the minister take it seriously know that when he be on the back benches he be powerful campaigner on not only this issue but many other as he be in position of power we look to he to make sure that the hundred of other in this position be properly support and protect and that they do not face the double jeopardy of be victim without the compensation that the vast majority of they rightly deserve thank the right hon member for north durham mr jones for his new clause on the eligibility of convict claimant to access compensation eligibility for compensation currently depend on conviction be overturn appeal against conviction in magistrate court go to the crown court where retrial of the original offence be hold when decide whether to oppose an appeal in the crown court the prosecution must apply the relevant test in the code for crown prosecutor that test have two part first the evidence must be such that there be realistic prospect of conviction in some case that test be meet because prosecution conclude that horizon evidence be not essential to the case in those case the prosecution must consider the second test which be whether it be in the public interest to hold retrial retry someone for an offence allegedly commit year ago for which they have already be punish would be harsh in such case the conviction be quash on public interest rather than on evidential ground those case differ from those where horizon evidence be essential to the prosecution and an appeal be concede by the post office in response to the right hon gentleman point about guilty plea there be case where conviction have be make upon horizon ground where there be guilty plea but those have now be overturn guilty plea be not barrier in itself notwithstanding that it be open to claimant to submit claim to the post office compensation scheme recognise the concern express by many about how the post office appear to have discharge its prosecutorial power accordingly we should remain open to consider any new evidence on liability in relation to these specific public interest case the right hon gentleman new clause refer to the payment of compensation to people with conviction he be right to say that to date the court have only overturn case which be small fraction of the more than conviction prosecute by post office and non post office prosecutor during the time that horizon be active that therefore could be unsafe note that in addition to the work of the criminal cases review commission the post office have adopt more proactive approach to encourage appeal by conduct review of case that have not yet be appeal independent counsel instruct by the post office will review case to determine whether it already hold sufficient material to reach view as to whether an individual case could be concede be an appeal to be bring where the post office identify such case it will write to the postmaster to notify they that it would not oppose any future appeal base on the information it currently hold and to set out what to do next to initiate an appeal strongly share the advisory board desire to see more innocent postmaster receive compensation the right hon gentleman set out the letter that the advisory board recently send to the justice secretary and completely understand the reluctance of postmaster to come forward to appeal their conviction it must be very hard to trust authority when it be authority that have let they down for decade some of the evidence give to the williams inquiry about the way prosecution be handle by post office be horrify there be obvious implication for the safety of prosecution and the way disclosure seem to have be handle mean that defence lawyer be inevitably fight lose battle when postmaster do get to the court of appeal the onus be on they to show that their conviction be unsafe recognise all the difficulty that that burden of proof cause especially with the passage of time lead to evidence be lose or destroy it do not seem right that these people face an uphill battle to clear their name last week the advisory board release some significant recommendation and its contribution be very welcome be sure the right hon member for north durham will be interested to note that have already ask for legal advice on what more can be do in this area so want to look closely at the idea he have float and the idea of the advisory board know that his idea be slightly different from those of the advisory board the advisory board be look at blanket overturning of all conviction whereas he seek to compensate everybody regardless of whether they have conviction look at his new clause question who would be the decision make body that would confirm whether there be clear compelling and corroborated evidence which normally court would do so there be more work to do before we can get to position that he and be both happy with want to look very closely at his idea and as he rightly say be also talk to my right hon friend the lord chancellor hear flora page one of the claimant barrister acknowledge on the today programme that overturn all the conviction automatically raise some constitutional issue so this may not be easy however be determined to make it easy for people to come forward and for conviction to be overturn honestly do not think there be anything between the position of the right hon member for north durham and my position in term of our desire to see justice do and compensation pay that be what he be call for and it be the government job to try to achieve it promise he that we shall do our good hope that in the light of that assurance and the other assurance have give he will be willing to withdraw the new clause mr jones you indicate that you do not wish to press the new clause to vote be that still your intention it be give the assurance that the minister have give beg to ask leave to withdraw the clause clause by leave withdraw the deputy speaker resume the chair bill report without amendment third read beg to move that the bill be now read the third time it be great pleasure to be speak on third reading as we have hear this afternoon this small but important bill will ensure that victim of the horizon scandal who have suffer over period of more than year be not time out on their rightful compensation because of an arbitrary deadline this government have respond to the concern of campaigner and of the statutory inquiry under sir wyn williams which recommend this legislative action in its interim report in july the government will continue to ensure that glo scheme member be compensate as quickly as possible and our intention remain that this should be do by next august however this bill will ensure that those entitle to compensation who have wait too long for justice be not rush or bounce into make decision on final settlement which should be full and fair may thank opposition members and the usual channel for enable swift consideration of the bill thank the house authority parliamentary staff the clerks the doorkeeper and member of different party who have participate in today debate also thank my official in the department who have work hard to prepare and deliver this bill at pace while continue to run the glo scheme the bill be further demonstration of the action that the government be take to address the wrong of the past and to demonstrate that we be firmly on the side of postmaster commend it to the house be pleased that the bill will pass and make at least some effort in address this injustice to the extent that that be possible what the sub postmaster have go through be horrific as we have hear they have suffer from year of uncertainty year of not be listen to and year of not get the justice they deserve the government must act quickly to process claim and provide the compensation that people desperately need even though the bill will extend the compensation deadline it be crucial that the minister and his team act with urgency to ensure that this miscarriage of justice be address thank the official the clerks you mr deputy speaker and all those involve in get the bill through most importantly thank those who have campaign tirelessly the sub postmaster and all those who have support they in the legal system and beyond to bring this issue to the fore also thank member of this house and the other house for all that they have do collectively to bring it to our attention and the government attention we would not be here today if it be not for all those who campaign let we be clear we need to learn the lesson hope that the inquiry will help with that to ensure that an injustice like this never happen again and that taxpayer money be not use to persecute people who should never have be pursue in such way welcome the bill passage which be another small step on long road note what the minister say about the response to the overturned conviction which will be difficult but as he well know we have be there before over the last few year again thank he for his active involvement also thank the other member of the advisory board professor chris hodges professor richard moorhead and lord arbuthnot for their continue work we will no doubt be meet shortly in the new year to ensure that we achieve what we all want with people get the compensation they deserve as well as the answer thank the minister official and in particular carl creswell rob brightwell and eleri wones they may seem long suffering give some of the expression they give to advisory board member when we raise more work and more difficult task for they to do but without their support we could not have get to where we be today official be sometimes not thank but it be right to thank they for their work on this again what the minister and all of we want be for the system to work and for it to go some way to help heal the great wrong do to the individual concern thank you mr deputy speaker for chair our proceeding wish you mr speaker the deputy speakers and members of the house all the good for christmas and the new year let we hope that in we can have conclusion for all the compensation and more

support to continue their provision of food voucher to family in need over the school holiday include christmas and the petitioner remain etc transport infrastructure cullompton motion make and question propose that this house do now wood it be pleasure to have secure the final debate of understand that have until about half past seven but give that be the only thing stand between the minister and sherry mince pie and wrap gift by the fire probably will not take the full two hour and minute have request of the minister this afternoon be ask this government to deliver the people of cullompton gift that everyone there have be ask for for year the cullompton relief road and the railway station cullompton be rural market town nestle in the culm valley there have be town there since roman time if you go out and knock on door in the area people will tell you that they have be wait that long for the relief road and the railway station the layout of the town would be familiar to anyone who have visit small west country town it have one major road straddle by shop and house the town centre be very much the beat heart of the community it have regular farmer market that take place once month every second saturday the economy of the town be build on past involve wool cloth and leather work but in recent year it be very much commuter community with people make journey to exeter in particular early this year distribute survey across cullompton to ask resident about their transport priority the response make it crystal clear that railway station be much need alongside relief road and junction upgrade resident tell on the doorstep that new housing must come with infrastructure first and they be right while in the department for transport work with the community and conservative county councillor john berry to secure new railway station after meeting with the chancellor the transport secretary and the rail minister local resident in cullompton have wait long enough it be time for decisive action not just warm word do the hon member need hand to get relief road too my neighbour the hon member for exmouth be quite right that people in cullompton be call for this but they have have enough of survey they have be consult until their pen have no ink leave in they in devon county council run survey on the cullompton town centre relief road another survey organise by cullompton community association field reveal that people be tear but would give up their community field for the sake of relief road to stop the awful congestion in the centre of the town now there be to be further consultation on both the relief road and junction on which progress also need to be make will expand on that shortly people in cullompton be sick of be consult they want to see action and in particular they do not want to see survey that be simply means of harvesting voter intention datum huge volume of traffic pass through cullompton every day the town be home to roughly people but it be reckon that day commute into and out of exeter and many of they be from cullompton traffic often become back up and gridlocke especially at busy time early in the morning or when child be pick up from school experience that at first hand recently when drive to one of my advice surgery in cullompton so bad be the congestion that have to turn the engine off to stop it idle and release pollution planning permission for the relief road be grant by mid devon district council in january not without cost to local amenity have play football with my child at the cca field and know that member of the cricket and bowling club would love to have well pitch or green but above all else they want certainty they want to know what the future of the town will look like what they do not want be an enormous amount of housing with no support infrastructure the minister and other members will have hear about the appeal that have take place but should point out that cullompton be special case there be plan for north west urban extension and also for garden village as member will know garden village be an initiative think up in and the culm garden village be set to add new house to the town if that be accompany by promise of new gp centre new community sport facility new school new bus link and new cricket pitch those might offer some amelioration but all that people in cullompton be see be more house we can not keep build house without the appropriate infrastructure to support they our road can not cope with the volume of traffic that we be see then there be question of the motorway the go past cullompton and junction be one of the more congested motorway junction in fact it be dangerously congest national highways say recently that it be unable to support development which introduce an unacceptable risk to highway safety which include queue extend onto the development be actually euphemism for housing what national highways be really say be that we can not afford more housing in this town because it will simply cause queue on the motorway but the queue be not just on the motorway they be also through the town itself all the motorist who get snarl up in the town idle in traffic know that they should be look to westminster and whitehall for the solution cullompton town council itself have say that it will actively oppose any residential development at east cullompton until the town centre relief road be deliver and the capacity of junction be increase that will need to include safe pedestrian crossing over the the railway and the river it be about time that westminster and whitehall take look at that because it be something that mp and candidate through the age have call for certainly in the tiverton and honiton by election last year the conservative candidate and both call for it as cullompton mp have raise the issue in parliament on multiple occasion and urge ministers to consider how the lack of relief road be affect people in cullompton in the local election early this year cullompton go liberal democrat dare say that that be sign of people protest and an indication that they be not prepared to put up with be overlook on this issue by the conservative government here in westminster we see the welcome network north announcement this autumn but the opportunity to fund the relief road be pass over in round and of the levelling up fund and although we do not know it at the time in round as well when devon do not get any levelling up funding at all with all the furore anyone would think that the relief road be go to be enormously expensive but in the context of the sort of figure that the department for transport be deal with suggest that million be not enormous particularly as million of that have already be secure by homes england to get good value out of that the government will want to match fund against that million from the housing infrastructure fund for which there be deadline it be think that the upgrade to junction would cost furth million that be much more expensive proposition but lot of work have go into it cost so far that have result in robust and financially sound business case the junction proposal contain option such be the diligent work that go into it and they have be whittle down to just three the proposal have now go out to public consultation with deadline of february member will forgive the people of cullompton for be tired of be consult on these matter they just want to see action the case for the relief road and junction be also health relate as it relate to traffic and congestion this be why we also need railway station at cullompton there be recent announcement of funding to reopen cullompton station again network north be something of re announcement but we be certainly glad to be part of the restore your railway announcement in strategic outline business case be develop last year and it will go to full business case in with the potential opening of cullompton railway station in work alongside my co chair the hon member for taunton deane rebecca pow as part of the metro board look at every stage of the development and at how network rail and great western railway be do perhaps give they little bit of nudge when necessary but absolutely support their excellent work railway station at cullompton along with the improvement to junction and relief road will help with air pollution the air quality management area in cullompton have good monitoring but be afraid it reveal very poor outcome for people health it be estimate that the building of the relief road and the improvement to junction would result in reduction in the level of nitrogen dioxide in the air of between and that would clearly improve people health locally there be also plan afoot for walk and cycling have have people work with on cycle route in the area sustrans be consider link tiverton and exeter through cullompton and there be local cycling and walk infrastructure plan for connect willand and uffculme together all these initiative the relief road the railway station and the walking cycling and wheeling route will make very friendly part of devon into an environmentally friendly one in closing give credit to neil parish my predecessor who work on this during his time as an mp and to local liberal democrat campaigner who have be work with on the operational detail hope that we can think of today debate in the context of christmas present the word present in that context be usually associate with gift but would like the government to think of it in the context of the present tense that be to say hope that we might see some action on cullompton railway station the relief road and junction in the present and not at some unspecified point in the future those would be gift for which know that people in mid devon would be very grateful on point of order mr deputy speaker seek an apology as the hon member for tiverton and honiton richard foord do not name my constituency correctly in response to my intervention he refer to as the mp for exmouth but my constituency also include sidmouth and should be refer to as the mp for east devon he have do this politically in local newspaper and leaflet wish also to clarify that devon be successful to the tune of nearly million in the most recent round of level up funding just to correct the researcher or whoever write the hon gentleman speech seek an apology for my constituency be name incorrectly and promise from the hon gentleman that he will not do so again the hon member for tiverton and honiton richard foord be not indicate that he wish to say anything far to that point of order in which case it stand on the record thank both the hon member for tiverton and honiton richard foord and my hon friend the member for east devon simon jupp for their contribution to this debate on transport infrastructure in cullompton it be an honour and privilege to address this issue on behalf of the department for transport have sense of déjà vu all over again as respond to yesterday adjournment debate and will be respond to the first adjournment debate in the new year on monday january as the hon member for tiverton and honiton eloquently say it be important to stress that transport infrastructure matter to everybody assure the house that will not be use my full two hour and three minute either but much as you do mr deputy speaker start by wish everybody in the chamber all parliamentary staff the department for transport team those work in

we understand very clearly that these man and woman keep we and democracy safe that should not be forget in any way as transport minister it be not for to comment on the quality of council bid to the levelling up fund and the department for levelling up housing and communities but will attempt to address the point that relate to this debate will try my hard to address the widespread gentle criticism that there have not be investment in the south west and in devon in particular will address cullompton but it would be remiss of not to highlight the important work the government be do to improve journey right across the south west and particularly in devon clearly we remain committed to long term multi road programme of investment to improve road link to the region by we will have complete mile upgrade between sparkford and ilchester combination of government and local funding have enable the delivery of million of support for the tiverton eastern urban extension provide access
