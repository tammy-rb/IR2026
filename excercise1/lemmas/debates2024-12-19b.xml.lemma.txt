death and claim relief will not be affect by the change have the right hon gentleman see the late research which show that of commercial farm will exceed the million threshold and therefore will become liable for inheritance tax just to give he one example family in west hanningfield in my constituency who have farm for five generation say that they face potential inheritance tax bill of million they say that it will put an end to all that have go before and end the aspiration of their family plead with the government to look at this again of course we hear the concern but say to the

and prevent an animal disease outbreak catastrophe be grateful to the hon gentleman who raise an important point however find it little ironic that conservative members be call for this government to commit to spending that their government never commit to the weybridge biosecurity facility be so dilapidated that it face obsolescence by the early that be the legacy that the conservatives leave the million that we have commit will start the process of improve those facility and through the spending review phase come forward we will consider how we can commit further funding to ensure biosecurity for farmer which the conservative absolutely fail to do call the liberal democrat spokesperson merry christmas to you mr speaker and to all here and beyond farmer in my community and across the country be genuinely devastate by the government family farm tax which will affect many in my patch who be on less than the minimum wage and by the cut in the basic payment next year perhaps what dismays farmer across our country and in westmorland even more be that the overall agricultural policy of this government and their conservative predecessor be to actively disincentivise farmer from produce food despite the fact that this country produce only of the food we need that be dereliction of duty by both main party and threat to national security what plan do the secretary of state have to change his policy and back our farmer to produce food the hon gentleman raise number of important point will repeat my early comment about agricultural property relief the last year for which we have datum available show that the vast majority of claimant will not pay anything unlike the previous government who think that farmer be not in it for the money we want they to succeed so we be embark on farming road map and new deal for farming that will consider supply chain fairness and stop farmer be undercut in trade deal such as the one the conservatives agree with australia and new zealand our intention be to make farming profitable for the future the conservatives record be the farming business that go bust and polyfluoroalkyl substances whether he have make an assessment of

pass the hunt trophies import prohibition bill which would have stop selfish hunter who slaughter and display endangered animal body part for their own perverse self gratification and they drop the

to tackle this problem by provide the funding support and clear regulatory enforcement that be need for level playing field thank the hon lady for raise such an important issue and recognise that over of pollution in our waterway come from agricultural run off sir jon cunliffe and the commission he be lead will look at all source of pollution into our water the budget for more sustainable form of

monitor very closely what be happen in thames water and indeed in all the other water company the only easement have ever see give to water company over pollution be that of the previous government who turn blind eye as sewage be flood through our river lake and sea this government be put the water company under tough regulatory special measure measure that the previous government could have enact but fail to enact electronic waste what progress he have make on reduce electronic waste as my hon friend know each week million vape such as single use pod and big puff be throw away or recycle incorrectly which be vape second that be why we have already ban single use vape and create extra vape recycling point in store we will ensure that online marketplace and vape producer pay their share of electronic recycling cost in order to avoid the fire which we know be so devastating mr speaker wish you and your team very happy christmas thank the minister for her reply we be all keen to increase recycling but too often the opportunity for recycle electronic waste be very limited mean that it go into mainstream waste lead to increase pollution and hazard we be see an increase number of bin fire start with vape which as she have highlight be particular problem will the government consider what opportunity there be to work with local authority to increase recycling opportunity and in particular to ensure that the public be aware of the downside of not dispose of electronic waste properly thank my hon friend for that question my own city council in coventry have introduce small electrical item take back point in its library which be an example of an excellent council innovating recently visit the currys recycling plant in newark which show the importance of recycle

restoration funding as part of the package of measure they be talk about early so that the river tone and bathing station elsewhere across the country can benefit from clean water our policy be certainly intend to tackle fly tipping and stop persistent organic pollutant enter the environment but will have to consult the minister for water my hon friend the member for kingston upon hull west and haltemprice emma hardy before answer on that detailed point river dredging what step his department be take to improve the dredging of river dredging can be useful option for manage flood risk usually as part of wide approach where it be technically effective effective and do not significantly increase flood risk for other of course we need to adopt the good solution for each place wish merry christmas to one and all my constituent in boston and skegness be very concerned that the environment agency be unable to properly maintain riverbank and properly dredge river in order to protect home and livelihood because of the very demanding requirement of natural england regard the protection of badger and water vole which mean that the priority be wrong will the minister meet and senior people at the environment agency to ensure that we get these priority correct dredging use to be commonplace but some evidence show that it can speed up flow and potentially increase the risk of flood downstream there be currently no plan for any further dredging in boston and skegness but be happy to meet the hon gentleman and the ea area manager to discuss this far high grade agricultural land what assessment he have make with cabinet colleague of the potential merit of safeguard high grade agricultural land we all know that food security be national security and most of we also recognise that the impact of climate change and nature loss pose significant risk to domestic production so it be very important that we use our land carefully consequently the government will be introduce land use framework to ensure that we protect our most productive agricultural land high grade agricultural land in mid bedfordshire have be farm for generation and it be critical for our food security and our freedom but it be under extreme pressure we have talk this morning about climate change and flooding and also about the government family farm tax what have not be mention so much be urban sprawl which be major threat to high grade agricultural land we live in an uncertain world and we need our country to feed itself consider the threat will the minister guarantee that high grade agricultural land will be protect by this government thank the hon gentleman for his point and refer he to my early comment we see more and more pressure and there be so many thing we need to do on our land to house and feed people so it be important that we have proper structure in place it be widely acknowledge that the current planning system do not necessarily do that the previous government promise land use framework we will actually deliver it topical questions if he will make statement on his departmental responsibility share customer anger about the water bill rise announce by ofwat this morning customer have be leave to pay the price of conservative failure after the previous government let company spend million of pound on bonus and shareholder payout instead of invest in our crumble sewerage infrastructure if you find crack in your house and do nothing about it for over decade the problem get bad and the cost of fix it escalate and that be exactly what have happen to our sewerage system we have introduce the water special measures bill to curb unjustified bonus money earmark for investment will be ringfence so that it can be spend only on infrastructure rather than bonus and shareholder payout as happen under the conservatives have appoint sir jon cunliffe to lead commission into the regulation of the water industry so that the failure that lead to today bill rise can never happen again this government will end the tory sewage scandal once and for all recent investigation have show that lack of investment in drainage infrastructure have contribute to significant flooding in uxbridge and south ruislip how will water company include thames water be hold to account where their lack of investment blight community through repeat flooding the government of course recognise the importance of and need for robust drainage system but my hon friend will be aware that the previous government fail to ensure adequate investment to maintain and upgrade it water company have duty to ensure that the area they serve be effectively drain this include drainage of surface water from the land around building as well as the provision of sewer call the shadow secretary of state wish merry christmas to everyone in the house and also to everyone in our farming food hospitality and water sector but not everyone will be able to celebrate christmas in recent week farmer take himself off to remote part of his farm and kill himself the message he leave his family who wish to remain anonymous be that he do this because he fear become financial burden to his family because of change to inheritance tax this be the human cost of the figure that the secretary of state provide so casually what do the secretary of state say to that grieve family extend my heartfelt sympathy to that family but think it be irresponsible in the extreme to seek to weaponise personal tragedy of that kind in this way where there be mental ill health there need to be support for that and this government be invest in it the right hon lady know from the last year for which data be available that the vast majority of claimant will pay absolutely nothing follow the change to agricultural property relief how heartless and how extraordinary that the secretary of state be more discomfited by be present with the fact of the consequence of his policy than the reality of what this policy ensure be minister for seven and half year and have never see policy have the consequence that this one have interruption member of the public will see labour members react in that way because have dare to present they with the fact we know that there be tragically high suicide rate among the farming community the national farmers union give evidence about this and the secretary of state have be tell repeatedly will he collect datum on monthly basis of suicide from farmer farming family landowner and family business so that we the house and the outside community can understand the human cost of this tax policy before it come into force mental health service be the responsibility of the national health service and the former health secretary who break the nhs be in no position to lecture anybody about public service she be no friend of the health service and mental health service and she be no friend of farming some farm go bust on the conservatives watch they fail to get million out the door and into the pocket and bank account of farmer and they sign trade deal with australia that undercut british farmer on environmental and welfare standard hear the posturing but it be this government who be stand up for farming recently meet farmer in the northern parish of my constituency and they tell about the urgent need for improved water management to protect farmland they want to establish an internal drainage board for flood management but they can not take action to set it up until the necessary statutory instrument be in place give the importance of establish an idb in my area will the minister commit to work with and stakeholder to reduce flood risk and will she outline when the statutory instrument for an idb in my area might be put before the house would be delighted to work with my hon friend on this important issue the association of drainage authorities be on the flood resilience taskforce and the statutory instrument will be lay as soon as parliamentary time allow farmer in my constituency tell that even in good year he be lucky to see much beyond in profit with margin as wafer thin as that regular farming barely qualify as investable at all the risk of lose huge slice of that farm to inheritance tax at random interval would not only go to put this generation out of business but go long way towards ensure that they can never be replace do the minister agree that this measure order we need to get our act together this be the short set of topical question and will not be able to get many member in we have to remember what topical be always about hope you have get the gist of the question minister the point that farmer need to get well return from their business be well make and that be exactly what this government will be address merry christmas to you mr speaker and to your team and to colleague across the house my constituent have long feel the impact of flooding and many resident have be isolate in rural area after storm have recently produce flooding report will the minister meet to discuss it so that can support the work of the department there be very easy and short answer to that would be delighted to meet my hon friend north cornwall have world class beach and river but santa swim have be cancel due to the constant dumping of raw sewage meanwhile water company receive million from bill payer but then the very next day they give it away to their shareholder do the secretary of state agree that the good gift he could give my constituent this christmas would be total ban on water bill rise until south west water boss finally end this scandal the hon gentleman be right to point to the scandalous situation that the previous government leave our waterway in with record level of pollution and raw sewage filthye our river lake and sea have appoint sir jon cunliffe to lead commission to review governance and regulation so that we can stop it ever happen again welcome the landmark billion agriculture budget announce in the budget which be the big ever budget for sustainable farming my farmer in north northumberland desperately need that money in that context what more can the secretary of state do to push for his department to get that money out the door in way that the previous government do not my hon friend be absolutely right it be extraordinary be it not that the last government manage not to spend million of the farm budget we be determined to ensure that we do well wish he and his farmer very merry christmas in my constituency we have an incinerator that regularly breach its air pollution limit but the environment agency do nothing about it will the government tell we what they be do to give the ea tooth incineration permit breach be matter for the regulator the environment agency but we be review energy from waste capacity across the country and will be make statement imminently merry christmas mr speaker and happy hanukkah to those who be observe what action be this government take to promote the purchasing of british grow and seasonal produce through their public procurement framework we be absolutely determined to ensure that we see more british produce buy across our public sector we will come to the house with our plan in due course call the chair of the environment food and rural affairs committee it would be helpful if the secretary of state encourage sir jon to engage with parliamentarian across the house the necessary change that he have outline will take time however the truth of the matter be that if those who currently have responsibility be to change their culture and focus on outcome for customer rather than their own internal process we might see early improvement there will be an opportunity for member to engage with sir jon cunliffe commission in january and be sure that the right hon member committee will want to do precisely that the water special measures bill which be go through parliament right now be intend to make quick change to the system sir jon review will give we the chance to reform regulation and governance for the long term recently meet the alde and ore estuary trust which

increase time large than current inflation we know that large proportion of that rise will be spend on pay off the debt of water company debt incur simply by pay dividend that be unearned and bonus that be undeserved be it in order for the government to have know that be come but not to have come to the house to make statement which would have allow we to hold they to account for their failure to ensure that ofwat have the tooth it need to hold the water company to account thank the hon member for his point of order have receive no notification from the government of such statement but he

the minister announcement of extra money be of course welcome but she have fail to answer the question will it cover the national insurance increase or not all hon member support their local hospice which know be important but have to remind the house of the parlous state of the sector that we inherit after year of the previous government if conservative members many of whom be part of that government have want to rectify the way in which hospice funding be allocate or indeed that end of life care be manage they have plenty of opportunity to do so this government have hit the ground run we have fast track these measure and this announcement today be clearly part of that hope that they all welcome it it be just shame that they do not do it themselves merry christmas mr speaker may

additional national insurance contribution payment that it will have to make will this extra funding which be very welcome be additional funding or will it be just enough to cover the extra cost that have be impose on the hospice sector through the increase in national insurance contribution in the recent budget have to say that dancing be more my style than marathon run so wish the hon lady luck with that at least she do not ask for any money refer she to my early answer this be additional money to support the hospice sector it be million boost for adult and child hospice to ensure that they have the good physical environment for care and million in revenue to support child and young people hospice we look forward to work with the sector in order to well deploy that in the new year merry christmas to you and your team mr speaker our hospice do an amazing job and look forward to visit my local hospice in the next few day but scottish hospice have warn that they might have to turn

must have similar level of ambition for scottish hospice and provide fresh investment for our hospice which do an amazing job in scotland as my hon friend highlight this be devolved issue for the scottish government we hope that they match our ambition as she rightly put it wish she well with her local hospice and hope that the scottish government take note of what we be do here in england

ahead of christmas many charity include hospice be try to raise fund know that the chancellor do not go into politic to be the grinch who steal christmas for charity so will the minister please look

what those volunteer be do this weekend the fact that the minister have come here expect we to welcome her announcement and congratulate she on give money that her government take away in the first place really beggar belief mountbatten hospice in my constituency need an extra million because of the nics increase that her government have bring forward will she guarantee to mountbatten and the charitable sector include hospice which the last government increase funding for before she come back to with that answer that today announcement will cover the million that her government have take away in nic what beggar belief be that person after person man after man on the opposition benches still feel able to get up and defend their record in government not once have we hear that they agree with lord darzi diagnosis or that they welcome the extra investment that the chancellor find by choose to support the health sector in the budget be afraid that until they reach that conclusion they be destine to be on the opposition benches for very long time merry christmas to you and your team mr speaker compton care hospice in my constituency provide specialist palliative and bereavement care hour day day year have previously discuss the lack of funding with the hospice be sure that it will welcome the extra funding that have be announce today will the minister please join in thank compton care hospice and its incredible staff for the care that they will continue to provide throughout the christmas period welcome my hon friend comment and be very pleased to thank compton care hospice for all its work he be right to highlight that the care be day year around the clock hospice such as st ann in stockport provide really high quality care to my constituent and other at what be often the tough point in their life but they be struggle in system that be no long fit for purpose it be of course welcome that the government be provide additional funding for they one of the challenge that the hospice sector face be really high rate of staff vacancy so would be grateful if the minister would confirm whether the year plan for the nhs include specific workforce plan for our hospice sector so that it continue to care for our constituent at the tough point in their life the hon lady make an excellent point about the stability of the workforce across the piece from diagnosis to the end of life we absolutely need to consider support for all part of that through the year plan encourage hon member and other to ensure that they keep make those point we be get excellent contribution from the public patient and staff and we look forward to develop the plan over the next few month and year welcome the large funding increase for hospice in generation if that can not bring some christmas cheer to the conservative benches it will in my constituency of wirral west where claire house hospice do such important work all year round be there just last week for their christmas carol will the minister take the opportunity to thank they for the important work they do in my constituency of wirral west thank my hon friend for his contribution and indeed for his singing those event bring joy to people at particularly difficult point in their life and they be very welcome any increase in funding for the hospice movement be of course welcome but let we be honest it be give with one hand and take with the other the two excellent hospice that serve my constituency st andrew in grimsby and lindsey lodge in scunthorpe tell they want certainty the minister say they will be tell early in the new year can the minister give categorical assurance that in the first half of january hospice will be tell how much extra they be get from the million she mention thank the hon gentleman for welcome the announcement as say we will be work with the sector in the new year and then we will make allocation accordingly stoke on trent be wonderfully serve by the dougie mac and donna louise hospice they be part of healthcare system in staffordshire and stoke on trent that the minister know have million project deficit what oversight will there be to ensure that the money that go to the icb reach the hospice and that the team in staffordshire and stoke on trent do not try to use some of this welcome new money to fill hole elsewhere my hon friend make an excellent point one that be raise early it be vital that icb work with all provider to understand the need and how they be well meet know he will be diligent as he already have be in pursue what be happen with the funding with his local icb we will work with hospice uk to ensure that that happen across the piece the hon member for cowdenbeath and kirkcaldy melanie ward call for fresh approach by the snp government in holyrood but she clearly expect we to do that with fresh air because part of the million additional cost from the national insurance contribution will fall on hospice on tuesday she have the opportunity to vote against that cost will the minister confirm that there will be barnett consequential for scotland how will she address the problem that marie curie in scotland face admire the hon gentleman for keep on the same wicket in the budget this government make the great allocation to the health sector what the scottish government do with their consequential and how they manage that be entirely matter for they and if they be not do good job the public need to vote for someone else wish you the team and all the wonderful staff on the parliamentary estate merry christmas very much welcome this big investment into local hospice and know it will be welcome by my local child hospice forget not and kirkwood hospice which do invaluable work in my constituency what assessment have the minister carry out on long term sustainable funding for the sector particularly in relation to statutory funding and the increase role that hospice play in the community and in people home my hon friend be absolutely right to highlight that need as say early end of life care and its stability as part of the wide system which be commission role for icb be not address by the last government over year as part of our year plan that will be important to do we can all agree that hospice such as st barnabas in lincolnshire do vital and value work hope we can also all agree that every government labour and tory have increase national health spending for that be simply matter of fact ask the minister to show little wisdom in contrition in acknowledge that the national insurance increase that be impose on charity and hospice have do immense damage we welcome the funding today of course we do but she need to be straightforward be she or any of the health team consult before the budget about the impact of the ni increase on hospice health charity pharmacy and so on may advise she to put down the folder and tell we what she really think have scribble my own note the right hon gentleman say that he agree but the issue be that his government do nothing over year to support or make change that be why the announcement we be make be so important reiterate my early point which will repeat every time be at the dispatch box the conservatives have not read the darzi report if they do not agree with the diagnosis they can not agree with the solution that be their fundamental problem welcome the announcement of additional funding as will many family across the country although it be not in my constituency rowans hospice be use by people in pompey indeed my nan pearl and my very dear friend fiona spend their last few week in the hospice care and what wonderful place it be at city council meeting this week concern be raise about the future of that amazing service will the minister confirm that the government be commit to ensure that every person have access to high quality end of life care that be absolutely what we want to do and today announcement be step towards it as my hon friend highlight hospice be very special place but most people want to die at home with their love one in the place they know well and many part of the sector will be able to use this money to help more people to die peacefully at home this additional funding will benefit hospice serve westmorland community st mary st john eden valley and the child hospice jigsaw only if two thing happen first the government must provide additional funding to match the national insurance increase that those hospice will have to bear and secondly the government must ensure that the integrate care board in south cumbria and north cumbria pass on that money in full and on time will the minister press they to do so on the morecambe bay end will she press they on the closure of the abbey view ward at barrow hospital the trust be plan to close that end of life ward which will put additional pressure on our local hospice but without any additional funding to support they the commissioning of those service be the responsibility of the icb and we expect they to do that they be responsible from diagnosis to end of life in the past few month have meet many hon member from across political party to discuss issue in their icb know that he will like other be assiduous in pursue the icb to ensure that funding go to the right place wish you mr speaker and the fantastic staff across the estate happy christmas thank the minister for the way in which she and her team have listen to and colleague who arrive in this place with real concern about the state of palliative care after year of under investment by the previous government the funding announce today will be welcome by keech hospice and garden house hospice which provide fantastic palliative care for constituent in and around my area will she join in thank they for the fantastic work that their staff and volunteer do all year round to support people in incredibly difficult moment in their life will she also assure they that palliative care will remain at the front and centre of the government mind in the difficult work of get health service work again be happy to support my hon friend who make an excellent point in his work with local provider he congratulate but the work have be do mainly by the minister for care my hon friend the member for aberafan maesteg stephen kinnock and by the secretary of state who have personally take on this issue they be visit hospice today so they could not be here even though they want to we be commit to support people throughout their life from diagnosis to end of life have be contact by vast number of family and relative of those who have be wonderfully care for by sue ryder manorlands hospice in oxenhope in the worth valley they be all concerned about the impact that the rise in employer national insurance will have on they those at manorlands be deeply concerned that it will cost they hundred of thousand of pound in answer the urgent question the minister have announce additional funding but can she confirm whether it will cover the cost of those rise to sue ryder manorlands hospice in my constituency do the government carry out an impact assessment of the negative impact that the budget would have on those in the charitable and hospice sector the hon gentleman ask the same question again through the budget this government have allocate more money to the health service than the previous government record announcement and we have announce money again this morning to govern be to choose the last government neither govern well nor choose to support the health sector from diagnosis to end of life this government have and will continue to do so some week before the budget visit both st catherine hospice and st peter and st james hospice which serve my constituent have not expect how quiet and empty those hospice be because of the empty bed and mothball wing that have be close due to lack of funding evidently the funding crisis in the hospice sector be very deep before the budget but the budget have only make it bad through the nic increase as such will try again will the welcome funding announce today cover the cost of those nic increase as lord darzi report announce the entire sector have be under pressure and struggle since the disastrous lansley reform they be part of the coalition government through to when we take over in july we will fix the nhs and rebuild it to make it more sustainable and fit for the future that include everything from diagnosis to end of life care for my sin too will be run the london marathon next year will be run to raise money for keech hospice know as do other hon member who represent constituency in bedfordshire what fantastic work that hospice do and the care it provide to our county the minister have be ask lot of time to comment on the impact of the nic increase which be go to hurt hospice in constituency all around the country so may ask the question in slightly different way do the minister think that keech hospice take in the round will be financially well off or bad off next year as result of both the budget and this announcement that she have be drag to the house to make have not be drag be very happy to be here the reality be that the health sector in its entirety from diagnosis to end of life care will be well off this year than it be last year or the year before under the hon gentleman government place on record my thank to all those in my constituency who will be care for other over christmas whether they be unpaid family carer or pay care provider that include the register nurse and register care provider who have write to to say that there will be an extra cost of per employee as result of the change in the budget will not attempt to ask whether the money announce today will cover national insurance contribution but will ask what the government will do to help register care provider where will the money come from to enable they to meet their increase national insurance contribution as the hon gentleman know this government have allocate an extra billion in this year for the health and care sector the full allocation to cover the entire area of health and social care will be announce in the new year it would be churlish of anybody in this chamber not to welcome the money that the government be set aside thank the minister and the government for that announcement but what discussion have the minister have with cabinet colleague to secure exemption from national insurance contribution hike for hospice worker think of marie curie speak about that charity yesterday in westminster hall and the minister probably have marie curie in her constituency we know what that charity do unlike the mainstream nhs it will not be exempt yet it carry out the end of life care that the nhs simply can not provide far what help will be provide to carer in the community the withdrawal of their service would leave the care system decimate the hon member make an excellent point about carer and their support we make announcement about that in the budget and we will make more general announcement about allocation in the new year may gently say that know you welcome be here minister but it would have be easy if the announcement have come as statement rather than through have to grant an urgent question when ministers be go out quite rightly to visit hospice we should be tell at the same time it would be nice and easy for we all to do it that way but thank the minister for come would also say to all of we that our hospice matter in the case of those hospice that serve my constituency the child hospice of derian house and st catherine wish they all the good for christmas thank all hospice for the duty they carry out on behalf of our constituent business of the house will the leader of the house give we the forthcoming business the business for the week commence january include monday january debate on motion on

for the conference recess on tuesday september and return on monday october mr speaker may associate myself very strongly with the remark you have just make about hospice you will recall that st michael hospice be the topic of recent discussion that we have at the dispatch box in business question mr speaker must confess that feel slight degree of trepidation and nervousness because at the weekend receive two massively welcome christmas present with the result of the manchester derby and dare say defeat of chorley by hereford in tough fight game at edgar street remain worried that will need all of your legendary reserve of christmas love kindness in order to mention this this be the time of year when we think of friend and family of our armed force that keep we safe here and overseas of those who care for other wherever they may be and of the emergency service that protect we all the year round but especially over the holiday period mr speaker think you will know that in relation to this house parliament own record be not absolutely unblemished when it come to christmas fuel by puritan hostility to public celebration and unseemly revelling the long parliament parliament no less outlaw the celebration of christmas in the people naturally react notably with the plum pudding riot in canterbury in which begin with football game but end up with brawl how very different from the result at the weekend perhaps the bad moment for this house be during the protectorate when parliament sit on christmas day and colonel john desborough attempt to impose decimation tax while many royalist be out sensibly celebrate the christmas season punitive and partisan tax and an unpopular blunder government up to various trick and seek to rush their business through the commons while the house back be turn how lucky we be that such thing could never happen today however my personal favourite be when the supply of french wine be temporarily cut off create absolute mayhem in london and other city across the country what to do there could be only one answer member of parliament should drink herefordshire cider it be every bit the equal of burgundy and bordeaux as roger bosworth my predecessor as mp for hereford in the parliament insist and it be the ideal remedy for smooth away trouble bosworth be medical doctor so he well know the life enhance benefit of herefordshire cider think the lesson be clear doubt the plum pudding riot would have happen at all if the people of canterbury have have herefordshire cider to drink after the football only hope that the chorley player be able to do the same after that hard fought game on saturday mr speaker to you to the clerks and the house staff and to all our colleague across these benches and in the other house wish very merry and herefordshire fill christmas and happy new year mr speaker too would like to start by wish you and everybody in the parliamentary community very merry and restful christmas

private office who have lead all the preparation for business question for successive leader of the house over the last two year she be leave for pasture new and we will miss she greatly will not join the right hon member for hereford and south herefordshire jesse norman in mention the derby match at the weekend if he do not mind but as this be the last business question of the year let we reflect it be out with the old and in with the new end the last parliament pay tribute to outgoing member from that parliament and we do lose some very big figure from this place but come july we gain the big intake of new member in modern history and it have be really energise to see so many enthusiastic committed and talented new colleague they have all get to work so quickly and many feel like old hand already it have be whirlwind for they and all of we arrive in government and think we all deserve proper break over christmas it have be not just huge change for parliament but big change in government too it have be difficult of course as we face unprecedented challenge and very difficult legacy try to return government to the service of ordinary work people not vested interest be big task for we to undertake but the oil tanker as they say have start to move we be take on the water boss to end the scandal of bonus over investment we be for the first time ensure our home grow energy supply meet our ambitious target for clean energy by we be address the housing need and the housing crisis with bold action bring in new right for worker and renter and create transport system in service of passenger not profit and we be restore our health and education into world class service with record level of investment many hon member will no doubt be in santa or perhaps should say mr speaker christmas good book colleague who ask short topical question those who speak through the chair and make sure they be in the chamber for wind up those who wear appropriate shoe the judge of purr minister for crown mr speaker cat attlee the champion and of course anyone mention chorley or rugby league in positive sense but there will perhaps be some who will not be get visit from mr speaker santa this year minister who do not make statement to parliament first and instead go on the bbc heckler in prime minister question member with pointless point of order anyone who announce to the medium their intention to secure an urgent question those who cross in front of member as they be speak and lest we forget any member drink milk in the chamber as be until july the shadow leader of the house might give the right hon member for hereford and south herefordshire little advice for these session base on some of his previous appearance if he do want to answer question perhaps he could make they little less long wind perhaps for next year he might not want to contradict his own previous position quite so often and go into he might want to reflect little more on why his party lose the election if you will forgive mr speaker give that it be christmas time perhaps we can take one final opportunity to look at the conservatives legacy hour wait time inflation lords defeat on rwanda million inactive worker bus route cancel million people on waiting list six council bankrupt five prime ministers topple million child in poverty three broken pledge two nurse strike and prime

the house aware of any economic analysis or modelling do by the government specifically on the negative impact they will have see that the secretary of state for business and trade be sit next to she on the treasury bench be he or even the chancellor aware of the negative impact of the measure in the budget on those particular business we fully support family business and other business which be

to find way to ensure that our public service have the investment they need go forward he will be aware that when we take into account all the other factor include personal allowance and so on few family business will be affect than the hon gentleman might think mr speaker merry christmas to you and all staff put on record that my mam be waspi woman my right hon friend will know full well the strength of feeling regard this week announcement of no compensation for the waspi woman the ombudsman be clear that parliament should make the decision on remedy parliament have not will my right hon friend please find time for debate so that we can do as the ombudsman have ask we to do thank my hon friend for her question know that this be really big issue for many woman right across the country and it have span multiple parliaments know that many will be very disappointed by this week announcement and we do not underestimate the strength of feeling and the upset that people will be feel know it be difficult to hear but pay flat rate compensation to all woman bear in the at cost of up to billion would not be fair or proportionate use of public money the government do not accept the ombudsman finding on the remedy be necessary in this case colleague can apply for debate on these matter in the usual way call chris law be extremely oh beg your pardon think there be doppelganger in the chamber for second mr speaker new government can make political choice and one would have think that in the week before christmas they would be positive choice thing that people could take home and feel grateful and happy about on christmas day however as have just be mention by the hon member for south shields mrs lewell buck million of woman throughout the country bear woman have be affect quite adversely in respect of their state pension many be in ill health and be continue to work in ill health they live in hope for many year during their protract passionate and very reasonable campaign for fairness and justice and on tuesday this week they be tell that they be get none of it we have an ombudsman which have make very clear very fairly and decently what amount should be pay in compensation and have also make clear that the department for work and pensions make error at the time since tuesday not only have we receive email but member of parliament particularly government members have be delete page from their website and twitter account the very page that show they campaign out there with waspi woman get their photograph take do video send message and so forth now they have no voice they be frighten even to raise the issue in this house may therefore urge the leader of the house and the business secretary to arrange debate as soon as possible meaningful debate in government time no ifs no but we all need to have our say on this as just say understand the strength of feeling about this matter the secretary of state for work and pensions come to the house first to make the announcement as be appropriate especially when it come to report from the parliamentary ombudsman which be lay before the house last march the government have consider that report in full and give it great deal of thought and there be time for member to ask question on tuesday but of course debate can be bring to the floor of the house in many different way and be sure that this issue will continue to be debate will my right hon friend arrange debate in government time in the new year on the funding of political party wonder what it mean when party talk about sovereignty and be then willing to sell itself entirely to foreign own entity while use slogan like take back control we have see the controversy of the conservative party fondness for take few bob from putin oligarchs and we have see the recent scandal involve the chinese try to influence politic in this country think that we as this government must make sure that we be say that our politic be not up for sale and think we should have debate about it in the house my hon friend have make some extremely valid point about our democracy and our sovereignty in this country see that the leader of the reform party be in his place deputy leader be sorry the deputy leader he give up his leadership role to someone else at some point recall anyway the deputy leader for now for now yes think the hon member

rogue actor and other who try to disrupt it and to spread myth and disinformation and these be issue that we should be very alive to think now have to go to richard tice thank you mr speaker as the deputy leader of reform uk along with think million of other british citizen be shocked to read the exposé in the times that britain have become the western capital for the use of sharia court may we have debate on this issue in the new year in my view the use of sharia court to make unofficial ruling about marriage divorce and family life have no place in the united kingdom welcome the hon gentleman to his place be sure that his leader be somewhere far more important perhaps in studio or abroad get an airing hear what he have have to say and be sure we all agree that the court that be

rotary club which work tirelessly to raise money to improve their facility but it can not assist with the impact of the national insurance contribution rise on staffing level and staff retention or with temporary contract and burnout will the leader of the house commit to grant debate to consider sustainable future funding model for school with send provision think would apply for an adjournment

liquidity loan have that occur the british taxpayer would have be put at significant risk of lose million of pound without the safeguarding of any yard job or ship believe that the possibility of the government provide such guarantee or loan which be much speculate on in the press be prevent market base solution the former government inability to make decision leave the yard and the workforce in limbo that be why make it clear in my first week in this job that no taxpayer guarantee or loan would be provide be dismay that when do so conservative members oppose that know as they do that with guarantee or loan there stand significant risk of lose an eye watering amount of taxpayer money that be deeply irresponsible crucially the deal that have be agree will secure the delivery of the fleet solid support contract of the ministry of defence the government have work closely with navantia uk on the future of the fss programme we have agree the absolute minimum of change to the contract to ensure its continue delivery navantia uk be the prime contractor of the team resolute consortium which be charge with build three logistic support vessel for the royal navy and it will maintain the

familiar with navantia uk will know that the firm boast strong expertise in naval shipbuilding be pleased that thank to this agreement it will continue to bring the next generation of technology to its operation here in the uk this be quite simply good deal for the harland wolff shipyard good deal for its employee and good deal for british shipbuilding it provide the good opportunity to sustain our essential sovereign shipbuilding capacity and capability now and over the long term defence be at the heart of the industrial strategy that we have identify defence be one of our eight growth drive sector of the uk economy that industrial strategy be unreservedly and unashamedly pro business engage on complex issue that be currently barrier to growth and investment national security be one of the foundation of our plan for change without it we can not deliver on our milestone to raise living standard across the uk with good skilled productive job like those at harland wolff uk shipbuilding alone support some job nationwide and add billion to the economy every single year we recognise how important it be as vital pillar of our civil and defence industrial base that be why my department together with the ministry of defence and the national shipbuilding office be do everything that we can to bolster our world class shipbuilding industry that include the significant progress that we be make on key procurement programme we have major contract with bae systems which have increase the order from three to eight type anti submarine warfare frigate on the clyde and

kingdom we will lead the sector into well future hope that all worker in all four yard be now able to enjoy this christmas with their family as they should commend this statement to the house call the shadow secretary of state thank the secretary of state for an advance copy of his statement the famous yellow gantry of harland wolff stand tall not only on the skyline of belfast but in the history of our nation it be difficult to overstate what harland wolff mean to people in the community of belfast appledore arnish and methil extended family across the country will welcome today confirmation that the shipbuilding contract that we award in government will now proceed there remain however many unanswered question which would be grateful if the secretary of state could answer if he can not answer they at the dispatch box today would be grateful if he or the defence secretary would write in the come day first at time of enormous geopolitical uncertainty can the secretary of state confirm that there will be no change to the in service date of the three fleet solid support ship with the first ship enter service as expect in the fourth quarter of secondly what funding or commitment if any have be provide by any part of the government to navantia to secure this finalise deal if so which budget will that be appropriate from have he receive state aid clearance for the transaction and if not could he clarify the process by which that will now be obtain the secretary of state say in his statement that the department have agree the absolute minimum of change to the contract but the statement provide absolutely nothing whatsoever as to what that actually conceal can he guarantee as navantia promise as part of its original bid for the contract that no less than of the whole supply chain activity will take place in the uk will he confirm that there be no additional work package beyond those originally envisage move from belfast or anywhere in the uk to puerto real in cádiz above all will he assure the worker and their family who be watch that the final assembly and system integration which be where much of the high value work sit for all three of those vital ship will take place in belfast rather than in navantia parent shipyard in spain the secretary of state will appreciate that it be sometimes hard though one try to take he at his word after the number of impact on business over the past few month the wide context though welcome in respect of this particular contract and these defence job be the large scale uncertainty that our defence company contractor worker and employee face about the timetable for the government to reach on defence spending they do not have the certainty that harland wolff worker now do this christmas we do not even have timeline for timeline as to when that will be hit and we have see degree of equivocation on exactly when the strategic defence review will be publish again would be grateful if the secretary of state clarify that or if colleague write to it be at the end of the day action not word we welcome this deal for harland wolff and the certainty that it will provide to worker and their family and thank the department official for their work on that but there be still many question to be answer call the secretary of state have serve in his department too will be pay close attention to the answer agree with the shadow secretary of state on the iconic nature of this business its role in british history and in the community particularly in belfast and the esteem in which it be hold do feel he could have thank we for clean up another mess that the previous government leave we although perhaps that be too much to ask after all they could have make the decision to allow the market base solution with support from government that we have be able to achieve despite those caveat welcome the fact that he welcome the news and recognise it as substantial good news story for many worker as we go into christmas and for the next year turn to the hon gentleman specific question on the delivery of the fleet solid support contract the issue that the previous government leave we may have some material impact although there be no large foresee delay to the delivery of the project at this stage on the support to the business there be no support go directly from government to the business to subsidise the transaction there have be amendment to the contract support by my department and the ministry of defence he ask for the detail will not reveal it in the house because of the commercial sensitivity but will find out whether there be way to share that with he on whether the deal be compliant with the windsor framework and our commitment as country under those arrangement be satisfied with all that despite the fact that we will always respect those arrangement we be the uk government and we make decision for every part of the uk with the regulatory approval and seek no one permission to be the secretary of state for business and trade across all the uk on additional work package there be no additional promise from the government although he will know that there be year supply pipeline for shipbuilde in the uk and many opportunity particularly in sector such as energy maintenance and fabrication and whole range of function where member across the house would want to have strong diverse and competitive shipbuilding and maintenance sector finally on defence spending the hon gentleman have bit of try on he ask what assurance the sector can have the big assurance can give be that we only ever hit that under labour government the fact be that we have labour government with that commitment to the defence sector and its role the ability to deliver maximum economic benefit for the uk as well as that vibrant and important defence role and we will continue to deliver on the way to that call the chair of the business and trade committee congratulation to the secretary of state this be excellent news for the people of appledore and of northern ireland and for worker across the harland wolff supply chain he might want to confirm that the peril of provide government guarantee be the possibility of entail huge payout to us base hedge fund which be the large creditor for harland wolff what be happen to the contract value for the fss deal it be price at about billion have that contract value now go up crucially what do the secretary of state envisage for harland wolff after that enormous contract be safely and soundly deliver thank the select committee chair for his kind word be delighted that we have be able to secure this future for harland wolff his assessment be right that the large creditor to harland wolff when we take office be riverstone significant us hedge fund he be right to say that have we go ahead with that government guarantee or loan there would likely have be no real return to the taxpayer no guarantee of job shipyard or ship be build that money would have go to the creditor actually in the commercial market base solution that we have be able to broker all creditor have behave responsibly but understandably if anyone think the government will come along and give they free money they will hold out for that option that be why it be so important to make that decision early on to secure this far well outcome on the specific question and should have direct my answer to the shadow secretary of state the hon member for arundel and south downs andrew griffith there be no change to the uk base content of the contract as say in the statement there have be some change on commercial term although they be relatively minor base on the overall value of the contract on the future can tell the right hon member for birmingham hodge hill and solihull north liam byrne that the deal we have broker guarantee not only all four yard but the job in the belfast yard for three year and job in the three other yard for two year we therefore have chance not just for new investment come into those yard but for the long term future to be secure for pipeline of work and energy and defence contract which be vibrant and successful opportunity for the future call the liberal democrat spokesperson who have up to two minute this be an outstanding christmas present for the employee from devon to the isle of lewis who will benefit from this decision and the deal that have be pull off by the government in the west country we have low wage economy and in the appledore dockyard which be not too far from my constituency of torbay this will go down extremely well so congratulation be in order that be in sharp contrast with the failure of the previous administration on implement an industrial strategy support our shipping industry and grow our economy over many year the position that the conservatives be take now be utterly shameful how can we hardwire that long term support for our shipping industry so that we see growth in this area and support for industry such as steel manufacturing be extremely grateful to be able to deliver that outcome for the hon gentleman constituent as result of the announcement he be right to say that successful uk government policy must be about more than one off solution to specific problem such as this that be why we have adopt an ambitious industrial strategy that cover key sector of the economy and deliver exactly what he have ask for consistency long termism and policy that cover every aspect of government rather than be see as lead by one department when we get it right good long term and effective public policy work hand in hand with the private sector deliver tremendous outcome for the country and that be what we be seek ultimately any strategy be only as good as its delivery and this statement be evidence that the government will deliver today news be welcome my right hon friend know how vital the fss ship be to our royal navy rfa fort victoria our only remain solid store support ship be due to be decommission in yet even before this rescue deal new fss ship be not due to enter service until be there any scope at all to accelerate that and close the capability gap be grateful to my hon friend for her expertise and insight on this matter understand the point that she make but it be perhaps one for my colleague in the ministry of defence will ask they to engage with she on those ambition to remedy the absence of capability but believe that that would be challenging welcome the statement and particularly the protection of the fleet solid support programme but join my front bench colleague my hon friend the member for arundel and south downs andrew griffith in say that we will have to wait to see the detail in principle however the deal sound very encouraging indeed and congratulate the secretary of state and all his team and official for get it over the line he mention world class shipbuilding in the uk he say from the dispatch box that national security be the foundation of the plan for change and his department online statement talk about sovereign capability but do he accept that without steel ship can not be build will he take this opportunity to say what more can be do in dangerous world to reduce the uk increase reliance on import from elsewhere include from sweden and asia so that ship can be deliver in time of conflict or war very much share the right hon gentleman aspiration he will know that most defence steel be high end they be specialised and tend to come from electric arc furnace and one challenge that we have inherit relate to the two remain blast furnace site in the uk we have improve the situation in port talbot but we could not change direction with the blast furnace go offline before the arc furnace be instal we have inherit an even more challenging position in relation to scunthorpe but we be work closely with the company to find solution believe that we be miss real capability in the uk can see the economic and business case for plate mill for instance and for the long term question of direct reduce iron in steel production the steel strategy be part of deliver on that whole range of horizontal policy particularly on energy price would have to be in corresponding position for we to do that the fact that the uk have such small steel sector relative to the size of our economy make we an outlier among develop nation and suggest that there be real evidence base for improve it and will work with any member of the house to deliver that merry christmas madam deputy speaker this be great christmas for methil thank the secretary of state for business and trade the secretary of state for scotland and all those in government who have work so hard to secure this deal which have save skilled job and apprenticeship at the methil yard in my constituency and job at arnish in the constituency of my hon friend the member for na eileanan an iar torcuil crichton do the secretary of state agree that it be vital that all level of government trade union and stakeholder in the future of the methil yard continue to work together so that with gb energy headquarter in scotland the yard can fulfil its huge potential in contribute to our ambition for growth in the renewable industry in scotland and the uk thank my hon friend for all his support and repeat submission to the department know how significant this matter be for his community and he have fulfil his role as member of parliament in articulate it at every level of government say the same for our hon friend the member for na eileanan an iar torcuil crichton visit the arnish shipyard during the election campaign it be so important in job such as mine and in department such as mine to recognise that we must deliver for the whole united kingdom the diverse challenge we face do not detract from the fact that we must deliver for every part of the uk and that be what we plan to do also thank my hon friend for his comment about my official who work very hard to deliver this outcome agree with he about the huge potential out there not just for shipbuilding fabrication and maintenance but for energy in particular there be real optimism for the future but it require the kind of foundation that we have put in place through this agreement add my congratulation to the government for get this agreement over the line but when will we get their defence industrial strategy so far we have have only rather lengthy statement of intent we need to reindustrialise our defence industrial base in order to face modern challenge and that be particularly essential give the threat we face from the east of europe at this time that be very difficult to do in government because the treasury hat his stuff as the secretary of state may already have discover but we will hold he to account on what he describe as lead this sector into future growth and indeed on reindustrialise our steel industrial base and so on so that we have the self sufficiency that be vital for the defence of the country encourage the secretary of state to be brave in respond to the point about the treasury absolutely madam deputy speaker very much welcome the question and would like to put on the record that have only good thing to say about his majesty treasury at all time laughter it be true mean that the hon gentleman be absolutely right to say that there be great imperative with particular degree of responsibility in the defence part of the industrial strategy in the challenge we face it be imperative not just that we work closely with colleague in the ministry of defence on procurement issue and government to government sale in which my department play major role but that we address wide regulatory issue as the hon gentleman may know the department recently do work on environmental social and governance criterion to ensure that they do not prevent investment into defence company there be issue with small and medium sized enterprise in the defence sector struggle to access bank account not through prohibition on defence but perhaps because of lack of understanding about such commercial contract be different from those in other part of the economy there be whole range of issue that we must get right but think that in the main member across the house share his aspiration and objective he have be voice of expertise and authority on these issue throughout my time in parliament and be grateful for his engagement on they today announcement will surely be well receive by the house the country the royal navy and the worker directly affect especially give the previous government lack of industrial strategy alongside the fantastic announcement for seafarer and worker condition and protection the agreement show the government commitment to the vital maritime and industrial sector shipbuilding be once proud industry and the backbone of the community in my city of portsmouth but it be decimate by the previous government what assessment have the secretary of state make of the deal wide implication for the uk economy and specifically for the shipbuilding and defence sector recognise the role that shipbuilding have play in my hon friend city grow up in sunderland part of what be once one of the major civil shipbuilding location in the world and recognise the identity and pride that come with that industrial heritage in many case people feel that it be something of the past but in this statement we be stress exactly what she say about the contemporary contribution and the opportunity for the future about which we should be excited there be whole range of increase need to shipbuilding expertise particularly in the energy sector offshore wind for example create range of demand for different type of maintenance and supply vessel so this should be an optimistic story for the future sometimes feel that the wide british public perhaps do not understand the number of job or the economic benefit that come from such sector so it be always good to make that case from the dispatch box as my hon friend do every day from the back benches call john cooper member of the business and trade committee congratulate this front bench team and the wide government on land this deal in the face of what the secretary of state have euphemistically call the headwind would call they full force gale create by the budget do navantia raise concern about the forthcoming employment rights bill it swing the pendulum very much in favour of trade union which as we know be very often red in tooth and claw be that an issue in land the deal no it be not it be good try but no first the employment right framework in most part of continental europe be very different from our own secondly as have repeatedly say the change in the employment rights bill do raise term and condition for some of the lowest pay worker in the country but many company in the uk particularly large one already operate to significantly high level shipbuilding be historically fairly unionised sector so do not think there be any concern or worry in that field to be frank the trade union in that sector often fight hard for the industry than former conservative governments understand the try on point that the hon gentleman be make but no the employment rights bill have not be problem in term of wide uk government policy this have be great endorsement of our eu reset and our willingness not to revisit the argument of brexit but to work more closely with friend and ally in europe to ensure that we be get the maximum opportunity for the uk and always work in our national interest congratulate the government on this announcement which be incredibly welcome news for all those worker who get to keep their job as result it be shame that the conservative front bench spokesman choose to attack the government over the target while respond to the statement and ask for timeline for when we be go to deliver fourteen year be timeline and the conservatives do not meet that target even once if we be to avoid situation like this in the future we need to have modern industrial strategy what progress have we make towards that strategy how do it feed into our wide growth mission and how will it support the uk economy to grow over the next parliament be grateful to my hon friend for his comment on the deal and for his observation about the question from the opposition front bench spokesman about the target on the modern industrial strategy that we be create we have have an incredible response to our green paper some individual answer to the question it ask show that there be huge appetite from industry across the board both in the uk and abroad to engage with what the government be seek to do again stress that that should always be on cross party basis there be nothing in that green paper that anyone of any political stripe should be able to oppose it be base on our national interest and the goal of be more competitive and business friendly succeed to great degree on the world stage this week we have our first meeting of the industrial strategy advisory council with some tremendous representative with expertise across the board uk industry academic and business figure it be an incredibly exciting time this be just one component of our growth mission but clearly an important one alongside area of work for such as the small business plan that we be put together genuinely believe that everyone should be excited about the future call alison griffiths member of the select committee madam deputy speaker be sure you will have notice that the secretary of state do not answer one question which be whether he would clarify that the final assembly and system integration will take place in belfast rather than in the navantia shipyard in spain be sorry if the hon lady miss it but be clear that what we have announce today do not change the provision in the original contract agree by the former conservative government what have change be that we have save all four of these yard at time when we could have lose they all through the inability of the previous government to take the action require so it be an incredibly positive story we have save the position of those yard and guarantee those job and not for month but for year to come take this opportunity to wish you merry christmas madam deputy speaker thank the secretary of state very much for what be wonderful news for all four site across the uk obviously be go to be slightly biased towards the two in scotland one in arnish on the isle of lewis and the other in methil in fife that be very welcome news in the week before christmas also thank the government for their co operation with the scottish government over the past month particularly in the early day when uk labour have come into government and put on record the work that the deputy first minister of scotland kate forbes have contribute have couple of question first give that we be move forward be the worker current term and condition go to continue as they be secondly have listen to what have be say about future contract we know that both yard in scotland will be protect for the next two year but can the secretary of state tell we little bit more about the long term sustainable footing not least because this company have change hand three time in the past four year be grateful to the hon gentleman for his observation and question it be really important to we that we keep all four yard together there have be an assessment that for understandable reason the belfast yard be more commercially valuable so there be real chance that any unstructured rescue package could have lose the two scottish yard there be question mark about those yard in particular so keep the business together and protect the future of those worker be hugely important to we and be delighted that we have be able to achieve that the job guarantee for the non belfast yard will last for two year the guarantee be for of the overall job number simply to provide the usual degree of flexibility in run that business but that guarantee cover the majority of the workforce and keep they in place the deal also come with investment in those scottish yard so whatever the future hold those yard will be even more competitive and more able to bid for the kind of contract that will secure the long term prosperity we be all seek be always genuinely willing to work with colleague across any part of the uk to secure the kind of outcome we have achieve today and be grateful to the hon gentleman for recognise that as someone who have consistently and regularly call for more shipbuilding to take place in the uk rather than be export today statement be good news and congratulate the secretary of state on announce this decision he have clearly say that further order have be add as result of this deal what further defence and much more importantly commercial opportunity be there for harland wolff to acquire contract from across the world rather than build elsewhere share the hon gentleman aspiration and recognise his call for uk shipbuilding to have high priority in future than it have in the past to be specific on what be say in the statement there have be revision to the value of the fleet solid support contract it have require little bit of additional support but not greatly and on commercial term in order to deliver it there be not promise of additional work package on top of the contractual agreement make by the previous government but because navantia uk be such world renowne expert builder of shipping of all size as well as the investment that come with this deal and the more competitive nature of the yard in future there be genuine ground for optimism see real opportunity in fabrication and maintenance but particularly in energy also think that little bit of competitive diversification in the military shipbuilding sector supply chain be welcome create well value for money in procurement across the board this be positive story for harland wolff and its employee but as the hon gentleman have describe it be also positive story for uk shipbuilding this announcement be really good news and everybody across the house will welcome it it be probably time to break out the christmas cake and the mince pie early because there be good news come and the secretary of state have deliver it today this morning speak to my right hon friend the member for belfast east gavin robinson who have work tirelessly with the company to secure this progress we all agree that it be great news particularly for the strong workforce in belfast and especially in the run up to christmas well do my right hon friend will be at the yard with the secretary of state for northern ireland this afternoon probably in about an hour time if the national shipbuilding strategy be to mean anything it must be that the government invest in skill and capacity throughout the united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland do the secretary of state agree that more could be do to increase research and innovation support across the united kingdom and in particular in northern ireland be grateful to the hon gentleman for ask what think will be my last question of the year would particularly like to recognise what he say about his colleague the right hon member for belfast east gavin robinson obviously he have constituency interest and lead role in northern ireland and think he understand the decision we have to make we have to explain in confidence to all colleague affect why the initial decision on the guarantee alone be not the right way forward but that we be commit to the kind of solution we have announce today be extremely grateful for be able to work with the right hon gentleman on that it be great news that he be go to the yard today my colleague the secretary of state for northern ireland and the minister for industry be also in belfast today and understand that the secretary of state for scotland will be at one of the yard in scotland too on the hon gentleman point about innovation and research and development that be the basis on which we have to compete whether in the sector of aerospace automotive or shipbuilding what we need be high end sophisticated innovation and world lead product that be what we have in many of our advanced manufacturing sector but it be such competitive world that we have to maintain that edge in particular be an area where core support and core funding between government and industry have real benefit we have see that in lot of sector maybe not to the degree we have need in shipbuilding but let we look at that for the future and approach the next year with some real positivity ukraine it be day of putin illegal full scale invasion of ukraine and would like to update the house on the current situation

office to increase diplomatic pressure and sanction the mod be work hand in glove with the fcdo through our recently form joint unit on ukraine to maximise the impact of uk defence support by starve the kremlin of the resource it need to sustain its war effort we will continue to co ordinate these sanction with like minded ally around the world to deny russia war machine the good technology and

falter president zelensky have speak of his desire for just peace and the government be in no doubt that just and last peace be only achievable by strengthen ukraine hand that be why this week the defence secretary in kyiv and as the minister at the dispatch box have set out how we will increase ukraine military capability how we be commit to training thousand more ukrainian troop how we will strengthen defence industrial co operation how we will harness the support of ukraine ally and how we will increase pressure on russia this be the sure route to just and last peace in ukraine and commend this statement to the house call the shadow minister thank the minister for provide advance sight of his statement which we on this side of the house warmly welcome as the minister note last month mark the grim milestone of the day of russia second unprovoked and illegal invasion of ukraine ever since russian troop cross the border and even before we have stand shoulder to shoulder with our ukrainian friend indeed relative to the size of our army we have gift more military equipment to ukraine than any other nato partner include the united states as well as train ukrainians in the uk since follow the first russian invasion we have provide they with everything from nlaw through to challenger main battle tank and almost all of our heavy howitzer we have also provide ukraine with brimstone and storm shadow missile and very considerable amount of ammunition everything from small arm to mm round as well as help to procure other ammunition on their behalf from around the globe when offer way out of kyiv immediately after the second russian invasion in february president zelensky defiantly retort need ammunition not ride we in britain have subsequently provide quite bit of it even more recently we provide very high tech system such as advanced drone and the dragonfire anti drone laser which we initially procure and which the ukrainians be put into service no one can doubt the commitment of britain in support of ukraine and we be pleased to see this bipartisan approach continue under this government but we should not lose sight of the fact that at the end of the day ukraine be sovereign nation and only ukrainian people can subsequently determine their own future have five specific question for the minister on his statement first as he be aware we have be train ukrainian troop in britain since initially under op orbital and now op interflex the key element of this be train troop to operate nlaw in sophisticated anti tank ambush capability vividly demonstrate in video footage shortly after russian force cross the border without this critical training it be no exaggeration to say the russians might well be have lunch in kyiv today with that in mind what further training do the minister foresee for ukrainian troop what additional support will we provide and will any of this training now be deliver in country secondly how much of the million from the international fund for ukraine which we co ordinate be from the uk and how much be from our ally what in other word be the uk proportion thirdly as the statement specifically refer to the supply of respirator can the minister confirm intelligence report that the russians have now even resort to limited use of blister agent type chemical weapon in ukraine be that true fourthly we have be unwavere in our military political and diplomatic support for ukraine as well as generous in provide equipment and ammunition however this raise concern about replenish our own war stock as highlight by the defence committee which serve on in the previous parliament include indeed on that inquiry six month ago the chief of the general staff announce clear objective to double the lethality of the british army by and treble it by the end of the decade what step be be take to replenish the uk war stock more specifically how do the government plan to achieve the cgs ambitious commitment finally the change the minister have announce today clearly feed into the ongoing strategic defence review yet there be emerge medium report that the much anticipate sdr publication may be delay until june next year to now coincide with the comprehensive spending review minister now appear to be stick to mantra that the sdr will be publish in the first half of next year which be commensurate with that timeline with the worsen international situation and give that the initial conclusion have apparently already be see by the defence secretary and even the prime minister we can not afford six month of paralysis by analysis while the government decide how to respond so can the minister end on positive note and tell the house today when the sdr will be publish and assure we it will not be as late as next june slava ukraini rise before call the minister let say that mr darling can see that you be bob and if you stay in the chamber will make sure to call you at an appropriate time thank the right hon member for rayleigh and wickford mr francois for his party continue support for our friend in ukraine he be certainly right that the initial provision of anti tank weapon make significant contribution in the early day and the provision of whole array of capability in every month since enable ukraine to stay in the fight which be absolutely essential today statement update the house on the additional military capability that we be provide to ukraine and on how we will continue to do that the defence secretary have already announce that we will extend operation interflex until the end of that be good news we have always be clear that we will flex the provision of interflex training to suit the need of our ukrainian friend the right hon gentleman be right that there be initial skill training and we now train different skill and that training be deliver differently as the defence secretary have say we will need to make the training well fit for what the ukrainians need we need to make it easy for the ukrainians to access it and we work with the ukrainians to help and motivate they to mobilise more recruit the right hon gentleman will understand if do not help putin by reveal our plan and any conversation that we may have with our ukrainian friend but we will update the house in due course the international fund for ukraine be really important part of the mix can get the right hon gentleman the full detail on that and about our share and will place that in the library of the house also place on record our wide support for all our international colleague who be contribute to that fund the chemical weapon assessment have high classification and the right hon gentleman will understand if do not go into the full detail of russian capability and any use but the provision of respirator be really important part of ensure that ukraine frontline troop be well able to defend themselves we have plan to replenish our stock it will come alongside the defence industrial strategy that intent be publish by the defence secretary few week ago and that will be part of the strategic defence review the mantra that the sdr will be publish in the first half of next year be not be afraid new it be the exist government position however can reassure the right hon gentleman that the intent be to publish it in the spring work continue on that and be grateful to lord robertson and his review team for the thorough work that they be do the aim be to make sure that the review be not just labour defence review but be defence posture that be support cross party so that we can ensure that our national security be strong and so that we can deter aggression and defeat it if necessary call the chair of the select committee on defence be grateful to the diligent minister for advance sight of his statement it be good to chat with the secretary of state on his return from ukraine and welcome his pledge while there of million package of support for ukraine because as the minister rightly highlight ukraine frontline be the frontline of our own security can the minister provide further detail however after the un secretary general statement last week about turbocharge defence can the minister provide further detail of discussion with nato and other ally in particular our us friend include recent discussion between the prime minister and president elect trump on the international defence step be take at this critical juncture be grateful for my hon friend support for the military package outline today the uk government will increase defence spending to of our gdp and path for that increase will be lay out in due course at future fiscal event we will publish the strategic defence review which will set out perhaps more importantly what we seek to spend any money on we can then look at what capability we need to develop and how that take we far we continue to speak with our nato ally through the sdr process to make sure that the uk defence offer be nato first offer that allow more interoperability and support our nato ally especially on nato eastern flank look forward to be able to speak more about that in due course to my hon friend committee call the liberal democrat spokesperson thank sorry be just try not to step on the right hon jennie it be absolutely right that we give our brave ukrainian ally the support that they need to resist putin war machine be proud of how our country have stand shoulder to shoulder with ukraine in defence of freedom and democracy yet with the loom threat of trump presidency america ongoing commitment to ukraine look increasingly uncertain it should serve as wake up call to we all if the united states pull back its support europe must step up the liberal democrats want to see the uk take lead within europe that must begin with concrete action such as seize frozen russian asset to bolster ukraine defence as and other speak about in this house just yesterday and reverse damage conservative cut to our armed force those step will strengthen ukraine hand and britain security robust financial and humanitarian assistance be also vital just few week ago liberal democrat foreign affairs defence and home office spokespeople meet delegation of ukrainian mps who stress the urgent need for ongoing tangible support their message be clear europe role have never be more important the liberal democrats stand firmly behind these measure the impending trump presidency put the safety of ukraine and europe in doubt do the minister agree that it be time for the uk to take lead within europe on defence and security and will he commit to work with his european counterpart to make sure that ukraine be support fully the minister also mention russia attack on ukraine energy network can he outline what work the government be do to support ukraine in get electricity generator and solar panel instal across the country to keep it function if we be seek to protect anyone in this house it will certainly be the right hon jennie the hon gentleman ask number of question it be right that we seek to far strengthen sanction against russia the government have make number of further development such as sanction the russian shadow fleet seek to cut off its oil flow as the bill set out yesterday we be take further step in legislation on frozen russian asset we will continue to support our armed force the strategic defence review will set out the future shape of the armed force and the path to will be lay out by treasury colleague in due course this be cross government approach the hon gentleman final question about energy infrastructure be profound and it allow to echo the word from our colleague in the department for energy security and net zero who have provide additional support for ukraine energy infrastructure and energy production it be vital that we continue that support because it be not just with missile and ammunition that we need to support ukraine we need all the support to keep that country go to keep it in the fight and to enable its people to get through tough winter once again commend my hon friend on his ongoing support for ukraine and his important trade visit to kyiv recently from that visit he will know that this war have advance military technology particularly in the area of loitering munition and anti unmanned aerial vehicle technology note that we have the defence industrial support treaty as well as our own defence industrial strategy what progress be we make on joint venture with ukrainian defence company and on base some of that defence capability here for our future security and the security of ukraine thank my hon friend for his work in support of ukraine he be consistent champion work cross party too it be right that we seek to improve and grow our technology especially around drone and in autonomy the treaty we sign with ukraine enable it effectively to use defence equipment and support as its own procurement agency to initiate more contract more quickly not only enable support for ukrainian industry but allow uk industry to work with it to deploy more capability fast he be absolutely right that the pace of change in ukraine mean that we need to continue to invest in research and development and to learn the lesson that be one reason why the defence secretary make the announcement about retire the british army watchkeeper system year old drone in favour of more modern system that we hope to be able to announce in the sdr this be great opportunity for to wish the father of the house happy christmas when russia cruelly invade finland in she not only take territory with force majeure but impose neutrality on that country for year there be phrase for it finlandisation know our influence be not overwhelming but when it come to the trump presidency will the minister assure that the government will stiffen the sinew of the trump presidency and ensure that there be absolutely no question of any war aim of russia be achieve namely take territory and neutralise ukraine we therefore must fast track nato membership thank the father of the house for his question he be right that we need to continue our support that be why from this dispatch box today and in government statement since we come to office we have make it clear that we will support ukrainians for as long as it take include on their irreversible path to nato membership it would be wrong for to speculate on the policy of the new us administration but it be certainly true that the safety of the united states as well as the safety of the united kingdom rely on putin not win in ukraine that be why we be continue our support for our ukrainian friend when the new administration take office further such discussion will be able to take place directly may just say how strongly welcome the statement our commitment across this house to defend ukraine must be firm do the minister agree that the cross party nature of the uk support have be and will remain critical feature of our support for ukraine as staunch ally the way that this house have come together on ukraine not just the provision of military equipment but our diplomatic effort and our support for ukrainians be testament to all party in this house we be make sure that we be put our national security and that of our friend ahead of any partisan desire expect that the government and every single party in the house will continue that because gap in our position be where putin will seek to prosper that be why maintain cross party support be essential for our overall uk approach be grateful to all right hon and hon member for continue that today welcome the minister confirmation of the government support for ukraine eventual membership of nato as step along that road will he look at the uk take lead in far integrate ukraine into the joint expeditionary force the joint expeditionary force be an important part of the complementary military alliance with nato enable the beer drink nation of northern europe as they be often describe to come together it be important that that geographical centre point in northern europe be maintain especially in the baltic sea and the high north however there be discussion around learn lesson by ukraine have more participation alongside jef nation it be certainly true that many of the jef nation have be the most forward lean of all our nato ally in provide support for ukraine and expect that to continue welcome my hon friend statement and urge he onwards rise to demonstrate my support for the stand we be take in support ukraine my thought be with the people of ukraine who be enter their third christmas in this conflict europe have learn the harsh lesson from deal with dictator in the past do he agree that at time when there be potential for change in america policy towards ukraine europe need to stand together and to make sure that we do not allow putin to succeed in any way because the consequence of that for future generation could be damaging indeed it be certainly true that this government will continue to support ukraine and to encourage more of our nato ally to donate to ukraine and to improve their own defence so that we act as deterrent and so that the experience of ukraine be not inflict on any other nato member hope that more ukrainian people will hear the christmas message of peace and hope as we go into next year but it will be very tough christmas and new year for many of they assure my hon friend that there will be no change in uk support for ukraine whatever happen over the come year we will continue to work closely with our european and nato ally to make sure that what we be provide to ukraine include in training and support will enable they to stay in the fight and be in the good possible position for the future we have see the proliferation of drone warfare in ukraine as never before be strike by how the minister refer to drone repeatedly in his statement it be massive change in how war be wag with trump presidency on the horizon europe need to look to itself and for its strength one of our strength be the automobile industry and component part which can easily be repurpose for the development of drone for the war in ukraine will the minister advise we on how he be work with european colleague to enhance that to support ukraine to the hilt thank my fellow devon mp for his support for ukraine it be certainly right that the increase proliferation of drone be hallmark of the conflict between and drone substantial number be use every day on the frontline and they be be use in an incredibly intense environment of electronic warfare and jamming that be why we need to continue to iterate and evolve in the support we provide to ukraine make sure that those drone can fly through ew jamming reach their target and project power in those area we be continue to strengthen support for development not only in ukrainian drone production but in the production of drone across the rest of europe that be why we work so closely with the drone capability coalition among our european partner to create that enhance industrial base as well as learn the lesson of what technology be work bear in mind that that iteration on the frontline mean that we need to keep adapt and enhance our drone offer to ukraine every few month merry christmas to you and the team madam deputy speaker as other hon member have do commend the minister for the statement and especially the funding announcement make today thank he for remind my constituent and all our constituent of the urgent need to support ukraine and for remind we that our national security be very much bind up in ukraine national security it be fantastic that this new money have be announce do the government have further update on the proceed of the sale of chelsea football club and the billion be sure that the minister will agree that the soon we can get that money unlocked the more military and humanitarian support we can unleash the government be work hard to ensure that the proceed of the sale of chelsea football club reach humanitarian cause in ukraine as soon as possible the proceed be currently freeze in uk bank account until new independent foundation be establish to manage and distribute the money official continue to hold discussion with mr abramovich representative expert and international partner and they will double down on effort to reach solution we be fight every inch of the way to ensure that money from russian asset go straight back to support ukrainians also welcome the new funding for ukraine today and the minister statement with an unstable government in france new election in germany foreign influence operation in the recent romanian presidential election and new administration in the united states what recent discussion have the minister have with nato colleague about how nato will continue to support ukraine to the very end to steel its resolve and work towards the just peace that he reference briefly on other nato member the minister will know that denmark policy on defence for ukraine be to allow ukraine to grow its own industrial base that be be support by norway and some other baltic country get the transparency point and support the government on that but to come back to an early question be there any potential of joint venture to allow ukraine to grow its own industrial base it be certainly true that in period of more instability on political level our nato ally value the united kingdom certainty and stability for that reason we be push forward on our effort to co ordinate more nato activity the right hon gentleman will be aware that nato have stand up number of additional capability especially in support the training function that ukraine desperately need and we be support those effort wholeheartedly the right hon gentleman be absolutely right that one of the ukrainian objective be to create more joint venture to develop and iterate technology especially missile and drone technology that have the support of the uk government so we have be support our ukrainian friend to do so not only in country but with uk industry at the same time how we do that be be work through the new treaty that we sign be really beneficial in enable some of that work to take place it be certainly true though that to keep ukraine in the fight we not only need nato ally to provide more resource but we need to create the environment in which ukraine can develop more of its resource in country to be use on the frontline merry christmas to you madam deputy speaker warmly welcome the minister statement which demonstrate again the ironclad commitment of this country to the defence of ukraine minister will have detect nervousness across the house regard political change in january so may change tack there be million ukrainian refugee across europe and million of displace people within the country itself will the minister join in pay tribute to community across the united kingdom who have support the ukrainian people and indeed in many case open their home to ukrainians come to this country join my hon friend in thank all those family across the country those in his constituency those of everyone here and those in plymouth who have support the homes for ukraine scheme and those ukrainians get to safety as of december ukrainians have arrive in the uk include just under via the homes for ukraine scheme our new ukraine permission extension scheme will open on february as announce at the end of october that will provide an additional month permission and access to the same right and entitlement as the current ukraine scheme it be really important that as well as lend support to ukrainians in ukraine we support those ukrainians in the united kingdom thank all the people who be work so hard in particular to ensure support for those family in the united kingdom today could we be completely realistic the outcome of the conflict be likely to be determine by president trump and what he choose to do therefore it be essential that the british government engage as positively as possible with president trump and resist the temptation that somehow his arrival be an invitation for we europeans to withdraw into ourselves with our limited defence capability our diverse political and foreign policy objective and vary degree of willpower to sustain the effort can we take the arrival of president trump as an opportunity to leverage change in whatever field never underestimate how much the united kingdom have to offer the united states and how join up and integrate so many of our defence capability be it be absolutely true that as the united kingdom have provide bridge across the atlantic between the united states and europe in the past we continue to do so today we will need to work closely with our nato ally include the united states with which we have very close and deep security relationship that be the case whoever be in the white house we look forward to begin more of those discussion with the administration once the us legal period that stop international discussion expire at the point of inauguration dispute just one aspect of the hon gentleman question this war could come to an end because of putin he could decide to withdraw his troop he could decide to stop inflict pain on the ukrainian people he could choose to end the war today that be why we must continue to support ukraine for as long as it take so it can get the peace and security that its people so desperately need welcome the late british military support for ukraine welcome that there be cross party support in the house and that the civilised world stand unite with ukraine long may that continue do my hon friend agree that the most important voice regard this illegal invasion and how to end it be not ours or those of our ally but those of president zelensky and the ukrainian people at home and abroad include in constituency such as mine the ukrainian people have suffer so much due to russian aggression and their fortitude and bravery be an inspiration to all of we who value freedom and democracy my hon friend be certainly right that the courage grit and determination of the ukrainian people be something we should be enormously proud of it be for that reason that we continue to support they because their fight be our fight he be also right that the decision on the future of ukraine be not for the united kingdom but for the ukrainian people and government it be for the ukrainian government to decide their future and their objective in the come year it be our job to help to strengthen ukrainian hand so that they be in the good possible position for any outcome in that be what this statement and the additional military equipment we have announce today seek to do know the cross party support from this house be feel in kyiv also know that video of this house show the united kingdom support for their fight be share on the frontline among ukrainian soldier although be not sure that every video of this place be precisely what ukrainian soldier on the frontline need what they can take from today debate be our cross party support for keep they in the fight for as long as it take for they to secure victory and peace for their people we on the snp benches stand united in that cross party support for ukraine and welcome the package that have be bring forward today have few specific question for the minister first he talk about the profit that have come from the frozen asset what discussion have he have with eu counterpart on that some have be quite vocal about the sale of those asset which could rapidly accelerate the strength of the ukrainian force secondly on sanction more than of the component of russian drone come directly from china there be negotiation next month between the minister own government and china on increase economic co operation more specifically we have loophole in the law just now that allow british shipping and shipping insurer to work outside the uk to deliver gas from siberia to other part of the world which aid and abet putin in his war of aggression against ukraine would like an update on those thing thank the hon gentleman and his party for their support for ukraine and for the united front this house have present and continue to present for ukraine discussion with our european friend on frozen asset be matter for the treasury but know that treasury colleague be continue conversation to ensure that when the united kingdom make move on particular area of sanction or asset it be replicate by our friend indeed the sanction we have implement on russia shadow fleet have be replicate by huge number of our european and other international ally to ensure that there be no place for that trade be concern by what the hon gentleman say but know that the treasury have be work far with the foreign office on how we can strengthen sanction however be very happy for he to write to with further detail on that the hon gentleman mention technology come from far afield it be not just technology develop in asia that we need to worry about we also need to worry about technology develop in iran which go directly to the frontline and be use by russian force to target civilian infrastructure in ukraine that be why we continue to take action against iranian weapon transfer to ukraine too start by welcome the minister statement it be incredibly welcome to hear that we still fully support the people of ukraine and will back they financially for as long as it take have two question for the minister first he mention the north korean troop in the kursk region he say that they have make little progress that they have have few tactical victory but that it have come at great cost to they how do he arrive at that assessment and do he expect north korean troop to contribute more in the conflict secondly increasingly find myself in debate with people who ask why britain be spend this money in ukraine why be it not be spend in britain use the argument that many in this house will be familiar with when people like vladimir putin be give what they want they always come back for more whether there be deal or not will the minister restate at the dispatch box why it be in britain direct national interest to ensure that the people of ukraine win this conflict thank my hon friend for his question it be certainly true that the assessment we have make of troop from the democratic people republic of korea engage in combat be concern development it be dangerous escalation and expansion of putin illegal war against ukraine and be further proof that he have no interest in peace we will continue to monitor what take place there my hon friend will understand if do not go into the precise collection method as to how we come to that assessment but it be certainly sign of further russian weakness that it need to rely on north korean troop in the operation it be undertake in kursk oblast secondly on why this matter would pose question that be always useful when think about this conflict do we think putin would stop if he win in ukraine think we all know the answer his illegal war would continue against the ukrainian people as would his threat against nato ally especially those on nato eastern flank his malign influence would continue to extend to subversion of democracy through attack on critical infrastructure and cyber attack on nato ally include the united kingdom that be why we have cross party unity in our support for ukraine ukraine security be the united kingdom security the war in ukraine have fundamentally change the nature of warfare in the century we be now generation away from the operation conduct in iraq and afghanistan and even the conventional warfare train for throughout my time in the infantry only decade or so ago we have see how the use of drone have revolutionise the battle space in ukraine by that very much mean the handheld disposable end of the spectrum rather than platform like watchkeeper with the pace of their development necessitate more agile approach to procurement and development give that the conflict have evolve over just day to be unrecognisable from its initial phase to what extent be we ensure that the forthcoming strategic defence review keep pace with the rapidly evolve nature of aspect of contemporary warfare thank the hon gentleman for his question and for his service to our country he be right that we be see huge change in the way that war be conduct in ukraine but we be also see development in how technology and different skill can be bring together few year ago be not sure that many in uniform would have welcome the suggestion that play on playstation could train people for military combat yet we do now see gamer in ukraine apply their skill to fly first person view drone through difficult scenario on the frontline in support of their freedom it be precisely those lesson that the sdr be seek to capture we be use not just lesson from the war in ukraine but experience with russian malign influence elsewhere around the world to inform the sdr my hon friend sit next to on the front bench the minister for veterans and people feel how shall put strongly about drone and be absolutely certain that the sdr will include great role for not only drone warfare but training around drone and modern warfare as well as great role for autonomy in all domain thank the minister for his statement and welcome the announcement on our ongoing military support it be critically important that those who wage putin illegal war face the legal consequence for their action with that in mind will the minister set out the step that the government be take to support the ukrainian domestic legal system to ensure that these case be prosecute in their own court the hon gentleman raise really important issue the horrendous activity of the russian force in ukraine should be subject to the full extent of not only domestic but international law the previous government and this government have provide not only military and economic support but legal support we be support the international effort to seek to prosecute not only putin but all those who have perpetrate hideous crime against the ukrainian people especially ukrainian civilian the effort be ongoing and encourage he to table some write question to the attorney general office which might be able to provide more thorough update can assure he that our support for ukraine extend across the whole of government and that we will continue to pursue all those responsible for crime in ukraine up to and include the president of russia we need to be absolutely clear that this illegal unprovoked invasion of ukraine carry consequence if we do not and it carry no consequence it will be green light for other dictator around the world to seek to change their border and to attack people simply because they want to that be not acceptable in an international rule base system we must uphold the law that be why the uk effort from people in uniform and civilian who support our armed force as well as the lawyer seek to prosecute those crime be so essential for the long term peace and security of ukraine thank the minister very much for his statement there be nobody in this house who do not support what he have say today it encourage we as mps and it encourage my constituent so we thank he very much for his commitment hail from nation that have have to have the most highly train police in the world personally know of multiple ex royal ulster constabulary and ex military personnel who be station in northern ireland who train other military force and police force across the world it be right and proper that our force be able to help our ally indeed they should help our ally will the minister confirm that there be no intention for our force to see direct action in ukraine and that our role be that of training military provision and support thank the hon gentleman for his question and through he as northern ireland mp thank all those family in northern ireland who have welcome ukrainians into their home and continue to support they and the industry in northern ireland that be support ukraine it be the position of the uk government that we do not have and will not provide uk troop for combat role in ukraine however we will continue to support our ukrainian friend through the provision of training and the military equipment they need to determine their future the training in operation interflex will continue throughout the entirety of next year and will continue to flex and adapt to the change need of the ukrainian fight it be certainly true that ukraine need more people on the frontline to deter the aggression and our ability to improve and update our training offer alongside our international partner will be critical to keep ukraine in the fight in the month to come save the good back bench contributor till last thank you madam deputy speaker it be an honour and novelty to follow my near neighbour the hon member for strangford jim shannon the cost of new year dinner in russia be up over interest rate be up taxis be up and the rouble be down that be largely down to the fact that the previous government introduce punitive range of sanction against russia the famous military phrase be in all domain and the economic domain be absolutely critical can the minister assure we that we will continue to ramp up economic pressure as well as military pressure thank the hon gentleman for his question it be absolutely right that in addition to military support we use all lever available to we as government to put pressure on putin the kremlin and his illegal war and that include economic measure it be certainly true that russia be seek to find way to circumvent and evade some of the sanction put in place not just by the united kingdom but by our international ally too it be for that reason that the foreign commonwealth and development office and the treasury be update the sanction on regular basis not only to expand they where we see revenue stream from activity that directly support the war but to put further pressure on the russian economic system so that stay in the fight become hard and hard choice for they ultimately the war need to be bring to an end as soon as we can our lever not only military but economic and diplomatic be essential to be able to bring the pressure to bear on putin to stop his illegal invasion withdraw his troop and give all the people in ukraine who just wish to get on with their life free from attack abuse and intimidation by the russian state decent future let we hope that bring well year than be for our ukrainian friend syria with permission madam deputy speaker will make statement about the current situation in syria ten day have pass since assad departure the government welcome the fall of his cruel and barbaric regime and the opportunity it offer for syrians however while there be some cause for celebration fighting and violence continue across the country the situation in syria have develop rapidly over the last week in the north east the us broker ceasefire between the syrian democratic forces and the türkiye syrian national army have be temporarily extend but the situation remain highly fragile in damascus hayat tahrir al sham or hts as will call they for the rest of the speech have appoint prime minister to lead an interim government until march but they have give very little detail on the shape and focus of that government the uk government remain committed to the people of syria we support syrian lead and syrian own political transition process base on the principle of un security council resolution and lead to an inclusive non sectarian and representative government we be hopeful that anyone seek role in govern syria will demonstrate commitment to the protection of human right include for woman and girl unfettered access for humanitarian aid the safe destruction of chemical weapon stockpile and combat terrorism and extremism the uk urge the transitional government to adhere to those principle to build more hopeful secure and peaceful syria on saturday jordan convene an arab foreign ministers discussion follow by meeting with eu french un us and uk representative all involve include the uk reiterate their support for an inclusive political transition process it be critical that the international community work together in co ordinated and complementary manner to ensure the good outcome for the syrian people along with our partner we want to see new political process that be comprehensive representative inclusive and most importantly determine by the syrian people themselves we must also ensure that chemical weapon stockpile be secure not use and that the transition to new governance be peaceful for all those reason it be right that the uk seek to use all the channel available to we to deal with hts where we have to to that end senior official from the fcdo have travel to damascus they have underline the uk support for the syrian people and discuss the pathway to more hopeful representative and peaceful future for syria with the new interim syrian authority and civil society during their visit senior official also discuss the importance of an inclusive transitional political process that protect the right of all syrians and prevent further instability those word be important of course but they must be support by action too the humanitarian situation on the ground remain dire with over million syrians in need of humanitarian assistance and that be purely within the border of syria itself that be why on saturday the government announce new package of international aid to help the most vulnerable syrians include in jordan and lebanon on top of that announce by the prime minister on december the uk million in aid will help provide emergency healthcare and nutrition and support displace syrian child we call on more of our partner to join we in commit great humanitarian support commend this statement to the house call the shadow minister thank the minister for advance sight of her statement the house have many serious question about the decision announce by the foreign secretary to the medium rather than to this house to establish diplomatic channel with hayat tahrir al sham hts be proscribe terrorist organisation but the foreign secretary say that the uk be none the less able to have diplomatic contact can the minister clarify the specific legal basis on which she have establish contact be hts the only such organisation operate in syria that now have diplomatic channel we be now aware that ann snow the uk special representative for syria and another senior fcdo diplomat have meet the leader of hts can the minister tell we who else have make contact have contact with hts leader only be make via official channel rather than at ministerial level know the minister will be aware that there be big difference between the two the foreign secretary also say that the fcdo be engage with hts because it want representative and inclusive government and an end to violence in syria have the uk convey to hts clear expectation of what should happen to bring that about if so will the minister now take this opportunity to share that road map with the house do she believe base on those conversation that hts will lead peaceful transfer of power to genuine civilian government which protect minority group the government need to be extremely careful because by deal with hts and publicly do so there be risk of legitimisation of the organisation and its position in syria at this stage do the minister not agree that that would be premature these be very early day in the new post assad reality and we need to judge hts by its action not its word now that the government have embark on this path can we expect an unequivocal statement that there be no read across to other proscribe group the integrity of the proscription system be absolutely paramount and the government must exercise extreme care not to undermine it in any way be it still the case that those who leave britain to support the murderous daesh regime have no place in the uk and will the minister commit herself to rule out any return of shamima begum and other to the uk we note her comment about chemical weapon can she provide any further detail on how the uk will push for their destruction let now turn to the humanitarian aspect of this conflict we be aware of the government late aid package to syria two week ago when press on aid delivery in syria the minister for the middle east say he be concerned that practical access for aid agency would be difficult to maintain and work be need to maintain access through established humanitarian corridor it would be helpful to hear the government late assessment of the situation the uk have fund more than billion of aid over the past decade and more but with terrorist group in control of significant territory can the minister assure the house that the only beneficiary of british aid include food water and sanitation be innocent civilian british aid must not end up in the wrong hand so what assurance can she give that the way in which aid be be deliver have take account of the new operating environment there be real concern about what iran next step in syria might be there be report that the regime in tehran have be in contact with rebel group and we need to be very alive to the risk that it may try to re establish foothold for its hostile and malign operation in the region we should be very clear about the fact that would be an awful outcome we and our ally need to be pull every diplomatic lever to blunt iran ability to launch resurgence in syria and the house would welcome an update from the minister on her work on that front we all want stable peaceful government in syria who will protect all group and minority free from the influence of iran and russia that be easy to say but bring it about be far more difficult as will be avoid an incredibly dangerous power vacuum that could fuel extremism cause further breakdown of law and order and bring about proliferation of criminal activity include the weapon smuggling and drug production we need to see clear plan from the government that protect british interest at home and abroad and support those who sincerely want to protect the innocent syrian civilian who have suffer so much be grateful to the right hon lady for her comment she have raise number of issue with which will deal in turn first she ask about the uk engagement with hts do talk about that in my statement but can provide additional information it be clear that the fact that hts be proscribe terrorist group do not prevent the uk from engage with it in our effort to help secure political settlement or from engage with any future transitional government in syria that include hts its proscription will not inhibit the pursuit of our foreign policy objective in syria and the uk will be guide by set of core principle for any diplomatic interaction with the interim syria authority with inclusion and the protection of human right as key consideration that have be the case until now and it most definitely will be the case into the future the right hon lady ask about engagement with other body at official level there have be engagement with türkiye and with the sdf and that will continue we be seek to do all that we can above all to ensure that the interest of syrians themselves be put at the forefront in this very difficult situation the right hon lady ask about the representation be make by the uk to the hts cover that in my statement but let repeat that we have be crystal clear about the fact that any subsequent arrangement must be comprehensive representative inclusive and above all determine by syrians she ask whether this would have any impact on the integrity of the proscription regime no and it must not because that be an incredibly important regime and there will be no linkage she ask what would happen with those who choose to leave our country to promote and support terrorism by seek to fight for daesh of course those people will not be able to come to the uk she talk about the use of chemical weapon cover that in my statement as well but again the uk will seek to play as much of part as it possibly can in ensure that those stockpile be destroy after they be use so appallingly against the syrian people the right hon lady ask about the use of aid have discuss this matter myself as have many of my official with number of multilateral body and with number of our bilateral partner as well we be determined to work together to ensure that aid do not fall into the wrong hand and be not divert of course that must not happen because it be desperately need by many syrians great many people have already be displace from syria to neighbouring country but large population movement now seem to be take place and it really be important that the aid go where it be need we be of course monitor that in detail the right hon lady ask about the situation with iran the uk have condemn iran reckless and destabilising activity include its support for militant group we have be very clear about that as the new government finally the right hon lady talk about the need to ensure that we do not see an increase in the development that have be so concern involve the smuggling of weapon and drug the uk will focus on that later with the new government because we see the damage that have already be cause in that regard welcome the minister statement early this week meet alevi kurdish and other community who be deeply concerned about what will happen to minority in syria now that hts have seize power there the uk have rightly proscribe hts as result of its link with al qaeda can the minister reassure the house that the government will use all their power to prevent hts and other hostile actor from attack minority in syria of course we will seek to use every lever in that respect because it be the position of this government that all civilian must be protect and that include civilian who form part of religious and ethnic minority we have also make it very clear that as mention few moment ago the political process must be inclusive and that cover all religious and ethnic minority when it come to the situation for kurds think it relevant to underline the fact that the uk have be in touch with both türkiye and the sdf since the start of this escalation we be urge all side to refrain from activity that could lead to further loss of civilian life and of course we want to see the ceasefire be hold to call the liberal democrat spokesperson the fall of assad mark turning point in syria history one that bring renew hope for million who have suffer under his brutal rule it also represent serious setback for the global ambition of the regime in moscow and tehran as we reflect on this momentous day however we must remain vigilant it be not enough to see the end of cruel despot who unleash chemical weapon on his own people true justice require that he be hold to account for his crime ensure that such atrocity never reoccur in these early day of transition every effort must be channel into secure an orderly and peaceful transfer of power we welcome the sign of engagement with group on the ground include those who have have contact with hts and we urge all party to commit themselves to stable path forward but this can not be mere change of flag or face the new leadership must work tirelessly to safeguard the dignity and right of every community ensure that religious and ethnic minority be not just tolerate but actively protect equally vital be the reconstruction of syria infrastructure investment in road school hospital and electricity grid be essential restore those lifeline of society will help to rebuild trust and lie the groundwork for thriving inclusive economy that reach every corner of the country the international community stand ready to support these initiative but we must see clear evidence of genuine commitment to positive meaningful change the minister mention the million of uk aid which be very welcome can she give we the detail of how it will specifically support syrians who be return to their home country may also ask what the government be do to work alongside key regional player to ensure that whatever come next uphold the value of democracy and freedom be grateful to the hon member for his remark and agree with the way in which he describe the current situation there be no question but that many syrians feel an enormous sense of relief at the end of such murderous and brutal regime but there be deep concern about what will come now the uk be determined to play our part in ensure that the future be determine by the syrians themselves the hon gentleman ask about accountability that be an incredibly important point to reflect on because in recent year we have see the appalling targeting of so many syrians by the assad regime the uk have play its part as have many expert from the uk in seek to gather information about that praise the previous government for their work in that regard particularly their work with the international impartial and independent mechanism which have be seek to make sure that there be coherent collation and use of evidence so that we can address the widespread impunity and the suffering of the syrian people under the assad regime give the change that have take place it be really important that we do not lose that information and that ultimately there be the accountability that the syrian people deserve the hon gentleman ask for detail of the aid that the uk have provide and about how that will be relevant for those seek to return to syria of course many area of syria have be appallingly degrade through the action of assad and basic service water electricity and other service that be essential for anything approach normal life have be destroy it will be long term process but the uk be now focus on provide emergency healthcare support for nutrition and food provision more generally as well as support for the many displaced child who have have to deal with such traumatic period we will continue to focus on those important issue with our partner into the future commend the minister for her statement and for the additional million in aid be particularly grateful for the extra that have be give to the opcw to help rid syria of chemical weapon which despite the denial and downplaying by some people include member of this house be be use by assad my question follow up on the one ask last week about political prisoner be grateful that sednaya prison look like it have be clear but hear from my syrian friend that there be other prison and secret detention centre across the country what step can the uk government take to help support the syrians to find any missing people and ensure that they be free as soon as possible be very grateful to my hon friend for raise those point he mention the terrible use of chemical weapon within syria the new government be deeply concerned about their previous use but we also want to ensure that they can never be use again on civilian population we note hts statement that it will protect chemical weapon site and will not use such weapon under any circumstance we urge all party to comply with international law include the chemical weapon convention and to engage with the opcw so that we can finally make sure that all ban weapon be destroy my hon friend raise the issue of those who have be appallingly detain in some case for an extremely long period of time in horrific circumstance accountability around those issue relate to the matter that talk about few moment ago the iiim be so crucial to make sure that datum about assad murderous regime be not just collect but hold and then use to drive accountability the minister will be aware of report that up to million be hold in asset in the uk under the syrian sanction regime will she look at way in which that money can be use in due course for the benefit of the people of syria be very grateful to the right hon member for his question be sure that he will understand indeed he have follow these issue for many year that the uk sanction regime be continuously keep under review the uk have be determine to ensure that where we can use sanction in order to ensure that there be accountability we will do so of course we will keep these matter under review and work with partner to make sure that there be accountability we welcome the minister statement and what she have detail about the effort of the department and our government to create broad coalition to bring about peace in syria early we have statement on ukraine from the minister for the armed forces who say that we be challenge malign russian activity and there be broad consensus across the house give the russians malign activity in syria do the minister agree that although we need an inclusive political process that include the country minority group it be essential that we have broad international process be very grateful to my hon friend for raise the critical need for an international process and the need for continuation of the engagement that we have see in recent day first with arab country come together and then engagement by the eu us uk and other want to underline my hon friend point about russia it be clear that with russia military support the assad regime be able to continue its brutal campaign against the syrian people for over year the sudden fall of that regime have expose russia weaken state and the unreliable and self serve nature of its so call alliance very much welcome the minister statement and the removal of the assad government what assessment have the uk government make of the syrian justice system capacity to prosecute war crime and all the horrendous crime that be perpetrate against the poor people of syria during assad regime sadly it be very clear that under assad we do not see justice system that be focus on criminal justice and on provide proper accountability instead there be vast number of political prisoner and extensive and extremely deep persecution focus on the need of the regime of course there must be change as describe in my statement the uk have engage with syria particularly on the need to prevent further conflict to ensure the protection of human right and to ensure an inclusive and representative political process that will require the kind of institution that can uphold an inclusive representative and comprehensive governance structure surely that be the least that the syrians deserve do the minister share my concern that the situation in both syria and gaza threaten stability in the wide region and can she reassure that the government be act urgently to support humanitarian need in both syria and gaza yes can reassure my hon friend on that it be important for we to understand the situation in many country in the region jordan have very large proportion of palestinian refugee and also have many syrian refugee have the absolute privilege of meet some of they when visit the zaatari camp in jordan the uk have be work with jordan on the jahez programme which we announce recently but we have also be work with the country to ensure that where possible we can push forward access for aid into gaza pay tribute to the jordanian government for that have several short question the minister have already touch on sanction the new syrian leader ahmed al sharaa have say that sanction must be lift and that that be not up for negotiation look forward to hear the minister thought on how we can move forward on behalf of the snp welcome the million of support particularly for healthcare and nutrition but who will deliver it and how can we ensure that it be deliver to the people who need it most over the last week or two we have all see the unfold news about the horror of what happen and not just in the prison this week channel news have report that hundred of thousand of civilian have be bury in mass graf what be the uk government thought on the technical and forensic assistance provide follow previous genocide not least in rwanda and the balkans what support could we provide the university of dundee be world leader in forensic and would like it to have the opportunity to hear the minister response will try to answer the hon member four question as quickly as possible so that other can speak first there be already tough sanction in place against the assad regime against individual and link entity as mention this government will keep all evidence and potential designation under close review and we will not hesitate to take further action as need we be work with partner particularly the un agency on deliver aid yesterday or the day before discuss in detail with the un emergency co ordinator how we will ensure that access be provide work together in concert we also need to make sure that there be no duplication give that there be such need that be something on which the uk be very much focused the uk have be engage in ensure that forensic evidence be collect as say much of that work be conduct through the iiim it be important that uk expert be engage and pay tribute to the dundonians who have be engage in this important work clearly we be hear very disturbing report and it be critical that we have clear substantiate evidence that can be use to drive accountability hope that many uk expert will be involve in that effort the end of vicious dictatorship and the limited progress that have be make under the interim authority be lead to ever more syrian refugee perhaps even million return home of course in principle this be good but syria education system its infrastructure and its healthcare system be devastate do my right hon friend agree that this present significant opportunity for the uk to play huge role in help syrians to rebuild their country british aid agency company and expert in international law can all help to embed stability and to ensure democratic transition and an inclusive and more prosperous country for the syrians agree with my hon friend of course million of syrian refugee remain in türkiye lebanon and jordan and the house have to recognise that further surge of refugee out of syria would increase the strain on many other country and potentially increase the number of people seek to use dangerous route into continental europe and the uk we need to work on this with multilateral organisation and with country in the region while make sure that we focus on future reconstruction we have talk about the destruction of many basic service and it really will be important to make sure that syria as whole nation and whole territory be make inhabitable again that be the right of all syrians be sure colleague on both side of the house welcome the fall of the brutal assad regime and perhaps very cautiously welcome the early inclusive statement in part at least of ahmed al sharaa the hts leader but have to confess that be somewhat nervous be these statement too good to be true do not the international community particularly the uk government need to be careful that it be not be play in particular the transitional government should be judge on their deed not just their word and bbc tv interview briefly when will the uk embassy in syria reopen what will the government do to ensure the protection of minority particularly at christmas christian minority and to make sure that they be represent in the transitional government and indeed the future government of syria although some of the biological and chemical stockpile hold in syria have be bomb by israel that be welcome in my view we have to ensure that they do not fall into the hand of any rebel group or transitional government but be completely destroy or give over to another authority that can destroy they cover the nature of the uk engagement with hts both in my statement and in my answer of course it be critical that the uk be clear about the need for future political settlement to be comprehensive and inclusive and it must include both ethnic and religious minority the right hon gentleman talk about the christian minority in syria many of which be appallingly persecute over many year as with other minority we need to ensure that they be protect into the future the uk have be resolute on that point the right hon gentleman mention chemical stockpile and the uk government have be absolutely clear that those stockpile must not be use hts have make statement on this subject and we be determined to ensure that it be hold to that and that all party ensure that the stockpile be destroy so that they can never be use thank my right hon friend for her diligent work on the very challenging situation in syria be sure that she have see the report from place like idlib aleppo homs and damascus of woman be force to wear the hijab young woman be escort and other restriction on woman right that be in stark contrast to the position under the autonomous administration in north and east syria rojava gender equality be bake into its constitutional arrangement what assessment have she make of hts attitude towards gender equality and woman right do she think that there should be ministry for woman and gender equality in the constitutional arrangement of future syrian republic my hon friend raise an issue that could not be more important when we talk about arrangement be inclusive comprehensive and representative that must include arrangement for the of the population who be woman we must also see that girl as well as woman be protect when we look at the previous humanitarian situation in syria we see that there be huge issue for many woman in access family planning and basic health service those kind of issue hit woman particularly hard the uk have be support the work of the united nations on family planning and we will continue to make sure that the uk be strong advocate both on political level and on service for woman and girl in syria the minister might like to welcome the fact that the israeli air force be systematically destroy chemical weapon rather than rely on the word of terrorist will she comment on the large occupation anywhere in the middle east namely that of turkey in syria and on the pro western kurdish fighter who be be singly deal with by the turks it appear that the turkish parliament now see an opportunity to annex more and more of syria create great turkish empire have the minister or the government have any discussion with turkey about its intention be grateful to the hon gentleman for raise these issue briefly mention that the uk have be in contact with türkiye and the syrian democratic forces since the start of this escalation as he will be aware there be us broker ceasefire and it have to be hold to we have be very clear with all side that they must refrain from activity that could lead to further loss of life or damage to civilian infrastructure in order to avoid further destabilisation and civilian suffering in the region which have already be intense and which must not be worsen welcome the minister involvement and preparedness to work with the new syrian government and we hope that that will deliver future free from war and free from human right abuse however the new government be face with country awash with weapon and armed force from russia turkey the usa israel and isis active in the country what action have she take to ensure israel withdraw from syria and turkish force withdraw from the north of syria allow the kurdish people to live in peace and with right of self determination we be aware that the situation be incredibly complex and large number of armed group with variety of different affiliation be involve in that context the most critical issue for the uk government be that civilian be protect my goodness they suffer enough under assad and now with the fall of assad we must ensure they be protect on other

williams who manage the inquiry with curiosity and care from conception to report our armed force personnel dedicate their life to protect this nation often at great personal sacrifice ensure they have access to safe comfortable and well maintain accommodation be not just matter of duty it be moral obligation the committee investigation have reveal deeply concern situation that have develop over many year the condition of both service family accommodation and single living accommodation fall far below the standard our servicemen and woman deserve we have find instance of dilapidated housing inadequate maintenance and unacceptable living condition include some truly appalling persistent problem with damp and mould case of total loss of heating hot water and cooking facility for month in winter flooding and rodent infestation such substandard living condition directly affect the morale and operational readiness of our armed force they be also significant challenge to recruitment and retention our report highlight systemic failure in the management and maintenance of service accommodation the current system be plague by lack of clear accountability and have reach point of crisis follow insufficient funding over decade satisfaction with service accommodation be very low that be hardly surprising give that third of single living accommodation and two third of service family accommodation be in such poor condition that they be essentially no long fit for purpose the committee have put forward several key recommendation to start to address this situation we call for detailed fund investment plan for service accommodation which be crucial to address the backlog of repair and to bring the housing stock up to acceptable modern standard such plan be also crucial to enable effective planning for how good to manage the interim situation in which so much defence housing remain substandard for all accommodation maintain under contract we call for the ministry of defence to review the assurance process and performance measure for those contract as part of plan to improve the management of accommodation there need to be much more focus on the satisfaction of servicepeople and their family that must include make sure that complaint process be accessible and fit for purpose well communication with servicepeople and their family be absolutely key alongside well delivery of real improvement that people value the committee also examine recent development relate to the allocation of family accommodation namely the botched mismanage nature of it both the propose change and the subsequent pause in their implementation have cause significant uncertainty for service personnel and their family the situation underscore the need for clear consistent communication and highlight the importance of thorough consultation with those affect by such change want to emphasise that this be not about apportion blame but about recognise share responsibility across government over many year to do well for those who serve our country however it be now for the current government to put thing right the challenge be considerable and require meaningful plan of investment and effective delivery and communication warmly welcome the announcement on tuesday that the government be buy back the service family accommodation portfolio the decision back in to sell the portfolio be major mistake and be compound by the term of the deal which have be describe by the public accounts committee as disastrous it leave the public purse billion of pound bad off and the government responsible for maintain and upgrade an estate that be in effect own by somebody else that be why the situation be nettle that need to be grasp buy back the portfolio be the right decision and have the potential to be real game changer however essential though that is the buy back will not in itself directly improve thing for servicepeople and their family right now along with my colleague on the defence committee will be look closely at the plan that follow and how it be fund and deliver commend the report to the house put on record this government support for the report that my hon friend have just publish the state of military housing be not good enough too many of our military family be live in poor quality accommodation and that be precisely why the government seek to renew the contract between the nation and those who serve that be why we be bring annington home back into public ownership that will save the taxpayer day which be money that can be use to well support our service family be grateful to hon member from both side of the house include the shadow minister the right hon member for rayleigh and wickford mr francois for his work in support of the deal do my hon friend agree that this decisive break from fail past be just our first chance to renew the contract between the nation and those who serve hope he will keep the government honest on our commitment to improve service life and accommodation through the work we be legislate for with the armed forces commissioner hope his committee will be able to support and provide ongoing scrutiny of service family accommodation because decent housing be the least that all our armed force and their family deserve this government be intent on deliver on that welcome the minister comment and indeed we will be support and scrutinise the work of government we look forward to work with the armed forces commissioner as and when they be appoint as intimate early tuesday announcement be very welcome but there be great deal of work for the minister and his colleague to do the proof will be in the planning and the delivery call the liberal democrat spokesperson the liberal democrats fully support the finding of the report and we hope it will mark the beginning of much well and fair deal for armed force personnel for too long they have be fail by successive government do the chair agree that this be long overdue change welcome by our party and across the house our service personnel who at time put their life on the line for this country should at the very least expect to have warm safe and secure place to call home do he also agree that the backlog and repair to the basic service he have highlight be unacceptable and should not be allow to recur in future could not agree more with the liberal democrat spokesman it be completely unacceptable that we expect our brave servicemen and woman and their family to be house in such substandard condition we have instance of damp mould rat infestation could rattle off so many other thing that be completely unacceptable completely concur with the hon gentleman and look forward to the government take immediate and urgent action to remediate thing warmly welcome the report and be proud to be part of my hon friend the chair team who have so well encapsulate the witness testimony and the work that be do by the previous committee join he in warmly welcome the announcement from early in the week and the forthcoming work to bring about service commissioner to oversee the process and ensure such injustice do not befall our service personnel in future do he agree that service housing be the foundation upon which our service personnel serve and commit to our country and that this be the start of journey of repair very damage contract that this country have with its service personnel concur fully with my fellow member of the defence committee give his vast experience of have serve in our armed force his contribution as member of the committee will be substantial and know he will bring that experience to bear as we look forward to remediate thing he be correct that service accommodation be the foundation on which we must ensure that our servicepeople have the very good facility that we as nation can offer call the shadow minister for the record declare an interest participate in the inquiry while serve on the committee in the previous parliament thank the committee chairman for kindly point that out also for the record we welcome the annington decision partly because we have do lot of work on that prior to the election thank the minister for play fair on that now that we have hopefully resolve the issue of the ownership of the estate there be still the question of its management change the ownership do not fix the boiler will the chairman of the committee be pleased to hear that in the same bipartisan spirit we be happy to work with the department and ministers to see if we can provide proposal for improve the management of the estate now that hopefully we have resolve the ownership question the right hon gentleman be indeed right not only in his considerable contribution to the deliberation relate to the service accommodation report but in precede year when he serve in such distinguished manner on the defence committee which by the way work on cross party basis and the report be agree unanimously he be also right to highlight that the management of the contract will be essential the committee report have identify the serious problem and now the ball be in the government court as to how they manage that however it be great to see the cross party working and hope that will help to address the issue in more timely manner welcome the committee service accommodation report and recommendation but be not surprised by its finding also welcome the government move to purchase back housing stock that should never have be sell off and the hundred of house that will bring back to portsmouth however the issue of ministry of defence housing be huge because of the year of manage decline under the previous government there have be no real investment just stick plaster portsmouth in particular have be underfunde and those in naval property miss out more than most because they can be in their home for long than those in other service as they be base at the port there be cap on void work which mean that if family move out the house need renovate and it will be withdraw this cause undue stress to family who have already select school sort out their removal and leave job there be not always guarantee of house in the same area there be so much to say on behalf of portsmouth service personnel but lift word from the page of the report invite the committee and the ministers to meet the contractor and service personnel in portsmouth to see the reality of the situation my hon friend be right she be also speak with considerable experience because of the importance of portsmouth to our nation defence and the sheer scale of its service accommodation indeed look forward to visit portsmouth the defence committee along with its staff will be visit the city very soon and yes every instance of substandard accommodation be unacceptable and we must collectively work to rectify matter some year ago be grow up in army accommodation because my dad be serve in the royal signals even then remember my parent talk about the problem that they be have with their accommodation it be extraordinary that all this time later thing have probably get bad rather than well want to put on record that this be about not only service personnel but their spouse and child who live in the accommodation when service personnel be serve away from home often for month at time the family health and mental health be impact by the quality of their accommodation do the chair of the committee agree that the impact on mental health be important could not agree more with the hon member she have get to the nub of it if our brave servicemen and woman be anxious about what be go on with their family when they be serve around the world that affect their mental health it also affect the mental health of the family themselves the partner and the child it be extremely important that we rectify matter otherwise armed service personnel will vote with their foot and walk away wholeheartedly support this excellent report of my hon friend and his select committee may also ask they to look at the issue of housing for veteran which be very important matter many veteran in read live in poor quality rent accommodation despite the fact that read borough council have prioritise their need in the council house waiting list there be simply not enough council house to go around we have particular problem with our british gurkha community who be struggle in poor accommodation will the select committee look into that matter my hon friend have be champion of veteran particularly gurkha veteran know that he recently visit aldershot and many other place include westminster hall to champion their cause he be right that veteran issue need to be resolve think that he along with his constituent will have be happy with the government recent announcement of home for veteran but we must keep push to ensure the good possible outcome for our veteran wish you merry yorkshire christmas madam deputy speaker thank my hon friend for the committee report as we be admit thing let say that in the too live in armed service accommodation for brief period it be important for we to remember how many child live in armed service accommodation have be raise this issue since at the time of the carillionamey contract catterick garrison in yorkshire have one of the large stock of armed force housing and know that my hon friend know how poor much of the maintenance work have be he have already mention mould rat and condition that be unfit for child or anybody to live in do he think that service family who suffer the most egregious example of poor maintenance should be able to receive compensation from those private company my hon friend along with other hon member speak with great deal of experience have live in service accommodation when have the honour recently to visit catterick be able to see for myself some of the service accommodation we do need to ensure that people be hold to account have no doubt that the government will put pressure on those management company to ensure that compensation commensurate with what people have suffer should be forthcoming that conclude the select committee statement point of order on point of order madam deputy speaker in today urgent question the minister for secondary care the hon member for bristol south karin smyth say that the government would be introduce million boost for adult and child hospice but neglect to say that this money would be available only for capital spending as confirm in the write statement publish this afternoon she repeatedly refer to the million sum when ask about what step the government be take to address the cost of national insurance increase for hospice even though this money will not be available for staff cost have mr speaker receive any indication from the minister that she intend to correct the record thank the hon member for give notice of that point of order while the chair be not responsible for the content of contribution make by ministers be sure that her concern have be hear by those on the government benches if an error have be make in this instance be sure that the minister will seek to correct it as soon as possible backbench business christmas adjournment beg to move that this house have consider matter to be raise before the forthcoming adjournment it seem like only few day ago that we be have the pre conference recess debate yet here we be in the final day of what busy year it have be for all of we we have have general election mayoral election leadership contest gnarly taylor swift eras tour the paris olympics and president trump re elect to the white house but still no trophy for spurs perhaps we can put that right in thank everyone who have play part in make so special the catering staff the house staff the clerks the workman the staff in the post office

chairman pay tribute to his hard work over that time ensure that back benchers be able to bring their issue to the floor of the house intend to do so in that capacity as well as it be christmas must say that my display of accismus to the position see off all the competition the rest of my committee and the clerks have be invaluable in the transition and look forward to continue our work in the new year another addition to my cv this year have be assume the role of chairman of the prestigious well would call it committee be pleased that we have welcome our new leader the right hon member for north west essex mrs badenoch who have make really good start in the five week since she be elect hope that labour member do not get too comfy on the government benches as we will be back in short order also thank my fellow officer my hon friend the members for north cotswolds sir geoffrey clifton brown and for stockton west matt vickers for their help and counsel over the past few month it have certainly be busy introduction to the job transport for london have continue to be run into the ground with spend priority that be short term political and simply vain the refurbishment of the central line need to be expedite this be badly need because it be my understanding that there be literally no more spare direct current motor for the stock available necessitate their conversion to alternate current motor as matter of priority that may sound not so important but the project have be go on for the last five year tfl now have completion date of for the project that be outrageous the piccadilly line be four year behind schedule the new train will not come into force until the end of next year they be suppose to come in in now tfl be say that it do not have funding to upgrade the signalling either the bakerloo line have the old work train in regular service in the uk those who have travel on they know how bad they be yet tfl duck the issue of replace they again cite funding as the reason there be no plan to replace the stock which many of my constituent have to use from station in my constituency but there be money for mayor khan to pay off his union paymaster there be also money to pay for costly election year fare freeze gimmick and million to spend on vanity project regard the london overground to say nothing of the choice of the line name themselves which be at good virtue signal and at worst extremely confusing madam deputy speaker you will be delighted to hear that will not bore the house with the history of the name of the london underground line but they be either historically derive or name after royalty the overground line be certainly not be therefore disappointed that the government see fit to reward this wanton destruction of tfl with promotion for the former deputy mayor for transport she be the new transport secretary and possible knighthood for the man in charge of it all nearly people have already sign petition call on the government to reconsider and heartedly agree indeed would be more than happy to recommend colleague from the government benches who would be far more deserving of knighthood than mayor khan we should remember the violence be implement on hindus and other minority in bangladesh and the attack in can you believe on jews and hindus in their synagogue and temple that be outrageous we in this house be all conscious of the escalate situation in the middle east but there be clear and present danger that if terrorist remain in gaza the conflict can not have long term solution indeed it could drag hezbollah iran and extremist force in the middle east into full scale war with israel which none of we want to see we should understand that the regime in tehran be pure skibidi on june labour promise that if it be elect it would proscribe the islamic revolutionary guard corps in its entirety as many of we have be call on previous conservative government to do for number of year on july the guardian report that the government would not proscribe the irgc as terrorist group in its entirety completely turn on their promise call on the government to correct that error of judgment soon rather than later be honour recently to meet the inspiringly brave mandy damari woman with rizz her daughter emily damari be still be hold hostage in gaza emily be the last british hostage in gaza she be an avid tottenham fan and an innocent young girl take from her apartment on october she have not be return and she have be shoot wound and not give medical treatment it be totally unimaginable what she be go through we must not let emily be forget and urge the government to work with the israeli government to ensure safe return as soon as possible the long emily be hold captive the slim her chance become and the long she have to endure such dark day my thought and prayer remain with the damari family and those who have lose love one due to terrorism another issue that the government need to reconsider give the situation globally be their defence spending commitment or lack thereof they commit to spend of gdp on defence as soon as they could now that have change to have road map to achieve it in this uncertain world we need this to be accelerate not delay we have already hear that the ministry of defence face large funding gap in the current financial year and in in december the national audit office identify deficit in the equipment plan of billion for this year and further deficit of billion for the following year the mod will have to find an extra billion each year to fund the above budget cost of the and pay settlement for the armed force it be such an important point that the national interest should not be subject to party politic or spending review the money should be ringfence on january we mark holocaust memorial day be pleased that through january there will be range of activity to mark it include the annual book of commitment which urge all colleague especially those new to the house to sign they can place in it their commitment to combat antisemitism and hatred of people because of their religion race or background it be sadden that the tension in the middle east be so frequently spill over onto our street with antisemitic behaviour rise by over compare with october level we must stand up to that abominable behaviour not allow any hate crime to take place regardless of race or religion during the festive period it be particularly important to share thought for those without permanent home and those sleep rough the winter month can be ruthless with increase hour of darkness and plummet temperature it can be an incredibly lonely period for those without any friend or home to live in watch everyone ignore they on the sidewalk while

thought and prayer be with his family at this difficult time time of family will raise four local issue one international one national and partridge in pear tree sorry that sound well in my head the first local issue be the accessibility of bescot railway station which do not have access for disabled people or for parent and carer first make contact with the minister of state for transport in september and despite meeting in november with walsall football club supporter include disabled supporter as well as network rail and west midlands combine authority nothing have happen ask network rail to look into the matter and it say that it think there be solution and would provide an answer in six month but we be still wait we have legislation enshrine in statute the railways act the human rights act and the equality act but understand that bescot stadium station have be put on the list for that mean that my poor constituent who be disabled or be parent with pushchair will have to wait until then which be unacceptable my constituent be not interested in feasibility study of feasibility study so will the minister who it be very welcome to see in her place raise this issue with the secretary of state for transport the second issue be bowel cancer in walsall and bloxwich emergency admission for case of bowel cancer be the high across the black country double those of the next high walsall manor be the only hospital in the black country that do not use robotic for bowel cancer why should my constituent have to travel to new cross hospital to access quick easy and cost effective way to treat this cancer which be the second most common cause of cancer death again if the minister would raise this issue with the public health minister that would be very welcome the next issue be the use of school and save the taxpayer money sneyd community school be close in it be re establish as university technical college by the university of wolverhampton and walsall college that be close in but it be perfectly viable school headteacher in the area have suggest that it could be use as special school but instead public money be be use to destroy the vegetation in reedswood

canteen kitchen and dining hall and have be work with it since so that it get its full allocation of building schools for the future money which it have not receive the headmaster have say that he hop

attraction on tripadvisor and suggest that hon member come and visit it be unique and interactive with engage demonstration of leathercraft have be tell by the worshipful company of saddlers that most uk business in the leather industry be base in walsall and leather good from my constituency be sell worldwide include by launer one of the company that make the late queen handbag be delighted that baroness hodge in the other place will be review the arts council but as the secretary of state for culture media and sport have say culture museum art and library be so important to our wellbeing as such will the minister raise this issue with the secretary of state the international issue want to raise be that of alaa abd el fattah british citizen who be in prison in egypt he have year old son

member happy new year early this year initiate westminster hall debate on headlight glare and the increase road safety risk result from modern vehicle headlight do so have read an article in my local newspaper the grimsby telegraph report on study carry out by the royal automobile club and it emerge from the debate that the department for transport be undertake research last week in business question raise the matter with the leader of the house and appreciate her reply say that she would get the minister to follow up be plan on raise the matter in this debate anyway look forward to receive that update but hope that mention it yet again today will keep it on the department agenda we all know that lighting technology have change considerably in the past decade or so clearly it be to everyone advantage that vehicle be well light particularly for pedestrian but there can be no doubt that the amount of glare have increase and the minister who respond to my may debate acknowledge that he be receive far more correspondence on this matter dr john lincoln of lightaware charity that explore these issue explain that although the human eye can adapt to wide range of light level from bright sunlight to almost total darkness it can not do so in short space of time he go on to detail the various scientific issue involve appreciate that the issue be complex and that the department will have to do much research before introduce any regulation but it be important it be not just that the light be much bright but that some vehicle seem to have far more than require there be also the issue of street furniture such as where vehicle pass over road hump can glare oncoming driver last january the rac publish the result of its research show that of driver think that some or most headlight on the road be too bright some say that they be regularly dazzle that might result in part from the fact that we have many more large vehicle on the road and they sit higher off the road lightaware have carry out extensive research on that and hope the department will soon conclude its own research the college of optometrists have suggest that as many as half of motorist over the age of may have early stage cataract in both eye that make they even more vulnerable to glare from oncoming vehicle hope that we can fairly rapidly conclude that research and bring forward new regulation to improve road safety will touch on one or two constituency issue be sorry to bore member about this issue but can tell new member that the only way to get success in this place often be to bore front bencher so that they eventually take action in first raise the issue of direct train service from my constituency then call cleethorpes to king cross which be withdraw by british rail in be still campaign along with my friend the hon member for great grimsby and cleethorpes melanie onn we now await meeting with yet another minister from the department for transport to hopefully restore that service as have mention to many transport secretaries over the year my constituency have railway station an international airport and the large port in the country yet we still can not have direct train service to london that be crucial to the development of industry in the area and be fully support by big business the hull and humber chamber of commerce have do much research on it very much hope that it will be bring forward in the not too distant future see that my time be run out so will restrict myself to just one other railway issue it be interesting to hear the hon member for newton aycliffe and spennymoor alan strickland talk about the anniversary of the stockton and darlington railway as chairman of the all party parliamentary group on rail hope that we can all join in mark that occasion it will not be mark in brigg though the rail service between gainsborough brigg grimsby and cleethorpes have one train day and allow people only minute to enjoy the sunny sand of cleethorpes or the excellent shopping in grimsby it be pointless to run one service day and give people only minute at their destination the service be run for the convenience of northern train rather than for passenger see the lord commissioner of his majesty treasury the hon member for redcar anna turley nod hope that the message will get through to the department for transport could go on for

their team and my wonderful team as well as the constituent of southend west and leigh merry christmas and happy new year happy christmas everyone patricia be young intelligent woman with severe eat disorder despite the tireless work of professional involve in her care her mental health treatment need be not be meet and her progress have stall the east of england provider collaborative which be responsible for referral to specialist eat disorder unit sedu be intend to ensure co ordinate care close to home but in patricia case it have fail profoundly since become involve in july have observe pattern of miscommunication delay and systemic neglect my attempt to engage with professional at the cambridge and peterborough foundation trust which provide local eat disorder service be initially refer to lawyer and the communication relationship between patricia her family and care provider be all but break meanwhile there appear to be no overall co ordination of or plan for patricia care this summer patricia stabilise medically during long admission at norfolk and norwich hospital she be promise an assessment for referral to sedu but face prolonged delay only to be reject for admission she be devastate yet resolve to continue to seek help at the time accept that it might simply be the case that patricia be not medically stable despite that be at odd with what her clinician at the hospital be say national nhs guidance require coordinate care and effort to reduce and prevent gap during service transition yet patricia transition between service have be anything but co ordinate crucially she have be deny care base on her disability and mobility need in meeting with those involve in her care seek close collaboration between acute and mental health trust patient centre care plan dedicated caseworker and the appointment of an external specialist instead the response be share email inbox hardly the co ordinate expert oversight require patricia eat disorder be not treatment resistant or untreatable as some have claim these term lack empirical basis and perpetuate stigma yet patricia have be judge for behaviour symptomatic of her condition at one point her care team remove she from sedu waiting list after she confess to such behaviour this stigmatise approach be unacceptable patricia complex need include autism and pathological demand avoidance require an integrated approach some of the thing that and other have advocate for she to receive have be deny other be take very long time to materialise understand that external psychiatrist be no long invite to the weekly meeting about her care instead the same individual who seem to have give up on she also advise the integrate care board create troubling conflict of interest the collaborative care model appear to have fail she and concern raise by other professional have be ignore that lead to request nhs england intervention disturbingly learn that patricia court ruling which prevent force treatment be be use to justify withhold all care unless she comply with rigid unattainable demand that ultimatum our way or the highway be unethical and counterproductive particularly for someone with autism and pda far patricia care documentation reveal fatalistic approach that misrepresent her condition effectively ensure rejection from sedu believe this be systemic issue reflect the toxic ideology in certain part of the eat disorder treatment system that some patient be untreatable and should not be treat this ideology detail in controversial article in the royal college of psychiatrists newsletter have no basis in evidence yet it appear to influence patricia care she be sadly not alone in face that eat disorder have the high mortality rate of any mental illness yet patricia have be systematically exclude from lifesave treatment nhs guidance have be repeatedly breach cpft reject external opinion and even offer of eat disorder specialist therapy support within the hospital setting patricia need stable specialist placement with integrate medical and mental health treatment yet she remain trap in cycle design believe to have her fail clinician who find themselves believe that there be nothing that can or should be do in case should step aside from any role in it not preside over it difference of opinion be essential to develop area of healthcare but they should be support by supervision and challenge not be encampment of ideology characteristically patricia refuse to die urge the house to support direct nhs england commission of sedu placement for she bypass cpft and its affiliate her case need proper second opinion and we need support for setting that be be ask to consider admit she the case will then need very careful handle to ensure her consent and participation but believe that can be achieve patricia experience be stark reminder of the injustice face by vulnerable individual in system that should protect they her story echo other national scandal where institutional neglect have cause immense harm be speak today because patricia her family and be at our wit end she have huge amount of value to offer the world she be at desperate stage of her illness yet she refuse to give up treatment be her only chance and we must not abandon she she will continue her fight her family will continue to fight and will be by their side every step of the way but the nhs must act urgently to hold its service accountable ensure adherence to guideline and provide the care that patricia and countless other deserve rise before call the next speaker

loneliness few week ago hold up surgery at the salvation army food bank citizens advice be there to provide financial support to those in need be able to provide financial advice and give support to

constituent woodbridge be one of the many beautiful market town in my constituency that tourist flock to and just the other week it be vote the happy place in the country in which to live as someone who live in woodbridge wholeheartedly and unapologetically agree however whenever talk about the beauty of suffolk coastal feel desperate need to talk about the other side of the constituency as well and edward story be real reminder of that fear that many people do not see the poverty or the struggle face so many people in my constituency in suffolk coastal we have of child on free school meal but in southwold the place that the tourist coo over we have and in just one primary school in southwold one in two child receive it we have food bank in every single town in my constituency and they

some of our amazing food bank and it do not stop there as you can imagine madam deputy speaker order the hon lady time be up believe that the government should be hold debate on the uk wide impact of the closure of the port of holyhead although port in wales be matter for the welsh government international trade be matter reserve to the uk government and holyhead strategic location be key to the uk economy westminster can not ignore this issue the port sustain serious damage in the aftermath of storm darragh and all sailing have be cancel until january at the very early the storm bring gust of up to mph and cause enormous disruption to the port which provide the main sea route between north wales and ireland and be the uk second busy roll on roll off port its closure just before christmas have have direct impact on livelihood and business on the island the sudden ending of freight traffic mean that business have see their work vanish overnight this be push local business to breaking point the owner of royalty recruitment family run business tell that they have have to let brand new staff member go three of whom have only recently join they holyhead truck service be another local business that have be affect it have see its work dry up completely as of its annual income be from mechanical work for irish company this time of the year would usually be the busy period for these business but now they be face huge job cut and reduce demand owe to the closure of the port the sudden loss of income be unsustainable for many business and job loss will push family into financial hardship leave they struggle to pay their bill in statement early this week the secretary of state for wales do not announce any direct support from the uk government to address the crisis be certain that if we be talk about the port of dover or an airport in london be close for at least whole month there would be huge effort to get the site open again and to support the thousand of supply chain job affect but so far holyhead have be treat as an afterthought the uk government must recognise the huge impact that the closure of the port will have not only on trade give that total uk export to ireland amount to billion and that ireland be the uk third large export partner but on the livelihood of the people of ynys môn and north wales they should set up hardship fund to support business and family directly affect by the closure as well as those involve in the supply chain the funding should be direct towards the council and third sector organisation that be well place to offer financial and other support to those struggle the port operator say that the early the port may open be january however that be with weather permit and fear that more cold and stormy weather at this time of year will push the date back once the port reopen the damage do to the local economy will take time to heal decisive action by both the uk and welsh governments be need to minimise the damage and the suffering that people will be feel as climate change fuel more violent storm the port of holyhead will be vulnerable to closure again the chair of the welsh affairs committee the hon member for newport west and islwyn ruth jones have join my call for support for business she write to the secretary of state for business and trade yesterday to seek an update on the support that the uk government be provide to get the port back up and run and to all business and employee impact by the closure the government must step up and provide the emergency funding need to

baby in the manger the christ on the cross be the king of glory be thankful that this remind of the hope that have when hold fast to he as we consider the christmas story we must remember that it do not end with the gift of the three king with miracle at wedding or with cross on hill it be an unfold story in which right hon and hon member have part to play we can all choose to bring light and hope in world of despair find that there be still goodness all around we think the goodness of god be see through the goodness of people around we when think about all the good work carry out by the volunteer the church and the charitable sector and when see the goodness of community group and neighbour be remind that people be still good when read of those act of kindness to stranger think of what it say in the good book if we entertain stranger we could be entertain an angel who know who we will meet in this world when we do something good for stranger in his introduction to the debate the hon member for harrow east bob blackman refer to help those homeless people on the street again that remind that people be still good there be still desire to help other and god still move in

ireland wish you all very happy christmas and bless new year it be with hope in my heart that trust that we will all see the goodness of god through the goodness of the people we meet in will use my time in this debate to raise an issue that we have hear so much about over the last six month the crisis in special educational need two week ago have the privilege of visit coffee morning hold by family voice in my constituency of guildford be honour to hear some story from group of mum who share their experience relate to their child journey and try to get support for those young people every single one of they stress to how challenge those journey have be with email go unanswered caseworker who go on holiday and never come back month sometimes year of their child not be able to attend education thousand of pound spend on private assessment to get the support that their child need or appeal decision make by the local authority and fight every day to be hear and the exhaustion that that bring the thing that distress most be the moment when one mum share that as result of the whole process she have consider suicide then another mum say the same thing how be we in position that the process that be design to support and provide for young people be create so much distress that family be at break point and even consider end their own life be deeply grateful to education ministers for make it very clear that the government be commit to address the send crisis and hope to be able to work with the government to address it in will tell the house two very quick story to emphasise how desperately the situation need to change the first be that of year old woman in my constituency who have be out of school for five and half year she be not able to do her gcse she be give placement in october at place where she have thrive she have say herself that she have feel see and have find her community but that placement have not yet be renew by the local authority she have be fail and the hope that be there have potentially be rip away the second story be that of nine year old boy with autism and pathological demand avoidance the local authority surrey send he to an independent school in to provide for his need that school have now say that it can not provide for those need it have remove his placement and say that it will not hold the place while his family try to find school find that deeply unacceptable they be apparently not the only family who have experience that off roll but surrey say that the family have elect to home school will the minister ask colleague to meet to discuss the practice of off rolling which be sure be happen not just in my own constituency reiterate that so many of we will have receive deeply distressing email seek support from our resident these be the people who be able to advocate for themselves how many family be unable for various reason to advocate for themselves as we try to fix the send crisis we must remember that we do so not just for the family we hear from every day in our inboxe at the moment have nearly separate case but we be also seek to fix the crisis for those family we do not know about hope that we will be able to work across the house in to fix this crisis because we can not and must not continue to allow our child to be fail wish very happy christmas to you madam deputy speaker and to all the staff of the house of commons for the work they do to support all of we also thank all the people who work so hard in my constituency in series of community centre school and other place and all those who help support and work in the food bank in my constituency feel sad that food bank have now become institutionalised within our society fifteen year ago there be almost no food bank now they be all over the country we need to look at the problem of inequality and poverty in our society feel sad that over the past five month in this parliament since the general election we have miss opportunity to end the two child benefit cap and to reduce level of poverty among many old people in fact we have make it bad by end the winter fuel allowance we have allow royal mail to be run by yet another private sector operator which will take profit out of it rather than bring it into public ownership to ensure that the people of this country benefit from our old public service when the house return in january the issue of the water industry will have to be address water company across the country be pay their chief executive officer the most massive salary imaginable and take out huge profit which be often pay to overseas investor in our industry and we have catastrophic level of pollution in our river and sea the water company for my area thames water the most indebted such company around expect to put up bill even high to pay for infrastructure which it could have pay for itself have it not be pay so much money to private investor all over the world the case for public ownership of water be absolutely overwhelming want quickly to mention some other issue in the last couple of minute have our society be precious and valuable but in the past year we have see the rise of racism in our society and culture of blame migrant and refugee for the problem people face in housing education and health it be nothing to do with they those problem be the result of lack of investment in those service can we resolve over christmas to have respect for those people who be try to make safe place to live and contribute to our society rather than this culture of blame migrant and people who have come from calais merely because they be try to survive in difficult world beset by war and conflict that would help great deal my constituent be wonderful people but many have the most appalling housing problem to deal with there be the street homeless who be help by various organisation include the local authority and do not blame they for the problem at all there be those live in the grotesquely overpriced private rent sector those live in increasingly undemocratically run housing association and those live in lease property where they pay exorbitant charge for ground rent and service and have little control over their own life appreciate what the government have bring forward in the renters rights bill welcome it as far as it go but we need to have furth deep think about housing as right and as something that people need and not the exorbitant cost at present with that wish you very happy christmas madam deputy speaker this week mark the end of disability

strategic thinker many of whom be deliver daily lifesave intervention and deserve to be equal partner in any conversation with the government and the nhs the work of the third sector can not be overstate but charity be now at break point for too long they have be ask to do more for less the third sector applaud well wage for all but urge the government to reconsider its non exemption from national insurance increase know that banes have survey its member charity in bath and north east somerset and those affect by the budget will need to find between and in extra cost every year those be big amount of money for organisation that already have to survive on dwindle resource so urge the government to consider the pressure that they will put on the third sector include hospice if they

thank you to kelly and jackie in the hairdresser downstairs question put and agree to resolve that this house have consider matter to be raise before the forthcoming adjournment mv ruby safety motion make and question propose that this house do now smith the mv ruby be sorry tale of bad decision making by government and selection of unaccountable unelecte quango operate in silos without any application of common sense it exemplify the loss of sovereignty of parliament which should be absolute under the bill of rights which assert the right of parliament and individual right base on john locke philosophy the outcome be shocking and avoidable double act of environmental terrorism when around tonne of ammonium nitrate well know as agricultural fertiliser be dump in the sea about mile off the coast of my constituency when fill my drill or fertiliser spinner with fertiliser discharge the content of the double skinned weatherproof plastic bag into the hopper and recycle the bag in this case the bag be dump into the sea with the ammonium nitrate still in they they will not biodegrade and will float to the surface after storm potentially become wrap around ship propeller and shaft cause extensive damage not forget the vast ecological damage to young fish the seabed and the inevitable algal bloom that will follow to make matter bad as the elect representative of the good people of great yarmouth be exclude from all communication and decision making lead up to the catastrophic dumping operation on november motion lapse standing order no motion make and question propose that this house do now smith apart from the terrible outcome the government account of event conflict entirely with the local account of event the local claim that the department for transport secretary of state representative drive the process and give instruction for the sit mp to be exclude from all communication convince that it be cobra situation when finally brief on november by the under secretary of state for transport the hon member for wythenshawe and sale east mike kane at the department office he state that the local have make mountain out of molehill the operation be never cobra and the decision to exclude the mp from briefing be local one somebody be clearly lie and the official briefing pack from the dft suggest that this be the government the hon gentleman tell in an email that he be too busy to see to answer follow up question and suggest that pursue usual parliamentary process so here we be be grateful to mr speaker for grant this debate which seek to inform the house where the truth lie the crux of the issue be the part play by the health and safety executive and its employee dr nathan flood mv ruby dock in the outer harbour of great yarmouth follow input from the secretary of state representative on october as ship in distress carry tonne of ammonium nitrate peel ports be use to handle this material which be commonly land at port distribute by road store on farm and use to grow our food peel ports notify the requisite authority include the hse which decline to inspect the ship cargo peel ports begin offload the bag of ammonium nitrate on to the sister ship zimrida on november peel ports identify seawater in hold one and some stain on the low bag peel ports notify the hse dr flood and again request its attendance to inspect the bag and the material hse refuse to attend and inspect peel ports send they photograph and video of the cargo in hold one peel ports employ its own explosive expert dr jim warren and dr charles owen to attend and inspect the cargo they report that they could wipe the staining off the bag conclude that it be unlikely the bag be contaminate peel ports again request hse attendance which be refuse peel ports view be that it could safely unload the stained bag the ship have previously carry cargo of coal on to the dock for analysis and disposal hse threaten sanction and enforcement action against peel ports if one bag be unload on to the dock understand that legal responsibility for the material pass from the maritime and coastguard agency to hse once unload it be also interesting that norfolk fire and rescue service attend mv ruby at this time on either or november and downgrade the situation dr flood attitude be report by many of the stakeholder to be aggressive inappropriate and unprofessional with the use of foul language and even bang his fist on the table and tell people this be go to flatten great yarmouth analogy to the beirut explosion be wholly inappropriate and misleading cause panic among both local and national government who have no experience of handle ammonium nitrate it be incredible that he do that without either site visit or proper physical analysis of the material before the dumping be he too lazy to do what common sense suggest be the correct cause of action dr flood only attend the site and inspect small number of remain split bag of material on monday november after be instruct to attend by minister understand that he put on new pair of rubber glove which he thrust into the ammonium nitrate and then throw the glove on to the table claim they smell of diesel other people report that they understandably smell of new rubber this be also after the gross act of environmental terrorism to carry out no inspection before dump be quite extraordinary this kind of behaviour be not uncommon from the hse which be law unto itself clearly employ policy of do as say not as do the question be who regulate the regulator when we understand that the hse be part of the department for work and pensions no further explanation be necessary or indeed possible we now find that the marine management organisation the mca the environment agency the department for environment food and rural affairs and the hse all blame the dumping on the ship captain all other possible sensible option be block but do this silence make they complicit in this catastrophe conclude that it do congratulate the hon gentleman on secure debate on this topic which have cause great concern to resident of our neighbouring constituency in this case there appear to have be total information vacuum for local people and representative which have fuel fear and speculation number of my constituent have contact ask simply what be go on do the hon gentleman agree that in the event of such situation in the future it will be important for all relevant agency to provide far more clarity and transparency for resident and their elect representative could not agree more good government must be transparent government hope that the minister have his pencil ready because have urgent question for which believe the house need answer no why do the minister tell on thursday november that this be local issue no why do the local official think that this be cobra situation when the minister say categorically that it be not no why do the minister suggest that local official have make mountain out of molehill the local say it be all drive by the department for transport and the secretary of state representative for maritime salvage and intervention who be lie no who give the instruction that the local mp be not to be brief except by the department for transport be that because be reform mp or because have experience of ammonium nitrate from farming what be the role and report of andy gregory stephen benzies and stephan hennig no be the right hon member for sheffield heeley louise haigh involve in the decision making no be the resignation of the right hon member for sheffield heeley on friday november in any way link to the unjustifiable outcome involve the dumping of approximately tonne of potentially contaminate ammonium nitrate with bag be it coincidence that it happen less than hour after my briefing by the department for transport no why be the load describe as potentially contaminate be it physically test before the dumping be there certificate to prove that no why be the polypropylene double skin waterproof bag dump with the ammonium nitrate when use in farming such bag be empty and recycle no do anyone consider that polypropylene bag float to the surface and damage or destroy ship propeller and propeller shaft apart from this be an act of environmental vandalism no why be the view of those at peel ports expert at handle ammonium nitrate not act upon they claim that the double skin waterproof bag at the bottom be stain but dry they suggest unload the dump material on to the dock for analysis and disposal be it true that it become the responsibility of the hse once on land picture that be obtain back up peel ports opinion no why do the hse throw its weight around and threaten peel ports with prosecution enforcement if one bag be unload on the dock no why be local fisherman local fish market and dutch fishing vessel not inform of the decision to dump offshore in my constituency no how close do great yarmouth come to evacuation why be that information withhold from the elect representative of great yarmouth who know what and when no be the balance of the cargo safely unload by peel ports no be it fair to say that the owner and operator of mv ruby be force into the decision to dump ammonium nitrate in bag at sea no who sign off on this gross act of environmental terrorism without test certificate how can this have happen no why do both the harbourmaster and peel ports agree that this matter be not handle well and that there be the wrong outcome no do this house agree that the government be right to exclude an elect member of parliament by diktat thereby undermine parliament and show disrespect for the good people of great yarmouth as chesterton observe society be in decay final or transitional when common sense really become uncommon this sorry episode lack any common sense and result in bad decision by unelected unaccountable quango act in silos we now need an official parliamentary inquiry which strongly request have research the matter in great depth it must not happen again and the appropriate head must roll on that note madam deputy speaker may wish you all the parliamentary staff and all my fellow mps very happy christmas well madam deputy speaker it be the season of good will first and foremost want to say that be proud of this nation think be prouder of this nation than the hon gentleman be the united kingdom have proud seafaring heritage and we be the home of the international maritime organisation we uphold the rule of law in this country and we treat seafarer with respect and dignity we fulfil our legal obligation and we proud to be pioneer in the maritime industry these principle inform how we handle this situation the mv ruby leave great yarmouth on december with no cargo onboard and be now at the port of tyne where she be undergo repair the ship leave great yarmouth with uncontaminated cargo on december for onward voyage to the ruby original intend destination throughout this situation my department and other authority exercise their duty for the safety of the uk and its population and for that of the ship and her crew stand by all the decision and action that we take and note that everything have be resolve successfully we be always confident that that would be the case will briefly set out the background the mv ruby be maltese flagged vessel that be damage during storm on august not long after leave port in northern russia the vessel enter uk water on september under international legal provision that allow for the right of innocent passage through territorial water she go to anchor in order to refuel but at anchor she pose number of potential risk to uk interest namely the safety of navigation for other vessel we be also worried about the safety of the crew their welfare and the safety of the ship there be no sanction issue in relation to the ship her crew or her cargo and she be insure by lloyd of london which be internationally regard as have the high standard for its client and strong requirement for the insurance company that conduct business there the vessel be class certify by det norske veritas which be one of the world renowne classification society within the international association of classification societies that demonstrate to we that the vessel be operate well within the recommend industry guideline before enter the port of great yarmouth the ruby have be at anchor for month the ship be damage and the crew be struggle to get basic supply at this point medium reporting focus on the perceive russian connection of the ruby as her origin port be in russia this make potential supplier fear russian exposure and reputational damage which far impact the quality of life on board beyond this humanitarian aspect the extent of the damage to the hull be unknown and the practical and environmental consequence of the vessel sink in uk water with all her cargo and fuel on board would have be unthinkable give all this and where safety requirement be meet there be no reason to deny access to port the secretary of state representative for maritime salvage and intervention sosrep support the ship management company in convene conversation with uk port to identify an appropriate port for the offloading of this cargo type and yard where she could then be repair the ship management company make commercial decision to enter uk port for repair this be because the condition in the bay of biscay which the vessel would have have to traverse can be extremely rough at this time of year the crew of on board have already suffer through the original storm and subsequent week on board damage ship offer her refuge in port help to manage all these risk and at that point there be no indication of concern about her cargo ammonium nitrate for bit of background be compound typically use in fertiliser that the uk regularly import in over tonne of ammonium nitrate be handle at uk port and the port of great yarmouth be one of the many port experience in handle this type of cargo once at port the cargo be safely offload for several day before any potential contamination be identify the health and safety executive be alert to the potential contamination on monday november as the port identify evidence of seawater and hydrocarbon fuel oil on the outside of the bag when it be identify that seawater and hydrocarbon be present on the outside of some of the remain bag all movement of cargo in the affected hold be stop and the relevant authority be notify hse undertake risk assessment and its finding be action by the port and the ship operator the port harbourmaster make the decision to issue direction under the harbours docks and piers clauses act follow the guidance provide by the hse at cross agency meeting and classify the vessel as dangerous ship sosrep be engage and work with the ship the port the mca and the hse to ensure that the ship and the crew be safely remove from port the ship be remove from port on saturday november and the affected cargo be discharge at pre identify location at sea the master of the ship take the view that in the light of deteriorate condition at sea and the unacceptable risk to the crew of the potentially contaminate material remain on board as the sea become rougher due to the incoming weather front disposal should commence that evening the cargo believe to be contaminate represent under of the total volume be transport discharge the potentially contaminate cargo at sea about metric tonne be not an exercise undertake lightly as would be expect there be careful and thorough examination of all the alternative option full assessment of the environmental implication and safety risk be also undertake the work be oversee by environmental expert and the relevant regulator the east of england environment group be convene for the purpose of this incident and be comprise of expert from the food standards agency the joint nature conservation committee the local authority the marine management organisation the centre for environment fisheries and aquaculture science natural england the environment agency and the inshore fishery and conservation authority the location choose for disposal be identify as the least sensitive in term of habitat flora fauna and fishery the site be an exist aggregate extraction area involve mechanical activity on the seabed we have be assure by scientific expert from both the department for environment food and rural affairs and the east of england environment group that ammonium nitrate be not persistent chemical and with sufficient dilution will dissipate without leave trace as would be expect defra be now go through the standard procedure of notify the relevant international authority of the discharge event as the british government treat our duty to the natural environment with the high seriousness where safety requirement be meet there be no basis for the uk government to refuse entry into port in those circumstance after the potentially contaminate cargo have be discharge the port and ship operator follow the usual process to enable the mv ruby to return to great yarmouth with advice from the mca hse and environmental regulator allow the ship to return ensure crew welfare and enable the normal transfer of its remain cargo must emphasise that there be no evidence that any of the remain cargo be potentially contaminate and this be bear out by event no further contamination be find if there be no potential contamination and if all the process be fully follow as the minister be indicate then presumably the government will have no problem ensure that all that documentation be make available and public in transparent and open way so that we can have no doubt about that and any lesson that need to be learn will be learn thank the hon gentleman for his intervention and wish he happy christmas as well we share the same dry cleaner mr george who regularly ask after the hon gentleman say to reform members that the way this matter be be raise be playbook assertion which be often outlandish or simply wrong be make that be design to appeal to malcontent victimisation come in that playbook because they habitually cast themselves as the victim of dark force conspiracy and cover up always want to know where and when and to have transparency they expect other to accept the premise of their question but then belittle the official and worker who have work extraordinarily hard often in difficult circumstance in our sea by belittle those official and worker reform members be try to make people believe those official be wrong and they be right think there should be little bit more dignity in the approach take by reform members in this matter have have correspondence with official at norfolk county council and great yarmouth borough council as well as the hon member for great yarmouth rupert lowe and the hon member for north norfolk steff aquarone who be no long in his place would like to offer my personal gratitude and thank to the official at the health and safety executive the maritime and coastguard agency and peel ports in great yarmouth for their co operation and diligent work throughout the period also thank the captain and the crew of the ship for their co operation during this episode be pleased that by follow the expert advice this episode have conclude safely and successfully our port and the man and woman who work in they be invaluable asset to our nation but we can all be guilty of fail to fully recognise the vital role they play in the life of our island nation would like this debate to record the respect and gratitude this house have for they and their work our christmases will be lot merry thank to they all merry christmas to you madam deputy speaker the staff and the house and blessed new year as well question put and agree to house adjourn
