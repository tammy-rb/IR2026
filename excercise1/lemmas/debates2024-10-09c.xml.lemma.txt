environment match the ambition of film maker and studio around the world we want they to invest in great british film making however the key to maintain that advantage be an internationally competitive tax regime and think that be beyond party politic as member will know tax incentive for film be first introduce by the last labour government in and the previous conservative government follow suit with the announcement of plan uk independent film tax credit in the last spring budget we have hear loud and clear the industry concern that any further delay to introduce this secondary legislation even to the end of the month may mean that investment in uk independent film be lose so be glad to announce that we have today lay the necessary statutory instrument under the negative process for the independent film tax credit to take effect it mean that eligible film with budget of up to million can claim enhance audiovisual expenditure credit at rate of on their qualifying expenditure up to million that be high than the standard rate for other film the regulation set out the eligibility criterion for film production company who can apply from october this government do not underestimate how important this tax credit be big blockbuster movie be an important part of the mix but independent film be every bit as important both for the british talent that they allow to shine and for the untold story that they bring into the spotlight too often people do not see themselves and their community reflect in the story we tell ourselves about ourselves as nation and this government be determined that will change later today the london film festival will open with the world premiere of blitz write direct and produce by one of our most successful british director steve mcqueen set in england during world war two it be an example of exactly what film can do it bring together top talent on screen and off and it showcase the nation history through storytelling and highlight on screen our beautiful country from london east end to hull old town our independent sector have produce film such as pride the king speech and bend it like beckham which show our heritage our community and our culture to the world and act as springboard from the grassroot for world class uk talent on screen and behind the scene while major film production have flourish small budget independent film have not receive sufficient support over the past decade they face multiple challenge include rise production cost crew shortage and decline revenue which have hamper the growth of this vital sector while too much of our creative industry have traditionally be concentrate in just one part of our country independent film thrive everywhere give the chance this uplift will not only

competitiveness of our creative industry on the global stage be welcome and should receive cross party support the hon lady mention the fact that the conservative government bring in this independent film tax credit at the last budget if that be true we would not be need to legislate today the truth be that the conservative government do what the conservative government do for year they talk good game and then do absolutely nothing to deliver for the people of this country she say that we vote against film tax credit but the truth as she well know be that we do not vote against they they be our idea and our initiative in in fact it be her party that oppose they in the first place if they have have their way in our british film industry would not be where it be today which be rival hollywood as one of the good film industry in the world she know full well that we support every one of the measure that after year of oppose they they have to be drag kick and scream by the film
