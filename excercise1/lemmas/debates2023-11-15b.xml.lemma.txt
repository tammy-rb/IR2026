permission mr speaker would like to make statement on the government plan for end illegal immigration the supreme court have today uphold the judgment of the court of appeal mean that we can not yet lawfully remove people to rwanda the important thing to note be that today judgment be make on the basis of fact from month ago the government of course fully respect the supreme court but its judgment do not weaken our resolve to deter people from make these illegal dangerous and unnecessary journey this be lengthy judgment that we now need to digest and reflect upon we take our obligation to the court very seriously which be why we have already take action to address number of point raise by the low court it be only through break the business model of illegal people trafficker that we can fully take control of our border and save life at sea this be why the prime minister back our deal with rwanda pass legislation to deliver it and say last december that other country would follow our lead we have now see that other country be indeed also explore third country model to address illegal immigration include austria germany and denmark italy deal with albania be new and innovative model for process asylum claim nothing in today supreme court judgment dim our commitment the supreme court say there be issue with rwanda asylum system that could create the possibility of someone be return to country where they could face persecution be strike by the court remark about the risk of refoulement the structural change and capacity building need to eliminate that risk may be deliver in the future but they be not show to be in place at the time when the lawfulness of the policy have to be consider in these proceeding the judgment be make reference to the early proceeding we have plan to provide exactly that certainty we anticipate this judgment as possible result and for the last few month have be work on plan to provide the certainty that the court demand we have be work with rwanda to build capacity and to amend our agreement to make it clear that those send there can not be send to any country other than the uk our intention be to upgrade our agreement to treaty as soon as possible which will make it absolutely clear to our court and to strasbourg that the risk lay out by the court today have be respond to will be consistent with international law and will ensure that parliament be able to scrutinise it the prime minister have say that if our domestic legal framework frustrate our plan he be prepared to change our law but we be not go to put forward proposal simply to manufacture an unnecessary row for political gain we have plan to deliver the rwanda opposition member be not listen but they might want to listen to this we have plan to deliver the rwanda deal and we will do whatever it take to stop the boat illegal immigration be huge global challenge and that challenge be grow it be topic that regularly raise with country across europe and around the wide world in my former role as foreign secretary across europe monthly illegal migrant number be trend upwards with an exception our number be fall illegal immigration be dangerous it undermine the law of our country and it be unfair on those who come here legally and on the british people who play by the rule it must and it will stop this wonderful country recognise that because have just have the chance to see it as other see it from overseas inevitably people aspire to come here but more people come here illegally be not fair on those struggle to get gp appointment housing or access to school or on those people live near to asylum hotel the impact be feel by some of the poor in our society and we have duty to address their concern while the conservative government have take action to protect our country the labour party have vote time and again more than time not to protect our border rwanda be ready and willing to help the united nations high commissioner for refugees operate its own refugee scheme in rwanda rwanda be ready to receive thousand of people process their claim give they excellent care and then support they to integrate in rwanda this be an african country full of potential and promise we have future focused mutually beneficial partnership with it and we have plan to deliver it the rwanda plan have only ever be one tool in our toolbox we have plan to drive down number and our plan be work before the prime minister launch his point plan last december the number of people enter the uk illegally in small boat have more than quadruple but while illegal migration in the rest of europe continue to rise crossing to the uk be now down by third we be tackle illegal immigration at every stage of the journey of would be illegal migrant and our plan be work last year the prime minister sign the large ever small boat deal with france we have expand our joint intelligence cell to deepen intelligence sharing and dismantle the criminal gang cut edge surveillance technology be in play and we have beef up security infrastructure such as more cctv at key border crossing point along the channel we have ensure that more french official and officer patrol french beach and they be work closely with uk staff so far in nearly crossing attempt have be prevent because of the close co ordination between british and french official that mean less money that the british taxpayer have to spend on hotel less profit for the criminal gang and few people to process it send clear message to the gang and to those who want to cross that we will stop they as foreign secretary work closely with my right hon friend the immigration minister to agree new deal with albania with well datum sharing close operational working and financial support in response to the work that he and do the number of albanian small boat arrival have fall by repeat that figure of far during and we have return more than people in just month we want to ensure that it be hard to get into one of those boat in the first place include by reduce the supply of boat we be target the movement of those good such as dinghy and engine that be use to facilitate the crossing in order to undermine key component of the smuggler business model those who do make it through will not be able to stay we have expedite return arrangement with country include france albania turkey and italy we have increase the number of illegal work raid by almost we have cut the asylum legacy backlog by more than case we have free up hundred of hotel bed with the use of alternative site we have announce the closure of the first asylum hotel and we have pass the illegal migration act the most ambitious immigration legislation in decade which make clear that the only route to asylum in the uk be via one of the safe and legal route we have put in place anyone who come to the uk illegally will not be able to stay they will be remove either to their home country if it be safe or to safe third country if it be not mr speaker can assure you that our commitment to end illegal immigration be unwavering we be positive outlier in europe our effort be work small boat crossing be down our decision making be fast we be remove those with no right to be here and take action against those who be work illegally we have do deal with multiple country and will continue to do so arrival down decision fast return up we be get on with the job and will do whatever it take to deliver on our commitment to stop the boat commend this statement to the house call the shadow home secretary welcome the new home secretary to his post he be the eighth conservative home secretary in eight year and what mess he have inherit the supreme court conclusion today be damn it expose the complete failure of the prime minister flagship rwanda policy of his judgment in make it the central part of his policy and of the conservatives in get the most basic grip on the boat and asylum chaos there be no serious plan on the dangerous boat crossing that be undermine our border security and put life at risk the end of which we all want to see there be no serious plan to sort out the chaos in the asylum system include end place people in costly asylum hotel because of the soar backlog there be readiness to spend more than million of taxpayer money on this plan money we can not get back now that the policy have totally fail that add to the prime minister disastrous judgment in appoint and back the previous home secretary who be unfit for the job do not agree with pretty much anything the home secretary predecessor ever say but she be right in this message to the prime minister if we lose in the supreme court you will have waste year and an act of parliament only to arrive back at square one your magical thinking have mean you have fail to prepare any sort of credible plan waste time waste money and let the country down that be the conservatives record the supreme court judgment outline catalogue of problem with the policy but ministers know all about they when it be first announce month ago raise in the house the problem with the israel rwanda deal minister be warn many time about failure and weakness in the rwanda asylum system but they just press on even if the plan have be find lawful today they have admit it would have cover only few hundred people anyway at time when people apply for asylum in the uk last year on the conservative watch and that it would have cost about twice as much per person as decide case in the uk the truth be the government have waste not just one but five year by fail to deal with the situation five year ago there be just few hundred people cross in boat but they let criminal gang take hold along the channel they let asylum decision collapse so the backlog soar and there be now more people in asylum hotel than there be when the prime minister promise to end that will the home secretary tell we how much in total the government have spend on the fail rwanda plan so far the house have right to know he say he want new treaty how much more will that cost despite his optimism the supreme court judgment say the rwandan government indicate that the contemplated arrangement might not be straightforward to implement in practice the provision of resource do not mean that the problem which we have describe can be resolve in the short term again we have more of the magical thinking what do this mean for the prime minister flagship legislation he boast about pass it only yesterday but the government have not actually commence the central clause of the law because without rwanda and frankly even with rwanda the policy do not work and will just lead to an endless ever increase permanent backlog will the secretary of state confirm now that he will not be implement the central tenet of that law this year will he also confirm that this mean that the prime minister pledge to introduce the new law to stop the boat and end hotel use will all be break this year why will the home secretary not put that money into proper plan to tackle the boat do not believe that he ever believe in the rwanda plan he distance himself from it and his predecessor language on it he may even on occasion have privately call it batshit but he and agree that we need action to stop the boat crossing that be undermine border security and put life at risk we need properly control and manage system for asylum and refugee let we concentrate instead on the thing that can work we support the work with france along the northern coast we want it to go far we support the work with albania and with other country across europe to tackle the gang but it be far far too weak we need proper comprehensive and massively scale up plan to go after the criminal gang proper system to clear the backlog and proper return unit in place so that we can end hotel use instead of that cost go up from million to million day on his watch let we end hotel use and save the taxpayer billion that should be common ground so suggest that he stop waste taxpayer money on more fail scheme that he ditch the magical thinking and the culture war of his predecessor and that he ditch the gimmick and finally get grip one of the danger of write critique of government policy before read the fact lay out in statement be that the statement make the critique obsolete the right hon lady talk about hotel usage which remind the house be come down she talk about small boat arrival in the uk which remind the house be come down she talk about form close working relationship with our european partner which remind the house we be already do in response to the right hon lady various question have write here do labour have plan interruption if those on the labour benches could curb their enthusiasm and listen to what be about to say next they would hear that be go to concede that it be clear that they do have plan their plan their great idea be to do what the government be already do which be buck the european trend when other country be see or increase in their illegal arrival we be see reduction of one third in ours buck the trend we have always say that rwanda and the deterrent effect of the rwanda plan be an important tool in our toolbox we have never claim that it be the only one we have always pursue range of option when say we mean my right hon friend the immigration minister with watch he from king charles street although the collective we be appropriate here and as set out in my statement those activity be have an effect my final point be that the mask have slip the glee that detect from those on the opposition benches for this temporary setback on the delivery of our plan display what we on the government benches know to be true they do not want migration control to work they do not want to take control of our border they would rather delegate it to anybody order want to hear the home secretary do not need those on the front you may pull face but the bottom line be that want some quiet to hear what be be say our constituent at home want to hear that as well but when you be chuntere so loudly they can not do so indeed mr speaker may welcome my right hon friend to his new position the home office be great department of state and hope that he enjoy his time there as much as enjoy my time as home secretary will he confirm that the judgment that the supreme court make today be not contingent on the european convention on human right indeed the fundamental judgment be make regardless of the echr pay tribute to my right hon friend and predecessor she be fantastic and long serve home secretary and intend to compete with she on both of those metric she make an incredibly important point we look closely at the judgment and find that it draw our attention to work that we can do work with our partner in rwanda to address the supreme court concern about people be return to unsafe country that be where we will address our focus because that will be the pathway to ensure that rwanda remain key element of our basket of response to illegal migration call the snp spokesperson we on the snp benches be very glad to see the unanimous decision of the supreme court today it really be quite ridiculous for the new home secretary to come to the house today to tell we that his predecessor dream will never die it have go give it up do something else instead before the extremist on his own benches start to blame the echr the supreme court judge lord reed be very clear that this be not just about the echr but about the refugee convention the un convention against torture and other cruel inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment and the international covenant on civil and political right as well as our own domestic legislation the supreme court make it clear that rwanda be not safe country at the heart of the judgment today be the principle of non refoulement which mean that people must not be send back into harm way the united nations high commissioner for refugees provide compelling evidence of rwanda do so even after it sign the memorandum of understanding with the uk as well as in its early deal with israel the unhcr point out that it have reject claim from country such as syria yemen and afghanistan it be absolutely ludicrous that those claim could be reject it also point to the lack of integrity in rwanda own system it be serious problem and one that the home secretary claim today that he want to fix but he should focus his intention instead on fix the multiple failing of his own department what now for the illegal migration act and for the people who will now be leave in immigration limbo without any recourse to claim asylum this incompetent tory government can not yeet they back to rwanda and they will not process their claim so what will happen to that group of people the solution lie not in puncture the market in rubber dinghy but in create function safe and legal route in the first half of the year the large group in small boat be afghans that be proof positive that the scheme that the government claim exist be just not work many people make these dangerous journey because they have no other option that remain the reality whoever the home secretary be so ask the right hon gentleman when he will stop waste public money chase fantasy at least million have be spend just on the legal challenge never mind the rest of this incompetent scheme when will he create system that treat the most vulnerable in the world with the dignity and respect that they be due to rebuild their life here in the uk the immigration minister have not even give glasgow mps the meeting that he promise to discuss the people that the government be about to make homeless through their bulk processing if the home secretary will not take seriously his responsibility on immigration and on refugee will he at least allow scotland to have the right to do so because we want to welcome people to our world on the hon lady final point if scotland or rather the scottish government not the scottish people want to be more generous in practical term to people seek refuge here they can do so in my experience they choose not to with regard to the work that we be do make clear in my statement the various work strand that we be do in close co operation with country around the world to address all element of the illegal migration pipeline include interrupt the logistic around this evil practice and it be work draw the hon lady attention to the fact that many other country around europe country that we have close working relationship with be see significant increase in their illegal arrival in stark contrast to the reduction we be see in the uk the hon lady talk about number of thing but ultimately be draw to the remark that the court make about refoulement the structural change and capacity building need to eliminate that risk may be deliver in the future that be exactly what we be seek to address welcome my right hon friend and essex neighbour to the great position of home secretary and wish he well in all his endeavour on this incredibly difficult issue he touch on the supreme court decision and its comment on refoulement today judgment be clear on that but the issue be not new it be raise early this year in the court of appeal if may say so ministers have the opportunity to address some of the practical measure prior to today judgment urge the home secretary to take every necessary step and measure to work with the government of rwanda on the practical operational delivery of the migration and economic development partnership to give all those assurance that partnership be clearly integral to ensure that we break the business model and stop the evil trade of people smuggle address that principle will go long way towards bring in this essential deterrent in the illegal migration battle my long stand friend and predecessor be absolutely right we will break the people smuggle gang we will undermine their business model we will pursue all the various workstream that my right hon friend will be familiar with from her time in this fantastic office in parallel just as she suggest we will work indeed we be already work to address the issue raise by judge in the low court to ensure that we can prove what they need to see which be that we will remove the risk of refoulement call the chair of the home affairs committee congratulate the right hon gentleman on his new role this morning at the home affairs committee david neal the independent chief inspector of border and immigration tell we that the big challenge face the home office be be professional maintain objectivity be fair and understand human right the inspector also say that what keep he up at night be the question of who be protect our border and whether they be do so to the good of our collective ability could the home secretary tell we whether today rule on rwanda prove or disprove mr neal concern the government be responsible for the protection of this country and it be role and responsibility that we take incredibly seriously it be the primary function of government in this statement and in the other statement intend to make and which ministers from the department will make from the dispatch box we will show the house and the country that conservative members take that responsibility incredibly seriously and we will take whatever action be necessary to ensure the protection of the people and the border of this country it would be helpful frankly if the labour party would break the habit seemingly of lifetime and once in while vote to support the action that we take as well as welcome my right hon friend most warmly to this post post in which his and my former london assembly constituent in bexley and bromley be massively proud to see he congratulate he on the tone and manner of his statement it be right that as rule of law abide country we respect the decision of the court however they go the supreme court be ask legal question and it give legal answer do he agree that it be clear that the decision be essentially fact specific apply to well establish legal principle and the solution be first to look at how those fact can be rectify to make this compliant my long stand friend and former south east london representative be absolutely right their lordship tell we what we need to do to address their concern we intend to do what they say need to be do we will address their concern operationalise this plan break the business model and stop the boat two per cent of those claim asylum in this country be people flee country where just be themselves can be death sentence do the home secretary agree with his predecessor that they be pretend if the right hon gentleman want to know my view on thing he can ask for my view on thing rather than ask to comment on other people view welcome the new home secretary to his place and share his disappointment at this morning judgment as we have hear the supreme court focus on the principle of non refoulement hopefully that can be address in new treaty perhaps it will be make more robust if we can work jointly with other european partner who have express an interest in rwanda type scheme why however be this not consider in the original rwanda treaty and which law officer be responsible for give legal advice to the home office about how it might stand up to challenge in the court my hon friend know that government legal advice be for inform the decision making of ministers it be not appropriate to discuss government legal advice at the dispatch box and we will not do so he know that we always prepare for range of eventuality as say in my statement we recognise that this be one of the decision that might come from the court we listen carefully to the statement make by the judge in the low court and we have already start to take action in response to the concern that they have raise too welcome the new home secretary to the dispatch box he have difficult job but it be in everyone interest that it be do well also welcome the part of his statement in which he say we be not go to put forward proposal simply to manufacture an unnecessary row for short term political gain that much at least will be refreshing change but he should be aware that his hon friend the member for ashfield lee anderson the deputy chairman of the conservative party be report as have tell itv that the prime minister should ignore the law follow the supreme court decision will the home secretary dissociate himself from those comment this country pride itself on be law abide country so to hear the government position on thing listen to the statement of government ministers have make it clear that we respect the judgment we listen carefully to the comment make by their lordship and the low court as say we be already respond to the comment that they make to ensure that the action we take when the rwanda scheme be operationalise be in strict accordance with international law will the home secretary explain to those of we who be not expert in this area why it be that people who arrive illegally on our shore from safe nearby country can not immediately be return to that safe nearby country clearly it would be in breach of certain law so can he set out perhaps in statement what those law might be receive country have to consent that be the nub of the issue that be why it be so important that ministers in the department particularly the immigration minister have spend so much time work with those country from which we have traditionally receive illegal migration include france and other most notably in term of the statistic albania with which we have develop an excellent work relationship will claim bit of credit here because my right hon friend the immigration minister and form something of tag team with the government in tirana and we be see the success that come from pragmatic but determined relationship with european partner and other pay tribute to the immigration minister for that work also warmly welcome the home secretary to his post not least because know people in the foreign office who be rather sad to see he go however let try this question again what do he think about the of people who claim asylum on the basis of their sexuality because they face massive persecution and death threat in their own country do he think they be pretend to be lesbian gay or bisexual if he do can he provide evidence for that the hon gentleman will know that we can not prove negative that be fallacy thank he for his kind word about my time as foreign secretary he will know since he clearly have mole inside my old organisation how passionately pursue the right of lgbt people around the world include have some very difficult conversation where necessary absolutely want to make sure that those people be protect but we should also recognise that bad people hide among good people and sometimes people lie to take advantage of the good will of other it be nonsense to suggest that everybody who claim to be suffer persecution because of their sexuality be lie and would certainly never say that but we need to ensure that people be not attempt to abuse the process as we do with any process or system because that limit our ability to help those who genuinely be in need recognise that lgbt people do face genuine persecution around the world and we want to support and help they much of the supreme court judgment today be encouraging with high court endorse yet again the principle of what we be look to do with rwanda as be touch on early much of the decision turn on the fact particularly those relate to refoulement that is the risk that those transfer to rwanda might be return to country where they would face persecution may test my right hon friend on what work he be do look at the decision make capability of the home office to help rwanda to build up its own decision make capability and how our judiciary might work with rwanda judiciary to address some of the supreme court point in that area pay tribute to my right hon mean to say my hon friend although he deserve to be my right hon friend know that he do lot of the work on this very subject and his question go to the heart of how we operationalise the rwanda plan their lordship set out exactly the point he raise about capacity building and professionalise rwanda system have have exchange this morning with my rwandan opposite number who have meet before the rwandans be keen to build and strengthen their institutional structure and they see we as key partner in achieve that together we will work to operationalise this plan pay tribute to my hon friend for the work he do on this very issue the supreme court judgment have put pay to the lazy ill inform argument that it be the european convention on human right and only the european convention on human right that be block this government on asylum and immigration this government have spend two year formulate policy that have prove incompatible with multitude of international treaty to which the uk be sign up and with numerous provision of our domestic law the supreme court be very clear about that my question for the home secretary be this when be he go to explain to his back benchers that the uk government response to this judgment must be to produce humane asylum policy that work not to try to overcome vital check and balance of the rule of law and human right law that stymie bad policy decision and protect human right our immigration policy as lay out in the figure run through in my statement be have the positive effect that we commit to we be bring down small boat number the need for hotel place and so on say in my statement that their lordship have set out the route to successfully operationalise the rwanda scheme through address those concern about refoulement we will focus on what we need to achieve to unlock that we recognise that this be constant battle against criminal and as with all constant battle against criminal we focus on what be effective and right their lordship set out exactly what that be and that be what we will focus on genuinely welcome my right hon friend to his place at the dispatch box speak softly and carry big stick be always very good way of behaving no reference intend fully agree with all his intention and the direction of travel in which he want to go to settle this issue in term of proper organisation such that concern be deal with in the court do he not agree that those who greet this judgment with glee need to remember that people be die in the channel try to cross in the boat will the home secretary ask our right hon and learn friend the attorney general to come to the dispatch box in due course to reflect on the judgment it appear to that it be much wide than the migration judgment because we be now link directly to applicability in uk law agreement that be make with the un that be never bind into uk law whether one want it or not that widen the whole issue of what become justiciable and would be grateful if she would come to the house at some point and deal with that thank my right hon friend for his kind word my focus in this role be make sure that the department be highly effective in protect the british people and protect our border this be not about try to look tough it be about try to deliver for the british people and that will be my relentless focus my right hon and learn friend the attorney general remind that her advice like that of all very good in house lawyer be limit to the client which be his majesty government however have no doubt could persuade she to meet my right hon friend on private basis welcome the home secretary to his new role be sure he would want to join in express gratitude to all those in our public service who come here as refugee and make such fantastic contribution to our country at the heart of this case be series of asylum seeker one of whom know have be confirm as victim of trafficking he have be stick in an asylum hotel since may as yet the government have not even begin to look at his claim for asylum can the home secretary tell we when his department will begin to process the claim of those people and get on with find out whether they be illegal asylum seeker or be he just go to continue with the charade that he can make rwanda workable do not have the detail of the individual case that the hon lady raise so can not comment on the specific but remind she and the house that as part of the prime minister point plan eliminate that historic backlog of case file be commitment at the start of this process the backlog stand at case it have now be reduce to few than few than so we be deliver on our commitment to work through that backlog of case it be one of the area where we make commitment we be deliver on it and we will pursue all the element of our plan rise order urge colleague to be brief in their question so that the home secretary can be brief in return we have very pack agenda today and want to make every effort to get everyone in add my congratulation to the home secretary on his new role it seem to that the key word be time we can not keep relitigate this question to achieve what seem an ever move target in what the court want we to achieve our constituent send we here with very clear message sort the small boat issue parliament have pass legislation to sort the issue can my right hon friend be specific about the point at which the attempt by the government to recondition the agreement with rwanda into treaty form will have elapse and notwithstanding clause of the kind that my hon friend the member for harborough neil have set out will become the only tool by which we can ensure that the will of this house take effect we can not allow this cycle to continue indefinitely order remind the house that do just say be brief listen carefully to my right hon friend comment we be absolutely determined to maintain the deterrent effect of the rwanda scheme to an extent it be already demonstrate utility by the fact that we know anecdotally so will not over interpret these figure that the fear of it as part of our arsenal be already have deterrent effect which be exactly what it be design to do national governments can not just vote themselves out of international commitment recognise as former foreign secretary that they be incredibly powerful tool as we try to do good around the wide world give my right hon friend the commitment that we remain relentlessly focused on ensure that we continue to drive down the small boat crossing use the full range of capability at our disposal the home secretary and the government be right to prioritise end illegal migration by my count he speak six time in his statement about have plan the only word he leave out be cunning because his plan seem to be as workable effective and chaotic as baldrick in blackadder that be no laugh matter because while the plan be not work there be still pressure on our infrastructure there be still criminal gang profit from people misery and people who use legal route be be disadvantaged will the home secretary give we the commitment that if the european court of human rights continue to be barrier to the will of this house the government will take action and ignore the demand of that court the right hon gentleman know that have huge amount of respect for he one point that take from the judgment today be that it be not just about the echr their lordship set out number of international commitment that we have make but they also set out what we need to do to get the rwanda plan up and run that be on very specific legal point which we be already in the process of addressing respectfully disagree with the right hon gentleman because small boat arrival be down unlike almost everywhere else in europe where they be significantly up the use of hotel bed space be down because of the arrangement that we have put in place the speed of processing have increase and the volume of processing of asylum claim have significantly increase there be always multiple strand to this plan as set out in the point that my right hon friend the prime minister put forward and they be have the desire effect we will just keep work to deliver on our commitment do my right hon friend agree that one of the glory of our parliamentary democracy be that government have to obey the law in the same way that individual citizen and corporation do do he also agree that those who look carefully at the judgment and think that there be simple solution with one lever to pull will be disappoint shall quote very wise woman giorgia meloni who be herself quote an even wise woman margaret thatcher by say this be constant battle in that battle both domestically and internationally one of our real strength as see as foreign secretary on the international stage be that when we speak and demand that other country abide by the rule of law we be take seriously because of our posture on this issue we will continue to ensure that we abide by the rule of law while simultaneously we have prove that we can do both deliver on the commitment that we have make to drive down illegal migration and stop the boat welcome the home secretary to his new position one fifth of my constituency casework relate to his department and it be catalogue of human misery in just one example from the hundred that could give the claimant asylum application be make in december their interview be in november and they be still wait for decision the claimant have two young child and have twice attempt suicide that all come at huge cost to they the nhs and the police will the home secretary get grip stop the magical thinking and just fix his department and the asylum process completely sympathise with the frustration that the hon lady constituent must feel which be reflect in the frustration that detect in the question remind she and the house that we never claim that the rwanda deal be the totality of our response to this issue we make commitment to increase the speed of decision making and to drive down the backlog and we have demonstrably do that my constituent be disappoint by the judgment but will be hearten by the government commitment to stop the boat as the government threaten to take over raf scampton my constituent be impatient and want the boat stop as soon as possible understand that the home secretary plan be to upgrade the treaty with rwanda how long will that take could it be subject to legal challenge and if so how long could those legal challenge take be not able to give certainty on timeline wish that be but my hon friend will know that have constituency interest in get this right as raf wethersfield in my constituency be be use as an asylum centre in my conversation with the minister for immigration in constituency capacity we discuss the need to drive down the demand for accommodation be it at scampton wethersfield or anywhere else the good way of close down wethersfield and not need scampton be to stop the we be relentlessly focus on do so as my right hon friend the member for gainsborough sir edward leigh understand for all the reason that have set out welcome the home secretary to his position and welcome the court judgment this morning notice in the home secretary statement complete lack of empathy as to why people seek asylum in the first place why people risk all risk their life risk everything to try to cross dangerous channel to get to what they hope will be place of safety he be right to confirm that there be massive global rise in the number of refugee should all government not work together to address the cause of that poverty war human right abuse and all of those issue will he confirm that this country will not walk away from the important although not perfect advance make over the past decade by the european court of human rights in improve human right across europe include in this country the right hon gentleman tempt to refer back to my previous role as foreign secretary can assure he and the house that huge part of the work that be do by the foreign commonwealth and development office be on exactly those issue address climate change so that rural farmer in the develop world have crop that they can grow sell and eat and reduce the risk of conflict and persecution we be address those driver but have to say to the right hon gentleman that the idea that we can somehow uninvent illegal migration be naive beyond belief we also have to address the fact that people be abuse by criminal they be use as product to smuggle and we have to break the business model of the people smuggler as well as address the issue that drive people away from the country from which they originate add my voice to the general welcome to my right hon friend he have tell the house that his department have anticipate the decision of the supreme court that be announce today that be the case can he tell the house whether he have make an assessment of whether legislation will be necessary to remedy the problem that have be identify if so when do he anticipate be in position to introduce that legislation can assure my right hon friend that as thoughtful and proactive department the home office look seriously at the range of potential outcome from the judgment can not claim credit for that work because much of it be do before my arrival we have already set in place the work to turn the memorandum of understanding into treaty thereby address some of the concern of their lordship and the prime minister and have both make it clear that if there need to be domestic legislative work to ensure that we resolve this we be unafraid of put legislation forward know from my recent visit to colfe school that they will welcome their former pupil to his new role as do urge he to resist call from people on his own benches to remove we from the european convention on human right if we be outside that convention serious criminal or someone who mean we harm such as terrorist or someone suspect of terrorism who seek to hide overseas could legitimately claim that their human right could be violate if they be extradite back to the uk how be that take back control of our border thank the hon gentleman will take the opportunity to go back to my old school and get their congratulation directly at some point of course will let the hon gentleman know that will be treading on his hallowed turf the hon gentleman invite to be distract but refuse to be distract will focus on what we need to do to achieve this policy in their judgment their lordship set out the route to operationalise the rwanda plan and will focus on what they have tell we will resolve the stick point there be much in the judgment to be welcome include all the element about the fundamental soundness of the policy we will focus on the thing that will unlock the operationalisation of the plan how long will the rwanda treaty take to get through how long will it take to have the court case and the judgment and have the whole thing crawl over again by human right lawyer meanwhile my right hon friend be victim of our failure to stop the boat he have wethersfield in his constituency as have raf scampton in mine he be thoroughly nice chap and think that he feel my pain therefore once the court case over scampton be decide in the next week or two whatever the result will he meet so that we can work together to get up to million worth of level up at scampton be always delighted to meet my right hon friend he will know of course that be now in position where have to be careful about the commitment make certainly about raf wethersfield do not intend to abuse my position as home secretary but be absolutely committed to drive down the need for raf scampton and raf wethersfield just as we have drive down the need for hotel accommodation be absolutely committed to that but of course will meet my right hon friend we need to speed up if we be to get everybody in warmly welcome the home secretary to his new role the uk be absolutely entitle to create bespoke policy and he refer to his constructive work with albania but do he understand unlike his predecessor that policy must be compatible with fact and the law and that it should focus on the chaotic processing he have inherit and on fund the public service that he say be under pressure can confirm that he acknowledge that the echr be fundamental cornerstone of the good friday agreement and that abandon it would not be compatible with the government commitment to northern ireland once again the hon lady be ask to comment on something in parallel to the thing that have set out my commitment to she and the house be that we will focus on the thing that will unlock this strand of our work can not give she or indeed anyone else in the house guarantee about timescale but we be already be effective on processing on drive down the need for hotel accommodation and on speed up decision making all those thing be part of the basket of activity that be help we be positive outlier compare with our european partner there be lot of tinker go on here but the real problem be parliamentary sovereignty the rule of law which my right hon friend refer to be at the heart of this issue if the law be clear and express and use notwithstanding provision as propose in an amendment few year ago it will deal with all these matter if may make further point before the attorney general jump in if we get the law right we can then deal with what be effectively an international problem while distinguish between economic illegal migrant and proper refugee would caution the house against grasp for silver bullet solution sometimes the most effective government policy be just focus and graft assure the house that the home office and the ministers and official within it will be relentlessly focus on the daily work that need to be do to address this issue of course we will look at what change we need to make to operationalise the rwanda scheme but urge people against grasp for silver bullet solution which be rarely effective the rwanda scheme be callous inhumane and ineffective one might say the same about the former home secretary that be why welcome the new home secretary to his post on the ground that he could not possibly be any bad hope that he will consider the ethical dimension of this issue since the court have just rule that rwanda be not safe country even if he do not do he not agree that the scheme be simply not workable it be not good use of money and it will take huge amount of effort to get to place where anyone be send to rwanda be there not much well way of pursue this issue and destroy the small boat model again it be easy to criticise it be easy to criticise ineffectually sadly that be what hear from opposition members far too often no credible alternative just criticism the point be that we be pursue number of workstream that be already prove effective which be why our number be go down at time when all our european partner be see illegal arrival go up we will continue work on multiple strand and we will continue pursue the rwanda plan when labour member finally decide to vote for something rather than against something we will listen but that day have not happen yet and do not expect it to happen any time soon we must be brief warmly welcome the tone and content of my right hon friend statement do he agree that in addition to the commitment to the echr which be very much treasure by the settle refugee community in my constituency this be an opportunity to reinvigorate the work with france that have do so much to bear down on the number of small boat crossing in the way he have describe assure my hon friend and the house that we be do extensive work with france once again pay tribute to my right hon friend the immigration minister and it be work this be the point it be work and therefore we will continue to pursue it will the home secretary please answer the question from my hon friend the member for glasgow central alison thewliss when be glasgow mp go to get meeting with the home office to discuss those successful refugee who have be grant status more widely what discussion be he have with local authority across the uk on rehouse successful refugee my understanding be that official from my department meet regularly on these issue if there be specific case the hon member should please bring they to my attention welcome my right hon friend to his place and welcome his comment on the unfairness of illegal immigration for those who have come here legally however the supreme court verdict this morning be extreme comprehensive and it reveal not just one obstacle but multiple obstacle to deport people from this country if we want to deter the small boat we need to be able to remove significant number of people extremely quickly give the comprehensive nature of the judgment this morning can encourage my right hon friend against an incremental approach it be clear from the ruling that we need to do something strong now we choose in the illegal migration act not to include notwithstanding provision but think we do need they now hear the point my hon friend make about powerful deterrent we be absolutely committed to that but do say again that in circumstance as challenging as this there be rarely silver bullet solution in my whole time in government and in politic have never yet come across one we have to pursue all our line of effort and give he my assurance that we will continue to do so would the money waste on the rwanda plan not have be more usefully spend on massively improve the application process to reduce illegal immigration and on establish safe and legal route to reduce the number of small boat be wonder whether the microphone be work there have be tenfold increase in the pace of asylum process this last year we be increase it the thing be not mutually exclusive we be do all of they it be great to have the home secretary in his new role and to hear his confirmation that small boat arrival be down not just by fifth but now by third and that he will find treaty to resolve the remain legal issue on the rwanda deal will my right hon friend also encourage his official to share the datum on asylum application that be over year old with member of parliament so that with our local council we can prepare housing solution in advance will absolutely take that idea on board we want to do everything we can to make sure that this process be as quick and as smooth as possible the european convention on human right be develop to ensure that government would never again dehumanise people and abuse their right with impunity so can the secretary of state tell we do the threat of revisit international relationship really mean that his government be ready to unpick our international relationship and treaty include the echr so that they can demonise with impunity those flee persecution and conflict we say never again member have ask the same question over and over again hate do this but will refer the hon lady to the answer give some moment ago welcome my right hon friend to his new role and agree with he that today we see the opposition mask slip they have no wish to tackle this issue and that be not surprising when their policy be to pass the number decision to the leader of the opposition mothership in brussels my constituent be absolutely feed up will my right hon friend speak directly to they and address their concern by say that nothing will be off the table to get this sort quickly the opposition be devoid of idea they criticise but they put nothing forward their good plan be to list thing that we be already do but object to other thing that we be go to add to that basket of tool that be why can reassure my hon friend and her constituent that we unlike they will remain focused on serve the british people and stop the boat to go back to the european convention on human right because the home secretary have not be clear on this point do he recognise that if the uk be to renounce the convention or tamper with it that would undermine the good friday agreement particularly around human right and policing and justice undermine the policing and justice co operation aspect of the trade and co operation agreement and leave the uk in the company of belarus and russia be well aware of the implication of the european court of human rights keep be invite to comment on something other than the text of my statement have make the government position clear we be focus our attention on what we believe will unlock this important strand of multi strand approach to illegal migration the home secretary will agree that the control of our border be defining issue for million of people so when the prime minister say that if necessary be prepared to revisit our domestic legal framework could we sharpen that up bit to say that we will revisit our domestic legal framework and will do so on multiple front in timely way we be focus on deliver for the british people and deliver quickly as say we have always have multi strand approach and we will make sure that the domestic legislative framework be fit for purpose and that we can deliver on our commitment to stop the boat when and how will the home secretary know that his treaty and legislative change be give the court the certainty that it demand will he proactively go to the court for fresh ruling or will he wait for third party challenge and for the litigation merry go round to continue be not go to set out all the plan for how we will put this in place we have already start the process for turn the mou into treaty we be focus on address the specific issue raise by their lordship in addition to vote against the government time on stop the boat the opposition speak about natural dispersal when deal with economic migrant this mean they often end up in doncaster where property be cheap rather than in the leafy suburb of the liberal elite but doncaster be full so will the home secretary do everything he can to put through the rwanda treaty as soon as possible welcome the point raise by my hon friend it be often the least well off community who feel the burden most heavily and it be our duty to they to address these issue give he that commitment on my recent trip to just outside his constituency get his name wrong for which apologise and will do exactly that this morning meet british palestinian woman call wafia who tell that member of her family have die in the last month in gaza she tell about her cousin who so far have survive but be utterly traumatise and completely terrified should those cousin and their child somehow make it to these shore albeit on the only route give to they by this government in other word the dangerous small boat crossing be the home secretary seriously tell that he could look they in the eye and tell they not only that they will they not be join wafia but that they will be go to rwanda which be his eventual plan and will never be reunite with what remain of their family be not go to be draw into make comment on specific individual without know the circumstance it would be ridiculous for anyone in the house to try to do immigration processing across the dispatch box like that of course recognise the pain and suffer that palestinian people in gaza be experience have see it we have family reconciliation scheme as part of our safe and legal route but be not go to make specific comment on individual case and the reason will be obvious to anyone who give it any thought the people of stoke on trent north kidsgrove and talke want to know clearly and simply whether the home secretary as well as look at our legal framework here in the united kingdom will be willing to disapply international treaty and convention such as the echr and the refugee convention in order to take back control of our border yes or no do not believe those thing be necessary but the point be that we remain focused on what we need to do as have say number of time there be no silver bullet this require constant work constant vigilance and constant effort and give commitment to my hon friend and to the whole house that that be exactly what we will continue to do accord to the home office own figure it will cost more to transport vulnerable human being to rwanda than to let they stay in the uk so if the government want to scrap this unlawful inhumane and cruel policy how much money would it save taxpayer do not agree do not agree with those number no do not agree with the hon member interpretation of those number because ultimately that fail to take into consideration the cost to human life of not deter people of put their life into the hand of criminal and of put their life at risk on the open sea in small dangerous dinghy he should be conscious that deter this evil trade be human good and something we should pursue be amazed that he look at it purely in pound shilling and penny not in the cost to human life do my right hon friend agree that it be classic labour double standard when labour members appear to support the united nations send people to rwanda but do not support the british government do the same friend of every country except their own think the home secretary be clearly under lot of pressure from his back benchers on this but may remind he that the echr be entwine throughout many year of devolved parliament legislation and indeed scottish case law what assurance can he give that his government will not attempt to weaken or change the echr without consent from the devolved administration with regard to amendment when be foreign secretary make the point that if we want to preserve institution they need to evolve nothing should be catch in aspic or freeze in amber ultimately once again the hon lady ask to be distract from our core effort which be deliver on our multi strand approach to tackle illegal migration and refuse to do so very much welcome my right hon friend to his new post and the clear determination he have show to stop the boat however speed be the metric by which our constituent will judge we once the dust have settle on the judgment and it be clear whether we need notwithstanding provision or other legislation will he bring that to this house with the same speed that we bring through thing such as the coronavirus act so that we can shut down the evil trade of people smuggle my hon friend make an important point and my commitment which be echo by the prime minister be that we will look at our domestic legislative framework and take action we have pass one of the most ambitious piece of legislation and we be unafraid to do so this be core to the life of the british people and their confidence in the security of their country and it be core to our mission as government what the home secretary be ultimately argue for be system whereby rich western country get to pack off asylum seeker and refugee to poor country that already bear vastly disproportionate share of responsibility for shelter refugee around the world there be zero evidence that that will work and an abundance of evidence of the harm it do to the individual catch up in it be it not the case that this be not just illegal but immoral and impracticable so what would the hon gentleman do would he say that every person in the the world be big place and there be lot of people in it be he credibly say that anybody choose to come here by any mean include through the hand of evil criminal should automatically have the right to stay it be an untenable position we be address poverty and conflict in the develop world we be address climate change which be affect farmer in the develop world we be do all those thing but we be also discharge our duty to the british people to protect their border if he do not feel that that be function of government then he be wrong first raise this issue in this place on may the rwanda scheme be stick in the court for month enough be enough do the home secretary agree that one of the tool in his basket need to be deterrent that be robust and that timescale matter have have enough and all of my constituent have have enough this be matter of critical importance do the home secretary agree remind my hon friend that we be already see success and that success be accelerate because of the measure we have put in place he be right to say that we need deterrent for people make those dangerous crossing and deterrent for the illegal criminal we be determined to deliver that and we will do so in the face of the opposition who be desperately try to prevent we from do so very much hope that the measure my right hon friend have set out will allow we to deliver the rwanda plan as soon as possible will he also look have ask for this on number of occasion at other third country that we could form partnership with to deliver more processing overseas in number of those location assure my hon friend that in addition to the conversation with rwanda which be well progress we be have similar conversation with number of other country indeed our policy be now be adopt in large part by number of other european country whose circumstance be considerably bad than our we be absolutely lead the field on this issue warmly welcome my fellow essex colleague to his place and wish he every success welcome his commitment to tough but fair policy on immigration the people of southend be particularly concerned that if we do not resolve the issue of illegal migration we be prevent people who have serve our country from come here legally to safety do he agree my hon friend be absolutely right and number of people have mention the humanity of this it should be the elected government of country who decide who can and can not come to that country it should not be criminal smuggler or people who prey on the weak that would be the by product of failure to address the issue and that be what we see from the opposition complete vacuum where policy should live that vacuum encourage illegality and criminality and that be what we be seek to address welcome the home secretary to his place and thank he for the outstanding job he do in his previous brief rwanda be country that we do business with country with thriving economy and country that the leader of the opposition football team even promote as tourist destination bear that in mind will the government consider whether it may be appropriate to add rwanda to the list of safe country my hon friend make good point and one of the few thing that the former leader of the opposition and share be passion for arsenal football club rwanda be country that be develop fast and it be close partner they listen carefully when we talk to and work with they and have no doubt that work closely with they we will bring this scheme into operation and put forward the deterrent that will be really important strand of our multi strand approach to illegal migration although welcome the steady progress be make to close asylum hotel be extremely disappointed that the metropole in blackpool be yet to be vacate that hotel be locate in the poor ward in the entire country bar none and the pressure on my local community and public service be immense be the home secretary able to assure that in the next batch of hotel closure socio economic condition will be take into account and that the metropole will finally be close listen careful to my hon friend point and he reinforce the issue that think be key it be very easy for people to be generous of spirit when someone else be bear the burden the people in his constituency and the immediate neighbourhood of the metropole hotel be as he say not wealthy people yet they be the one disproportionately bear the brunt of illegal migration that be why we be committed to help they and other people like they across the country

endure cessation of fighting as soon as possible and credible diplomatic and political process to deliver the last peace of two state solution when the prime minister open the king speech debate just eight day ago we have all this briefing about how it be rishi reset moment so much of flop be it that have make promise just eight day ago about the change his government would deliver now he be talk about the change to his government instead we have another reshuffle and another rishi reset not change just more of the same chaos we remember his conference claim that he be reject decade of failure include the last year of tory government just month later he have bring back one of the main tory architect in the former prime minister who cut police officer bring in the bedroom tax and austerity and push work family and child into poverty it be sign of the state of the tory party that the prime minister who do all that be now suddenly see as moderate instead of government focus on the problem face the country whether the cost of living crisis record nhs waiting list or rise town centre crime and serious violence what we have get be just more of the same tory psychodrama and chaos in the past seven and half year we have have five prime ministers six chancellors seven health secretaries seven foreign secretaries eight home secretaries and think count right justice secretaries eight eight justice secretaries it have be struggle to keep count of their change we have have eight home secretaries in less than eight year and even bad two of they be the right hon and learn member for fareham suella braverman she be so unsuited for the job of home secretary that she be sack twice once for breach security rule in government and the second time for undermine security on our street attack the police undermine respect for the decision they take in the run up to difficult weekend ramp up division around remembrance and make it hard for the police to do their job no other home secretary would ever have do those thing it show how little this prime minister care about our security that he be prepared to reappoint she to defend she and to follow she wherever she lead and now we know why the dodgy deal that the prime minister deny last year be now lay bare in the former home secretary letter she say despite you have be reject by majority of party member and thus have no personal mandate to be prime minister fair point there she go on this be document with clear term to which you agree in october during your second leadership campaign trust you obviously that be another sign of her poor judgment the deal make he prime minister and make he make she the most unsuitable home secretary this country have have the conservatives publish their late criminal justice bill yesterday it have measure that labour call for to tackle antisocial behaviour and be go to make the point that the government have no idea of their own and be just follow labour lead but have to concede that they and the tory party in general be definitely the expert on antisocial behaviour the former home secretary be throw rock and stone the new conservative group be make dark threat go round the parliamentary tory party nuisance beg for no confidence letter in the prime minister the right hon member for south holland and the deepings sir john hayes be so desperate to find out how many letter have go in to the chair of the committee the right hon member for altrincham and sale west sir graham brady that he be now camp outside his office but guess they tell we it be lifestyle choice while the tories fight culture war with each other the rest of we be worried about security on our street the new home secretary have brief that he do not want to take over the job but he have agree to take one for the team let just say to he and to all government front bencher if they do not want to run the home office or the ministry of justice and can not see how to do the job they should get out the way for those of we who can our country be cry out for government who care about tackle crime restore security to our street and restore confidence in the police rather than tory government chase headline and fighting among themselves the government want to tell we that all be fine on the number of police and the level of crime but they be badly out of touch because that be not what it feel like across the country and nothing in the king speech will touch the side we have few neighbourhood police on our street half the country say they never see bobby on the beat knife crime be up by devastate young life we have persistent violence against woman and girl across our country that be the conservatives abysmal legacy on law and order labour have set out mission on crime to halve serious violence include knife crime and violence against woman and girl to reverse the catastrophic collapse in the proportion of crime solve and to rebuild confidence in the police and criminal justice system by get more neighbourhood police on the street and tackle town centre crime however what do we have in the king speech the criminal justice bill include measure that labour call for long ago but it do not tackle enough of the serious problem that our country face or make up for the damage that have be do we support make sure that the most serious and dangerous criminal properly serve their time but frankly too few criminal be actually catch or charge in the first place under this government more than of crime go unsolved for those who commit crime the chance of be catch and punish be less than half what they be under the last labour government that be the scale of collapse in law and order under the tories on knife crime the measure go nowhere near far enough on violence against woman and girl be really concerned because there be nothing on spike nothing serious on stalk and nothing to turn around the woeful fact that of rapist avoid charge the government sentencing proposal may mean that thousand of domestic abuser whose violence be escalate will be let off jail there be nothing at all on town centre crime shoplifting be up shocking in year assault on shop worker triple during the pandemic and have not go down again this be freedom from fear week and thank the union of shop distributive and allied workers and the british retail consortium for the work they be do to stand up for staff safety and shine light on the disgraceful way in which people be be treat just for do their job but why be the government not listen to they labour be and we will change the law we will table amendment to the crime and justice bill to ditch the ridiculous rule that stop action from be take against repeat shoplifting gang and to bring in proper new offence of assault shop worker because everyone have the right to feel safe at work on national security and some of the core issue that affect the safety of our nation in the past we have broad cross party consensus and work together in that spirit labour will always stand ready to do so security ministers and shadow security ministers have do so before and that be the spirit in which we will work on the national security bill that be also the spirit in which we would always have expect to approach the operational independence and impartiality of british policing the last home secretary undermine that hope that the new home secretary will be able to restore it because this be too important for we to disagree on it be likewise for the safety and cohesion of our community we have see tension increase as result of the truly awful event in the middle east there have be an appalling rise in antisemitism include some disgraceful incident this weekend with jewish community feel enormous anguish and distress we have also see an awful increase in islamophobia and the rise of organise far right thuggery about which the police raise concern this weekend every one of we in this house must be clear that violence and hate crime have no place on britain street and must face the full force of the law we must all back the police in take the action that be need thank the police for the reassurance work they be do with synagogue jewish school and mosque as well as their action against the hate crime that devastate life and corrode community say to the justice secretary and the new home secretary that labour have call for strong action to tackle both antisemitism and islamophobia and hateful extremism again we stand ready to work with the government and see what we can do to come together to address these serious issue because there be responsibility on all of we to bring our community together the shadow foreign secretary my right hon friend the member for tottenham mr lammy will speak later about labour amendment in more detail but every one of we will have be deeply disturb by the terrible event in the middle east we want an end to the devastating violence and suffering we have see palestinians kill two third of they woman and child thousand of innocent child be dead family be bereaved and parent grieve it be intolerable hundred of hostage be still be hold follow the grave attack on jewish people on any day since the holocaust israeli family be still experience the horror and the trauma as the remain of their love one be still be identify family and community be still reel from the event we all condemn the truly barbaric attack by hamas terrorist on october under international law we respect country right to defend their citizen from terrorist attack and also country obligation to abide by international law the conduct of war matter as antony blinken say at the very start of the conflict how israel do this matter we democracy distinguish ourselves from terrorist by strive for different standard even when it be difficult our humanity the value that we place on human life and human dignity that what make we who we be the rule base order must not be abandon that be why we must commit to recognise the jurisdiction of the international criminal court to address the conduct of all party in the conflict but it be also why we need an urgent suspension of hostility not just short pause but as my right hon friend the shadow foreign secretary have set out the time and space to get in fuel food and water to rebuild vital humanitarian infrastructure to protect aid worker who be lose their life on scale we have never see before in conflict to put in place protection for civilian and negotiate hostage release and to work towards full cessation of violence and endure peace so that life can be save and the intolerable suffering can end we know that that require immense and complex diplomatic work it be not easy we have word on page that we will talk about vote on today but we all know that it be not through word on page that this will be achieve it will be achieve through step by step intense diplomacy and pressure that recognise how difficult it be when hamas refuse to agree to stop rocket attack and pledge again to repeat the attack of october we recognise too that hostage be still be hold but we still have to make urgent diplomatic progress we still have to do what we can right now to save life and make progress in get hostility suspend especially so that humanitarian action can be take we recognise too that the only way forward be two state solution with secure and safe israel alongside secure and sovereign palestine my right hon friend the shadow foreign secretary be right to say yesterday that neither the long term security of israel nor long term justice for palestine can be deliver by bomb and bullet official report november vol that be why there be responsibility on all of we to urge the uk government to do what they can to strain every sinew in the pursuit of peace the first duty of any government its most serious and solemn responsibility be to keep its people safe since overall level of crime be down by more than domestic burglary be down by violent crime by vehicle relate theft by and the number of young people admit to hospital follow an assault with knife or other bladed weapon have fall by in fact his majesty chief inspector of constabulary andy cooke have say that england and wales be arguably safe than they have ever be that be because the government have take decisive measure include recruit police officer so that we can cut crime and keep our community safe we have make robust punishment available for the bad criminal to keep the most serious offender in custody for long and we have commission the big prison building programme since the victorian era the gracious speech build on that record with range of long term decision that keep public protection at the heart of the government agenda for our country want to start with tackle violence against woman and girl on point make by the right hon member for normanton pontefract and castleford yvette cooper that be priority for the government and for personally but let we step back to reflect on some of the progress make in the last decade or so the right hon lady refer to the offence of stalk and say that she want some progress she will recall that in the year that she be in government there be no offence or crime of stalk we be the party that create it so that behaviour describe as murder in slow motion could be properly address then we double the maximum sentence let correct the secretary of state he may not recall but table one of the first amendment on reform to introduce stalk law that same amendment be eventually take up in the other place by the labour lord and the conservative government agree to it be very glad that they do but he should not take credit for agree to labour proposal that and other put forward be delighted to debate this with the right hon lady thirteen year and it be not on the statute book when do it come on to the statute book in she have year and she miss her opportunity this be the party that put it on the statute book the right hon lady refer to other matter of violence against woman and girl this be the party that create the offence of coercive and control behaviour we be the party that slay the myth that abuse be perpetrate only with punch kick and other physical violence we know that it be not and we act to outlaw it we introduce the landmark domestic abuse act create new domestic abuse commissioner and end abuse such as the ability of da perpetrator to cross examine victim we create standalone offence of non fatal strangulation and make clear that the cowardly so call rough sex go wrong defence for murder do not exist we deliver radical improvement to the victim code to secure entitlement for victim include the automatic right for eligible victim to be tell when perpetrator be due to leave prison there be rape support helpline more than independent sexual violence adviser and independent domestic violence adviser we have outlaw upskirting and revenge porn and introduce the most wide range modern slavery legislation probably anywhere in the world over the last year we have build on that work by ensure that violence against woman and girl be now recognise as national threat just like terrorism and organised crime it be also include in the strategic policing requirement when begin my career in the court violence behind close door be all too often pass off and trivialise as domestic with no action take not any more we see it for what it be corrosive cruel and devastating those responsible be no long beyond the reach of the law commend the secretary of state on his speech he will know that the figure for northern ireland be the bad in the whole of europe total of woman have be murder in northern ireland by an intimate partner relative or family member since those figure be shameful and discourage for we all would he encourage the department for justice in northern ireland to follow suit on any legislation on tackle violence against woman and girl so that northern ireland be not leave behind yes would look forward to the restoration of the assembly so that these important priority can be pursue let turn to the issue of rape which hear mention sotto voce from the opposition benches in we launch rape review to drive up the criminal justice system response to this crime we commit to total transparency on the datum publish dashboard about report charge and receipt in the crown court so that any member of the public could see what be take place at the touch of button we identify lever to drive forward the effectiveness and efficiency of the system include roll out technology to ensure that evidence from mobile phone device could be harness rapidly without victim be separate for long period from what can be lifeline we set out ambition that many commentator say be unachievable and we bring government departments together literally sit around the same table to prosecute our mission on behalf of victim of course there be always further to go but the progress make be significant the volume of adult rape case reach court since have double meanwhile see as the right hon member for normanton pontefract and castleford want to put we under the microscope let make these point the situation compare with be strike more case of rape be be prosecute the conviction rate be high sentence be long and importantly the proportion of those sentence spend in custody be significantly increase too to the political point that the right hon lady make she be in government and vote for the criminal justice act section of which if she want to remember make sure that every single rapist be release at the halfway mark if they be sentence to year she vote to ensure that they be release after five we have change that this government say that that be not right not fair on victim and not just she need to account for her action we have invest million in operation soteria which bring together the police prosecutor and academic to develop new approach to rape and sexual offence there be now clear expectation that investigation must focus on suspect behaviour not on the victim suppose credibility let turn to the police become police officer be noble calling to sign up be to commit to run towards danger when other flee it mean engage with the most threatening people in society but also the most vulnerable that demand judgment as well as skill and integrity give the power that officer necessarily wield it be essential that those who wear the uniform be competent decent and honest small minority of officer fall short of the require standard in recent year some have transgress in the bad way possible that inevitably shake public confidence in the police baroness casey review of the met make for deeply concern reading and the first part of the angiolini inquiry be focus on the career of the serve officer who rap and murder sarah everard part two will look at broad issue in police and the safety of woman early this year the government launch review into police officer dismissal and the home office have recently announce number of measure to strengthen the system as result of that review there will be presumption of dismissal for those find to have commit gross misconduct we be hand back responsibility for chair misconduct hearing to senior police officer while retain independence in the system the college of policing have strengthen the statutory code of practice for police vetting make the obligation on police chief strict and clear as be publish in july his majesty inspectorate of constabulary and fire and rescue service have find that force have make progress on vetting they must not let up all police force have cross check their workforce against the police national database to help to identify anyone not fit to serve and the national police chiefs council will provide an update on its finding in january the government will change the law to ensure that all officer who be unable to maintain vetting clearance can be sack the criminal justice bill include duty of candour require police chief to ensure an ethical culture in their force in august the previous home secretary write to police leader ask they to outline their plan to increase visibility and confidence in local policing and to report back on progress by next march confidence in police be not just about individual behaviour but about the performance of each force there be no such thing as trivial crime the public expect the police to follow all reasonable line of inquiry and the government have secure pledge from all force to do so that pledge apply to all crime and the public expect to see improvement in the approach to phone theft car theft criminal damage and shoplifting at the heart of the government legislative programme for the forthcoming parliamentary session be our plan to keep the british people safe our sentencing bill have public protection at its core there be two element to our approach for people who commit the most horrific murder such as murder with sexual or sadistic conduct the public be protect by keep they where they belong out of circulation behind bar for the rest of their life unless the court find exceptional circumstance that be how they can be prevent from inflict any more damage to individual and to society our bill also mean that rapist and those convict of the most serious sexual offence will serve every day of their custodial term behind bar that is night and day compare with the regime we inherit in at that time rapist sentence to year be out in five now rapist sentence to year will serve the full term my right hon and learn friend be make an excellent speech and do excellent work he have not mention the crime of terrorism which be one of the most serious and he have not have chance to mention the amendment that we will vote on today there be grave concern that the great the loss of civilian life in the middle east be the great the likelihood of radicalisation and increase terror at home do he agree that those of we who believe that now be not the right time to call for full ceasefire because of the difficulty of give it be not give israel moral blank cheque to continue with operation in the way it have so far protect civilian life be vital to prevent future terrorism here and elsewhere my right hon friend put it well anyone who have observe what have take place can not fail but to be fill with anguish and distress so of course it be the case that nation right to defend itself be right to do so consistent with international law the government be very clear on that as indeed think be most people in the house but she put the point well protect the public which be the theme be seek to stress also demand that we follow the evidence about what work to prevent reoffende if reoffende go down crime go down if crime go down the public be protect be very grateful to the lord chancellor who be quite right early to reject the attempt at revisionist history on stalk by those on the labour benches he and work very closely together on the initial change to the legislation do he agree with that there be an opportunity in the next police crime and sentence bill to also address something that would help to protect some of our young people which be the issue of spike there be real opportunity to update the law give clear definition of spike and send very clear message to all those who might be tempt to do so thank my hon friend who be absolutely right he do extraordinarily important work on stalk he understand as do that it be wicked crime that leave woman in particular feeling very vulnerable we act when other do not and revisionism be to be deprecate strongly agree with he on spike my hon friend be tremendous campaigner he be right that the legislation that be apt to capture this offence be within the offences against the person act it provide police with power but he make powerful point he will continue to make such point and we will consider they with care the right hon and learn gentleman be make an interesting speech expect he will share my disquiet that we presently have vacancy for police in scotland which be not go to be fill an independent councillor in the highland call matthew reiss himself senior retire police officer have say that the thin blue line be go to get thin without police we can not do the sort of thing that the right hon and learn gentleman be talk about in other word catch the criminal and make people feel secure could he in his capacity share his good practice with the scottish government in the future what very kind offer be sure that call will be echo by those in the snp benches in front of the hon gentleman we of course would be delighted to share any good practice he make very serious point to do all the thing we want to do to protect vulnerable people require boot on the ground it require police officer that be why we be proud of the fact that in this jurisdiction the number of police officer stand at or close to an all time high we would be happy to commend that approach to our friend north of the border on public protection take the most serious offender out of circulation be how we stop they commit crime but we also want to follow the evidence about what work to prevent reoffende because that be also how we keep the british people safe the evidence not sentiment evidence show that those on immediate prison sentence of less than month be significantly more likely to reoffend than similar offender who get sentence in the community they be over likely to reoffend as compare to less than for those who be require to adhere to tough condition with risk of go to prison if they fail to comply let be clear about what that mean those who be on suspend sentence order be require to comply with onerous requirement be they unpaid work order alcohol rehabilitation requirement or whatever on pain of go straight to prison if they fail to comply the evidence show that people see that as powerful deterrent my right hon and learn friend will want to comment in that context on persistent offender because he will know that there be many offender who persistently offend and commit crime that would not attract sentence of more than month the right hon member for normanton pontefract and castleford yvette cooper speak of shoplifting for example criminal damage would be another example as would antisocial behaviour some of persistent offender commit of crime be he really say that none of they should go to prison on the contrary know that my right hon friend rightly on behalf of his constituent want to ensure that those who destroy life and have corrosive impact on community be bring to book that be why the provision have be carefully construct and calibrate to ensure that those who be unable or unwilling to abide by an order of the court can expect to hear the clang of the prison gate not only will the proverbial sword of damocles be hang over they but for those who commit an offence when they be subject to court order be it supervision order community order or non molestation order the presumption no long apply we send clear message to criminal obey the order of the court or expect to go to prison judge will retain their discretion to impose immediate custody when an offender pose significant risk of physical or psychological harm to an individual this be to the direct point make by the right hon member for normanton pontefract and castleford so that domestic abuse offence and other violent offence against woman and girl can and will continue to be punish with immediate custody protect victim nothing change but for those whose sentence be suspend the court will be able to continue to use range of requirement include curfew electronic tag community payback and exclusion requirement those who do not comply or who commit further offence can be bring back to court and risk be send to prison alongside that we want to ensure that we have the prison place to keep serious and dangerous offender lock up for long while allow low risk offender to benefit from community base restriction to assist with their resettlement get back into work and start contribute to society where that can be safely manage for that reason we be extend home detention curfew to offender serve sentence of over four year and keep our tough restriction that prevent serious violent sexual and domestic abuse offender from access this facility the criminal justice bill include measure that deliver on three strategic objective first protect the public from violence and intimidation secondly enable law enforcement agency to respond to change technology deploy by criminal include by equip they with sufficient power to address emerge type and threat and thirdly strengthen public confidence in police we will protect the public from violence and intimidation by strengthen the law on the taking of intimate image without consent and expand the offence of encourage or assist self harm be grateful to the secretary of state for give way we use to have happy time on the justice committee together when we be little stripling what he be say sound good but my question be this last year the hon member for harwich and north essex sir bernard jenkin and amend the public order act to stop intimidatory protest against woman use abortion clinic although it be pass that be the only section that have not be enact ealing council do not know whether to renew its temporary order which be come up again if the law be pass and enact it should not have to can he tell ealing council and the whole country what to do when woman every day face intimidation thank the hon lady for her question we do indeed have productive and non partisan time on the justice committee on the specific important point she raise the minister for crime policing and fire my right hon friend the member for croydon south chris philp will address that point in closing but essentially it will happen in due course we will protect the public from violence and intimidation by strengthen the law on the taking of intimate image as have indicate we will increase the multi agency management requirement on offender convict of coercive or control behaviour as say that be not an offence in we be implement further recommendation in the domestic homicide sentencing review give judge the discretion at sentencing to add statutory aggravating factor for killing connect to the end of relationship many of which be commit where there have be history of coercive or control behaviour that man who say if can have you no one will can expect more serious penalty finally it be further insult to family when perpetrator refuse to appear in the dock to face up to the consequence of their action so it be quite right that we will give judge the power to order offender to court and punish those who refuse the secretary of state have outline some measure to protect woman who face really horrific abuse have be campaign on the key issue of girl who be associate with gang the fact be that they be groom and use by gang member for horrific crime and those girl be then victimise and imprison do he agree that we should have statutory definition of child criminal exploitation so that girl do not continue to face that horrific ordeal the hon lady have make very important point will not bore the house with war story but remember defend young year old she have be abuse by her boyfriend who have put pressure on she to hold firearm the police of course then arrest she and she be at risk of mandatory minimum sentence of three year although she have be put under all that pressure by her boyfriend the court do have discretion to take personal circumstance into account and in that case when the court find that there have be exceptional circumstance it be not bind to impose the mandatory minimum sentence it be always worth recall that in fair society before independent court there be an opportunity for important point of mitigation to be advance the hon lady also make point about groom and now want to turn to the issue of protect child in that regard in april the prime minister and the former home secretary announce package of measure to tackle child sexual exploitation grooming and abuse so that our law would keep pace with criminal late warped ingenuity we be introduce statutory aggravating factor at sentencing for groom behaviour in connection with sexual offence commit against in order to tackle those involve in groom gang there be also new child sexual exploitation police taskforce that mean analyst in every police region and new complex and organised child abuse database tackle organised exploitation programme have also be roll out bring together force level regional and national datum and intelligence the criminal justice bill also take the fight to criminal article use in serious crime such as template for print firearm component and pill press will be prohibit the government have secure from the police agreement to pursue all reasonable line of inquiry and the bill create power to enter premise without warrant to seize steal good such as mobile phone the operation of serious crime prevention order will be strengthen to make it easy for police and other law enforcement agency to place restriction on offender or suspect offender and prevent they from participate in further crime the bill bring further action on the scourge that be knife crime that include create power to seize retain and destroy bladed article find on private property that be likely to be use in connection with unlawful violence increase the maximum penalty for the sale of prohibit weapon and for sell knife to those under and the creation of criminal offence of possess bladed article with the intent to use it in unlawful violence to increase public confidence in policing the bill provide for duty of candour for policing and give chief officer the right to appeal against the result of misconduct board to police appeal tribunal let turn briefly to the victims and prisoners bill which will enshrine the principle of the victim code in law and provide great oversight and transparency in respect of how victim be treat with criminal justice inspectorate undertake joint inspection on victim issue when direct to do so as one who grapple with the old victim code under the labour government when the right hon member for normanton pontefract and castleford be in power should point out that that be pale imitation of what exist now the code that be in place under labour fail to give victim right to review or the right to make victim personal statement it only apply to victim of particularly serious crime and it fail to give any right to close relative our victim code dramatically strengthen the right of victim it will be easy for victim of crime to make complaint against public body by remove the need to go through an mp it create duty for the police to ensure that request for third party personal record from complainant be proportionate and necessary this measure will apply to victim only there will be an independent public advocate for the victim of major incident who will help bereaved family and the injure in the immediate aftermath of large scale disaster rise will give certainly way to the right hon lady in moment but not before pay tribute to she and indeed the hillsborough family and other for campaign for this measure know that the lord chancellor have take an interest in the public advocate proposal but do he agree that they need to be strengthen in order to be effective and that his proposal as they currently stand be nowhere near good enough to do the job that and other hope they can do have be very grateful to the right hon lady for the care and attention that she have give to this sensitive area over many month and year we will continue to work with she so that this can be the well possible advocate it be important to note however that whatever we provide will be massive step forward we do of course want to get it right and commit myself to work closely with the right hon lady in order to do so finally the parole board will be require to include member with background in law enforcement in order to help parole panel make well decision when assess risk the legislation lay out in the gracious speech be an ambitious long term vision for our country it build on our record over the last year to make our country safe than ever it be programme root in evidence programme that respond to the anger and distress that we all feel about crime and that do so with measure that actually drive it down we will ensure that the most dangerous offender spend long in prison to protect the british people from harm and to protect woman and girl in particular we will equip the police with power to fight the late criminal trend that blight our community and we will ensure that law enforcement have the confidence of the public while pull every lever to reduce offending because that be what keep the british people safe rise at the death will give way detect that my right hon and learn friend have reach the close part of his peroration so want to ask he to address one concern that have about the policing of demonstration as it happen think the police make the right call about november give the law as it stand what concern be that three week early on october plan demonstration in golders green to pray for israel and the jewish people be call off after the police advise that it would be subject to intimidation or violence from people who be represent it as threat against muslims hold demonstration for palestine seven mile away do it not concern my right hon and learn friend that peaceful demonstration should be call off in the face of intimidation and be it not matter of concern that the people who make the online threat that lead the police to give that advice have not as far as have learn be in any way question seek or prosecute as always my right hon friend have make an extremely powerful point on the basis of what he have say that do seem troubling do not know all the detail of course but the fundamental point be that anyone in our community whether they be jewish or otherwise should be able to practise their faith without let or hindrance be grateful to he for raise that if there be measure that need to be follow up to protect our vulnerable community they should be the criminal justice bill focus on the evidence the evidence of what work and the evidence of what keep the british people safe sometimes that will mean people be lock up for long and we make no apology for that sometimes it will mean ensure that those who be capable of be redeem be be redeem that be how we drive down reoffende and that be how we protect the british people commend the government programme to the house rise order as soon as the scottish national party spokesperson have sit down will impose time limit of six minute on speech it may go down from that but we will see how we get on friend of mine will know that run an occasional series on my social medium about westminster weirdness give what have happen in the past week really do not know where to start but congratulate the secretary of state on still be here to deliver his speech that suppose represent some progress for he if not for his colleague tend not to speak too much about justice in this place because that be largely for the scottish parliament to determine but some aspect of the legislation propose in the king speech bear some relation to what be happen in scotland note in particular the draft terrorism protection of premises bill hope that the government will engage closely not just with the scottish government but with local authority in scotland which may have an important role to play in the implementation of such bill give the way in which the exist licensing regime work for venue and premise in scotland they may have something to add that might work quite well in scotland be sure that ministers will want to work closely with the scottish government on the investigatory powers amendment bill note that certain provision of the criminal justice bill will apply in scotland and look forward to get some clarity from ministers on precisely which provision will apply there will mention some of these thing later on it be shocking at the weekend to see the attack on the police happen outside this very building attack that be encourage in many respect by the rhetoric come from this government in many case the signal that ministers and their colleague have be put out have not be dog whistle but foghorn to see the far right out on the street burst through the police claim police helmet as if it be some kind of war victory and take those trophy home be appalling the further fallout from this of the islamophobic attack on woman at station in the city be appalling and shocking hope that those who perpetrate all those attack will be identify and bring to justice likewise those who have be make antisemitic attack against our jewish community need to feel the full force of the law the scottish government recently bring in hate crime legislation in scotland and be sure that it will be use wherever it can be to hold those who perpetrate such hate crime to account recorded crime in scotland remain extremely low the most recent crime statistic show that record crime be at one of its low level since the overall number of crime record for the year end june be low than the pre pandemic level in june accord to the late statistic remarkably police scotland have homicide detection rate mean that every one of the tragic murder that have be commit since the inception of the single service have be solve far to that significant number of cold case commit many decade ago prior to the inception of police scotland have be detect use modern technology and bring to trial include the murder of brenda page in and renee macrae in there be lot still to be do to ensure that those who have perpetrate crime be bring to justice however and no one can rest until the love one of those victim see the justice that those they have lose deserve we need to do good deal more on violence against woman and girl the scottish government have lead in this area in many respect the equally safe strategy have work well but there be always more that we need to do the recently publish vision for justice delivery plan include action to address long stand challenge in the system face by victim of sexual offence as well as the continued modernisation of the prison estate we be set out an ambitious programme of reform that go up to march the plan put fresh focus on early prevention to prevent and reduce crime and to make community safe it can never be just about lock people up prevention be incredibly important too the criminal justice bill that the secretary of state mention talk about crack down on thing but crack down on thing just mean lock more people up for young people in particular that will change their life chance dramatically and have an impact on the rest of their life and their family life the work of the violence reduction unit in scotland over many year have take preventive approach to violence in young people and violent offending in young people have go down significantly as result this work recognise that young people particularly in this era with the impact of the pandemic and the cost of live crisis be really struggle with their life and need intervention all the more youth work can be powerful in change young people life chance pay tribute in particular to peek possibility for each and every kid and the youth community support agency in pollokshields which have do huge amount of work over many year to tackle the issue face young people in our community however we can not be complacent we need continual work and investment in these service the violence reduction unit also wish to highlight the work that have be go on around the promise for care experienced young people in scotland who we know from the statistic be sadly more likely to end up in the criminal justice system we need to continue to work with this group and to learn from they and their experience to ensure that their life chance be improve and that the promise be deliver upon another piece of work that have be go on in scotland far to the hate crime legislation that come before be baroness helena kennedy work on the introduction of misogyny bill to create new offence relate to misogynistic conduct any woman in this place will tell you about the scourge of misogynistic conduct whether it be the grow swell of hatred against woman online the challenge of social medium and the attack on woman there or the way in which young woman be draw into thing that put they in harm way perhaps through sexual experience online or through the way in which these thing be deal with in our society lot more work need to be do to tackle misogyny in our society national system will be roll out in scotland to digitally transform how evidence be manage across the justice sector which will benefit victim and witness and support the quick resolution of case we be also aim to expand the availability of mediation service in civil dispute because it will save people time stress and money if these thing can be resolve at an early stage want to touch briefly on drug policy because there have be significant progress in scotland in recent year yes we have our challenge and we acknowledge those challenge but we be put significant effort into tackle they welcome the mention of pill press in the criminal justice bill because street valium have be particular scourge on the street of scotland it be be sell at very cheap price and with indeterminate strength it have be implicate in many death so we need to tackle it at source again this be public health issue we be not tackle the people who be take those drug we be tackle those who be force they on to the street on the uk approach would continue to urge the uk government to do something with the misuse of drugs act it be an entirely outdated piece of legislation that criminalise and harm people who have health issue it be disappointing that the king speech do not see fit to tackle that and that the uk government have respond so poorly to the strong evidence base report that the home affairs committee produce on drug policy in the uk we need to learn from these thing not continue to be guide by outdated and harmful ideology in scotland we have invest million in drug and alcohol service and make huge stride in the increase of residential rehabilitation facility which be incredibly important we have open the first national family drug treatment service in the new mother and child recovery house in dundee we have also make huge amount of progress as be acknowledge in the home affairs committee report on medication assist treatment standard which will help people to get that treatment straightaway when they need it we be increase the uptake of residential rehabilitation placement and the availability of lifesave naloxone encourage all member to go for naloxone training as and my office team have do have staff from the scottish drugs forum come into my office and deliver training to and my staff and the staff team of colleague on how to administer lifesave naloxone it be simple thing to do and it can save life as we be all aware in our community it seem sensible to be able to do this if we be teach cardiopulmonary resuscitation it make sense to do something of this kind with naloxone the scottish government have very much be leader in that we have implement an enhance drug treatment service which will deliver heroin assist treatment to small group of people it have be incredibly well receive and successful for those who have be through the programme those who complete it have see huge benefit and look forward very much to the opening of the safe drug consumption facility in my constituency next year it be not yet open but very much believe that it will do an awful lot to reduce the antisocial behaviour of people take drug on the street in bin shed and on close back lane and waste ground and to bring those people inside where they can take drug under medical supervision not one person have die in any of these facility where they have operate in city around the world and hope that its introduction will lead to harm reduction approach in scotland and help people to get on the right track to stay safe and improve their life amendment which be table by and my honourable colleague call for an immediate ceasefire in the middle east struggle to cope with the scene of horror that be on our television screen every night the horror of october shock we all as have the devastation since for the people of gaza both of these thing be incredibly difficult to process how can people behave in this way towards their fellow human being do not think have ever receive as many email even on brexit as have receive these past four week overnight have email from constituent who be desperately worried about this situation and be demand ceasefire now both of these thing be incredibly difficult to process how can people behave in this way towards their fellow human being do not think have ever receive as many email even on brexit as have receive these past four week overnight have email from constituent who be desperately worried about this situation and be demand ceasefire now have to update the figure in my remark because the death toll have of course rise at least child in gaza have be kill that be one child every minute and more than child every single day further child remain missing under the rubble of bomb out building and be presume dead the number of child kill in single month of conflict in gaza be more than eight time the number of child kill in ukraine during the entire first year of the current war with russia many of the child who have manage to survive so far be sick or at risk of fall ill due to the lack of clean food and water oxfam have report five hour queue at bakery and very real risk of starvation nowhere be safe from the airstrike not even medical facility which be protect under international law only one hospital in northern gaza be still operational with very minimal service the al ahli hospital where my hon friend the member for central ayrshire dr whitford have work be struggle to keep go she await news of whether her colleague and the people she know have survive and of the current circumstance riham jafari of actionaid have comment on the concept of humanitarian pause what use be four hour pause each day to hand community bread in the morning before they be bomb in the afternoon what use be brief cessation in hostility when hospital ward lie in ruin and when road use to deliver medical supply and food be destroy actionaid have also talk about the situation face pregnant woman give birth under bombardment give birth do not fit into neat four hour humanitarian pause woman be give birth and have caesarean without anaesthetic and baby be be bear into chaos and death they can not be guarantee ventilator to keep they alive waseem an oxfam staff member in gaza have say price have treble the market be almost empty there be major shortage of essential food and essential item no bread no dairy product no salt no milk no can food no blanket or mattress access to basic service be very limited no electricity no water no gas no health system and no education we feel trap civilian who have do nothing wrong ask we how long can this go on vivian silver the year old canadian israeli peace activist who found women wage peace be confirm murder in the october attack on kibbutz she be identify by her dna she have work her whole life for peace when the attack happen she be have discussion on the radio from her safe room before the phone cut out she be challenge on her view on peace in the middle east and even when an attack be happen and she be in her safe room she say we can talk more about this if survive we should listen to her bravery and commitment to peace this afternoon her son who have lose so much be seek ceasefire because they know that this can not go on we should commit to peace and understanding in her memory how do this end all conflict at some point end there be an armistice an agreement and paper be sign the question for all of we in this place be how long this current phase of conflict continue when do it end the uk be always keen to talk up its position as member of the united nations security council but what be that worth when we do not back the un secretary general when he call for ceasefire in what reasonable circumstance should antónio guterres have to go to the rafah crossing to plead for aid to get through why be we not stand behind the secretary general and the united nations if we do not strive for peace we condemn yet another generation in palestine and israel to cycle of violence to death and destruction beyond our imagination we commit ourselves to two state solution to justice and to peace we will vote on the king speech tonight and we will vote on these amendment it will not end the year old conflict but it give we place to begin call the chair of the justice committee it be pleasure to listen to the lord chancellor open the debate with the characteristic moderation and eloquence that he bring to the dispatch box also welcome the two new under secretaries of state for justice my hon friend the member for orpington gareth bacon my constituency neighbour and my hon friend the member for newbury laura farris to the treasury bench they be both great asset to the government team welcome what the lord chancellor say in his speech will concentrate on justice relate issue give the pressure of time the justice committee have in fact already work on some of these policy area and be grateful to he and his ministerial colleague for take on board some of the issue we have raise we may want to press they little far as we see the detail of legislation but welcome the move they have make appreciate their courtesy throughout our dealing will start with our recent report public opinion and understanding of sentencing which be important in the context of the sentencing bill and some provision of the criminal justice bill the report show that there be real problem with the lack of coherent approach to sentence policy in the uk as well as an issue with public understanding of the objective of sentencing in particular there be insufficient analysis of the potential impact of sentencing change this be not unique to the last few year it have be systemic for all the time have be involve in politic and probably for all the odd year spend in practice at the bar specialise in criminal work before come to this place no government take particular blame but systemically we have perhaps not do enough to adequately collect and efficiently and fully use datum to drive evidence base policy know the lord chancellor and his colleague understand that and know the department be make move to improve it which welcome these bills be example of where we can try to put some of that into practice that be certainly what our report be look to achieve give the public view that public protection be the top priority we come to that conclusion after very detailed sentencing exercise might add do not think people object to strong sentence for the most dangerous offence but equally we need to be alert to identify any potential unintended consequence that mean we have to level with the public if we repeatedly enact measure that increase sentencing with the mantra of be tough on crime we have to be honest with the public by say it will cost money keep an adult male in prison cost year if they be danger to the public of if they commit the bad type of crime that be money well spend but the lord chancellor be quite right to look at alternative where that money could be well use for those who be not danger and who be in many respect inadequate and have be fail much early in their life lead to chaotic situation tougher sentencing be sometimes part of the mix and rightly so but smart sentencing be usually what be important think the sentencing bill recognise that and give we an opportunity to build on it that be also important because of the capacity crisis we have identify in prison through our study of the prison workforce where we have real difficulty in recruitment and retention that be also important as we can not have rehabilitation without sufficient and adequate staffing as winston churchill say there be in truth golden treasure in the heart of almost every man not everyone be redeemable but very many be far more than people in politic sometimes think it be good thing if we can turn people live around through the prison system because that mean less reoffende that be why the presumption against short sentence be right there be certain area which have be mention where we must carefully look at the detail but overall the evidence be overwhelming that short sentence do more harm than good sentencing policy should be about evidence and prevent reoffende not about soundbite and grab headline know the lord chancellor have adopt that approach rise will give way once and once only because time press be extremely grateful to my hon friend those be the argument that have be use for most of my lifetime the idea that recidivism be cause not by punishment or by retributive justice that somehow this be less important than the fact that as he say the people who commit crime have somehow be fail for long time this have be the prevail view in criminal justice yet it have bring no decline in recidivism rather the opposite before the hon gentleman come back on that must point out that if those who be try to catch my eye later intervene before they have speak they will be move down the list lifetime of hold particular mindset that be not support by evidence be not something would boast about have follow the evidence which show that short sentence do harm more than good the government have get the balance right and with respect to my right hon friend do not think that those who take contrary view have prison do not always work it work for the bad case but not for everybody and let we be honest about that that be exactly what the lord chancellor be try to do finally on sentencing hope that when we get the sentencing bill we will be give proper impact analysis on prison place and demand be sure that we will as for the criminal justice bill we all recognise that when people thumb their nose at the victim of crime people expect they to be see and hear the court pass judgment but welcome the tone adopt in the bill whereby ultimately the discretion must rest with the judge it be fair to give the judge further tool in the toolbox to use but there will be case the lord chancellor and have see this where people try to hijack the proceeding in order to grandstand or behave disruptively the use of reasonable force be well establish concept we do not want people be drag up at the risk to prison officer who do dedicate work and put their health and live on the line we have to get balance on this matter the bill achieve that and commend the lord chancellor for deal with sensitive topic in that way also hope that we will see in the victims and prisoners bill the opportunity to take forward some of our committee suggestion on imprisonment for public protection sentence we make number of recommendation and the lord chancellor have take forward some of they but believe there be scope for more he know my view on resentence but be also talk in particular about the way in which the life licence work be sure that there be an opportunity to improve that greatly so that we do not have people be set up to fail from the start there be good and sensible measure in this bill welcome they and hope the house will support it be pleased to be call to speak in the king speech debate on police and criminal justice as chair of the select committee on home affairs be pleased that policing be get the attention it rightly deserve but say to the government that far more need to be do quickly particularly on the vetting and dismissal of police officer who should not be serve in our police force and on specialist unit for investigate rape and serious sexual offence it be disappointing that not all police force have those in place our committee along with the hon member for gloucester richard graham have also call for spike offence in recent week the committee have be concern about whether we have the correct law in place to deal with some of the protest we have see and this issue of hateful extremism we hope that the government might address that as well totally agree with the call for statutory definition of child criminal exploitation the committee have be call for that for some time after today judgment on the rwanda policy may again commend to the government our report on small boat publish last year which contain range of policy option that the government might want to look at again we look forward to work with the home office and ministers and to scrutinise proposal and policy that be base on evidence and fully cost model want specifically to address the government draft terrorism protection of premises bill which be also know as martyn law the government be now plan to conduct consultation before table the bill in parliament and before respond to the pre legislative scrutiny that the committee conduct in the summer however it be worth remember that the bill be response to the terrorist attack at the manchester arena in and the recommendation of the inquiry and it be design to help to prevent such an appalling crime from happen again pay tribute to figen murray the drive force behind this legislation whose son martyn hett be tragically kill in that attack hope that ministers will be able to confirm the exact timetable for their consultation and when they plan to table the bill in parliament sadly we have learn from the king speech that the government priority for this session do not include deliver justice to victim of the infected blood scandal the big treatment disaster in the history of the nhs that is of course despite the government accept the moral case for compensation despite repeatedly assure we that they be work at pace ready for the infected blood inquiry to report this month and despite have receive final recommendation seven month ago from sir brian langstaff on compensation not to mention sir robert francis kc framework document which be give to they month ago the government do not even pledge to extend interim payment to bereaved parent child and sibling as be propose by sir brian langstaff and recommend clearly in his report be sure that member from across the house whose constituent include those infect and affect by the contaminated blood scandal will join in voice our deep disappointment that after year and five year of public inquiry with one victim die on average every four day this king speech be yet another waste opportunity therefore table amendment with cross party support to try to put this matter right let we be clear the government have have all the information and time they could possibly need to set up compensation scheme it appear that the miss ingredient be political will and that be not surprising with the appointment this week of the right hon member for salisbury john glen as the late paymaster general we have have nine holder of that post since the infected blood inquiry start in july those receive infected blood be not to blame for what happen to they and for the decade of delay in get to where this issue now stand they be certainly not responsible for the current state of public finance along with colleague on both side of the house will continue to push the government every step of the way until they finally do what be right and deliver justice for this group finally be really disappointed that the king speech contain nothing to deal with the bread and butter issue that my constituent care about one of which be the inability to access nhs dentistry that affect many part of the country and there be nothing in the king speech to deal with it secondly it contain nothing to deal with the coalition government have change planning permission requirement so that company want to erect telegraph pole outside people house to extend broadband connectivity can just do that in hull three or four company be do that without local resident be able to have say in it hope that the government will look at this matter again and have table private member bill on that basis shall speak mainly about the various bills that be design to make our street safe almost all of which fully support with one detailed exception also want briefly to express regret about two absence from the gracious speech the first of which be that of any change to the social care system that system have be creak for year and the government solution have be to give it some more money as sticking plaster every year we need much more radical change than that we need proper workforce plan strategy to keep old and more frail people in their home for long both by redesign housing and by use technology underlie it all we need much more stable funding system where we do not rely on council tax that be big problem the other absence be amendment refer to by the right hon member for kingston upon hull north dame diana johnson which have sign as she say that scandal have be go on for long time she talk about when the issue come under the purview of the cabinet office that be so long ago be the minister responsible and it be hugely regrettable that six year later we have not make enough progress let turn to the criminal justice aspect of the king speech they be clearly necessary and central to restore public confidence in the way we live in this country even in relatively prosperous and peaceful constituency such as mine people have significant worry about area such as town centre feel less safe legislation be require to address some of those issue but obviously that be not the whole answer the welcome increase in police number that we have see in recent year be equally important be delighted to congratulate ministers and kent police and crime commissioner matthew scott on the fact that we now have record number of police in kent that be significant step forward but there be always more to be do some of which be address in the king speech the sentencing bill strike the right balance be very happy to see the most dangerous criminal in prison for long and echo my hon friend the member for bromley and chislehurst sir robert neill the chair of the justice committee in welcome the provision on short sentencing my right hon friend the member for south holland and the deepings sir john hayes rise to ask legitimate question about recidivism look at the fact short sentence of less than month have reoffende rate of so people who have receive such sentence be more likely than not to reoffend but the reoffende rate for those who have receive suspend sentence order with requirement be less than half that figure at so the evidence be pretty stark that short sentence be not work to address the problem that my right hon friend legitimately raise strongly support almost all the provision in the criminal justice bill be particularly keen on introduce statutory aggravating factor at sentencing for those involve in groom gang be very much in favour of increase the multi agency management requirement on offender convict of coercive or control behaviour because other agency need to get involve as well as the police be particularly keen on measure to tackle violence against woman and girl many member on both side of this house as well as those outside include police and crime commissioner have do good work on that issue for various reason be less convince by the proposal to give more power to the police to enter home without warrant the police have perfectly good power under the police and criminal evidence act which give they various power to enter house and be not convince by minister argument for need more power indeed be even less convinced when read the explanatory note for the bill which say the law commission report publish in find that the process for apply for search warrant be extremely inefficient and delay cause by this increase opportunity for evidence to be lose we have therefore an important safeguard in place the need for warrant but we be extremely inefficient in use it instead of become efficient in use it we will dispense with the safeguard altogether put it gently to colleague on the front bench that that be completely disproportionate and frankly not the sort of thing conservative government ought to be do so hope my right hon and learn friend the lord chancellor will think again about that part of the bill in general be very supportive of the criminal justice and sentence measure in the king speech think they be both necessary and timely and can build on the success we have see in recent year under many home secretaries in enable the police to prevent and fight crime more effectively the bills be significant part of good set of measure in the king speech despite my individual caveat on that one measure will be proud to support the government in the lobby at the end of the debate rise to speak to amendment and on monday night the prime minister make speech set out vision for foreign policy with morality and value at its heart however the absence of anything in the king speech that even come close to promote the uk as positive and outward look nation show that this government embody neither morality nor value foreign policy with morality at its heart would not leave over million palestinians trap in humanitarian nightmare without food water medicine or power foreign policy that put value first would not be follow the direction set by washington and the united states in address this conflict foreign policy that be build on morality would not stand by as over palestinians be kill more than be wound and woman and child have their life take from they or as school hospital church mosque refugee camp and home be reduce to rubble foreign policy that be drive by value would not still be advocate the four hour pause that do nothing to alleviate the suffering of innocent man woman and child and do nothing to end the violence that those live in the region have face for decade foreign policy of morality and value would also not leave the government unable to answer just how many palestinian life will be take before they condemn the action of the israeli military in gaza that continue to violate international law act of collective punishment that clearly fall within the definition of war crime instead foreign policy of morality and value would front and centre advocate ceasefire that end the bloodshed allow desperately need aid to reach those most in need and create space follow the safe return of hostage from meaningful negotiation on last peace with over palestinian civilian and israelis kill since october and ten of thousand more wound it be clear to the united nations and every single aid agency operate on the ground in gaza that humanitarian pause do not do enough and do not go far enough the innocent man woman and child of gaza who be trap in the never end nightmare of conflict which they do not start and have no power to end do not need pause they need it to stop the only way we can achieve that be with real and immediate ceasefire remain clear in my belief that that be the right thing to do and the right choice to make if we want to see both an end to the bloodshed and last peace in the region which no humanitarian pause will ever be able to achieve that be why stand down from the opposition front bench also advocate for ceasefire rather than brief humanitarian pause because without ceasefire without real break in the fighting we will just see the unimaginable suffering horror death destruction and devastation continue to unfold in gaza without ceasefire the bloodshed that have already leave thousand of innocent civilian dead and have wound so many more that have leave child without parent rob parent of their child and see premature baby leave to die outside their incubator will tragically continue without ceasefire the desperately need aid and assistance that palestinians urgently need and cry out for food water fuel and medicine will not be able safely to enter gaza we will not be able to reach those who be most in need and that will lead to the death of many hundred and thousand more without ceasefire the negotiation work towards peaceful resolution and real two state solution for which the region can not wait any long will simply not have the space or the will to succeed that be why support the ceasefire amendment and why shall continue to advocate for ceasefire to stop the bloodshed to enable desperately need aid to reach those most in need and to create space for meaningful negotiation in law and order context there be rich and sad irony in today amendment on ceasefire the uk parliament be soon to vote on ceasefire in conflict over which the uk have no control and ceasefire that neither side in the conflict want hamas openly say that they will fight on to kill as many jews as possible not israelis but jews and that they would do what they do on october all over again if they could they openly say that israel will destroy hamas and will be do the world and indeed the palestinian people great service by do so ceasefire would play into the hand of terrorist and terrorism the scottish nationalist among other have engineer an amendment to this debate to incommode and undermine the labour leadership but what they actually undermine be community cohesion and the jewish community in this country if may want to address the jewish community in the united kingdom there be great deal of fear in the jewish community who feel decidedly unsafe and abandon vulnerable and isolated and who have effectively be ban from central london for several weekend now by the risible failure of police action and the one side prejudicial reporting of the bbc and other those factor have an adverse effect on law and order as well as on diplomatic move internationally we hear of deep hatred for israel from multiple quarter why do we not see mass demonstration and similar response when hundred of thousand of muslims and other be kill in conflict elsewhere some civilian include child have be kill in the past year in sudan and in yemen there be countless dead in ethiopia tigray and in azerbaijan armenia then there be china hard oppress uyghur muslims and the wonderful kurds be attack by turkey east timor and so on it be difficult not to come to the conclusion that the screaming about israel be base on the ancient hatred of antisemitism why else ignore large loss of life we see hate we see dissent and we see division wish to appeal today in the limited time available to different emotion which be hope say to the jewish community in the uk and to those of any faith or of none who yearn for peace and reconciliation to be of good hope there be much to be hopeful about why one of the prime reason for the timing of the isis style pogrom of october be the bloom flower of relationship between israel and saudi arabia it be apparently few month away from fruition and what wonderful development that would have be the saudi position as the keeper of the holy place be such that perhaps dozen muslim majority country would have soon follow suit and open relation with israel however all be not lose the good news be that that will still happen and the sign be that the saudis will still pursue the project for jews and many other yearn for peace it be something to look forward to it would build on the historic abraham accord of when bahrain and the uae bond with israel and that arrangement have bear rich fruit there be reason to be hopeful even with iran why there the theocrat in tehran be irredeemable they support and fund terrorism in many area and oppress and torture their own people but in due course the evil design of that clerical cabal will fail just as the evil design of so many other motivate by hatred have fail the iranian people be wise and cultured people and there be much to hope for there recently the people of iran have be encourage by their regime to chant slogan against israel to trample on large israeli flag place deliberately for that purpose at the exit of football stadium and to carry out other stunt but the persian football mass pointedly decline to do so what bravery and what nobility good sign of hope for the future what hope can we look to here in the united kingdom think lot we have see gang of proto fascist frankly crowd around marks spencer branch for example include one in glasgow wonder why the snp do not wish to mention that in debate rise the reality of the matter be that marks spencer which be once jewish own company but since have be own by thousand of shareholder be now subject to antisemitic attack year after its foundation mr marks first come to the uk escape ironically another pogrom this one in the but there be hope even there because can tell the house that marks spencer thrive like never before its share be up this year there be even more hope elsewhere we have prime minister who have support israel leader of the opposition who have withstand the brickbat and those who wish to divide and be defend the jewish people from insult and prejudice and sovereign king who be global leader and who will be source for peace there be no well hope than that we can not discuss confidence in the criminal justice system and police without tackle the long and balefully negative influence of the aftermath of the hillsborough disaster which although it be more than year ago have hugely impact how the police and public authority be see across merseyside and beyond the impact be widespread and intergenerational and more need to be do to tackle it have hop that we would see hillsborough law in the legislative programme to learn the lesson of the tragedy in which people be unlawfully kill by the gross negligence of the police responsible for keep they safe to date none of the south yorkshire police responsible for the disaster or for the subsequent cover up and campaign of vilification have be hold to account and now none probably ever will be while the family of the dead and survivor have endure decade of wrongly be blame for what happen and feel that they have to defend the reputation of their love one from the ongoing ignorant attack spawn by south yorkshire police deliberate campaign to shift the blame from themselves it be particularly difficult for family to feel frozen in time forever be drag back to their dark day as they have to keep repeat to ignorant people what really happen the finding of unlawful killing at the second inquest and the finding of the hillsborough independent panel the truth of hillsborough in other word yet the police campaign aid by some newspaper be so powerful and have be so enduring that we still hear tragedy chant at football match blame liverpool fan for what happen one of the big comfort that the family of those who die and survivor who still suffer to this day could have be the assurance that parliament have take step to prevent such problem from occur in the aftermath of such tragedy yet we have not do so that be why have introduce my public advocate bill repeatedly block by the government since that be why support the more general call for hillsborough law to try to prevent what happen after hillsborough from ever again affect victim and family who be catch up in public disaster through no fault of their own then find themselves treat with indifference or hostility by public authority and their feeling ignore there have be disaster since hillsborough and there will be more although we must hope to keep they to minimum the hillsborough law aim to rebalance the scale of justice towards family bereave by public disaster and towards survivor first it would establish public advocate independent of government and able to act at the behest of family affect after major incident to give they say and to use the learning from the hillsborough independent panel process on the huge power of transparency to stop thing go wrong as they do after hillsborough secondly it would place statutory duty of candour on public servant not just the police although welcome the fact that the government will legislate for duty of candour on the police that can only help to make thing well but by itself it will not be enough to prevent the recurrence of an event such as hillsborough thirdly the law would ensure proper participation of bereaved family at inqu through publicly fund legal representation and ensure equality of arm by end the limitless use of public authority budget to defend their reputation on those occasion no matter what the circumstance fourthly it will make bishop james jones charter for family bereave through public tragedy which have be voluntarily sign by some legally bind on all public body the government have recognise for year that there be thing that need to be change but be afraid they have be lamentably slow in do anything about they bishop james jones report which the right hon member for maidenhead mrs may ask for when she be prime minister be publish in more than six year later there have be no response to it find that quite shocking have be press the government to respond for all that time and there be no conceivable reason for they not to have do so at least since may when the last of the criminal trial collapse it be now two and half year since then and there be still no response can not understand what have hold they up the fact that the response have not be publish be an insult to bishop james and the work he do and it be try the patience of family and survivor who have already have to wait too long keep hear that there will be response soon and really hope that be true but be not hold my breath the victims and prisoner bill carry over from the previous session do contain proposal for public advocate which have welcome however the lord chancellor know my view be that his proposal be not sufficient to make the public advocate useful in prevent thing from go wrong in future in the aftermath of disaster it will simply be signpost service for those family who be catch up signpost service be all well and good and it be welcome but unfortunately it be not go far enough there be real opportunity to make sure that family catch up in future public disaster do not have to suffer the same experience as the hillsborough family but his public advocate have neither the independence nor the power require to shift the dial in favour of family or to torpedo cover up which be the whole point furthermore it be to be direct solely by the secretary of state which will not give it proper independence when the bill come back for its remain stage in this place which hope will be before christmas will keep try to make positive change to improve it because otherwise it will be an opportunity spurn hope that government ministers on the front bench will give thought to improve the current proposal because if they be enact as they stand they simply will not be enough to make real use of the lesson to be learn from hillsborough let start by say that have read the amendment on the order paper tonight and if could bring the hostage home and stop the fighting on the street of gaza would do it and would do it now but the truth be that can not no one in this house can be legislator in our domestic parliament so in this debate want to speak out against the wickedness of antisemitism it be not acceptable that any community should be cow or intimidate from display outward expression of their faith through fear of violence let be clear whether it be judaism christianity islam hinduism or any other faith we allow people to express their faith visibly without fear of attack that be fundamental to this debate it be not right for any british citizen to be hold accountable for the action of government other than their own my jewish friend and neighbour be british citizen last friday talk to young jewish doctor in the nhs who say charles be jewish in this country right now be very very difficult those be not the exact word she choose but the word think should use in the chamber worshipper leave synagogue in maida vale on saturday be abuse and suffer verbal threat the synagogue be near where grow up near where go to school it be where many of my friend worship this be not acceptable house in north london display mezuzah be daub in paint from top to bottom not acceptable without equivocation or qualification say this stand with good and decent people of all faith by the jewish community and if any jews face harm and those people will place ourselves in front of those jews to defend they from that harm that be solemn commitment on my part the jewish community in this country be people but it comprise my constituent my family and my friend and they be deserve of my support and the support of we all let get to the crux of the law and order part of this debate we have to deal with this as parliament and future parliaments will have to deal with it hate law do not stop hate we wish that they would but they do not hate be one of the basest of human emotion it be the consumption that consume the soul in the way that cancer consume our physical body be desperate to see peace really be want to see peace in so many part of the world but what history have teach we be that peace be reach when the cost of hate be so great when too many people have be kill when scythe be exhausted when nobody can take it anymore that be the moment that great man and woman of courage and enlightenment stand up from both side of that division and set their hatred and enmity aside embrace each other and hold out hand the world be complicated complex place if there be simple solution we would have find they by now they do not exist but there be always hope there be always hope on both side of this house we settle our argument through debate and we be friend on either side of the house there be big lesson in there for many it be pleasure to be call early in the debate usually wait lot long so get on with it get on with it say the labour front bencher on justice hope that the minister hear my hon friend the member for glasgow central alison thewliss speak about the violence reduction unit work be do in scotland be member of the cross party youth violence commission there be lot of work be do on this issue in scotland it be public health issue and yes education and lifelong learning have role in tackle it as hope the minister will take on board on the king speech itself this have be an extraordinary five day it start off with lot of the hard right wing rhetoric and now we see that the government have move or be try to move to centrist position it be quite extraordinary listen to the right hon and learn member for northampton north sir michael ellis and have hear other hope that he will condemn the far right thuggery we see at the weekend in london and elsewhere those be not counter protester the phrase have see be use but far right thug every single member of this house should condemn those individual who wear poppy on their jacket while show swastika tattoo at the same time it be an absolute outrage those be despicable sight at the weekend other measure be mention in the king speech after today supreme court judgment it be obvious that there will be yet another immigration bill that have be an annual event in this place since come here in to try to fix the broken asylum system in this country be concern at my surgery in govan on friday meet palestinian constituent who have be deny asylum by the home office he have not hear from his family in gaza for day and have be deny refugee status in the united kingdom that tell how broken the asylum system be and hope that home office representative will meet to discuss that particular case what be most surprising about the king speech be that it contain very few measure to tackle the cost of live crisis or as call it the cost of greed crisis that be take place across these island it be interesting that in america president joe biden have launch food poverty strategy to eliminate food poverty by the year but this government will not match that ambition here certainly intend to table bill on that issue because we need strategy to eliminate food poverty far too many of our citizen across these island be go hungry it be disgrace that that be happen in an economy like ours it be be leave to the rest of we to develop community shop network sell food at affordable rate or at cost to help people move away from food bank from emergency need we need that sort of system and we need the government to take food poverty in this country extremely seriously because as have say far too many people be in food poverty include far too many child it make weep when hear some of the story report to my office of people who do not have the basic essential we need essential guarantee in the universal credit system it be incredible that we have this ridiculous situation in which the universal credit system which be there as so call safety net be no long safety net for many reason universal credit and the social security system be also break there be opportunity in the king speech for the government to fix they but sadly they do not associate myself with the remark of the right hon member for kingston upon hull north dame diana johnson the chair of the home affairs committee about the lack of action on infected blood in the king speech it be no long good enough for the government to sneak out statement just before recess or prorogation talk about the lack of action that be take place for far too many people who have be catch up in that scandal we will continue to call that out there need to be debate and regular statement in this chamber so that member from all side of the house can call the government to account for the snail pace of action lastly will be vote in the name of humanity and support ceasefire in the lobby tonight it be privilege to speak in today debate on theme that many of we and certainly our constituent care passionately about reduce crime and restore faith in our criminal justice system be very pleased to see the victims and prisoners bill roll over as well as the introduction of the criminal justice bill and the sentencing bill both of which be announce in the king speech will focus my remark on the sentencing bill have not be shy about outline the key catalyst for my journey into politic but hope the house will forgive for raise it once more because it be very relevant to today debate for member who do not know when be year old my dad be kill by single punch one blow to the head and he be go in second he be when it happen it funny but at the time remember not think much about his age he be my dad so obviously he be just an old man but now that have reach the other side of it kind of make it all the more real and all the more stark with no warning on cold february friday night he be go leave behind and my mum and his own mother my amazing nannan sue for whom my dad be her only child do not want to talk about the perpetrator or go into detail about our specific case but want to outline the sheer devastation that this incident cause my family the family be the indirect victim of crime we may not have take physical blow but the impact of the psychological blow will be with we for life true life sentence through lengthy chain of event that follow have the privilege of be elect to this place and have make it my mission to raise awareness about the impact of single punch assault in few week time one punch uk an incredible charity will be launch its annual punch out cold campaign to show in quite grisly but necessary detail the impact that violence can have it be to remind people that yes it be fine to go out over christmas have few drink and get bit merry but it be never the right time to raise their fist hope members across the house will support that campaign why do talk about my family experience again today one of the headline in today debate be raise confidence in the criminal justice system and through my work with one punch uk know all too well that many family who be the victim of single punch assault do not feel that the criminal justice system be on their side victim support be patchy and varied and sentencing be feel to be far too low some would even say that it be insultingly low people have lose love one through these violent act and have see the perpetrator release within year know that no sentence will ever feel enough to make up for the loss of love one and the loss of all those future memory of what might have be but we must do more to restore confidence in sentencing there have be concern in the past about overly lenient sentence indeed in the sentencing council be ask by the then lord chancellor to develop guideline for one punch manslaughter and consultation be subsequently launch in in the seven year prior to that the average sentence for such offence be just three year and month frankly kick in the tooth for the family of victim who be already go through so much new guideline eventually come into force on november but in my view sadly they still do not go far enough for single punch assault the low possible sentence in the guideline be just month where life have be take and where the family of victim do go through life sentence that be for those with the low culpability and the guideline state this be for case where an unlawful act be commit but where there be no intention to cause any harm and no obvious risk of anything more than minor harm but think many across the house would agree with that that in itself be deeply flawed because when throw punch there be always an obvious risk of serious harm and the many one punch assault campaigner work with believe that sentencing for such assault should properly reflect that risk so it be time for new thinking that be why would greatly welcome discussion with the justice secretary and the under secretary of state for justice the hon member for orpington gareth bacon who warmly welcome to his new role about how the new sentencing bill could include specific minimum sentence for one punch manslaughter that fully reflect the severity of the crime and the real devastating impact on the family affect that would be concrete and tangible way that the government could restore and raise confidence in the criminal justice system for the family of past victim and heaven forbid of future victim of single punch assault have little bit of time leave so more broadly join the chair of the justice committee my hon friend the member for bromley and chislehurst sir robert neill in welcome the pragmatic approach take by the lord chancellor on sentencing with the most serious offender rightly spend more of their sentence behind bar for the sake of public protection while also focus on the very real need for rehabilitation for low level offender to frankly prevent petty criminal lose their own life to vicious cycle of reoffende and incarceration we know that criminal justice and social justice go hand in hand so be very pleased that the ministry of justice be take such pragmatic approach and look forward to support the lord chancellor and the entire justice team on this legislative agenda rise to speak to amendment and as have state publicly the attack against innocent israelis on october be an egregious crime against humanity the family of those kill continue to mourn the loss of their love one and the family of those take hostage pray for their safe return it would be grave injustice not to recognise the act of terror commit by hamas for what they be in the same way it would be grave injustice if the world turn blind eye while innocent palestinians be be murder by the hour more civilian have be kill in six week in gaza than be kill in month in the russia ukraine war more child have be kill in gaza than the annual number of child kill across all conflict zone since more united nations worker have be kill in gaza than in any comparable period in the un history and more journalist have be kill in gaza than in any conflict period since hospital have be bomb refugee camp have be bomb and united nations school have be bomb ambulance bomb bakery bomb mosque and church bomb northern gaza bomb gaza city bomb khan yunis bomb the rafah border bomb almost every inch of the gaza strip have be bomb more than innocent civilian have be kill and the hope dream and future of nearly palestinian child have end in mass graf some million people be flee death and destruction with baby die in incubator and pregnant woman have caesarean without anaesthetic there be no fuel to power hospital no food to feed the living and when search for clean water it be as rare as when search for gold make no mistake this be humanitarian catastrophe that be why urge member to back an immediate ceasefire on all side and push for the release of hostage that call be back by member of the un security council un agency the un secretary general the world health organisation the world food programme amnesty international and more than lead international non governmental organisation include oxfam save the children christian aid medical aid for palestinians the un refugee agency the pope and the archbishop of canterbury it be back overwhelmingly by the british public and now it be back by president macron of france almost every international aid agency in the world be say that vital humanitarian aid can not be deliver to people without ceasefire those be the very agency whose expertise we rely on in other conflict and take their lead so why not this time we need political solution to an issue that lead to peace not one that end in way so horrific that it embolden more terror in the region injustice be the great barrier to peace and we can not expect peace unless we enable justice to be deliver nothing symbolise our british value well than the statue of lady justice tower over the old bailey she be figuratively blind because justice be unbiased with the scale represent the impartiality of decision and the sword symbol of power and justice when israel act with impunity and attack hospital un school and refugee camp and the case for the palestinians be veto by the us and uk at the international criminal court the world ask whether our justice be really unbiased when we rightfully condemn extremist and genocidal statement by hamas but fail to utter single word about the genocidal rhetoric be spout by netanyahu and his right wing government the world ask whether our scale of justice be truly impartial when we follow the path of justice and the rule of law in the face of putin aggression yet israel continue to defy un resolution with empty word and no action the world wonder where be the sword of justice when we fail to provide equal application of justice in the eye of the world it be one rule for the ally of the us and another rule for the rest official report march vol those be not my word but those utter by the former labour foreign secretary the late robin cook in this very chamber word that sadly ring true year on our value push we to do well which be why despite all the risk to our personal position we must do what be right while it may be matter of convention to follow our close ally the us in the interest of foreign policy it be matter of conscience to step away from our close ally in the interest of peace we know that eventually there will be ceasefire in this current crisis every war end with cessation of hostility the question be not if there will be ceasefire but when for the people of palestine every minute every hour and every day that we wait be another orphan another grieve mother and another family wipe out that be why in stand to save the innocent life of palestinians and israelis and in represent the people of bradford west will be support the amendment that seek an immediate ceasefire rise it will be obvious to the whole house that great many member wish to catch my eye this afternoon so after the next speech will have to reduce the time limit to five minute interruption there be no point in people complain you come to and tell which of these people you want not to speak we be talk about fairness here interruption it be rhetorical question will stop dig number of member have reference the appalling practice of spiking so will begin by commend my constituent mandy and colin mackie who found spike aware uk follow the tragic death of their son greg who have his drink spiked support their campaign to have law criminalise spiking introduce in scotland and the rest of the united kingdom there be much to welcome in the gracious speech particularly the strong focus on tackle crime and keep community safe from crime and antisocial behaviour the propose measure for ensure tough sentencing for the most serious offence and increase the confidence of victim will be sure receive strong support not just from member on the government benches but across the country the devolved nature of policing and justice in scotland mean that my constituent and everyone live in scotland will not automatically get the benefit of those change that would require equivalent action from the scottish government who have responsibility for policing tackle crime and the justice system the experience of my constituent and of community across scotland be that when it come to these matter snp ministers promise big but deliver small on police number for example the snp government come to power in on commitment to recruit and maintain extra police officer over and above the full time equivalent officer who be then in place sixteen year later the number of police officer in scotland be little over right back to where we start from in the word of david kennedy the general secretary of the scottish police federation the state of affair in scotland for police at the moment be pretty bleak there be few cop on the street when we ask around people no long see the police on the street from my own contact with constituent know just how much they value and respect the work of officer work in their community but time and again concern have be raise with that there be simply not an adequate number of police officer work within local community to provide they with the reassurance they need and deserve have be give that clear message most recently by local people in peebles and gretna in my constituency where concern have be put to over the increase disorder and other type of antisocial behaviour continue report from those community and other of antisocial behaviour drug dealing and vandalism be worry and they be clearly make life miserable for the law abide majority there be no doubt that the scottish government have not be provide police scotland with the resource it need to properly respond to crime or to be as visible as local people expect the truth be that the snp know that be the case speak in the scottish parliament just month ago emma harper the snp msp for south scotland say understand that division in dumfries and galloway be struggle to meet the demand of its large rural region with the current number of officer what specific action be be take by the scottish government to recruit police officer to rural area such as dumfries and galloway as parliament official report october ms harper be entirely right to be ask why the scottish government have not take the urgent action need to recruit and maintain police officer in community such as the one represent my constituency be cover by three police division in dumfries and galloway there be total resource complement of officer in three year on that have drop to just in lanarkshire three year ago there be total complement of it be now in lothian and borders in there be local complement of officer which have now fall to it be the same picture right across scotland will therefore use this occasion to urge the scottish government to take page from the king speech and give proper focus to keep community safe from crime and antisocial behaviour ensure tough sentencing for the most serious offender rebalance the justice system to put the right of victim over those of criminal and restore the proud tradition of community policing which have serve constituency such as mine so well over the year by give our police the resource and increase manpower they need to do their job and keep local people safe call michael shanks to make his maiden speech mr speaker may start by thank you and all the staff of the house for the very warm welcome that have receive and for all their help when have so obviously become lost while move around the building be glad that choose quiet political day on which to give my maiden speech it be pleasure to speak in this king speech debate and in debate focus on improve our justice system there be much that we can do not just to talk about be tough on crime but to understand its root cause and tackle the underlie issue not least the poverty of opportunity that lead so many into criminal activity before qualify as teacher spend several year work with young people involve in gang and offending they be not bad people they be not bear bad they be people often without hope that their life could be anything more than what they currently experience when you lose hope when your aspiration be limit by your experience when you be unemployed or exclude from school be it any wonder that gang start to seem like reasonable option be glad that the police in england be learn from wonderful project in scotland as mention by my friend the hon member for glasgow central alison thewliss such as the violence reduction unit which do lot of work with the key to such preventative project be to continue invest not to cut and run when crime stat go down prevention absolutely work but in order for it to work we have to keep on prevent it be an absolute honour to stand here as the member of parliament for rutherglen and hamilton west say to my hon friend the member for selby and ainsty keir mather who give his maiden speech few week ago that he set the bar very high and somehow also manage to make feel very old for have be bear before the general election should say that be not too old as be still aged in single digit when tony blair become prime minister something share with my hon friend the member for mid bedfordshire alistair strathern who give an outstanding maiden speech yesterday also welcome to the labour benches my hon friend the member for tamworth sarah edwards who be similarly new to this place it be get to the point where we will have maiden speech every week perhaps general election will not be necessary after all for labour to form the next government it be customary in maiden speech to praise one predecessor and hope that the house will permit to praise my predecessor the cause of the by election will not have escape many hon member but meet countless people across my constituency who praise margaret ferrier attention on matter of casework and local issue credit be due to she for that towards the end of her time in this place she also start to give the hon member for strangford jim shannon he be not in his place for change run for his money on participation in debate hope that can match at least some of her parliamentary energy also pay tribute to my predecessor ged killen tom greatrex and lord mcavoy for their dedication to the constituency over many year rutherglen and hamilton west be steep in industrial and political history rutherglen itself be one of the old royal burgh in the land grant its royal charter by king david in that mean that in rutherglen will celebrate its anniversary which the community be look forward to mark blantyre be the home of david livingstone and the museum that stand where he grow up be not just thriving monument to his life but reflection on his complex past as both an abolitionist and fervent supporter of colonialism across the constituency there be legacy of coalmining iron and steelmaking such as the clydebridge steelwork in cambuslang which stand as sad reminder of the industrial decline of community such as mine across the west of scotland as labour mp the root of our founder keir hardie be in lanarkshire it be in rutherglen then call mid lanarkshire in just short century before be bear that he first stand for election for snp members the area also see one of their most famous by election in the election of winnie ewing whom we sadly lose just few month ago the seat also hold electoral history for another reason which thank the house of commons library for double checking until my by election result the only time that labour take seat in scottish by election be in in rutherglen then the seat be take from the tories this time around it be the deposit that be take from the tories and not return laughter thank everyone who support the by election and our volunteer be proud to say that unlike some other party in this place our campaign do not rely on zero hour contract leafleteer to deliver our election material enough of history rutherglen and hamilton west past be not all that it should be proud of it be patchwork of vibrant community from burnhill and rutherglen in the west on the border with glasgow to fernhill and whitlawburn in the south stretch through burnside cambuslang newton halfway blantyre and the western edge of hamilton which sadly will leave the constituency follow the boundary change some member may know of my somewhat irrational running challenge during lockdown when set out to run every single street in glasgow achieve it some two year and km later have set myself the challenge now of run every street in my constituency something encourage all hon member to do in their own path though that suggestion be dismiss in horror by my hon friend the member for edinburgh south ian murray when suggest we take it on together on my way around the street in by election that take six month meet so many incredible people do so much in their community it be constituency with fantastic sense of pride from the various gardening group that brighten up the street to the charity and organisation such as leap healthy happy the fernhill bingo the bowling club or even mo famous shop in blantyre which operate more as community centre than shop they do so much to bring the community together and reduce the social isolation that so many people feel especially after the pandemic it be community full of hard work decent people who be not shy of tell anyone what they think as any journalist who camp out on the main street of my constituency will remember during the recall petition and the by election they want the absolute good for their community and their family but they be rightly angry politically scunnere at be let down time and again by government distract and divide at the very moment they need they most devolution promise we the chance to make decision unique to scotland in scotland but so often of late it have become place not of high ideal of public policy but of manufacture grievance and division donald dewar speak of the scottish parliament as means to revitalise our place in this our united kingdom it feel to most scot today that neither the snp nor the conservatives be revitalise anything our much too slow march towards social justice continue to elude far too many my first contribution in this house be to ask the secretary of state for work and pensions to make work capability reflect the complexity of people with neurological condition it be cause close to my heart as be disability more generally far too many people potential be still limit by factor outwith their control system that we put in place so often hold people back complexity in the benefit system force people into poverty and destitution fundamental lack of compassion and understanding stall people ambition right at the moment it should be unlock they another lanarkshire labour mp and political hero of mine john smith put it well in choice between labour opportunity society which invest which educate and which care and the sad reality of neglect division and rise crime that be tory britain today choice between labour commitment to democratic renewal right and citizenship and john major centralised secretive and shabby government fast forward year and he could be talk about where we be today government who be incapable of deliver the change my constituent need it have become fashionable of late perhaps it always be fashionable to denigrate politic it be not hard to see why people see our deliberation here as foreign to their daily life but have also see in the few short week have be here mps from across this house championing cause that may only affect few people but affect they greatly as use to tell my pupil when be encourage they to vote politic change our life for well or ill and it be our responsibility to engage with it meaningfully have be elect be amazed to discover my former pupil take to tiktok to speak positively about which have to say work with teenager be not necessarily guarantee but would also say on reflection mr speaker that since arrive in this place be discover that the behaviour sometimes use to complain about in the classroom might have be more impressive than think laughter have no doubt that over the come week and month will wrestle with complicated issue and seek to further my understanding of topic will openly admit need to know lot more about none of we have all the answer although suspect that may come as surprise to some hon member but complexity should not be something we shy away from nuance which seem so lack in our political discourse today no doubt in part because of the role of social medium be an essential part of come up with the common sense solution that work for people be able to disagree without be disagreeable should not only be possible but something we strive for with general election on the horizon who know how long might be sit on these benches at least on this side of the house the opportunity to serve as john smith put it be about put our value into practice do not want to be here just oppose the tories but on the other side replace they for every day be here hope can serve the people of my constituency well hope have the confidence to stand up for those who be too often voiceless in our society and at least try to change some of what hold back so many people in my community this place be full of people with wonderful calling and hope can do the people who send here proud in the time that have what pleasure to follow the thoughtful eloquence of the new hon member for rutherglen and hamilton west michael shanks one of his predecessor tom greatrex shadow when be the energy minister and become great friend hope that he too might become good friend over time when be boy still young than the hon member for selby and ainsty keir mather attend my first conservative party conference in margaret thatcher the new conservative leader declare then that the first duty of government be to uphold the law if it try to bob and weave and duck around that duty then so will the govern and nothing be safe not home not liberty not life itself for civilised society be an order society and because it be the most vulnerable the old the frail and the less well off who live on the frontline of disorder they must be protect from it the hon member for rutherglen and hamilton west speak about the hopelessness that can lead to when people feel they be exactly that on the frontline of crime for that reason prerequisite of social solidarity be civil order where law be enforce justice prevail for all and the guilty be punish we in this place must stand in defence of the gentle yet too often in my lifetime those who shape criminal justice have be impervious to the harm their doctrine do detach from the concern of hard work people those with power be too often influence by guilt ride bourgeois liberal too many member of this opinion form elite have lose any sense of proportion about what matter and what do not they be unable to gauge the significance of triviality which waste time and resource unable to tell the difference between the petty and the pertinent many people often believe rightly that the criminal justice system be more interested in hurt feeling than in the hurt that crime cause they can not understand why element in the police appear to care more about silly social medium than they do about burglary and theft it be preposterous that half the call pass on to frontline police in recent year have be about social medium figure release in june reveal that the proportion of crime result in charge or summon be just slight increase on last year figure by the way which mean that of crime in england and wales go unpunished and that be leave aside those that be not even report meanwhile in the five year to an incredible people be record for non crime hate incident cause offence may be rude but be it really worthy of police time the liberal elite who offer multitude of platitude about equality be none the less content to see two tier justice system in which cultural relativism determine what be investigate and what be not the law must be apply equally to all whether they be eco fanatic or islamic extremist for such character in the absence of sense of proportion anything can be legitimise in the cause of self righteous purity and that include when they glue themselves to road stop ambulance take the sick to hospital we must end the culture of excuse and reward deviant and wicked behaviour recall from when study criminology at university in the seminal book rehabilitation and deviance which show that rehabilitative ideal have become so institutionalised that the criminal justice system have become disconnected from the core concept of justice crime be not an illness to be treat it be malevolent option choose by those who carelessly harm and damage people largely out of greed or spite or malice yet too many heinous and hardened criminal receive risibly lenient sentence we should not be let people out of prison early nor should we be suspend custodial sentence for persistent prolific offender that be not what the public expect it be not what our constituent want and it be not fair because it be not just crime must be punish and punishment matter because the public want to see law abide decent patriotic people protect from the minority who seek to do they harm be that too much to ask no authentic conservative should vote for early release and no authentic conservative should vote for the end of custodial sentence if any do they must answer to their constituent let begin by make three point first must congratulate the new hon member for rutherglen and hamilton west michael shanks on sparkling maiden speech it be worry for an old chap like to see such talent in one so young but have every confidence that we will see great thing from colleague in the year to come secondly strongly endorse the remark make by my good friend the right hon member for let get this right dumfriesshire clydesdale and tweeddale david mundell what he say about the police reflect my own early intervention it be true and it be as true of the highland of scotland as it be of the south of scotland it be too bad that we be lose so many cop in the way we be thirdly want to put on record my pride in amendment which stand in my name and those of my colleague it will not be take today but be proud to have be part of it the amendment make three fundamental point we hear from the hon member for glasgow central alison thewliss who be no long in the chamber some figure show how many innocent people be be kill it be absolutely abhorrent and appalling my party and believe many other believe that two state solution be fundamental to the future of that part of the world it be the foundation the rock on which we can build peace in the long term have be to gaza it be hell on earth before this late bombardment and it have be absolutely flatten over the last few week the hon member will know that one of the lesson from our peace process be that the only way to bring about political settlement be to stop the killing first when israelis and over palestinians lie dead surely now be the time to stop the killing and call for an immediate ceasefire that be precisely why the second main point in my party amendment be call for bipartisan ceasefire right now also want to emphasise that the future of gaza must not be about hamas we have to be very clear about that leave those introductory remark aside be surprised that the king speech do not refer to global warming or climate change as some right hon and hon member know the extreme far north of scotland have see some very severe weather wick harbour be damage in the recent storm and if that be not deal with speedily it will undermine or threaten the future of the harbour offshore wind development such as the beatrice wind farm depend on wick harbour as do the royal national lifeboat institution in that same weather the protective wall for the railway line lead from inverness to wick and thurso in the far north fall away and for period of time we have no train whatsoever that prompt the question of whether network rail be inspect the sea defence in the way that it should have be await answer on that this weather be real it be happen when be young we do not have weather like this we now have flooding landslip and all sort of damage have speak many time in this place about pregnant mother have to travel mile back and forth to give birth in inverness now that the road and rail transport link could be dodgy it make the ludicrous decision to downgrade the maternity service base in caithness even more dangerous to pregnant mother be glad that nothing bad have happen but we have have near miss with one of two twin be bear in golspie and the other in inverness it be just too bad and hope and pray that one day this issue will be revisit besides the weather it be hugely important that everything that the government do be it the scottish government or the national government have to be about address and prepare for climate change hope that much work will be do on this and that much will be say in the future but we have to get it go now before there be more damage and before my constituency infrastructure be far undermine it be very much in the good interest of my constituent that this work be carry out as soon as possible shall conclude my remark by again congratulate our young colleague the hon member for rutherglen and hamilton west on an excellent speech and look forward to hear his contribution in the year to come it be great pleasure to join today debate would like to remind my constituent that this debate be about the policing and criminal justice element of the king speech follow by vote on simple vote of thank for that king speech that king speech lay out our king government legislative programme which in this context be about law to reduce serious violence and violence against woman and girl and about raise confidence in policing and criminal justice wholly support my constituency neighbour the lord chancellor and secretary of state for justice my right hon and learn friend the member for cheltenham alex chalk and his commitment to toughen sentence for the bad crime such as rape while use community sentence more creatively for much small crime hope that he will continue to listen to my belief that define spiking update the offences against the person act and use new language to have strong nudging impact on young people will form crucial part of protect our constituent well it be particularly good to hear my right hon friend the member for dumfriesshire clydesdale and tweeddale david mundell say similar thing early not least on behalf and in support of mandy and colin mackie spike aware uk cause which they establish on behalf of their son greg hope my right hon friend constituent will join dawn dines and her stamp out spiking cause with many supporter on both side the lord chancellor would be work with the grain of feeling in this house and hope the new home secretary will work closely with he now turn to the amendment to the humble address my muslim constituent make an enormous contribution to community across gloucester and they make huge contribution to the multicultural diversity for which our city be such success not least at widden primary school which comprise more than different nationality be very conscious that many of my muslim constituent feel that today debate be about israel palestine and gaza and perhaps do not know that this be effectively vote of confidence on the government legislative agenda and the specific policing and justice issue cover in today debate the government approach to israel palestine and gaza have be lay out several time not least in two statement in the last week frankly the snp table its amendment to try to embarrass and divide the labour party and labour amendment which summarise the government position well be table to give any embarrassed labour members something to vote for in the absence of call for ceasefire something over which none of we have any control have be to gaza twice and see the horror of operation cast lead in what be happen today be many time bad it be humanitarian disaster but neither side neither hamas nor israel be call for ceasefire there be still large number of hostage and british citizen in gaza who need to be release and who need to get out it be not remotely my task to try to defend what israel have do over many year in the occupy territory but today be not the moment to call for ceasefire when neither side have any intention to observe one and when hamas have make it clear that they will continue with october attack and massacre for as long as possible will therefore not be support the snp and labour amendment will abstain on they and strongly support the humble address in response to the king speech our legislative programme particularly on policing and criminal justice be one that we should all strongly support in the time between the king speech last tuesday and today debate we have have not only former prime minister parachute into new cabinet job but yet another housing minister that be housing ministers in the last year four more than the number of chelsea manager over the same period it be simply not possible to build the house we need with that level of chop and change and when the average life expectancy of housing minister be less than nine month what can our new housing minister look forward to in the next parliamentary session we have finally have sight of the renters reform bill but whether it mean we will see an end to section no fault eviction be anybody guess as that depend on reform the court after year of tory governance we hear king speech that ignore the real problem that many of my constituent face every day the problem hear about more than any other in my weekly advice surgery be the chronic lack of social housing see number of constituent evict and place in temporary accommodation outside london hundred of mile from their home merton may have the low number of family in temporary accommodation stand at between and family but that be more than the norm it be small in comparison with the neighbour borough of croydon which have family in temporary accommodation and wandsworth which have more than council across the country be threaten with bankruptcy because they simply can not afford the temporary accommodation bill the quality of temporary accommodation be almost universally poor and shockingly there be not even requirement that family with child under two should have access to cot that be important because after read the datum from the national child mortality database we know that homeless child die between and as result of the temporary accommodation they be house in most of they be under one the most likely cause of death be sudden infant death syndrome because of lack of safe sleeping provision such as cot in the fifth large economy in the world child be die due to lack of access to cot surely there be room in the king speech for commitment to end that shameful statistic the all party group on household in temporary accommodation will be lead campaign in the come session to provide cot to every family with child under two live in temporary accommodation whether or not the government provide desperate family with cot we will still need the plan and the policy to build more house that be why be delighted to hear my right hon and learn friend the leader of the opposition raise in his conference speech the issue that and many other have work on in the past few year with professor paul cheshire of the london school of economics build on the grey belt within london green belt alone there be enough non green site surround train station for more than million new home my frustration here be not about park hill or area of environmental protection but the scrappy plot of land in town and city surround railway station that no one in their right mind would see as attractive be talk about the car wash in tottenham hale the scrubland in ealing the waste plant in hillingdon and the concrete airfield in wisley site that no one in their right mind would recognise as green belt if it be not for their designation issue plea to the government build on the grey belt to give my constituent the home they deserve and give child cot because they desperately need one it be pleasure to follow the hon member for mitcham and morden siobhain mcdonagh against whom have the privilege of stand in when be resoundingly defeat that show the quality of her work and the way in which she go about thing in this place and pay tribute to she it be privilege to speak in this debate on the king speech because genuinely believe that crime and sentencing be one of this government key success in the past year this government have deliver on reduce crime and make sure that we back our police on the street of our country crime be down by from million record case in to million today that be real success story and welcome the lord chancellor approach to offer rehabilitation to the offender who would genuinely benefit from it while make sure that we have tough sentence for those who deserve to be behind bar for long we have more police on our street now with in hampshire alone which mean more crime be solve in my constituency before talk about the impact on eastleigh let say gently that this afternoon we have have the same old labour party with labour members constantly carp about what we have not do but offer no alternative vision for this country member opposite can criticise but when be parliamentary private secretary at the home office the shadow home secretary would constantly stand up to say that we have not go far enough but would never say what she would do the only thing that opposition member have do be vote consistently against this government plan for tough sentence more police and sort out our immigration system the british public will see that when opposition member have to put themselves up at the ballot box in year time and they will be find want want to talk about this king speech and what the government record on crime and sentencing have do for my constituent as well as the focus on rehabilitation and tough sentence we have through the work of this government and our excellent conservative police and crime commissioner donna jones recruit more police she have plan for more because through devolution the government have give she the ability to channel fund into recruit even more police that have be enable by clear commitment by this government and prime minister and the last two prime ministers actually to ensure we have more police on the street than we have when we take over in after three year campaign be delighted that donna jones have listen to and secure new police station in eastleigh town centre to tackle antisocial behaviour and crime with focus on local crime which be blight many of our town centre that be fully accessible to my constituent with front desk and cid and investigatory facility in the building that show this government action to give people and pcc the accountability and service they want and give pcc that power deliver for the people we represent although there be lot of good thing in the king speech and there be much to celebrate want to tackle the minister on an issue that have be consistent driver for many colleague in hampshire and for in eastleigh fairer funding formula for hampshire police many hon member think hampshire be leafy county as it be in many part but eastleigh town centre be not leafy it be working class ex railway town that have specific issue with crime southampton and portsmouth two ex industrial city also suffer with specific issue of crime we simply do not get fund enough to deliver on the number of police we need in certain locality such as southampton and eastleigh we have have promise from various police ministers that they would look into this but they have not do so when the responsibility be hand out to the new ministers in the department ask the minister responsible for police to look at that again and meet to discuss how we increase that funding fundamentally believe that this be good king speech and that the government have proud record to defend on tackle crime for our constituent as say the shadow minister the hon member for stockton north alex cunningham can shout at but say to he again the people of this country have see government who have tackle and reduce crime and deliver more police on the street while the labour party have do what it always do which be to offer no alternative plan and to vote against the strong action we have take it be the same old labour party that be what it always do it be pleasure to speak in the debate if we need further proof that this government be out of idea and time be not go to mention the speech make by the hon member for eastleigh paul holmes the king speech provide that evidence because it take no action on the issue my constituent face on daily basis it do not even come close it do nothing to deal with the cost of living crisis the housing crisis or the climate crisis let start with the cost of living crisis if only to remind those on the government benches who seem to have forget the impact it be have on million across the country the cost of loaf of bread be high than it be this time last year how be family able to purchase basic essential at time of rise price inflation may be fall but that do not mean that price be fall how be family to afford housing when there be chasm between housing allowance and the low rent and when mortgage rate be soar how be family mean to save for the future amid the long squeeze on wage for generation real average weekly earning have increase by since in stark contrast to the increase experience between and under labour government the government simply do not see the housing crisis as priority we be now on our housing minister in year promise in the renters reform bill be subject again to indefinite delay because of the need for legal reform but every week receive email from constituent who have be give section notice they tell about the exhausting experience of be evict from the place they call home and have to live in state of limbo to pack up belonging and to leave support network and employment at immense personal mental and financial cost there be nothing in the king speech to protect renter just far delay and inaction the government promise to end rough sleeping by but again look at their record rough sleeping have rise by since on the climate crisis the government have take this opportunity to legislate for annual oil and gas licensing round deepen our dependence on dirty expensive volatile fossil fuel that will not only torch the climate commitment they have make but undermine energy security this will not bring down energy bill at home not my word but the word of the current secretary of state for energy security and net zero energy bill be double what they be two year ago by comparison labour would make the uk clean energy superpower go much fast on renewable and cut bill for struggle family in his conference speech the prime minister promise change he do so because everywhere he look there be record of failure the country know that it be not the conservative party that will deliver change it be only labour government who can lead we to an era of national renewal want to use my final minute to express my disappointment that my own care supporters bill which be put through parliament be ignore during the king speech it include the important principle that the care of love one be not an optional extra when person be in hospital or care home ask ministers once again to consider pass this legislation in the little time that they have leave it be pleasure to contribute to this debate on the king speech much of the work on crime and policing of course welcome tough sentencing for the most serious criminal action on groom gang and action on criminal gang facilitate illegal migration it be incredibly important too that we think about low level crime such as shop theft that be blight many of our community in ipswich town which represent we have see an increase in shop theft it be almost at the point where it be outstrip pre covid level data be often not collect on number of crime so we must have deterrent in place we have reach stage where some business in ipswich town centre be lock their door and people must ring bell to be allow in which be have significant effect on footfall there be also group of man hang around and behave in an intimidating way and this be put number of my constituent off of go into the town centre lose count of the number of time that when knock on door in my constituency be tell by people that they go shop elsewhere that they be shun their own town centre that be utterly depressing for people who care passionately about the future of their town have just do survey on the town centre ask people which two option out of eight be the most important to get they back into the town centre the first be the police adopt new zero tolerance approach to antisocial behaviour and crime will be work on with suffolk constabulary and the home office to make sure that that happen on the protest that we have be see recently and number of my constituent be absolutely appalled and shock by some of the activity that take place in our nation capital last weekend there be antisemitic poster display hatred that we hope have no place in our society we see the police post picture of individual spread hate the bad form of hate and racism those individual be not challenge at that moment it be not enough to post picture of these individual after the event say who be they can you help we the police should get in there straightaway hold these people to account and punish they for the hate they be spread to be perfectly honest however strongly someone may feel about any cause whether it be what be happen in palestine or anything else if they can not put their poster and banner aside for two day to remember our war hero they should take serious look in the mirror people can protest on monday on thursday or on friday but that weekend be dedicate to remember the good of we the people who have die fighting for this country and its value resent the fact that the march go ahead at the weekend do not think that they should have happen at all and make my view incredibly clear on that find it utterly depress that hundred of thousand of people seem to be prepare and think it be okay to go on that kind of protest instead of respect the people who fight for this country for what it be and for its value and institution will the hon member give way no be not go to give way in this speech have great respect for the police of this country but that do not mean that they do not sometimes get it wrong or that as member of parliament we can not from time to time criticise their approach to an issue it be completely legitimate to do so when activist in the street be aggressively call for jihad do not think it be okay to engage in semantic about what they may or may not have mean virtually everyone in this country know what that person mean when they call for jihad on our street and it be despicable that action have not be take against that individual it absolutely should be with regard to the broad issue of israel palestine mourn the loss of life on both side as everyone in this house do be utterly depressed about the situation as be most of my constituent want two state solution just like everybody else do but be not convince that an immediate ceasefire right now would work or be appropriate when one side would not respect it and have make that abundantly clear hamas must be destroy over four year ago go to kibbutz on the border with gaza my understanding be that good number of those people have now be kill in massacre we must never forget the evil that happen that day the enemy of the people of gaza be hamas and we must work cross party to support hamas be destroy at the same time every step must be take to minimise the loss of life but it be incredibly hard when hamas be use innocent people as human shield that be something we must acknowledge will focus on few key issue as we debate the first gracious speech of his majesty reign first agree wholeheartedly with the government on one issue the country need change however disagree that the solution be fifth tory term my constituent in merthyr tydfil and rhymney have be hit hard by the tory failure of the past year and they want and need the change that only labour government can bring in the past two year british household be the bad hit in western europe by the energy crisis due to our high dependency on gas it be shocking to note that during the bad energy bill crisis in generation we have an energy policy in the king speech that will not even take penny off energy bill it beg the question have the conservatives give up on bring down energy bill for british family the king speech be more notable unfortunately for what be not include than what be focus on today theme labour will rebuild public confidence in police and the criminal justice system and restore the rule of law on britain street thirteen year of tory government have see over of crime go unsolved mean that criminal be less than half as likely to be catch now compare with under the last labour government in our town centre police patrol have be reduce and there be still few neighbourhood police than in there be nothing in the king speech to turn that around near record number of victim be drop out of criminal million last year alone record number of crime have be million last year due to no suspect have be identify the proportion of crime charge have drop by since and the average time it take for crime to be charge have treble since from day to many of we receive feedback from our constituent that they never see bobby on the beat labour will restore neighbourhood policing put more officer and police community support officer on our street and introduce new community police guarantee to make britain street safe labour be already lead the way in wales despite not have responsibility for policing the welsh labour government have provide funding for more than pcso across wales labour plan will bring back proper neighbourhood police by ensure that every part of the country have more local officer and pcso with guarantee town centre patrol give every community name officer they can get in touch with so that policing get back to do what it be suppose to do know that many in my constituency and across the country will welcome that there will also be dedicated lead focus specifically on tackle antisocial behaviour in local area in south wales under the leadership of our police and crime commissioner alun michael we be already see great focus on tackle antisocial behaviour despite strained resource it be important that that focus provide an opportunity to work alongside partner in local authority the voluntary sector and elsewhere that work be all the more important against backdrop of significant financial pressure another issue want to focus on be the huge variance in fuel cost despite word from ministers motorist in merthyr tydfil and rhymney continue to be rip off at the petrol pump just on monday this week petrol be per litre more expensive in merthyr tydfil than in neighbouring area in merthyr tydfil driver pay per litre while motorist fill up in neighbouring town pay just national retailer asda charge driver at their merthyr tydfil store per litre more than in the neighbouring aberdare store the government should be look at regulation to ensure that driver right across the country get well deal when fill up it be hard to understand why after countless promise there be no legislation to ban conversion therapy in this parliament that be an absolute betrayal of the community and people at risk of such abhorrent treatment we know that conversion practice be abuse and should be outlaw but the conservatives have fail on that as they have on so many other issue countless conservative mp and ministers have promise to bring in ban and they should apologise for yet another failure to be clear labour would bring in full no loophole ban on such practice no one could fail to be move by the harrowing scene on our tv screen come from the middle east and be sure that everyone want this horror to end be support the amendment from my right hon and learn friend the leader of the opposition and will be vote for it later this evening finally despite all the government talk on create good secure job it be very disappointing yet again this year not to hear any measure to outlaw fire and rehire practice in the gracious speech especially since those tactic be use by company throughout the covid pandemic and the prime minister himself say that they be unacceptable on that issue as on so many other we hear rhetoric where we need action not just weak word from government on their last leg his majesty gracious speech to both houses of parliament be most illuminating in my view and serve as an excellent statement of intent from his majesty government remind the house that since there have be much progress in the area of policing and law and order the rate of reoffende then stand at but be proud to say that in the year it have fall to since violent crime be down by domestic burglary by and vehicle death by the measure put forward by the government in this gracious speech will be sure be welcome by people across the country particularly those who live in fear of crime and antisocial behaviour the criminal justice bill contain some excellent proposal we all see the terrible lucy letby case play out in the court and indeed in the press early this year the bill will mandate defendant attendance at sentencing hearing ensure that victim have the right to air their grievance with the defendant present and see justice do at first hand in addition to give great satisfaction to victim through the trial and sentencing process the bill will well protect child and young people by increase maximum penalty for those who have sell weapon to minor and by strengthen law tackle individual in possession of blade with the intent to cause harm if we can take knife off our street and at the same time increase the deterrence hope we can continue towards dramatically reduce knife crime and in particular the horror of child kill other child that issue have be priority for local police and crime commissioner include my very good friend and colleague commissioner mark shelford in avon and somerset however even with all the progress we have make so far it be still the case that in some of our community vulnerable and old resident be afraid to venture outside their home especially after dark and some young people may also feel intimidate by group of other young people the situation have get well since but there be much more to do and the criminal justice bill be massive part of the plan to improve our law and order and the safety of our community at the launch of the police and crime commissioner election campaign last week in county durham with my colleague councillor robert potts the conservative candidate and former soldier and police officer outline how the bill empower our policeman and woman to enforce the law well and to stand up for the victim of crime the bill will give officer great access to driver and vehicle licensing agency record and database in order to identify criminal and bring they to justice officer will also be able to enter private premise without warrant if steal technology track by gps be prove to be at the corresponding location the sentencing bill will mean that life mean life for the most serious and sadistic of offender who have take the life of other in addition it will ensure that the most serious sex offender will serve the whole of their sentence and will not have the opportunity for parole however when other prisoner be release on parole home detention curfew will be extend and ministers will have great oversight of parole board to ensure that they be accountable to the public those measure will ensure that we can keep our street and community safe and protect the most vulnerable in our society that must be the priority for any government and any police force while not diminish the opportunity for rehabilitation so that people can become well educate when serve their sentence emerge as well citizen in our society the protection and safety of child the vulnerable and the innocent must be our first priority indeed in the gracious speech the government announce legislation to empower police force and the criminal justice system to prevent new or complex crime such as digitally enable crime and child sexual exploitation include groom in addition the victims and prisoners bill will implement jade law automatically suspend legal parental responsibility for parent who commit murder or voluntary manslaughter of their child other parent to far protect woman in particular the government will bar prisoner convict of the most serious crime from marry or enter civil partnership in prison in england and wales to sum up the measure in the king speech encapsulate the value of the conservative government some on the opposition benches have pay lip service to law and order over the year but we conservative have recruit police officer and tackle reoffende and we be deter crime and make our community safe will address two issue in my response to the king speech both of which relate to violence in my constituency we have lose far too many young life to serious violence include since the start of september ronaldo scott and keelen morris wong both be brutally murder in broad daylight with huge knife of the kind know as rambo knife or zombie knife they both leave community of family friend and neighbour utterly devastate our community be play their part with support from our local council and the mayor of london in tackle the complex problem of serious violence but the government have not be play their part ban on rambo and zombie knife be promise in but in response to my recent write question the minister say that it would be do when parliamentary time allow the king speech be the moment in our calendar when the government set out how they will allocate parliamentary time so be dismayed that it contain no specific mention of ban on the large and most brutal of knife no one have legitimate need for hunting knife in london by fail to bring forward the ban the government be signal that they simply do not care about the violence be perpetrate in constituency such as mine the second issue will address be the horror that we be witness in israel and gaza the terror attack perpetrate by hamas on october be an unspeakable violation the large slaughter of jewish people since the holocaust and the large terror attack since we stand in solidarity with all those affect the injure the hostage and the family who be bereaved or desperately worried about love one hold captive in gaza israel have the right to defend itself as would any country in the face of such an horrific attack but that right be not without limit it be constrain by international law which protect civilian critical infrastructure such as hospital and critical supply such as food water medicine and energy we have witness month of unrelenting bombardment of gaza more than people have be kill home and whole neighbourhood have be destroy hospital have be leave unable to function and whole population be be deny access to food water energy and medicine we can not look at the horror and suffering on our tv screen and conclude that the scale of destruction we be witness be proportionate or that deny aid from enter gaza be within international law again we must stand in solidarity with all those affect the injure the family who be bereaved and those desperately worried about their love one in gaza have hear from thousand of my constituent who have be in contact with over the past month to share their view they too be completely horrify by what they be see and they want every possible effort to be make to stop the conflict they understand that that be what be signal by the word ceasefire in call for ceasefire no one be suggest that the cessation should be unilateral or without condition hamas must release the hostage in war ceasefire do not always hold and we must all be realistic about the intensity of this conflict but bilateral humanitarian cessation of the violence ceasefire be surely the minimum we should be demand in the face of such horrific suffering this be not minority view but the view of oxfam medical aid for palestinians islamic relief the red crescent christian aid and all of the major aid agency with presence in the region it be the view of the united nations and all of its aid agency it be the view of our former colleague in this place david miliband as well as of president macron the archbishop of canterbury and the pope on this issue the overwhelming prevailing view of my constituent be that where we have an opportunity to call for an end to the horrific suffering in gaza we must do so ceasefire be the word that they understand to mean an end to that horrific suffering my hon friend be make an incredibly powerful speech and be sure my constituent feel very similarly to hers think we all want to see ceasefire cessation of hostility and we need to have the step to bring that about however do my hon friend agree that we need to see not only the release of hostage but an agreement between these two war faction and the release of prisoner from the other side thank my hon friend for his intervention and he be right this process be not easy nobody be say that it be but my conscience tell that call for ceasefire be the right thing to do that be not unilateral lay down of arm but bilateral humanitarian ceasefire predicate on the release of hostage and lead to an internationally broker peace process and two state solution with secure israel live alongside sovereign viable palestine fully understand that colleague will have different view from those of their constituent and there be no easy response to this appalling conflict we must all treat each other with respect at this time but we must all be able to stand in front of our own constituent with integrity and at peace with our own conscience on the issue that matter most to they my conscience tell that must call for ceasefire today halt to this dreadful destruction and conflict far too many have already die on both side and more will continue to die if the violence do not cease we must call for ceasefire be very supportive of the policing and criminal justice aspect of the king speech but be very aware of the time limit on members for the benefit of ministers from my point of view at least will just touch on one aspect of the sentencing bill the government press release for that bill state the bill will also make sure vile criminal who commit rape and other serious sexual offence face the full consequence of their action and spend every day of their sentence behind bar to and to most people in the street that be common sense if judge say that someone sentence be year that be what be expect not five year just because that person have behave quite well in prison however would like to file that quote down little more it refer to vile criminal who commit rape and other serious sexual offence have some experience of the legislation around child sex offence rank very many of those convict of child sexual abuse as criminal so vile that they should be include in that category legislation in this country take big step to protect child against those criminal in and since then this country child protection legislation have be world lead the sexual offences act and subsequent development and improvement have be agree on cross party basis include the grooming aspect of that act the act introduce for the first time the big step in child protection the innovation of make child groom crime even today few member of the public and probably very few mp have any real knowledge of just how vile the action of many paedophile towards child often be in committee on the sex offenders bill in become aware that some member on both side of the house be oblivious to the vile action that many paedophile apply to child consequently arrange an informal cross party meeting of the committee with some of the top police from the met paedophile unit one mp ask the superintendent to describe the bad he have come across he do and it shatter the committee member they be aghast and shocked and that part of the bill then go through seamlessly will not repeat what the policeman describe suffice it to say that to call it vile be gross understatement those and virtually all other child sex offender male or female can only be describe as vile or bad some year ago be sadden to read short article in quality uk weekly by journalist who partially absolve people who collect child sex abuse material the article reasoning be that view the photo do not involve their actually touching child it be appalling individual who collect such photo create market that induce other to produce they by abuse child at the other end of the camera be child be abuse hope the secretary of state for justice and his ministers will consider include convict child abuser among those who should spend every day of their sentence in prison without early release that include those who may not have touch child but who by collect what be not infrequently thousand or ten of thousand of image of child abuse pornography be also culpable and should hence spend every day of their sentence behind bar as the judge may decide be appropriate when they be convict for the last five week have be watch in utter despair as hamas kill hundred of innocent israelis and take over hostage and as the israeli military kill over palestinians the overwhelming majority of palestinians who have be kill be woman and child not hamas fighter they have be kill in their home school and refugee camp in church and mosque while deliver aid and in hospital as patient staff and those take shelter at al shifa hospital premature baby lie starve be wrap in foil to stay warm and be wait to die there be no oxygen no food and no fuel to run generator as we speak israeli troop have enter the hospital put patient and staff at grave risk over at the al quds hospital israel have fire live ammunition directly at the intensive care unit with most of the victim be child there be no long any work hospital in northern gaza due to the depletion of fuel lack of power and constant attack have see picture of parent carry piece of their baby their child in carrier bag there be still thousand of people miss bury alive under the rubble of the half of gaza house that have be destroy across this country we have see hundred of thousand of people peacefully march on the street and urge the government to call for ceasefire despite the former home secretary brand they hate march the people of britain have continue to turn out week after week to demand justice for palestinians and contrary to what she claim the violence at this weekend protest be by the far right during the two minute silence to mark remembrance day embolden by the former home secretary extreme hate fill rhetoric they attack the police and chant islamophobic slogan today debate be about raise confidence in policing as former greater manchester police officer believe it be shameful that the tories be the big driver undermine that have visit israel and palestine and see the discrimination and suffering of palestinians in the west bank and occupy territory have champion the need for two state solution whereby israelis and palestinians can both live peacefully it be extremely painful to watch the sheer scale of palestinians be displace more than one and half million already that remind of my visit to un refugee camp in iraq where meet three generation of palestinian woman live in tent the grandmother have be displace in her daughter have be bear into refugee camp and that daughter have just give birth in different refugee camp three generation bear in three different refugee camp that be the reality for so many palestinians but it do not need to be like that if we have have ceasefire yesterday gazan child would still be alive today israel have already cross every red line imaginable and broken international humanitarian law history have show we that military action alone do not resolve conflict and israel use of force will not resolve this one we need full and immediate ceasefire now my constituent have demand that and will not refuse they support ceasefire be the very least we can do it be joy to participate in this debate on the king speech from the back benches again follow my year of exile in the government whips office if have more time would have comment on some of the amendment call for ceasefire and address the situation in israel and gaza and on some of the scene we have see on our street in this country over few week however due to lack of time can say no well than that agree with every word that my right hon and learn friend the member for northampton north sir michael ellis say early in what think be an excellent speech on the other aspect of today debate criminal justice and policing welcome the measure that the government be bring forward because they build on the positive progress that we have make over the past year to bring down crime and improve our criminal justice system clearly there be more to do and welcome the measure to ensure that those who commit the most serious crime and be convict serve the whole of their sentence in prison that be absolutely right also welcome the measure to address drug and knife crime and antisocial behaviour we be lucky enough in cornwall to live in one of the low crime area of the country but we have significant problem with antisocial behaviour the two main town that represent newquay and st austell both have significant issue with antisocial behaviour that issue be raise with frequently by local resident and look forward to work with the government to see what more we can do to address it labour members have mention raise confidence in police for the sake of transparency declare that member of my immediate family be serve police officer and as family we be very proud of they and the work they do it be incredibly welcome that we have deliver on our manifesto promise to recruit an additional police officer in devon and cornwall we now have serve police officer which be more than in december and record number we must ensure that those additional police officer be see and feel on the front line the public need to see and feel that we have those additional police officer on the front line and that be not always the case encourage the government to look at the reason why that be not see to be the case and to see what more can be do we must ensure that police officer spend their time do police work one thing have observe from go out on patrol with police officer in my constituency be just how much of their time be spend fill the gap leave by other part of the public sector whether that be the nhs the local authority or in particular social service it be not right that police officer be expect to spend so much of their time do work they be not train to do and that should be the responsibility of other part of the public sector encourage the government and in particular home office ministers to look at what more can be do to ensure police officer spend their time prevent and fight crime rather than fill the gap leave by other part of the public sector we also need to recognise that our expectation of policing have change massively in recent year and to understand the great scrutiny that our police officer be under many of they welcome that but some of the recent coverage in the media be have an impact on the morale of police officer on the frontline we need to be aware of that many be concerned that just for do what they believe be the right thing to deliver the job they may be hold up and possibly even lose their job while it be right that we hold they to account and that we remove those rogue bad apple that be inevitably in any organisation of that size we need to recognise that the vast majority of police officer be decent honest and professional and they simply want to do good job to serve the public and keep we all safe rise to support the amendment in my name and amendment and to highlight the failure of this king speech to ensure that the government uphold international humanitarian law yusof and his two old sibling count themselves lucky their dad radiographer at the local hospital in khan yunis have instal solar panel at their house so even when their neighbourhood lose power they could still watch their favourite cartoon that be what they be do when an airstrike hit from israel miraculously yusof brother hamed be unharmed his sister jury be find in the rubble she be injure but alive yusof mother search in vain for her young son she go to the hospital ask if anyone have see she handsome and curly haired boy it be yusof dad who find he his body have be take to the morgue yusof be seven year old when he be kill his dream be to be doctor when he grow up on his final day he run and hug his dad before he leave for work his dad recall yusof kiss and say goodbye yusof be one of the more than child and more than palestinians of all age who have be kill in israel assault on gaza the world health organisation say that palestinian child be be kill every minute yusof be one of those behind every number we read and behind every horrifying statistic we hear there be hope and dream just as real and just as valuable as your and mine can not believe that it have to be say but it clearly do palestinian life matter just as much as anyone else israel assault on gaza have now kill one in every palestinians in the besiege enclave hospital ambulance and refugee camp have be target premature baby in incubator let repeat that premature baby in incubator be die because hospital have run out of fuel in the illegally occupy west bank where hamas be not in power around palestinians have be kill by israeli force or armed settler we could spend all day list the horror that the like of the united nations secretary general amnesty international and human rights watch have say amount to clear violation of international humanitarian law and war crime the truth be that israeli official have be open about their intent at the beginning of the assault an israeli military spokesperson say that the emphasis in bombing be on damage not accuracy former head of the national security council say that the aim be to make gaza place where no human being can exist this weekend an israeli government minister say that the war would be gaza nakba reference to the catastrophe where hundred of thousand of palestinians be forcibly expel from their homeland and never allow to return none of that be to downplay hamas appalling killing of israeli civilian have condemn that already and do so again today repeat the call for the release of all hostage but as the un secretary general say none of those crime excuse what we have see since unlike those crime israel assault on gaza have be do with the government unequivocal support and complicity and almost certainly with british make see smirk on the government front bench personally do not think it be laugh matter when the government refuse to support ceasefire they give israel the green light to continue its slaughter of innocent palestinians when they refuse to support ceasefire they be refuse to push back against israeli politician and policy that aim to ethnically cleanse palestinians from their land be utterly horrified that after all that member of this house be still willing to give israel the green light propose nothing more than humanitarian pause there be nothing humanitarian

prosperous let begin by congratulate my hon friend the member for rutherglen and hamilton west michael shanks who be no long in his place on his excellent maiden speech be excited to witness for the first time as member of this place his majesty deliver his first gracious speech turn up last week eager to hear the government comprehensive and ambitious plan for the parliamentary session but what the government have to offer be nothing short of threadbare perhaps if the prime minister have spend less time on the phone to his predecessor try to get they to come and save his skin he could have draw up plan to get our country build again and to help work people get on the housing ladder sadly there be complete absence of home building in the government legislative programme the aspiration to own one own home sit strongly in the british people it be not just an aspiration to own property but an aspiration for security roof over their head and those of their family and solid foundation on which to build their future but far too many be lock out of that ambition watch as the dream of own their own home be erode by soar inflation record high energy bill and the high tax burden on the british people since the post war period the british people do not lack ambition they know the potential in their community but we must take the decision here that meet their ambition out there get the balance right between green space and build what we need be vital and it can be do the agricultural industry be so important to my constituent our farmland do not just contribute to the local and national economy but keep the country feed we can protect our farmer and their land while find space to build the home we need for the future green belt policy that protect disuse car park while green space be hand over to developer simply do not work the grey belt space be there often add nothing and in some case blight our community we must have the ambition to use it say to the prime minister that in west lancashire we be open for business skelmersdale be the most populated area in my constituency with around people make skem their home when the spade first enter the ground in skelmersdale in the the new town be intend to provide home to over people but year later we have not reach that number we have the potential to deliver the home we need to realise the aspiration of modern britain but we can not do that without the critical infrastructure that sit alongside it and have too often be ignore in recent development human being need more than just roof over our head we need connectivity service and community skelmersdale have be without train station since three year before it be designate new town it be one of the large town in the entire country without station and be the perfect candidate for levelling up fund but it have receive none project such as new railway station in skem would constitute genuinely new offer for transport regeneration in the north west claim that the government be level up through investment in the network north project be also frankly laughable despite fanfare and promise there be little on offer for community like mine the now prime minister once boast about change the public funding formula to divert funding away from deprived urban community to more prosperous town since then community cry out for investment have see more of the same take cursory glance at some of the project reference in the government network north proposal and you will find that many of they already exist it be not just our train that be not work devoid of idea and vision for this country the government send their own mps home early on half the parliamentary sitting day in the last session there be no sign of that change with the king speech which contain the few new bills in almost decade the sad reality of the situation be that the prime minister have no confidence in his government to get legislation through parliament he do not even trust his own mps enough to make one of they the foreign secretary even bad than that the prime minister seemingly have no confidence in himself like king midas on opposite day everything he touch turn to disaster it be clear that the government have give up on governing so why not let the british people decide at general election it be privilege to represent the constituent of ruislip northwood and pinner which be characterise by very strong community spirit in the eight village that make up the constituency thankfully today our metropolitan police figure show that from harefield to hatch end we continue to experience low level of crime overall and that it be safe place to work live and raise family however many constituent remain concerned about matter relate to law and order as part of the greater london area comprise our capital issue from disorder associate with recent march in the centre of london through to the rise impact of online and digital crime be at the forefront of our mind even in an area which look and feel safe to most resident there be example of particular individual and group feel vulnerable they deserve our attention to ensure that this be place where all our people be able to feel and be safe that be why welcome the measure contain in the king speech that aim to update our law to take account of change circumstance in the world and in our society to keep people safe in the face of the emerge challenge the victims and prisoners bill represent suite of measure intend to improve the way in which we deal with crime and the victim of crime engage with constituent have be strike on number of occasion by the need to ensure effective and appropriate support for woman and girl who have be victim of crime target against they particularly in our local area harassment on public transport welcome transport for london response to our lobbying seek to make public transport safe space for woman and girl the move to place the victim code on statutory footing and the minimum service level set out for victim be great opportunity to ensure that our response after crime be of high and more consistent standard than have be the case in the past on the whole our police do an excellent job in always challenging circumstance but ensure that all victim benefit from consistent standard of treatment will far build public confidence in our police the digital markets competition and consumers bill represent significant step forward in help constituent to feel confident online robbery have become vanishingly rare occurrence in my constituency and across the capital but scam online fraud and target crime such as push payment fraud be become significant and grow concern to many for those who for whatever reason may feel less confident go online they be barrier to engage in our increasingly digital society as we have see that growth it be welcome that the government be respond with effective measure to deal with digital crime as that have parallel consistent fall in in person crime our legal framework need to be update through the bill to take account of the change world and its new risk finally wish to touch briefly on the ceasefire amendment like all member have receive many representation about the event follow the hamas terror attack of october and the target massacre of civilian represent very diverse constituency and have engage with constituent who have be personally affect both by the event in israel and the attack and issue for family member in gaza each have present incredibly distressing issue which know have move many in the whole country and have be express in this house tonight particularly welcome the work do by the government as well as the regular update on it that

represent progress ours be country that uphold international law and remain committed to the lead example of international human right law the european convention on human right base on our own domestic law as well as the wide international law of war and humanitarian law therefore welcome the government clear and unambiguous commitment to press all party to ensure that those law be respect in israel and gaza the note of realism that be strike by the right hon member for wolverhampton south east mr mcfadden he be not in the chamber this evening on the bbc this morning very much reflect my view that there have be long term cycle of violence that be cost many life on both side especially since hamas take over the governance of gaza in their absolute refusal to countenance ceasefire now or on any previous occasion tend to nullify the humanitarian purpose of ceasefire call from many quarter if we be to break that long term cycle of violence we need to ensure that we do not vote for ceasefire that would undermine that my constituent know that stand in solidarity with those affect by the atrocity in the middle east as liberal democrats we call for an immediate ceasefire and two state solution and path to peace in the long term it be privilege to speak in debate on the king speech the king first speech may begin by pass my condolence to the family of lord cotter brian cotter be somerset man and tireless advocate for both small business and mental health the home secretary may have change but it be still same old with this government charge rate be the low they have be for year especially those for burglary one of my constituent have worth of equipment steal in september and have still not meet an officer while welcome the success of operation soteria bluestone pioneer by the avon and somerset force it be not enough for the government to rest on the laurel of the academic and the officer who create it we need to create pipeline of trust by commit ourselves to educate all boy and man about violent crime against woman and girl we also need more officer from diverse background and policing culture that welcome and value they simple number in uniform be simply not enough without thorough vetting and training we need trust visible and local community police officer who be much more effective in their community than police and crime commissioner the liberal democrats have already commit themselves to all those change delay be the mantra of this government and nowhere do we feel that more than in somerset we be miss out on new home because they be in the level and moor catchment area designate site of special scientific interest endanger by the high level of phosphate in our water system have constituent on the waiting list for affordable housing in frome the average rent be nearly month make up of the average salary one family of six be currently live in two bedroom apartment at this point must declare an interest as proudly active somerset councillor without new house the council can not enforce section agreement that make developer provide fund for the benefit of local community or claim the community infrastructure levy recent no cost trial in the west country lead by somerset council show that modular water treatment unit remove more than of phosphate and of nitrate want to see the somerset partnership bid to the nutrient mitigation fund grant and adopt across those affect area we do not need to be stick in an archaic binary of either not build anything or scrap environmental safeguard the liberal democrats will use new blue flag standard to protect our water include wild swimming area such as the site in farleigh hungerford in my constituency we will also build new social home year those aim do not need to be mutually exclusive as farmer could see that the only potential brexit benefit be common agricultural policy reform but the government have botch that leave many farmer on the brink farmer need

work hard to ensure that nobody be out of reach of banking service and affordable food the liberal democrats listen plan and act please let move forward let call general election now would like to start by thank his majesty king charles iii for his speech and echo the comment of many of my hon friend and colleague regard how special it be to be speak in the first king speech debate for year today debate on police and the criminal justice system be of particular significance as these be issue be often contact about as the member of parliament for broxtowe the safety of our family and love one must be of the high priority it be reassuring to see the sentencing bill announce in the king speech tough sentence for the bad offender will ensure that dangerous individual be off our street and not endanger the public would like to put on record my personal thank to all those police officer in the uk who serve our country especially those within nottinghamshire and also to thank all those who work for the police in support role will single out one individual in particular neighbourhood policing inspector inspector mike ebbins who regularly meet to discuss the specific crime affect people in broxtowe it be essential that we be keep our community safe this will also be achieve through the criminal justice bill which seek to empower our police force and justice system to prevent crime such as digitally enable crime be glad to see focus on the welfare of victim keep victim at the centre of our criminal justice system and ensure that as much support as possible be in place for they be essential welcome these new measure especially the proposal in the victims and prisoners bill to monitor how criminal justice body comply with the victim code the bill also set out plan to improve support for victim include statutory duty for partner agency to collaborate the bill will have hugely positive impact on those most need our support would like to put on record my deep disappointment that mental health bill be leave out of the king speech since first be elect have be campaign for mental health reform and the increase support that be desperately need across the uk be encourage recently when the government publish the suicide prevention strategy but it do not go far enough stand in this chamber in and debate the huge merit of the mental health act white paper have person centre approach to in patient facility and remove autism and learn disability from be categorise in the act as mental health disorder be change that be miss today and that be of course detriment to many throughout the uk implore the government to start prioritise mental health reform as soon as possible the king speech also discuss the importance of look after veteran as veteran myself be passionate that the uk should become the good country in the world for veteran to live the government have make huge stride in veteran care in recent year and we have the first ever minister for veterans affair attend cabinet in order to prioritise that care we have have many success in improve service for veteran since establish the office for veterans affairs such as the dedicated referral pathway for mental health physical health and homelessness establish by operation courage operation restore and operation fortitude recently have the pleasure of open the first ever military service leaver pathway into policing which be proud to champion the course be the first of its kind and look forward to see service leaver take up their place in nottinghamshire police my hon friend make very interesting point on the value that veteran can contribute not just to public sector employer such as the police but to so many private sector employer military service be driver in raise skill level do he have any thought on how these skill could be well use in future completely agree with my right hon friend about the value of veteran transferable skill teambuilding and sense of duty those thing be important and can be transfer to many form of employment particularly police the military to police scheme give veteran direct pathway into the police via the police constable degree apprenticeship ensure that skill gain in the military be transfer to new career follow shortened training scheme it would be remiss of not to mention my disappointment at see incredibly important area such as mental health not address in the king speech as they should have be however welcome the propose bills and believe that many will have directly positive impact on my constituent in broxtowe in speak to amendment and the house will be aware that have openly call for negotiate ceasefire on both side along with the release of all hostage however neither the israeli government nor hamas have agree to an immediate ceasefire hamas have state that they will continue with their strike against israel and they have not heed repeat call by the un and other for an unconditional release of all hostage likewise the israeli government have reject grow international call for ceasefire and have continue with their relentless bombing israeli prime minister netanyahu have state that ceasefire would be possible only if all hostage be release who be suffer intolerably in the meanwhile the palestinian people after the hamas terror strike that tragically result in the killing of well over israelis tell the prime minister on the floor of the house that while israel have right to defend its citizen and rescue its hostage its response must be proportionate and submit to international law however over palestinians and rise have be kill shockingly in just day one in every people live in gaza be no more have be particularly horrify by the killing of more than innocent child that be one child die every minute the number of child kill in just over four week of israeli bombardment have surpass the number kill in conflict zone across the globe every year since as parent of two child can not imagine what their parent be go through if indeed they be still alive whether or not the israeli government and hamas listen to our plea believe we must call for an end to the violence to save life the netanyahu government must be make to realise that raze gaza to the ground and indiscriminately kill palestinians will not lead to safety and security for people live in the region it will merely fuel more anger and resentment take we far away from peace and prosperity for all and from viable two state solution have always speak up for human right and in the past six year have often speak up for innocent palestinians who have suffer decade of injustice occupation and forceful removal from their home they be now face an atrocious siege and further bloodshed my hon friend be make some important point do he agree that we need ceasefire or cessation of hostility we can use whichever word we choose sense he do agree with that or certainly with the sentiment do he also have frustration that the scottish national party amendment before we tonight be design as political ploy and therefore we will not be vote for it and will vote instead for the labour amendment thank my hon friend who be correct in what he say lot of our constituent will not be aware of the procedure and protocol of parliament and how labour members hardly if ever vote for any snp amendment this raise another important point that my constituent have be email about sign early day motion have be try to explain to constituent on the doorstep and elsewhere that hundred of early day motion be in circulation at any give time and that shadow ministers such as myself and minister never sign they and they do not have the requisite power those be some of the protocol that my constituent and other will not be aware of wish to thank the labour front bench team who have listen patiently to the passionate argument of member such as myself and table comprehensive amendment last night address our concern first it call for an end to the violence in israel and palestine that be what we all want to see secondly it reaffirm the jurisdiction of the icc to address the conduct of all party so that we can ascertain what war crime have occur thirdly it call on israel to lift the siege condition allow food water electricity medicine and fuel into gaza fourthly it call on we to guarantee that people in gaza who be force to flee during this conflict can return to their home and seek an end to the expansion of illegal settlement and settler violence in the west bank fifthly it address the road map and how we can get an endure cessation of fighting basically ceasefire as soon as possible and credible diplomatic and political process to deliver the last peace of two state solution as the member of parliament for what be recently vote the most royalist constituency in the country old bexley and sidcup it be an honour to speak in this historic debate and to thank his majesty for his first gracious speech as king which set out the government priority to make the difficult but necessary long term decision to change this country for the well be proud of not only our royal family and the pageantry of this country which be clearly on display at last week state opening but of our police officer throughout the country include our brilliant police officer in old bexley and sidcup and their dedication to our local community that be the drive force of our raise confidence in policing which be of course key part of today debate would also like to place on the record my thank to sergeant dave catlow and all the team for their ongoing work in tackle vehicle crime and to congratulate police community support officer steve graves on his year of service to our community welcome the fact that the king speech reaffirm the government commitment to keep community safe from crime antisocial behaviour terrorism and illegal migration at time when threat to national security be change rapidly due to new technology it be welcome that the government will give the security and intelligence service the power they need and will strengthen independent judicial oversight through the investigatory powers amendment bill also welcome the fact that the king speech announce that legislation will be introduce to well protect public premise from terrorism in the light of the manchester arena attack through the terrorism protection of premises bill that be an issue my predecessor and friend the late james brokenshire work so diligently on during his time as security minister one of the good way to raise confidence in police in london be to ensure that the thousand of decent hard work police officer can continue to focus on fight crime in the community they serve however under the labour mayor of london as the police and crime commissioner for london that be difficult for community such as bexley because his tri borough policing policy negatively impact community police in bexley as well as the ability of police to connect with community and respond to crime in timely manner it be also extremely inefficient to merge police resource in borough with so little in common often leave safe borough such as bexley with few resource as we have see in recent week when there be protest in central london have more police officer be central to have visible police and law enforcement presence so welcome the successful recruitment of an extra police officer by the end of march this year bring the total number to nearly officer across the country and reflect the government determination to ensure that people feel safe in their community notably this year billion police settlement include specific funding for pcc to drive the recruitment of those officer sadly it be frustrating and concern that despite be give that extra money by the government to hire more police officer the mayor of london have fail to spend it and the metropolitan police service be the only force in the country to fail to hit its recruitment target miss out on over extra officer who could be help to keep londoner safe despite his ongoing claim to have no money and despite blame everyone else for his many failure over the past seven and half year as mayor he have have to pay some of that money back to the government for fail to hit that target sadiq khan have also close many police front counter such as the one at sidcup station quite clearly the mayor of london need to be put into special measure right now it be of paramount importance that the police be equip with the power and tool they need to protect the public welcome government measure to tighten the law around zombie knife and recognise that stop and search be an important tool to keep our street safe when use properly about knife and weapon be take off the street every month use stop and search in london alone also welcome that the government my right hon friend the minister for crime policing and fire be in his place be look closely at scan and search to help detect knife will continue to lobby for that give its potential to help improve community safety and end that awful crime restore confidence in our criminal justice system go hand in hand with restore confidence in police that be vital in our action to tackle violence against woman and girl and wholeheartedly support the step that the government be take it be right that the most serious offender include those who have commit violent and sexual offence should spend more time in prison to help keep the public safe every day since october news from gaza and israel become yet more painful to watch even for those of we who can choose to look away while the horrific attack on israeli citizen by hamas be appal the response by israel military be devastate the life of ordinary people in gaza my party have hear the testimony of several welsh palestinian family who have lose relative in gaza aymen aladham an it consultant in swansea have tell we how in three separate air strike in gaza last month he lose member of his family the pain and anguish people such as aymen must be experience now be beyond imagine those who survive must seek shelter in diminish number of place half of all gaza home be damage or destroy university and school be under frequent attack we be witness in real time the complete collapse of vital infrastructure to support human life include power line and water desalination plant one doctor describe how hospital in gaza be now practise medieval style medicine with premature baby huddle together to keep warm because their incubator no long work and doctor operate on patient without electricity or anaesthetic in what perversion of international law can anyone justify turn hospital into battlefield that must end the un secretary general have say that in the name of humanity there need to be ceasefire now it be clear that humanitarian pause alone be not enough first the fact on the ground render they invalid the un agency for palestine have say that communication in gaza will start to fail as of tomorrow when telecommunication company run out of fuel to operate their data centre and major connection site without reliable communication people will not know when the current four hour pause in the bombing begin or indeed when they can begin to undertake the perilous journey across gaza without access to fuel secondly pause as oppose to ceasefire presume and make accommodation for the resumption of violence which mean more child die more home destroy and more life ruin pause be tacit endorsement of the position that more bomb and bullet be the answer to this crisis rather we should be reach for political solution use diplomacy and dialogue that can happen only with full and immediate ceasefire not only would this stop needless death of palestinians but it would of course allow for the safe release of the hostage capture by hamas last week plaid cymru table motion in the senedd call for an immediate ceasefire be pleased to say that the motion pass with labour mss and one liberal democrat ms join our call for peace some people here may doubt the strength of the senedd call for ceasefire but together nation after nation can make powerful statement for peace and westminster now have the opportunity to join wales we can show the innocent civilian in gaza and the family of israeli hostage who be desperate for their safe return that we stand with they we can tell the world that antisemitism be intolerable and that islamophobia be intolerable these be the voice that need to be hear when we use the ability of this place which be great to amplify call it be in that spirit of unity and peace that urge colleague from across the house to support the amendment today finally to those who say that this amendment have be table for political reason say that they be do that thing that belittle we in the eye of many of our constituent we be talk about party political interest we all have constituent who believe firmly that ceasefire be the only and the right way forward it be our duty in this place to enable their voice to be hear and shall be support amendment apologise but in order to get the last seven member in we will have to drop the time limit to four minute it be pleasure to speak in this debate on his majesty first king speech especially on the vital issue of crime and confidence in our police and criminal justice system under the conservative government crime and antisocial behaviour be have massive impact on community in erdington kingstanding and castle vale last year my constituency have the high rate of knife crime in birmingham in one area cover stockland green and kingstanding the west midlands ambulance service be call out to treat on average three victim of knife crime every month constituent contact last month he say my friend recently have his skull crack on the high street four guy try to rob he and then stamp on he have see police officer up there in month host meeting last month of all the local trader on our high street in erdington one woman tell that she work alone all day she say that from am to pm there be constantly people deal drug outside her shop when she arrive while she be work and when she close up but unfortunately even though she constantly ring the police she never see anybody the conservative government have cut the police force by since labour leave office leave we with the low number of officer since the early that be reckless and short sighted it be no wonder that our local community do not trust the government action on antisocial behaviour there be not any on the impact that the king speech could have have it could have pledge to restore neighbourhood policing as labour have and put more officer and pcso on our street it could have guarantee town centre patrol as labour have pledge to so that people could walk down high street such as mine after pm and at night without worry about violence unfortunately that have not happen the government be wrong to think that our constituent will give up we need to stop the decline and start fight for well future finally want to talk about the struggle have have with the snp amendment have be contact by hundred of constituent who like many across the uk have be witness horrifying scene in israel and gaza since october be nurse and can not sit idly by while know that people be face the bad suffering imaginable especially elderly woman and baby in hospital across gaza it be clear to that we need increase humanitarian aid that be why be call for temporary bilateral ceasefire to ensure that innocent civilian leave gaza and access the aid that they desperately want ask this house to think twice about the snp amendment because it have be table to cause division and together we stand divide we fall it be with great sadness and frustration that must speak again in this house about the failure of the government to uphold the responsibility that they have to the people unlawfully kill at hillsborough to their family and friend and to survivor after year of the fight by family for truth and justice the inquest the long jury hearing in british history end with juror rule that the fan who die at the fa cup semi final be unlawfully kill and that the catalogue of failing by police and public official contribute to their death shamefully nobody have be hold accountable for the needless death injury and endure trauma suffer at hillsborough despite the inquest verdict we need change in law to ensure that the pain and suffering of the hillsborough family be not repeat and that there be legacy from the tragedy in the then prime minister the right hon member for maidenhead mrs may ask the then bishop of liverpool reverend james jones to conduct review into the lesson to be learn from hillsborough the recommendation of that review call the patronising disposition of unaccountable power be publish in november six year later on november in letter send out by the former home secretary the government promise to publish their full response to bishop james jones report on wednesday december will the minister confirm either at the dispatch box now or in writing that that commitment will be honour there can be no more delay in the time we have wait for the government to respond parliament could have pass the public authority accountability bill initially present to the house by the then member for leigh now mayor andy burnham those law could be in force today but the government choose not to introduce they after six year we instead have the government draft criminal justice bill publish this week it mention duty of candour in clause but only in the context of code of conduct that be an insult to all those who have be affect by state cover up and to the memory of the it do not establish or define the duty in law it provide no mechanism for compliance or enforcement crucially the government do not appear to be introduce statutory duty of candour on all public official as hillsborough law now campaigner demand and as my party thankfully support we need legal duty of candour on all public authority and official to tell the truth and proactively co operate with official investigation and inquiry bring to an end the depressingly familiar pattern of cover up and concealment nothing less will do in the six year that we have wait parliament could also have pass the public advocate bill introduce by my right hon friend the member for garston and halewood maria eagle instead the government have propose legislation in the form of the victims and prisoners bill that be pale imitation of what the hillsborough family and survivor have spend year campaign for the bill do not make the public advocate independent have no power or statutory duty and will only report on what the secretary of state direct it to report on what the government have put forward in the king speech be certainly not hillsborough law amendment which have table to the humble address call for the right to food to be enshrine in law and thank the hon member who have sign it hunger be political choice make by this government at the moment in my great city one in three people live in food insecurity and there be nothing in the king speech from the government that would address the crisis my west derby constituent face we need systemic change we need right to food enshrine in uk law so that everyone include all child be legally protect from the scourge of hunger associate myself completely with the remark of my good and hon friend the member for liverpool west derby ian byrne have not originally intend to speak in this debate but give the appalling slaughter and suffering in the middle east and the ongoing tragedy in gaza have to do so as the member of parliament who bring forward the motion to recognise the state of palestine which be approve in the house on october be often target for those who do not believe in peace or two state solution in the context of the then home secretary sowing of division and hate it be interesting that hon member have refer to remembrance sunday when be move and overwhelm by the word some of which would like to share of the roman catholic priest father marc lyden smith he say that although remembrance sunday be time when people wear red poppy well establish tradition he have for the first time see someone wear both red and white poppy when he ask why their reply be red be for remembrance and white be for peace find that very thought provoking our hope in remembrance be ground in peace peace that so many have give their life for we must remember that peace look forward to what we be try to build justice harmony wellbeing and the opportunity for all to flourish the most powerful part of father lyden smith sermon be towards the end when he remind we that jesus say bless be the peacemaker he do not say bless be those who win the war those who have sufficient resource and advanced weaponry to crush their enemy he say blessed be the who work to build world of peace we can all be peacemaker we can all work towards bring about peace internationally we should let today be wake up call for we all on both side of the house to work for peace and when we pray every morning before the session start to work for reconciliation understanding and harmony that begin in this house in our community in our home in our family in our friendship group and especially in our heart today will vote for ceasefire will vote for peace will vote for state of israel and state of palestine to live side by side in peaceful coexistence the horror death and destruction that we witness daily on our tv screen be breeding ground for hate but if we be ever to secure peace and last peace we can not be drive by hate vote for ceasefire and call on all hon member but particularly the prime minister and the leader of the opposition to use their platform and position of authority not only to secure humanitarian aid amid the horror we see in gaza and have witness in israel but to work every day towards last peace and the safety and the security that all people in israel and palestine deserve will call the front benchers for the wind up no later than pm with sense of camaraderie start by congratulate the hon member for rutherglen and hamilton west michael shanks on his maiden speech maybe can go far in extend the hand of friendship by help he through the aye lobby this evening if he wish to join we in vote for ceasefire as the scottish labour party in holyrood appear to be say it will do next week be not go to get into this but the hon member for slough mr dhesi have prompt to do so he seem to suggest that the snp table an amendment on the principled position that we have take at every stage every step of the way since the attack in gaza on october be somehow political game that be an utterly bizarre suggestion we have be absolutely open our amendment be table last wednesday week ago and publish last thursday you will forgive mr deputy speaker for suggest that if anyone be play political game it would be those who lodge an amendment minute before the deadline last night also thank the hon member for slough for confirm what many of we have suspect the reason the labour party often do not vote for snp motion be simply that they be snp motion that be deeply unfortunate invite labour members to look in hansard at the countless time the snp have vote with labour on opposition day motion we will go through the lobby and vote for position that we agree with if that be what he feel he need to say and do to justify the position to himself that be matter for he but we put forward principled position tonight in our amendment which be delighted to sponsor and support particularly give that countless people in midlothian have email to ask to do so let touch little on today topic draw the house attention to my entry in the register of members financial interests as be trustee of white ribbon scotland when we particularly we man get the chance in debate to stand up and call on all man to do what we can to tackle the grow misogyny across society it be important that we take that chance use our position and platform to call it out where we see it misogyny be entirely unacceptable and more of we need to say so because it be happen far too much far too often people stand by and say but he good guy really that be simply not good enough more need to be do so welcome the fact that the government be introduce legislation which will watch closely as it progress the king speech could have do much more it could have offer much more to help constituent in midlothian and across our nation however for all the challenge we face they be nothing compare with that face by those in gaza tonight so call on everyone who want to see an end to that conflict to join we in vote for ceasefire after year of tory austerity what thin king speech it be from government who be out of touch and out of idea and hopefully soon out of office they promise change by wheel out the prime minister who run off after he accidentally bequeath we brexit then there be the ex home secretary who be so fixate by the next tory leadership race that she forget her function of keep the street safe she make they less safe by stoke unrest and fear and encourage right wing mob on to our street kudo to sir mark rowley and the met for stand up to the meddling crime and antisocial behaviour need neighbourhood policing but this gimmicky government still have not restore to level the officer they cut hate crime should not be on our street but sadly event far off have trigger islamophobic and antisemitic event nationally and even locally in the past month be alarm by reprehensible individual hoot horn and provocatively wave flag in acton on october the day of the bad atrocity in israel history since then we have shockingly also see red paint daub on two mosque three time between they and on syrian café that be disgraceful with winter approach there should not be street homelessness and rough sleeping in one of the rich country on earth in that be also disgraceful as be the ex home secretary call it lifestyle choice reclaim the street also mean an end to the grisly roll call sarah everard sabina nessa and zara aleena who be only walk home however my last example be from the street of gaza which have dominate mps inboxe and fill our tv screen with desperation death and destruction have hear it at first hand from man who come to see whose brother have live in ealing and train as surgeon at guy before return to gaza with his expertise he have not move from al shifa hospital since the start of the war that hospital be now household name surround by tank and with no food water or power long before hamas despicable slaughter on october start this cycle of violence the new foreign secretary call gaza an open air prison camp that be unsustainable those word be now true than ever so back labour amendment tonight demand both the end of violence and two state solution stress the importance of international law and condemn hamas illegal settlement and west bank violence have also put my name to amendment which ask for some of the same stuff include the release of hostage who themselves be at risk from hour day of incessant bombardment but also call for the end of the siege of gaza condemn collective punishment and urge the government to press for negotiate ceasefire that be bind on all side not surrender all war end in ceasefire eventually we can not continue at the rate we be see with lose life and of building in gaza demolish it be only month in even the sun call this damp squib of king speech from party for whom it truly feel like the end of day to paraphrase the spice girls what we want what we really really want and what this country need be general election now bring it on it would be remiss of not to begin by congratulate my hon friend the member for rutherglen and hamilton west michael shanks on fantastic maiden speech remember say in mine which feel like year ago that admire his integrity and intelligence think those value shine through in his speech and will shine through in his conduct in this place it be pleasure to rise to speak in this debate on the king speech for the first time as the member of parliament for selby and ainsty but must say that be little disappointed be send to this place to hold this government to account to scrutinise their agenda and their concrete plan for government but this king speech have reveal that there be scarcely plan at all instead the conservative party have resign itself to drift rudderless toward the next election shuffle the deckchair on the titanic while work people in community such as mine suffer the consequence of year of decline nowhere be that more apparent than on crime the so call party of law and order have sleepwalk into crisis where of crime go unsolved and criminal on the street be half as likely to be catch today than under the last labour government the conservative legacy on crime be one of damage decline and collapse confidence and community such as sherburn in elmet in my constituency be pay the price sherburn be bustling and dynamic place with bright future it have grow from village to town with its population expand by around people in the past year but with that growth come worry about crime and fear that the hard work staff at north yorkshire police do not have sufficient resource to address these issue in my recent election campaign the conservatives have the gall to celebrate how more police officer be now on the street of north yorkshire ask we to be grateful while seemingly oblivious to the fact that those officer be merely replace the one we have lose from our street since the conservatives take power in as well as those who have be force to leave the profession they love due to overwork anxiety and stress it be plain to those local resident in sherburn who feel threaten by burglary and whose street be make unsafe by antisocial behaviour that this government be dangerously out of their depth and be unwilling to use opportunity such as the king speech to get grip on spiral crime his majesty speech could have provide what everyone in my constituency know we need and what my hon friend the member for birmingham erdington mrs hamilton outline so ably fundamental reset for our police service and criminal justice system under labour plan to tackle crime we would see more officer and pcso on our street fast track detective recruitment and return to proper neighbourhood police with guarantee neighbourhood patrol as well as new power to tackle antisocial behaviour in our town centre instead it be all too clear that this government be unprepared to take the important decision necessary to solve the crisis in which they have place we my hon friend and will do all we can to push they to go far until general election allow we to deliver the fresh start that community such as mine so desperately need some israelis have be kill and more than palestinians have be kill in gaza around half of they child kill by the israeli bomb and missile target home school hospital refugee camp mosque and church while almost be miss presume dead under the rubble those total will be high now than they be when we start this king speech debate the world health organisation have note that the brunt of the horrific assault be be bear by woman and child with well over child kill every day and countless more maimed suffer lifelong psychological trauma or trap under rubble more child have be kill in gaza during the last three week than the total kill in conflict around the world in every year since of those kill two third be woman and child woman and child be disproportionately impact by this violence densely populate refugee camp in gaza be be bomb leave dead and wound child with no survive family be leave comfort too many of my own constituent in leicester east who have lose huge number of family member with their in law wipe out entirely as we speak gaza large hospital al shifa have be surround storm and occupy by israeli force trap hundred of medic patient and civilian inside without access to vital supply with even food and water run out gaza hospital be out of anaesthetic and many be out of fuel child and other be undergo surgery for horrific trauma with no pain relief premature baby in neonatal care be die without access to oxygen and more generally there be now report of civilian die from hunger and starvation with lack of food water and hygiene collective punishment be war crime and so be forcible transfer yet the people of gaza be be drive from their land into the sinai egyptian desert these be war crime and the urgency of the situation the gravity of the crime and basic human decency demand that plain language be use to our shame the government the prime minister and the leader of his majesty official opposition be refuse to acknowledge this do they not see palestinians as human do they not see the burn out ash of barely recognisable human body or the tiny hand of baby cover in debris reach out from the rubble do palestinian life not matter we be see death by war crime in plain sight every day of delay mean more life be lose and more woman and child be kill by the indiscriminate massacre and barbarism of israeli bomb the international human right community and international non governmental organisation be unite in their demand for full and immediate ceasefire the united nations and its child and relief agency the world health organisation international and israeli human right group and the million of ordinary citizen of the uk and other country who have take to the street each week be all demand ceasefire our humanity in this house demand that we call for ceasefire on point of order mr deputy speaker as you will know this have be an extraordinarily difficult day for many member in this house but for this be the most difficult day have have to endure in my parliamentary career we be now over month on from the atrocious attack by hamas on october and we be all right to utterly condemn those attack but ahead of the vote that we be go to take in moment want to let the house know that today lose my first family member the reason why this be important be that have speak about how they be in church in gaza city and they do not be afraid die from bomb instead they die perhaps from lack of food perhaps from dehydration their health deteriorate in the last week and they could not get to the hospital they need today want to vote for peace want to vote for two state solution because that be the only way that these horror will never be see again want to vote for get hamas out of gaza and for those reason want to vote for an immediate bilateral ceasefire so that family like mine but also family in israel do not have to endure this anymore urge colleague from all side to bear in mind that this be more than just party politic right now have be so disappointed by language have hear today and the prime minister early suggest that we be not on the side of israel order deep condolence from the house but this be clearly not matter for the chair we will let the comment that you have make stand thank no please resume your seat this be not matter for the no please resume your seat we have express our deep condolence but this be not matter for the chair and therefore not legitimate point of order during this debate it be time for the front bench contribution call mr david lammy the whole house will want to send their deep condolence to the hon member for oxford west and abingdon layla moran after what we have just hear this have be strong and powerful debate on the king speech and all hon member despite the most challenging and difficult circumstance in the middle east feel very grateful for the depth and quality of the contribution we also hear the most outstanding maiden speech from my hon friend the member for rutherglen and hamilton west michael shanks it be thoughtful humorous and full of live experience and fantastic scottish history be sure that his career in this house will be very successful we have lot of contribution about crime of course give the nature of the debate and it be good to hear from the chair of the justice committee the hon member for bromley and chislehurst sir robert neill he be right to remind we about the cost of imprisonment and that every prisoner cost and about the importance of the government adopt labour position on short sentence be grateful to hear the secretary of state move in labour direction and disagree on this occasion with his colleague the right hon member for south holland and the deepings sir john hayes who be not in his place at the moment interruption forgive he be we also hear from the chair of the home affairs committee my right hon friend the member for kingston upon hull north dame diana johnson who raise spike as grow issue in our country along with sexual exploitation as well as the need to move forward with statutory description we hear from my right hon friend the member for garston and halewood maria eagle and my hon friend the member for liverpool west derby ian byrne about the long campaign for justice and hillsborough law and about how painful it be and will be for many people that despite the report of bishop jones that measure do not find its way into the king speech two and half year later my hon friend the member for merthyr tydfil and rhymney gerald jones raise police in wales and my hon friend the member for dulwich and west norwood helen hayes speak about the horrible scourge of knife crime and the failure to ban rambo and zombie knife we be still wait let turn to the amendment and the horror of war that know every member of this house and so many of our constituent be all focus on tonight will start with meeting hold two week ago in cairo with the egyptian foreign minister he remind that it have be almost exactly half century since egypt and israel be at the height of the yom kippur war year pattern of conflict that some fear would never end there be devastating loss in the sinai and whole army face encirclement by the suez canal few expect the narrow diplomatic opening to lead to last peace but diplomat seize those narrow opening then in sadat come to jerusalem set the two country on path to peace that have hold ever since minister shoukry remind of that although it may seem impossible in the toxic fog of war peace be always possible in the end so day since the start of the war between israel and hamas ask the house to remember that peace be never simple and never win easily much of the language be about ceasefire the pope the archbishop of canterbury save the children unicef the world health organisation the un secretary general and several eu prime ministers have all call for proper ceasefire be it not time that labour move its position and actually use that word proper one to let humanitarian aid in will turn to those issue shortly everyone in this house want the fighting to end the central debate be about the step to bring that about and there be discussion across this place among member all of whom want peace and all of whom want to see the loss of life come to an end interruption respect the hon member position and will come to that in moment peace be never win easily peace be possible because of diplomacy because of compromise and because of negotiation it be our duty in this house to support all the necessary and practical step to get we there think we all understand that there have to be step towards an eventual conclusion and we all want to see the fighting stop the labour amendment call for cessation of fighting which presumably mean cessation of firing what be the difference between cessation of firing and ceasefire rise will my right hon friend give way have to answer the question from my hon friend the member for sheffield south east mr betts direct he to the statement from the united nations office for the co ordination of humanitarian affairs which clearly set out five or six step and five or six different type of occasion where arm be lay down some be purely for humanitarian reason other be because some negotiation have begin or some political dialogue be possible the debate be about how we get to the end which be that arm be lay down for lasting reason and the political process in the end this will surely end with political process can properly begin my right hon friend be right to highlight the fact that get to peace be the ultimate goal for all of we like many hon and right hon member have receive so much communication from my constituent there be clear consensus from the general public that ceasefire be one of the key way we can get this peace do he not agree that we should be work towards that urgently rise will my right hon friend give way will just respond to my hon friend the member for vauxhall florence eshalomi she be of course right that all of we want to see ceasefire and the laying down of arm she will have see also the statement from hamas just few day ago that they intend to continue and continue and continue it be hard to see how ceasefire can come about if hamas be not prepared to stop the firing of rocket into israel and if they be not prepared to lay down their arm and set those hostage free that think be at the heart of the nature of the discussion rise give way to my right hon friend order would like to advise david lammy that will be call chris philp at pm with apology may say to my hon friend the member for sheffield south east mr betts who raise the question of what the difference be between use of the word ceasefire and an end to violence that fear there be most unfortunate difference and that be why never use the word ceasefire and will not be vote for motion that include it that be because tragically to some people call for ceasefire mean that israel should stop fight but not that anybody else should and that be not point of view that could support wholeheartedly support the excellent amendment table by labour front benchers few of we in this house have the experience of my right hon friend she know that it be quiet hard diplomacy that will bring about an end to the loss of life she know that we need to rapidly get to long pause and she know that there be legitimate debate in this house but that the labour motion deal with the issue at hand today not next week or the week afterwards let we see where we get to let join the shadow foreign secretary the right hon member for tottenham mr lammy in express the whole house condolence to the hon member for oxford west and abingdon layla moran for the tragedy that her family have suffer today it be huge pleasure to close the final debate on the first king speech join other in congratulate the hon member for rutherglen and hamilton west michael shanks on his excellent maiden speech anyone who take seat off the snp have my fervent good wish hon member oh that be clearly not universally popular view it be the first duty of the state to secure the safety and security of its citizen that be why the government have deliver record ever police number across england and wales as my hon friend the members for penrith and the border dr hudson for old bexley and sidcup mr french and for st austell and newquay steve double reference we have more police officer than we have ever have before at any time in history and those record number be deliver result accord to the crime survey overall crime measure like for like be low now than it be in that be to say that the labour government in which the shadow foreign secretary and the shadow home secretary the right hon member for normanton pontefract and castleford yvette cooper sit preside over crime level that be double those that prevail today violence be down by burglary be down by and vehicle crime be down by the subject of the debate include fight violence against woman and girl topic that be sure the whole house can get behind be proud that in the last year the government have legislate to criminalise stalk in pass the domestic abuse act criminalise coercive and control behaviour create non fatal strangulation offence and outlaw upskirting and revenge porn the previous labour government fail to do all those thing during their year in office there be more to do the conviction rate for rape and serious sexual offence need to be high be glad that the hon member for somerton and frome sarah dyke acknowledge that operation soteria be make progress with police referral in the quarter to june up by compare with crown prosecution service charge up by and crown court receipt up by there be lot more to do but that be all head rapidly in the right direction some specific question arise which for the sake of clarity would like to answer the hon member for dulwich and west norwood helen hayes who be in her place ask about measure to ban zombie knife and machete those require secondary legislation and can confirm that the government will bring forward the relevant statutory instrument in the very near future in addition to the measure announce in the king speech to double the sentence for supply knife to an and to double the sentence for possess knife with intent to cause harm my hon friend the member for ipswich tom hunt mention antisocial behaviour come next april every single police force in england and wales will have funding for antisocial behaviour hotspot patrol where they have be trialle they have almost immediately reduce antisocial behaviour by around the hon member for liverpool west derby ian byrne and the right hon member for garston and halewood maria eagle ask about the government response to hillsborough which they and many member of parliament take very seriously can confirm that the government be plan to offer their full reply to bishop james jones report on december the right hon member for garston and halewood and other will be brief in advance if they wish to be the duty of candour in policing will be introduce in clause of the criminal justice bill on gaza which many member have speak about let we keep in mind that innocent civilian be deliberately target and slaughter by terrorist and over people remain held hostage as the prime minister have set out repeatedly this government support humanitarian pause to ensure that aid can get to civilian in gaza give the difficult circumstance this government have dramatically increase humanitarian aid have provide million worth and tonne have be send in already of course much more be require will the minister give way be afraid that must finish up we be also work actively with international partner include president sisi of egypt to make sure the rafah border crossing which have visit be open more to allow critical aid in in order to ensure that civilian in gaza be protect our government be actively engage with the government of israel to ensure that they obey international law and redouble their effort to protect civilian in gaza that be the humane and civilised thing to do and this government will continue to call for that however ceasefire with hamas in place can not be just hamas have say that they intend to destroy israel and that they would once again perpetrate atrocity like those commit on october they continue to hold hostage include child and british citizen and they continue to fire rocket into israel to ask israel to cease fire unilaterally would not be fair or just in order to have just peace and lasting permanent ceasefire we need two state solution with sovereign and recognise palestinian state on the west bank and in gaza guarantee their security and the security of israel alike all of we in this house and beyond should redouble our effort to bring about that state solution and to bring about the peace we see in the aftermath of the oslo accord pass in that show there be path it be difficult but it can be tread only with just and last peace can we see just and last ceasefire commend the king speech and the government legislative programme to the house it will take this country forward and it deserve the support of the house question put that the amendment be make rushanara ali rosena allin khan
