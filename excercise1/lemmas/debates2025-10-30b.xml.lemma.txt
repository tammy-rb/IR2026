be have the uk do enough on june the prime minister say that we do not spend enough time on sudan in this house that might be because the minister for africa sit in the other place but when lord purvis ask baroness chapman on july about the uk work to enforce un security council resolution on the protection of civilian in el fasher she say often find myself ask what the point be of many of these report house of lords july vol be the minister equally defeatist about the uk role as penholder at the un or will the uk use its position today to press for sudan wide arm embargo on the role of uk weapon in the conflict which have be widely report will the minister today ban arm sale to the uae until it be confirm that the uae be not use british weapon to arm the rsf the hon gentleman raise important issue give his previous career and have work with he in the past know of his sincerity on these matter ultimately the party involve be responsible for the conflict if the allegation turn out to be true we be clear that anybody responsible must be hold accountable and we will not rest until that be do both through our role at the united nations and in relation to support accountability for any atrocity that have be commit we of course engage on very close basis it be not just about statement it be about direct contact by our special representative richard crowder and the team in addis

licence under review and if need will we cancel they assure my hon friend that we take these issue very seriously we take allegation that any uk make equipment may have be transfer to sudan in breach of the uk arm embargo very seriously that reflect the point make by the liberal democrat spokesperson the uk have one of the most robust arm export control regime in the world we constantly assess our licence for the risk of diversion and we regularly prevent export that might be divert to an undesirable end user or end use we be aware of report of small number of uk make item have be find in sudan but there be no evidence in the recent reporting of uk weapon or ammunition be use in sudan will keep these matter under close review thank you for grant this urgent question mr speaker as you have do with number of other but this important issue should not have to come to the floor of the house by way of an urgent question the government must be more proactive the minister for africa give commitment to the international development committee that they would be more proactive during this parliament and hope that that commitment will be honour will the minister set out more fully what discussion there have be with the uae not only be there concern about the use of weapon but it be clear that the uae have significant influence over the rsf and be key player it be state by the

through our consular service can the minister explain to the house what be the attitude of other state in the region towards this conflict be there any prospect that they could unite and possibly make some form of physical intervention to separate the war side in sudan obviously it be not for to speak to the individual policy of country in the region but the right hon gentleman will know that regrettably to date it have not be possible to find consensus in the united nations security council on way forward we push for that and always attempt to do so in our engagement as the penholder we

minister for his statement it be good to have somebody at the dispatch box who both understand and care about this issue we have spend no shortage of time in this chamber talk about the conflict in the middle east and in ukraine but think all of we be guilty of not talk enough about sudan the international criminal court be investigate some report of atrocity in sudan do the minister feel that that investigation should extend to those who knowingly export weapon into the conflict my hon friend be right to raise the issue of accountability have already refer to our support for the work of

the house will the leader of the house give we the forthcoming business the business for the week commence november include monday november second reading of the public office accountability bill tuesday november opposition day allotted day debate on motion in the name of the official opposition subject to be announce wednesday november consideration of lords message to the employment rights

bill friday november the house will not be sit the provisional business for the week commence november include monday november committee of the whole house and remain stage of the biodiversity beyond national jurisdiction bill thank the leader of the house for that update know the whole house will want to join in send our very good wish to the victim of the hurricane in jamaica and now also cuba haiti and the turks and caicos islands want to pay personal tribute to prunella scales who die this week she be magnificent actress the linchpin of great acting dynasty and as be her husband timothy west wonderful reader of audiobook among the news this week have be the follow item the former leader of the house the right hon member for manchester central lucy powell have be elect as deputy leader of the labour party and have vow to work constructively with no downing street the director of public prosecutions have publicly contradict the prime minister in relation to the collapse china spying case the labour party have fall in the poll to record low for recently elect government and irish citizen may now be force to have digital identity card to work in this country under the government new plan would like to raise with the leader of the house two important issue one directly relate to the recent business of the house as former chief whip he will know that the first question at prime minister question always follow simple formula the prime minister be ask to list their engagement he or she typically present public condolence or congratulation and comment on an issue often an international issue affect the whole house and then say this morning have meeting with ministerial colleague and other and so on unfortunately since take office last year the present prime minister have increasingly misuse his first engagement question two week ago he use it to avoid make full statement to the house about china which do not think can have please the speaker office this week he use it to try to score series of partisan political point by my counting the eighth time he have try to do this since take office this be an abuse of procedure and it be discourtesy to this house its effect be to turn an open question into party political broadcast it undermine valuable opportunity to bring the house together every week on matter of public importance before the usual knockabout of pmq begin it be unworthy of the prime minister office and unworthy of the prime minister who be very decent human being therefore may politely invite the leader of the house to ask the prime minister to desist interruption and may wish he good luck in do so my second issue concern the so call graduate premium the government hold an extremely powerful set of datum know as the longitudinal educational outcome or leo data which link people school result university record and later earning many people in this house include perhaps more than any of we the leader of the house will know that education can transform people live for the well this dataset can show what happen and how it do so in detail but most of the datum remain entirely hidden only limited figure have be publish such as average graduate earning five year after university the government also have information on what happen to those who do not go to university but this too be withhold so we still can not answer question that be crucial for many people how financially worthwhile be particular course or particular institution how effective be apprenticeship what difference do university really make the secrecy weaken public trust and good public policy family and young people be be force to make major life choice without clear fact because no member of the public or indeed member of this house can see which course or institution genuinely improve this kind of opportunity it seem that the government themselves will increasingly use the datum to shape policy but without make those datum public people go to university for many different reason and financial return be only part of the story but these datum be gather at public expense and describe public outcome with the right safeguard they should be open for review and for public debate and discussion the institute for fiscal studies have explain exactly how so will the leader of the house ask his colleague in the department for education to make the leo datum public soon let begin by join the shadow leader of the house in his tribute to prunella scales who be fantastic actress and in his remark about the effect of hurricane melissa the uk be offer full support to jamaica and many caribbean country in the aftermath of the hurricane the foreign office be deliver humanitarian assistance to affected area include through specialist rapid deployment team in the region to provide consular assistance to british national our thought be obviously with the people of the affected area but they be also with those in this country of caribbean heritage who will be particularly worried at this time this week the house mark year since the house of commons chamber be rebuild from ruin after it be bomb during the second world war and thank mr speaker for the event that he have organise this week to mark this important anniversary as we approach remembrance sunday be pleased to announce the general debate on the

and candidate thank the conference for this important work the government will look closely at the recommendation not least through my role on the defend democracy taskforce would like to express my personal thank to mike mccarthy bem who be depart from the government whips office this week have serve every government since hope the whole house will join in wish he well hon member hear hear on the shadow leader of the house remark about the recent election of new labour deputy leader would gently point out that this be do by take the matter to the member of the party who make their choice and very good choice indeed that stand in stark contrast to what have happen on the opposition benches where the right hon member for newark robert jenrick have simply foist himself on the conservative party as the unofficial deputy leader on prime minister question if what the prime minister be do be not in order would expect whoever be in the chair to point that out however to some extent my right hon and learn friend can not win because if he do not comment on the matter of the day or matter of urgency people will ask he why and if he do he get call out for it on the shadow leader of the house point about school result know he be passionate advocate for education include high education absolutely agree that school result and education be transformational in people life will draw to the attention to the secretary of state for education who share our view on the transformation that education can bring his point about what further datum can be usefully make public let just add and before the shadow leader of the house call out for knockabout this be not knockabout but simply mention some of the thing he might have add that this week the government announce an billion deal to supply typhoon fighter jet to turkey support job with nearly worker at warton now know that their job be secure awaab law have come into force improve life for tenant live in million social rent home across england and today announcement of knife be take off our street be very good news along with the news that knife crime be fall hope life will be change as result this be what the government mean by our plan for change in action make defence driver of growth in the economy and also drive renewal and opportunity up and down our country may place on record my thank to the leader of the house for all his support he be brilliant chief whip and at least now the nation get to share his wit and wisdom may we have an urgent debate on the accountability of institution for the use of public money walsall college and walsall council be close the iconic leather museum against the wish of local people but no financial information be available please could we have such debate on financial information and accountability my right hon friend be great champion for her local community and she be right that local people need to be involve in decision that affect their local community she have put on record her concern but would encourage she to go even far on this matter perhaps by apply for an adjournment debate call the liberal democrat spokesperson associate myself with the comment about hurricane victim and indeed with the comment about prunella scales early this week we be treat to the delight of conservative opposition day and the main thing we learn be that the conservatives do enjoy be in opposition we have the shadow housing secretary the right hon member for braintree sir james cleverly decry the housing crisis that their government leave behind and

another conservative opposition day next week the conservatives be set to get day to the liberal democrats three in this parliamentary session we would just gently suggest that if we want to elevate the debate in this chamber we may want to redress that balance in the next session how many do reform get move on to fraud speak of would like to focus on how fraud destroy life it eradicate people saving it plunge people into debt and it diminish people faith in human nature fraud be on the rise it be up by almost fifth and it make up nearly half of all crime in the uk know that the government be set to release fraud strategy soon but there be worry report that key component be about to be ditch british bank pick up the tab for fraud in this country they be the one who reimburse the victim even though the vast majority of fraud these day happen on online platform the prime minister himself recognise this say before the election that tech company have clear obligation and should have clear financial incentive to tackle fraud that commitment be what we be worried about be drop apparently to appease american president donald trump the government send gushing letter to big tech ceo over the summer congratulate they on their effort in tackle fraud but uk finance and the financial conduct authority both disagree and say that big tech company be not do enough can the government publish their fraud strategy and commit to hold big tech company to account ensure that they be hit in the pocket for not tackle fraud will first respond hon member point about opposition day as have announce not just one but two of they this might be matter that he wish to draw to the attention of the modernisation committee be go to defend the official opposition here and say gently to the hon member that the official opposition do have particular role in the constitution and we need to be very careful before we start change that simply because an election can produce particular number of seat for other party thank the hon member for raise the fraud strategy fraud be hugely important matter for many of our constituent and it remain huge challenge and one of the most commonly experience crime in our country as he point out we will bring forward new strategy later this year to protect consumer and business we need everyone to play their part in that and we continue to urge tech and

will be particularly helpful in identify the unregistered infected people for the next group and indeed more as the service grow as member of the house be aware from my previous statement on this matter ibca be an independent arm length body and it be vital that we respect that independence while also ensure that do what can to drive progress forward that be why in july ask for an independent review of ibca delivery of the scheme that review lead by sir tyrone urch begin in august and conclude early this month be today publish that review and have deposit copy in the libraries of both houses the report note that ibca have make substantial early progress towards deliver compensation to victim of infected blood but it also make recommendation to aid the scaling up of operation and the delivery of compensation to complex cohort will of course consider all of those recommendation carefully alongside ibca delivery of the compensation scheme the government have continue to make progress on interim payment in july inform the house that we would make further interim payment of to the estate of infected person who be register with an infected blood support scheme or predecessor scheme and have sadly pass away in addition to the interim payment of that open for application in october be pleased that application for those payment open last week mean that some estate could now be eligible for up to in interim payment since application for the initial interim payment open last year over estate have receive payment total over million that be in addition to the billion that the government have pay in interim compensation more widely hope that this additional interim payment bring some temporary relief to the family impact and also hope that ibca intention to begin the first claim on behalf of estate of deceased infected people by the end of this year provide some reassurance be resolute that we get this right and hope the progress have set out today show that we be take positive action and crucially listen to and make progress alongside the community after all those who have be so impact by this horrendous scandal must be at the core of every decision we make in government and across this house they deserve no less commend this statement to the house call the shadow minister thank the minister for his statement and for advance sight of it although just under an hour be not lot of time to digest page of documentation so will do my good join the minister in acknowledge the work do by sir brian langstaff and his inquiry as well as the serious improvement in the pace of payment that ibca have make in recent month we thank sir robert francis david foley and all their team at ibca on behalf of the opposition welcome the measure that the minister have announce that implement some of sir brian recommendation from the additional report particularly those deal with hiv eligibility start date the deeming of severity band evidence of the date of diagnosis affected estate and bereaved partner support scheme payment turn to the recommendation relate to hepatitis we of course welcome confirmation that the government will remove the earning floor on the supplementary route exceptional loss award however do not hear any specific reference in the minister statement to measure to address recommendation of the original report which deal with effective treatment perhaps the minister could set out how the government intend to give effect to that recommendation similarly could he set out what measure the government be take beyond the appointment of the new member of the technical expert group that he have announce in response to recommendation which deal with the transparency of scheme design that be particularly important in light of the inquiry worry find that victim do not feel that they be be listen to now turn to the recommendation that the government do not feel able to accept immediately welcome the fact that the minister be consult on way forward on those issue clearly as have say there be need for transparency and proper consultation the consultation period will last until the end of january next year we recognise that there be little that the minister can do about that clearly define period but give the need to address these measure without undue delay will he ensure that once that consultation period close the government respond swiftly to the consultation paper and introduce any necessary further regulation with maximum speed so that this house can consider any further measure that be necessary more broadly how be the government apply the lesson learn from the implementation of payment scheme for people infect to well inform the operation of payment to people affect and to their estate as he refer to in his statement what action be the minister take with the independent ibca to ensure that the pace of payment which have see welcome progress continue to accelerate and be not jeopardise by change to rule and process as say sir brian inquiry have do incredible and invaluable work to give voice to those who have battle so courageously against decade of injustice and to ensure that victim and their family have some remedy although clearly no amount of money can ever reverse the terrible harm do by this scandal over many year the recommendation in the additional report that sir brian publish shortly before the summer be an invaluable contribution look forward there will need to be degree of policy certainty as we move from period of review to one of rectification and delivery that be one reason that the cross party work both before and since the election have be so important to give confidence and certainty look ahead do the minister have any indication as to when we might expect the inquiry to draw to close and what might the mechanism be for do so be grateful to the shadow minister for the tone of his remark note what he say about the time he receive the statement and other document and he know well enough by now to know that have great respect for this house and will always facilitate shadow ministers have material with plenty of time will certainly take that issue away and look at why that happen join the shadow minister in pay tribute to the work of the inquiry and to sir robert francis and david foley ibca chief executive this house rightly have hold to account for the number of payment ibca be run test and learn approach and always say to the house that there would be small number that be representative sample of case which would then allow ibca to scale up exponentially we be now in that exponential phase that steep curve look every single week at the number of payment and it be start to increase significantly know that member across the house will welcome that the shadow minister make point about treatment for hepatitis one of the thing we be look at in the consultation be the impact of interferon which have such detrimental impact on so many people the shadow minister be right to raise the transparency mechanism while do not need piece of legislation for that be look at that mechanism and want to get it into place as soon as possible the shadow minister ask about the week consultation the government will respond to that within week and will then want to bring forward fourth set of regulation with the great possible speed the shadow minister final point be about learn lesson and that be precisely why ask sir tyrone urch to carry out his work first it be about learn the lesson from what have happen so far and how we can well take thing forward secondly it be about the practical step can take to assist ibca with scale up and make payment to affected people which will clearly be far large number of people for ibca to deal with to finish on consensual point the cross party support on this issue have be important the continuity between the work have do and the work of my predecessor as paymaster general the right hon member for salisbury john glen have be hugely important in the delivery of this scheme welcome the statement from my right hon friend this issue have its origin back in the and it have be go on for an extraordinarily long time the state have not be respond to or provide information to the people it should have be there to serve we find ourselves in situation where people have live almost all their life wait for compensation and now this issue be arise that they may pass away have just receive compensation and their estate will then be subject to inheritance tax the state be give with one hand and take back with the other realise that my right hon friend be not in the treasury but we need to take that issue forward there be also this outstanding issue of support to the campaign group that support the application of people who be infect and affect part of one of sir brian langstaff recommendation be that they need extra support from the department of health and social care on both these issue what can my right hon friend do to assist the people make these application and to get they the response to sir brian langstaff recommendation that they deserve pay tribute to my hon friend work with the all party parliamentary group on the first question the compensation that have be receive clearly be exempt from tax understand exactly the point he be make about someone such as widow who inherit or have the compensation on behalf of deceased partner that money will be receive tax free but appreciate his point about the speed that be need because of the age of so many of the victim of this scandal that be through no fault of their own but be the fault of the state the tax exemption be in line with the policy that be pursue consistently across government on his second point about the campaign group be conscious that we be approach the end of another tax year pay tribute to the work that the charity do and undertake to he that will take up that matter with the department of health and social care call the liberal democrat spokesperson the minister will see my pile of paper which hope be criticism that never have to raise again welcome his statement and the work be do particularly by sir brian langstaff and other also welcome his intention to listen to and work with the infected blood community this scandal remain the bad treatment disaster in the history of our national health service and it be source of shame for successive government and for the health service we have hear from our constituent who have be let down by medical professional and the nhs in many case they be victim of deliberate malpractice and cover up all those warning about unsafe blood be ignore and official fail to inform patient in many case those patient pay or be still pay with their life an estimated victim suffer and that suffering be compound by the further injustice of have to wait decade for compensation as of my late datum understand that six time as many people have die wait for justice as have benefit from this scheme hope the minister can update with slightly more accurate figure payment to date have be make at an infuriatingly glacial pace would like to ask the minister about the timeline for deliver compensation can he reaffirm that all eligible victim all will receive compensation by will he confirm that the consultation he will undertake will not delay in any way or affect the speed at which the payment be be make more specifically have challenge he before about the victim of the special category mechanism be they in different state from the advice give in august last year have thing change completely from the situation in february this year when the rule change just want to check something that be not entirely clear about with the infected blood compensation authority the current approach be that people could not apply for compensation and you be now say that they can and that they will not have to wait order ms munt you say you be say but be not hope you be come to conclusion apologise madam deputy speaker can the minister confirm that people will not have to wait and that those registration be only part of it when we recognise that there be victim thank the hon lady for the tone of her comment on her final point that number be just the number of registration not the totality of the number of victim on the point that she raise entirely share her concern as say when give evidence to the inquiry in may the test that always have at the forefront of my mind when make change be about not cause additional undue delay to the payment of compensation the hon lady ask about that be backstop not target date say that to the inquiry in may as well the target be to get the payment out as quickly as possible as say in response to the shadow minister the hon member for kingswinford and south staffordshire mike wood the test and learn approach be always take because we feel and ibca feel that that would ultimately be the way to get the money out to the large number of people as quickly as possible think we be now in an exponential phase where the number of payment be go up quickly the hon lady be entirely right to draw attention to the number of people who have die before actually secure justice that be again reason why have be push for payment to be make as quickly as possible finally the special category mechanism be one of the seven issue mention in the consultation know this have be ask before but would urge she and her constituent to respond to that thank my right hon friend for the content clarification and tone of his statement it be clearly an awful situation would like to speak up for my constituent in easington and to seek some clarification regard those people who contract hepatitis will the minister confirm that all in the infected blood community include those suffer with hepatitis will have access to the consultation as recommend by sir brian langstaff understand that the consultation close in january and he mention that there would be week period in which the government would consider that the straight answer be yes my hon friend be powerful advocate for the victim in his constituency of easington whether for hepatitis victim or the other victim of this scandal want the consultation to be as accessible as possible and very much hope that he will encourage his constituent to respond to it the minister be clearly totally committed to this subject and thank he for the way in which he reach out to the mps he know have an interest in it will he join in commend ibca for the quality of its communication both the website and the mps toolkit recently send out could not be more free of jargon which set an excellent example go back to the point raise by the chair of the appg the hon member for eltham and chislehurst clive efford as understand it if compensation grant be make to the family of someone who have already die those relative will receive it tax free but if the grant be make to the individual shortly before their death the very same family member might have to pay inheritance tax on it that be clearly an anomaly so will the minister speak to the treasury about it pay tribute to the right hon gentleman who have campaign on this issue for many year on his first point agree whether the document and communication be from the government or the ibca be constantly press for plain english to be fair to those task with produce those document some of the content be complicated but try to communicate in accessible way be hugely important on the right hon gentleman second point regard the tax exemption he be correct think in his interpretation that there be single tax exemption the compensation be receive free of tax in the first instance but there be no subsequent tax exemption that be in line with general government policy on tax exemption across the board thank the minister for his statement on lesson learn hope he have look at the national audit office work on different compensation scheme so that we can learn from that also hope that he support the national campaign to encourage people who receive blood transfusion to get test for hepatitis as two people month be contact the helpline to say that they be infect during the relevant period to press the minister far on the point raise by my hon friend the member for eltham and chislehurst clive efford and the right hon member for new forest east sir julian lewis under this scheme people get compensation because they be die due to infected blood it be not random coincidental or due to something else if they happen to receive the compensation just before they die their family will pay inheritance tax on it the victim want to ensure that their family be properly support because they be no long able to do that so will the minister renew his effort to talk to the treasury about this issue this be small define group of people which do not need to set more general precedent but for this particular scheme where the state fail people so much the issue be an important one to resolve pay tribute to the work that my hon friend do on this entirely agree with she about learn lesson from the different compensation scheme across several government in recent decade on her second point regard tax exemption have set out the government position but hear very strongly what member be say thank the minister for his meticulous and thorough analysis of all the different strand of this challenging problem and for the work he have do to deal with the complexity of different group concern over delivery of the compensation also thank sir brian langstaff for what he have do however after six year million have be spend on this inquiry and we do not yet have the account for the current year in sir tyrone urch review which the minister mention the first recommendation be regard policy stability can the minister say something about how we will achieve that policy stability respectfully be it not time to thank sir brian and sir robert for their work and then focus on the delivery of ibca rather than have more iteration of recommendation which do not achieve much for the individual who need this accelerate thank the right hon gentleman for the painstaking significant work he do when he be paymaster general the reference to sir tyrone urch and his report be apposite because ask sir tyrone to look at the working of ibca to look practically at what barrier be still there to deliver compensation quickly of course sir tyrone first recommendation be around policy stability as say when be before the inquiry in may we would not want to be make change to the scheme that be detrimental to the ability to deliver the compensation quickly that be something that think be really important go forward congratulate and thank the minister for his work on this know how much of his time it be take far to the point make by my hon friend the members for eltham and chislehurst clive efford and for hackney south and shoreditch dame meg hillier and the right hon member for new forest east sir julian lewis there be perversity in the people who be fail by the state potentially be ask to repay of their compensation to the same state that fail they the minister have clearly set out that that be in line with policy be he willing to stand at that dispatch box and state categorically that that be fair if he can not say that it be fair will he at least undertake to again raise this issue with the treasury so that those people who be fail by the state be not then penalise by the state my hon friend and number of member have make that case powerfully will say to the house that they can be assure that look at all aspect of this scheme and test whether they be fair and think we can see across party the strength of feeling on this today congratulate the minister on make real progress on this matter after many year of delay recently meet jean hill and her daughter she have be campaign on this issue for year sadly her husband die in at the age of his brother die at and nephew die in more recent year what assurance can the minister give and jean that payment to deceased estate will be expedite as matter of urgency and what additional resource will be put in place to achieve that pay tribute to the hon gentleman for his work know that he have raise this issue on previous occasion with regard to deceased estate he will have hear what say in my statement about the interim payment additional interim payment have just open which show the urgency of the situation to the government and the importance of the money get to where it be need that be why make sure that those payment be open in recent week thank the minister for his statement today and for the work that he have do one issue raise by constituent be that when she apply for the interim payment she fill out lot of form and give information as she have be do for many year because her husband die some time ago have contract infection back in the she now have to apply again and the same information will be ask for there must be way of expedite the process to make life slightly simple for people like she she too be in situation in which at the age of and have not receive all the payment that she be likely to get she be worried about inheritance tax not on her own behalf but on behalf of her child be sorry to belabour the point but may add my voice to those around the chamber perhaps those voice will help the minister to have the ammunition to take to the treasury to say we not happy with this with regard to my hon friend first point on the interim payment there be an expedite process if the detail be unchanged from the first interim application if my hon friend write to with the particular detail of her constituent be happy to look at that on her second point think the strength of feeling in the house be very clear on previous occasion have pay tribute to the minister for his sincerity and hard work in this matter and add to that the collegiate and consensual way that he approach all of this particularly in his work with the devolved administration include the scottish government previously ask for the work of voluntary organisation third sector organisation to be place on statutory footing the minister will understand that despite the system be fairly straightforward and simple as have be acknowledge claimant still need support particularly those who be unwell can the minister advise whether that work have now be place on statutory footing on the hon gentleman first point have work with the devolved administrations throughout we have to take into account that this be pre devolution scandal so it be uk wide and number of sir brian recommendation from his initial report be uk wide they be now within devolved competence so this be hugely important have always be conscious of that and work with the devolved administrations in northern ireland scotland and wales with regard to the hon gentleman second point on the issue of voluntary body couple of different issue be mix up on that question if he write to precisely about put work on statutory footing will give he an answer more generally the work of voluntary body and charity in support victim have be absolutely invaluable and be very conscious of the financial pressure they be face so many life have be scar or end by this betrayal of trust cover up denial and delay and my constituent have wait for up to decade for justice many be concerned that they will not see it in their lifetime can the minister outline how he will ensure that my constituent and the infected blood community find the consultation accessible and can he say when the third set of regulation that have be publish will become law on my hon friend second question and subject to the will of the house would really like the third set of regulation to become law by the end of the year his advocacy for his constituent have never be anything short of impressive and be more than happy to look at any specific case that he bring to thank the minister for his commitment to find solution and for his incredibly compassionate demeanour in handle these issue think we all thank he for that the streamlined scheme for compensation open just three week ago can the minister confirm that it be indeed now easy for people to access the money that they deserve hope that the scheme be not add more worry and stress to those who live their life under burden not of their making be the government truly share the load with they and what more can the minister do to make the process smooth as ever the hon gentleman make very useful point build on the point make by my hon friend the member for bournemouth east tom hayes moment or two ago be very keen to ensure that the consultation be as accessible as possible and some of sir brian langstaff recommendation for example about how we calculate past and future loss be quite technical always say to both the department and ibca that it be really important that we do everything we can to make the system simple but we also need ready explainer the hon gentleman can be assure that will continue to push for they thank my right hon friend for his continued compassion and commitment to the cause and for the communication that we have have about affected constituent in my constituency as he will recall their concern be about bureaucracy and delay give what he say in his statement can he assure that this government remain committed to ensure that all affected and infected individual will see their compensation as quickly as possible what assurance can he give and my constituent about when they will be invite to start their claim be grateful to my hon friend as ever he make powerful case on behalf of his constituent at the moment offer have be make that be worth over billion but remain restless about the speed of progress want it to continue to increase be very conscious that ibca will be move from deal with those who have be infect to the much large number of people who have be affect appoint sir tyrone urch to look at the lesson that we can learn and at how ibca can well scale up to deal with much large number of claim indeed over claim have be register stand ready to assist and support ibca as we move forward into new phase thank the minister for his statement and for his very clear personal commitment on this issue he will be aware that build and maintain trust between the affect family and the government be essential be sure he will agree that the hillsborough law which come before the house next week be one example of how we can continue to repay that trust and demonstrate that we be determined to see recommendation such as the duty of candour put in statute my constituent who be affect by the scandal still continually ask for reassurance on transparency so will he consider publish regular datum on claim receive assess and pay so that the public can clearly see the progress that be be make exponential or otherwise my hon friend be entirely correct about transparency ibca continue to publish statistic which be very important have today publish the technical expert group minute which be very important too my hon friend put his finger on another really important aspect of the response to sir brian langstaff report from last year the duty of candour which will be hugely important in drive cultural change across public service be proud that we will have the second reading of the relevant bill on monday welcome the minister statement and the opening of further interim payment last week the family of infected people in falkirk have in the past tell that system could be well streamline to improve the pace of delivery know the pace of delivery will continue to be imperative for family so what assurance can the minister provide that the action set out in his statement and action take follow the consultation will continue to reflect the feedback of infected people and affected family my hon friend be entirely correct we will have consultation and introduce transparency mechanism but we will also look very seriously at the recommendation that tyrone urch have make we need to ensure that the speed of payment continue to increase but also as my hon friend say that feedback from victim be at the heart of the process in one of the first contribution have the privilege of make in the house raise the case of the blake family their son stuart be infect aged six and he die at the age of back in have be in regular contact with the family and it be my privilege to show they around this place just few week ago be sure the minister and the house will understand that this have consume their family for four decade and they be still seek reassurance about the urgency with which the government be bring forward payment and about whether they will be make as quickly as possible be really encourage by the statement the family be eligible for the second interim payment but would be grateful if the minister confirm his personal commitment to bring such case to resolution as soon as possible my hon friend have previously speak to movingly about the experience of the blake family and it be exactly family with such experience who be at the forefront of all our mind across the house as we drive this forward can of course give he personal commitment that will continue to do all can to quicken even far the pace of the compensation payment thank the minister for the update especially on behalf of my constituent robert who lose his brother age and who have be in regular contact with on this issue the government previously announce that they be allocate funding to charity that be recommendation of the inquiry will the minister confirm the step that he have be take with the department of health and social care to make sure that money get to those charity so they be fund to process application as quickly as possible my hon friend raise really important issue because charity have play an absolutely vital role in support and advocate for the victim of this scandal money be already allocate in this financial year know that there be concern go forward he can be assure that will work closely with health and social care ministers on that be very grateful to the minister for his update be pleased to report that one of my constituent the one whom have be most in contact with the minister about have finally be fully compensate which be huge relief to he and his family speak with he this morning and he be watch now although he welcome the improved service from ibca and find it reassure that the intention be to begin pay the first claim on behalf of estate of deceased infected people by the end of this year my constituent ask if there be anything we can do to prioritise those close to the end of their life so that they can get the justice they deserve in life bear in mind the valid inheritance tax concern raise by member from across the house be pleased to hear that my hon friend constituent have have his compensation payment my hon friend speak very powerfully on his constituent behalf on his point about those near the end of their life ibca have publish how it prioritise claim he and his constituent should be assure that it be exactly those who be at an advanced age and who be deal with this matter at this moment in their life for no other reason than the state failure to deal with it over past decade who be at the forefront of my mind as try to drive progress even fast point of order on point of order madam deputy speaker this weekend the hon member for east wiltshire danny kruger suggest on reform uk broadcast that the country could soon be run by an appalling hamas support lgbt support nationalist party as gay man and an mp be proud to say will always support lgbt right to suggest that that support be the same as back hamas vile terrorist organisation that systematically persecute lgbt people be beyond the pale what can we do across this house to make it clear to he and his party that support lgbt right be fundamental to our british value and to the value of this parliament thank the hon gentleman for notice of his point of order and his assurance that the member concern have be notify indicate assent can see the hon gentleman nod what member say outside the chamber be not matter for the chair but he have most definitely put his point on the record he have most likely read the recent report from the speaker conference which once again talk about member use moderate political language on point of order madam deputy speaker in july treasury minister agree to meet about the closure of the lending standards board ahead of the launch of the ethnicity code this meeting be schedule to take place in september but be cancel due to the government reshuffle despite an initial indication that this meeting would be reschedule have have no recent response to request from my office for date and time give that the lending standards board be due to close tomorrow wish to ask for your advice about what further step can take to ask the government to engage with on the ethnicity code thank the hon lady for notice of her point of order and her assurance that she have notify the minister while this be not matter for the chair be sure those on the treasury bench be seek to make eye contact have hear and note her frustration israel palestine conflict government response foreign affairs committee select committee statement emily thornberry will speak for up to minute during which time no intervention may be take at the conclusion of her statement will call member to ask question on the subject of the statement and these should be brief question not full speech emphasise that question should be direct to the select committee chair not the relevant government minister front benchers may take part in questioning must confess that in the year have be in parliament have never do one of these before it be all entirely new to if be do anything wrong please madam deputy speaker and be sure you will put back on the straight and narrow the situation in palestine be humanitarian catastrophe an injustice and great unfinished business it have also be huge diplomatic challenge for our country and indeed for the rest of the world we as country believe that we have some responsibility to try to find way through and rightly so give our history in the region and the potential assistance that we can give for long time our policy on israel and palestine have be dictate by be close to the americans believe that they be the one with the influence but the americans until recently be not really do anything in any event the israelis be certainly not listen to the americans and for sure they be not listen to we the international community think just stand and watch as hope for two state solution run into the sand meanwhile our long stand alliance with country such as the arab country be blemish by our continual refusal to recognise palestine so while we have willingness we be not as influential as we should or could be in the view of our committee britain need to have strong voice and there be more that we could do in the word of the former member for north east bedfordshire the former middle east minister we tend to do too little too late most of we think that it be beyond time to recognise palestinian state it be of immense importance as an expression of intent and good will and to help reset the important relationship in the region be really pleased that four day after our report be publish the government commit to recognise palestinian state accept that it be not just our report that persuade they it be also the circumstance of the france saudi arabia conference and the campaigning of great many people not least member of this house particularly the chair of the international development committee my hon friend the member for rotherham sarah champion our report also recommend that humanitarian aid must immediately flow in under the auspex of the un and call for the immediate dismantling of the gaza humanitarian foundation be glad that we have see the back of that organisation good riddance but be keen to hear more from the government about their contribution to the un day plan to deliver vital food aid and sanitation the committee report be not just about gaza we all agree that everything have to be do to protect the west bank from an increasingly violent and organised settler movement with representation at the high level of the israeli government we go on visit and see evidence of settler think they could act with impunity we also meet organisation establish to monitor the settlement that be be undermine by israeli legislation take funding away from non governmental organisation we urge the government to prepare comprehensive ban on the import of settlement good because when we say that settlement be illegal we must mean it and we must follow through we also call for the government to immediately evacuate injure child for medical treatment in the uk and be pleased that they immediately commit to do so we call for the government to participate in peacebuilding and to kick start negotiation for long term two state solution they tell we that they have play full part in the france saudi arabia conference but the question be what be happen now and how be we go to keep move forward we have to keep move forward many of we have be ask to express conclusion on breach of international law from genocide downward the government have consistently maintain the position that they be not able to make determination first because it be not for they but for court and secondly because we need to see the evidence have to say it look like genocide to but be not court that be why we need to play role in collect evidence for the future legal reckoning that must come be really disappointed more than that be genuinely surprised that the government do not agree to this in their response to our report one of the thing that the labour government pride themselves on which be proud of too be their commitment to uphold international law no matter how difficult it be really do not understand why they have take that view our report be the sum of huge amount of work by member of the committee and committee staff for which be hugely grateful we always know that as soon as it be publish it would go out of date maybe it have go out of date in good way at least there be some semblance of ceasefire now and the hostage have be release though it be very difficult to say all that give the event of this week what remain consistent be the approach that we believe the government should take to be consistent and clear to act as convenor sensible friend and force for good to work hard to refuse to look away and to take seriously our responsibility in the region peace will come it be question of when and how and whether britain will be at the forefront of craft it we believe that britain should be congratulate the right hon lady on her committee report in response to the seventh recommendation about palestinian state the government state our message to the terrorist of hamas be unchanged and unequivocal they must immediately release all the hostage sign up to ceasefire disarm and accept that they will play no part in the government of gaza do the foreign affairs committee give consideration to what should be do if hamas refuse to disarm and give way to for example the palestinian authority at the moment we find ourselves in vacuum where there be no plan for what be to happen to the strip now in lawless situation it be extremely challenging that be why we have to keep move forward the ceasefire be not the answer but only the first step there be some work be do but would like to be reassure that we be play central role in that believe that we could be and we should be thank the chair of the committee for her statement and her recognition of the committee member on recommendation on the reconstruction of gaza gaza be still the most dangerous place in the world to be child over child be report to have be kill or injure and nearly the same number have lose parent unicef which be headquarter in my constituency have raise urgent concern about the devastating and long term consequence that child be face include the trauma of mass displacement do my right hon friend agree that the long road to recovery must include specialist care for child so many of whom have witness unimaginable horror and whose survival safety and dignity have be imperille by war and humanitarian crisis for over two year thank my hon friend for all her work on this report her contribution have be so important she be right what we be try to do when find peace be to bring hope and future not just for palestinian child but for israeli child too so that they can live in peace together and have decent future be grateful to the chair of the committee for her statement in this place we use the phrase two state solution very readily and often so much so that it become cliché our visit as committee to the knesset reveal just how limited support for two state solution be there be pleased that the government announce their intention to recognise palestinian state on july just four day after the committee publish its report but draw the house attention to the september two state solution conference convene by france and saudi arabia in respond to the committee report the government say that they play full part in that conference and do so by co chair the work group on humanitarian action and reconstruction do the right hon member share my view that the uk contribution need to go beyond humanitarian action and that the uk must continue its engagement on how we can make two state solution reality thank the hon member for his contribution to the report and all his work it have be great deal of work and he certainly play his part it in so thank he yes britain can do so much we have experience in the region and we have really good friend we also have the experience of northern ireland people say there be no chance of get peace and long term solution in northern ireland until suddenly there it be we need to bring hopeful and positive attitude to this believe there be an important contribution that we can make welcome the statement of the chair of the committee think all of we on the committee be relieve that since our report be publish we have now reach ceasefire the un have be able to re enter gaza and the situation it have see on the ground be devastating the un humanitarian chief describe it as like go through the ruin of hiroshima while it be welcome that the un be able to restart its humanitarian delivery this be only first step towards the last peace that be need do the chair agree that the uk must play its part with international partner on security and governance as we move towards two state solution we need to enable palestinians to rebuild the place where they live in way that be fair for they my hon friend be another member of the committee who work very hard on this report his focus and commitment really make difference to the report so thank he for that we on the committee be concerned about the funding and assistance that can be give for governance defend democracy and create state not just in gaza but in other country we be very concerned about the budget and exactly how much will be available to do the vital work that britain be really good at we do not want to withdraw from the field thank the chair for her committee report she mention the possible determination of genocide and say that in her personal view that be what have take place of course un report have reach that conclusion as well be fairly certain that that should place certain obligation on the uk so will the committee commit to investigate exactly what the uk obligation be to any kind of international accountability process just as do not think britain as country can look away from what be happen do not think our committee can look away either we have ask the government for their response to that particular court case and we be still await proper response there may well be some obligation that be attach to it and we do think that it have take too long for the government to respond thank the chair of the foreign affairs committee and the committee itself for the report which think be very helpful and insightful share the concern that the chair outline about the gathering of evidence want to ask about medium access into the gaza strip be that an area that the committee could look at in future and do the chair have view on how it might help or hinder evidence gathering in our report we call for the medium to have free and full access to gaza the question have to be what have people get to hide not allow the medium in be breach of establish norm the medium be allow in no matter how difficult the circumstance it be for the medium to decide whether or not it should take the risk of go into particular area but the world do need to know what happen there have to be some form of accountability there have be limit accountability but nothing like the accountability there ought to have be have there be free access for the medium thank the chair and the committee very much for their report and think what they be say be positive the united states of america the united kingdom the eu and many arab state have all push for peace they state collectively that hamas can not have any part in the future of palestine that hamas be the obstacle and that hamas must be disarm and can never ever be allow to exist for last peace to mean something hamas have to go do the right hon lady agree with that of course agree with that and respect the experience the hon gentleman have in relation to northern ireland disarm terrorist and be able to move on be of crucial importance congratulate the committee on this important report and thank the chair for explain it and answer question in the chamber today there have be lot of discussion already even in this short interchange about gather evidence the right hon lady have highlight the position of the government on this but there be international body that need to gather evidence and reflect the point early that even journalist be not allow in what can she tell we about other evidence that be be gather by international organisation and what more do she think the international community not just individual government should do it be very good question of course the problem be that there be still not free access for anyone go in part of the concern obviously be that there be an attempt to undermine international jurist and the international court by not just israel but some of its ally we need to ensure that we stand by the rule of law and the international court there need to be reckoning on both side there have be on the face of it the most terrible crime commit and we need to ensure that people be hold to account we must not be afraid we must do that backbench business property service charge relevant document oral evidence take before the housing communities and local government committee on june on property management companies hc correspondence between the housing communities and local government committee and firstport uk on property management company date september august july and july report to the house on october september and july beg to move that this house have consider property service charge it be privilege to bring this important debate to the house today thank the backbench business committee for grant it remember vividly the day over year ago now when pick up the key to my first flat in south east london it take time to get to position where my salary be sufficient to secure mortgage and to save up the deposit but manage to do it spend the first few week on mattress on the floor while save for bed but it be the most amazing feeling in the world to own my own home be fortunate enough to have purchase the freehold so never have to face pay service charge that could not afford and never have to rely on third party management company to make essential repair when the time be right for to move on my flat be easy to sell other have not be so lucky they have buy leasehold on private estate and with that come life sentence today want to give voice to those people on the hook for ever increase service charge trap in home they can not afford but can not sell either who think they be buy their dream home when actually it be the start of nightmare make no mistake this be no exaggeration on my part people life have be and be be ruin by excessive service charge let start madam deputy speaker by tell you about park housing estate in redhill it be build year ago and have home mixture of house and flat it be contemporary and stunning site with the type of home that people want to live in it be particularly attractive to key worker such as doctor and nurse due to its proximity to east surrey hospital like many new estate it be build by private developer with no arrangement make for the local authority to adopt the communal land after completion so firstport be appoint as the property manager to maintain the estate this mean that resident of park pay an expensive service charge to firstport on top of their mortgage and on top of their council tax for pretty basic service those service charge be go up significantly every year drive some homeowner to the absolute brink first become aware of the issue when meet louise single mum at my first ever surgery last year meeting will never forget she tell how she have purchase one bedroom flat on park when they be first build but the service charge quickly increase become unaffordable for she in part due to the expensive biomass communal heating system in desperation she try to sell but three time over she lose her buyer she now let out the flat and have move back in with her family unable to access the equity that would allow she to buy somewhere else she be trap not able to move on with her life then there be alfie who purchase two bedroom flat in he be thrill to get on the property ladder at the age of think it be valuable investment his first service charge payment be just under per annum six year later it be over increase for that he say they basically cut the grass and insure the building when heating be include it get even bad due to the biomass system the first amount become go up to whopping per annum increase again madam deputy speaker remind you that he be pay council tax and mortgage on top alfie do consider challenge the service fee at tribunal but he be advise by the leasehold advisory service that for any chance of success he would need to appoint surveyor to review the service charge however to do that there need to be recognise tenant association and to set that up over of leaseholder need to agree in the case of park he quickly find that to be an impossible task as many rent out their property and so be not easily trace with that door close to he he try to sell his property for over two year even for less than he buy it for just to cover the mortgage there be lot of interest but every time the potential purchaser find out about the service charge they withdraw alfie say understandably nobody want to buy it the we buy any property company will touch it and even the auction site which run no sale no fee policy do want to take it on commend the hon lady for secure this important debate the fact that so many member be present be an indication of its importance in my constituency have see an increase in the number of people who buy their house or flat many year ago and be now face difficulty with the level of charge unexpected cost increase and poor communication and service quality do she agree that service charge can never be see as blank cheque for the owner and that what those charge be spend on must be itemise and make clear completely agree to add insult to injury alfie tell that firstport charge an administration fee if payment be not make within day of demand in he receive his fee on christmas day while in discussion about payment plan to settle outstanding fee firstport refuse to remove the charge despite his financial struggle alfie have now leave the uk and be rent his flat out at loss because that be the only option available to he the hon lady highlight the problem of resident be charge late payment fee have number of constituent who never receive an original letter demand payment but who be then charge late payment fee despite not know payment be due do she agree with that the lack of communication be another critical issue that we must address thank the hon member for raise that point completely agree that be very much an issue as have hear that too alfie and louise sadly be not alone so many other people on park find themselves in the same situation trap unable to sell and move on with their life and wish they have never buy the property in the first place sam another resident say that it not an exaggeration to say this be ruin people life he have wife and child and want to have another but he can not move to big property as he can not sell this one it be literally stop they grow their family he even try sell his flat for less than the valuation and he still could not sell it due to the service charge this be devastating for they as family as constituency mp have have some appalling experience with firstport at oak lodge in hockley and at king georges court in rayleigh the latter be four storey mccarthy stone development that it manage where the lift be out of action for almost year be not the fundamental problem with firstport that it be ultimately own by several offshore venture capital company that be very aggressive in seek revenue from their tenant but do not seem very willing to provide decent quality of service in return thank my right hon friend for provide that very useful context will come on to that in my speech one of the challenge we have be that property service company be seek to make profit yet they be unregulated and free to do as they will it be for this place to get handle on that hope that today we can think constructively about potential solution to address the problem the scale of which across the house we all recognise we do not want our constituent to continue to face it be afraid to say that firstport be not cover itself in glory have now hear hundred of time over about its lack of responsiveness lack of transparency on cost and inadequate explanation of service charge increase resident have tell about be bill for service they have never receive like window cleaning with no avenue to formally challenge and remediate any opportunity to charge resident be use to the full these thing be all symptomatic of an industry that prioritise extract maximum value from leaseholder regardless of the human cost there be no incentive for property service company to act any differently it be incredibly hard for leaseholder to remove they so the company have free rein to do pretty much what they like this fundamental power imbalance must be address and it must be make easy for leaseholder to take their business elsewhere the park service charge for the year end april be estimate to be just under million high than last year estimate the increase in cost be primarily to cover the future replacement of playground equipment street lighting road repair and other infrastructure park resident be also pay council tax for exactly those type of thing outside the estate out of the million service charge firstport keep around in fee which work out at just under of the total service charge how easy be it for to find that figure in firstport cost breakdown not very have to total up number across many page of cost as there be no nice neat summary at the front show the total amount that may or may not be out of kilter with industry find it difficult when research to confirm one way or another which be an issue in itself the key point to recognise here though be that there be absolutely no incentive or requirement for firstport to keep the cost base low in fact the more money it spend on maintain the estate and the more people it employ to deliver service the small the percentage proportion its management fee appear to be perverse incentive indeed it would be very easy for to berate property service company throughout my speech and suspect that other will take up that mantle during the debate however we must recognise that it be the current system that allow the company to operate in this way south derbyshire district council have take the bold and rather commendable decision to ban any new property management fee and to backdate that to january however that do not help those who already have home they buy before do the hon lady agree that we should press our government to legislate to help those who be tie into these arrangement to come out of they thank the hon member for that point an important debate for we to have today be about what we do go forward both for those who have not yet buy leasehold and to help our constituent who be in this situation right now be really interested to hear everyone view on that these company be symptom of the problem they be opportunist make money from an inequitable system it be this house that must take responsibility for address the intrinsic unfairness and urgently make the change need to unshackle leaseholder hope that we will today hear hon member view on the solution not just the issue we can not keep build new housing estate under this same model perpetuate the problem this be increasingly important in the light of the government ambitious plan to build million new home over the next few year have to say if nothing have change when the time come for my child to purchase property will be strongly advise they not to purchase leasehold on private estate to start we off will give the house my view think make it easy for leaseholder to change property service company be important as be well regulation and high standard but that will not fundamentally transform the situation what be need what be critical be change to the default model so that homeowner be not pay both the council and private company for the exact same service one sensible and equitable option would be that local authority be oblige to adopt communal land and infrastructure on completion of new estate in all but the most exceptional case for that to work in practice developer would need to be oblige to ensure that the infrastructure meet the council standard before transfer that way owner of leasehold property would be put on an equal footing with everyone else pay for communal service once through their council tax that would certainly deal with future issue but what about those who like our constituent be already trap it may be that something more radical be need such as mandatory direction to all local authority to adopt communal land where request by exist estate it would be difficult know in this current financial environment and with the likely variability of estate quality but it would certainly address much of the issue and allow my constituent to sell their property and move on with their life know that this government be also keen to move forwards and towards commonhold arrangement especially for flat which essentially put management of the estate in the hand of leaseholder themselves there be some benefit to commonhold over the current model but it be not the silver bullet that be need and bring its own set of problem anyone who like have be involve in resident association or similar organisation or indeed who simply understand human nature will know that most people do not want to pay out for significant work so the work will not get do which in time will result in crumble road fail roof and fall home value again it will become difficult for resident to sell their property it be just another version of the same trap and one that pit neighbour against each other urge the government to think again on plan to make commonhold the default tenure for new build flat the hon lady be make some excellent point really think it be the radical solution that we need to consider should probably declare an interest as director of right to manage company we get so feed up with the freeholder fail to manage our building properly that we take back control however as she point out that be not the end of the story and we still need to get lot of people to agree on lot of thing and build up the reserve fund be particularly difficult encourage the hon lady to keep come up with idea that be bold than the one that be out there at the moment because it be sticky problem to fix thank the hon member for his encouragement and will keep come up with radical idea before finish want to raise the issue of education and information provision to homebuyer if most people know the current problem with leasehold arrangement they would not buy they or they certainly would not pay as much for they be sure that conveyancer include warning and information when manage the sale and purchase process but it be not cut through people be sleepwalk into purchase with little or no understanding of the uncapped service charge they be sign up to and we must do more to ensure that people be adequately advise and inform before sign on the dotted line would be most grateful if the minister could today give his view on few thing how can we good address the current power imbalance between leaseholder and property service company what role do he see an industry regulator play in drive up standard what default tenure model should be use for future housing estate to reduce the incidence of these issue in the first place would also appreciate his view on my suggestion to move to mandatory adoption model after development completion rise order all back benchers be now on six minute speaking limit call justin madders congratulate the hon member for reigate rebecca paul on her excellent speech and on secure the debate state for the record that be patron of the leasehold knowledge partnership which do such good work in advise leaseholder it be eight year ago that stand on the opposition side of the chamber and describe the use of leasehold in new development as the payment protection insurance of the house building industry be pleased to say that the previous government eventually start to tackle that and the current government will hopefully complete that work soon so that we can finally condemn leasehold to the history book it be four year ago that stand on the opposition side of the chamber and warn that estate management fee could replacement leasehold as the new ppi of the house building industry or as the indomitable woman of the national leasehold campaign term it fleecehold now that have come to pass it seem that just about every new development build in this country adopt the same exploitative model and the public be rightly ask what we be go to do about it the minister have amass great expertise in this area and know he be keen to crack on with reform there be number of legal case ongoing be pleased to see that the bogus argument about human right have be dispatch by the high court however there be number of other where well resource freeholder be try to preserve the status quo and not every court be as wise as the high court be in the human right case the court of appeal recently find in the romney house case that where tenant go to the first tier tribunal to challenge service charge the tribunal need only to consider whether the process be reasonable and not whether the charge themselves be reasonable that be absurd and have have the effect of require those leaseholder to pay for the refurbishment of gym that they do not actually own it be freeholder with their seemingly limitless resource that can challenge and delay action by leaseholder to preserve their rotten system at every turn so the soon we implement the leasehold act in full the well there be clear warning here as to why we must crack on with tackle estate management fee more broadly look forward to the government response to the consultation when it come to stop any more estate be build in this way and we must end this practice as matter of urgency suggest as the hon member do that it will actually be much easy to do this than it have be for end leasehold urge the minister to send clear instruction to local authority that estate management arrangement will no long be accept in planning application and to legislate to ban they on any new development if necessary the long we put off fix that the long it will take to fix this mess fear the minister will be tell that such move would have an impact on the ambitious house building plan that we rightly have and would damage the housing market more generally but be we not face with the same argument when we try to abolish leasehold after all these developer do not have to pay community sum to the local authority indeed they have an additional lucrative income stream but despite those new income source it do not seem to have have any impact on the price they charge for people to buy their home in the first place the reality be that an estate management company be nothing more than calculation on balance sheet the developer have zero interest in keep the verge neat and tidy after they have go if they can make the bottom line look more attractive by create the management company they will and they keep get away with it because we let they of course we must act to protect those already catch in this trap it be also clear as we have hear that many people be not aware of the implication of an estate management company or how much it will cost they when they buy their home often first time buyer be excite by the prospect of own new home and they place their trust in the system the lender the developer the lawyer and the echo of the leasehold scandal with this be loud glitzy sale staff paint very different picture they never set out the reality that in addition to the significant commitment people be make when they buy home they be also agree to pay an unspecified sum to often unspecified recipient for as long as they stay in that home the mis selling and failure to properly advise have all the hallmark of the leasehold scandal we should not be surprise by that because the same actor be involve in that industry as be involve in these rip off an example of some of the novel way that this financial trap can be describe by sale staff come to my attention when constituent on recently build estate all have the common explanation give to they that this service charge be for storm drain but that it would be pay off in few year so they do not need to worry about it well they be still pay it year later they be not even sure if there be storm drain and even if there be who be actually responsible for it and yet the invoice and threaten letter still come we also recently meet interested party on another new development where we be try to clarify who be responsible for maintain what and who they be accountable to because the estate have be develop over several year by different developer about different organisation be represent at that meeting it be little wonder that we struggle for transparency with so many people involve the fundamental question from the homeowner be why be we pay twice for the maintenance of open space once through management fee and once through council tax we should start from the basic principle that the local council should be do all the work and that estate management company be an unnecessary tax on homeowner how long will it be before we see concerted campaign for people to get reduction on their council tax on the basis that they be be tax twice in the wrong hand that sort of campaign could pit community against one another let we not forget that buy home be the big single purchase people will ever make we need far great accountability for what developer say and what they build housing be of course critical part of our infrastructure and fundamental part of person life but it have be show time and again that we can not rely on the market alone to deliver that in responsible way let we get control over these company empower homeowner and legislate if necessary so that this rotten avaricious model become history just like leasehold eventually will congratulate my hon friend the member for reigate rebecca paul on secure this debate in the house early this year write to hundred of resident across the weald of kent to get well understanding of how property management company operate across our home what discover be very worrying and as many member here will recognise it be an all too common story to date have hear from nearly people across estate all complain about their property management company firstport the pattern be as depressing as it be predictable steep and unexplained increase in service charge slow and inadequate response to maintenance issue and serious lack of accountability and transparency let share few example constituent in yalding and headcorn have tell that they face and rise in their management fee respectively those be not minor uplift and nobody can tell they clearly what they be pay for understand that cost be rise not least for thing like insurance but at the very least hike like that should be clearly explain constituent in marden and kingsnorth have document case where no maintenance at all be carry out for month despite repeat chasing grass not cut light not fix and rubbish not clear and yet the bill keep come finally constituent in tenterden and coxheath have tell that it be begin to affect the value of their home as my hon friend mention some have say that their property be become unsellable because buyer will not take on the liability of these charge and this management in one case two sister be try to sell their late father flat he buy it for and they now can not even sell it at at auction the price have fall below they tell that local estate agent refuse to list it because of the fee associate with manage the property much of this be part of wide pattern many resident on these estate pay twice for what most people would regard as the same basic service they pay full council tax to their local authority as everyone do but on grow number of estate the council have not take over the road street lighting or green space and therefore do not maintain they to that point about council not have yet adopt such thing as the road or pavement have the example of pebble beach in seaton where represent where resident have be charge fee and even threaten with legal action before the estate have be hand from the developer to the property management company have she come across that too be afraid so and fairly regularly in fact the legal action that the hon member mention be important to reflect on because it can in some case be deeply distress and seem very aggressive for people just try to get what they have already pay for which in some case do not even exist yet resident be require to pay second set of charge on top of the council tax to private management company such as firstport they pay council tax for street lighting and then they pay private company for street lighting they pay council tax for maintain the verge and then they pay again for someone to cut the grass except of course in many case the grass be not cut in these situation the homeowner have almost no practical leverage the council say it be private land the management company say you be contractually oblige to pay we anyway and the person who live there who can not simply switch provider and who must disclose the charge when they come to sell be leave with little ability to challenge poor value people be pay more and get less there be continue lack of transparency with resident routinely deny proper breakdown of charge not give meaningful answer and in some case not even give the dignity of reply firstport be one of many property management company that have be allow in some respect to conduct themselves with impunity largely because local resident have almost no consumer power or transparency have meet representative of firstport and they assure that the company be change and improve very much hope that this be true but in case that do not happen the last government take important step to address this through the leasehold and freehold reform act the purpose of the act be to give resident clear information about what they be be charge and why to widen access to redress when something go wrong which be crucial and to ensure that dispute with management company can be resolve fairly but resident will not see those benefit until all the secondary legislation be bring into force guidance be publish and management company be give clear expectation that they will need to comply caution the government against assume that the answer might be to layer on fresh regulation or to draft new bill encourage the government to accelerate the implementation of those element of the act my constituent do not want to wait say another year to see itemised comprehensible service charge bill and prompt access to redress they accept that the streetlight must be maintain the gutter clear and insurance buy they know all of that cost money but what they will not accept and nor should they be pay more for less with no answer and no accountability welcome this important debate and thank the hon member for reigate rebecca paul very much on behalf of the many constituent who come to my surgery who write to and who meet when be out and about in the many development across putney southfields roehampton and wandsworth town speak today on behalf not just of my constituent but of leaseholder across the country who feel that they be be let down by the broken system one that continue to allow unfair and sharply rise service charge poor communication and substandard service to persist unchecked the limited right to challenge such change leave people feel as if they be fight the battle on their own as we know from the number of members present and from many other meeting people across the country face these issue so there be something wrong not just with the individual manage agency that we be all think of but with the system itself the hon member for weald of kent katie lam mention regulation do we need more layer of it we must also consider the check and balance in the system ask people to go to the first tier tribunal as last resort be so daunting and cumbersome that it be not proper check on the system welcome the government decisive action to tackle long stand injustice in leasehold and estate management thank the minister for all his work on that include the incoming change this debate be full of hope about those change make difference ahead of the closure of the government recent consultation on strengthen leaseholder protection conduct service charge consultation in my constituency where it be big issue in so many development the result which have submit to the government be deeply troubling more than constituent respond to my consultation and think they speak for hundred more almost of respondent report significant increase in their service charge even that they feel those increase be unjustified that come down not only to poor communication but to the fact that many of those service charge do seem to be unjustified those be not isolate case as we be hear in the debate in service charge rise by on average well above the rate of inflation and in my constituency they average per year see countless example of eye watering hike one constituent report that their annual service charge have increase from to per year for example while another tell they be send large additional bill right before christmas as their manage agent claw back more money after an error in its accounting that often happen during year in which the amount have already rise lot before rise more still because of extra charge and service provide or not provide as many constituent see it too many leaseholder be ignore by manage agent and charge for service that be sub standard or not deliver at all include clean service that show no sign of leave the building clean paint in communal area that do not need to be paint or for which the charge should be low and in one case garden service for garden that do not exist one of the most shocking example in my consultation be large development in my constituency leaseholder report revolving door of housing manager who be inexperienced unqualified overstretched and unfamiliar with the building history the manage agent present account that simply do not add up contractor be pay without check fault go un penalise and resident be leave to clean up the mess time and again the manage agent have ignore numerous industry expert who have state that important plumbing work need to be carry out some have say that the building be in serious danger of complete structural failure basic service be not carry out yet leaseholder continue to foot the bill the manage agent be suppose to paint the exterior at least every year but nothing happen it be the same old story again and again six manage agent be name many time in my consultation will not name they here because that would be damaging for the people who live in those development clearly there be some good manage agent and landlord but there be also some very bad one and those be the one that we need new bill to deal with the leasehold and freehold reform act contain proposal for great transparency through standardised account mandatory reserve fund and easy route to challenge unreasonable service charge rise and manage agent will face mandatory qualification and enforce membership of professional body those measure be all welcome the previous conservative government have year to act on these matter but pass leasehold reform law only in the die day of the last parliament so their measure be rush poorly draft and fail to ban new leasehold home be very glad that this debate offer we the chance to talk about go far on industry regulation and to welcome the commonhold bill leaseholder in my constituency and across the country have wait long enough the system be break the injustice be real and the need for reform be urgent call david reed many congratulation on baby reuben thank you very much madam deputy speaker it be nice to have his name on the record be very grateful for the opportunity to speak in this debate and thank my hon friend the member for reigate rebecca paul for bring the topic to the house attention in my constituency this be rapidly become one of the most frequently raise issue the big problem be that people who have work hard save responsibly and buy home in good faith find themselves trap in system that be opaque unaccountable and in the bad case exploitative like other member since be elect have be inundate with complaint about one company in particular we all know its name firstport it be by some distance the most problematic housing management company operate in my constituency my office be deal with almost open case relate to development that it manage the story be depressingly consistent resident describe unexplained charge unclear billing and long delay in resolve the simple issue we have hear many such example today they send long chain of unanswered email they attend my surgery exhaust and frustrated when my team contact firstport on resident behalf we often wait an unacceptable length of time for reply and progress if it come at all be slow early this year and other member of this house meet firstport manage director hope madam deputy speaker that you see as chill out kind of guy but leave that meeting with my blood boiling and other members have similar experience we ask forward question but receive vague answer rehearse corporate language and no clear commitment to improve customer service group of mps will meet firstport again soon and hope that the company have set to work in earnest on reflection what anger most be that many of the people catch up in these issue be elderly they feel intimidate by the complexity of the system they be pass from pillar to post ignore when they raise legitimate concern and make to feel like an inconvenience simply for ask what their money be be spend on however when firstport want payment this be something that it be very good at its communication become clear and very persistent when resident in several development try to move away from firstport essential financial document include sink fund balance and reconciliation statement be withhold in some case large sum of resident money be retain for month prevent new management company from plan maintenance or accounting properly in my constituency local resident director karen wheeler and david buller fierce campaigner have document delay fund transfer miss paperwork and opaque accounting karen eventually give up try to reconcile the final balance because the spreadsheet be in her word unfathomable for karen development the cost be about quite significant sum for many elderly resident but as my hon friend the member for reigate rightly say the real issue here be the power imbalance resident have no transparency no clarity and no meaningful route to resolution despite firstport own code of conduct which promise transparency value for money and excellent customer service think we can all agree that that do not stack up this be neither an isolated concern nor partisan one former ministers have highlight firstport and other company be consistently associate with high charge and poor service the bbc have report homeowner be bill for thing such as terrorism insurance without any context while basic ground maintenance be not complete more than mp have write jointly to firstport demand action we all know that the problem be structural far too many homeowner be lock into contract they never choose be force to pay service charge for poorly maintain communal area and have no ability to change provider when the service fail as we have hear many homeowner on private estate the so call fleecehold estate be effectively pay twice once through council tax and once through service charge leaseholder try to sell their home frequently face long delay and eye water administration fee and what should be proud milestone own or sell home become source of stress and financial burden we have hear that legal protection exist but they be not enough the leasehold and freehold reform act will bring mandatory transparency will the hon gentleman give way have one minute leave and will make my final point the act aim to bring mandatory transparency through standardised billing great right to challenge charge and easy route to take over management but those reform be not yet implement why be that hope that the minister in his closing remark will set out course for when those measure will be implement and will say what new legislation will be bring in to ensure that people be protect finish on point on which think we all agree resident who be on these scheme do not need more consultation they need action and this parliament must deliver order it be up to member if they wish to take an intervention if they do they have an extra minute on their speak time often hear the same story across doncaster east and the isle of axholme about bill that jump without warning charge that people can not control invoice that be hard to decipher and work that arrive late or not at all if we pay for service we should know what we be pay for the standard we can expect and how to put thing right when they go wrong there have be some progress on what have be coin fleecehold and on the right of homeowner welcome step to protect leaseholder from unjustified service charge and to raise standard in manage the agent sector but many people still feel powerless when bill land change must bite on the ground we have hear that many household pay estate rent charge on top of council tax and in the bad case there be excessive or unexplained fee charge for service that would normally be provide by local authority arbitrary administration cost and fee impose during sale too many discover too late that road verge and play area be not adopt no family should be ambush by large one off bill for work that they could not foresee clear pre sell disclosure and sensible reserve planning be essential there be good actor resident lead management company responsible freeholder and professional agent already publish clear breakdown and engage on work early they should feel back by system that raise the floor and reward good practice therefore ask the minister today for four thing first will the government promptly bring forward secondary legislation we need to define what insurance fee be permit end hide commission and require standardised transparent statement so resident can see where every single pound go secondly will they set professional standard for manage agent we need mandatory qualification and robust code of practice that will lift the quality bar and give resident confidence that estate be run properly thirdly will they fix the major work regime we need clear pre sale information to be provide early engagement on big project to be require sensible reserve to be plan and safeguard put in place so that household be not hit by avoidable spike fourthly will the government make redress fast and affordable we need to resource the first tier tribunal and publish simple guidance so that resident can challenge unreasonable cost without need deep pocket be sure that small number of timely ruling will reset behaviour across entire development my constituent in doncaster east and the isle of axholme be not ask for special treatment they be just ask for fairness bill that be clear charge that be reasonable and service deliver as promise have set up number of street surgery in the area from which get the most comment on this matter that way can hear constituent voice and directly feed back what they have say to the minister and the department as we move forward with the legislation with prompt secondary legislation tight definition on insurance professional standard for agent and an accessible tribunal system we can turn confusing and stressful system into one that treat resident with respect and provide peace of mind the hon member talk about secondary legislation when suggest what should happen next the leasehold and freehold reform act provide protection for leaseholder on private manage estate it enable they to go to tribunal to challenge management charge do he think that that ought to exist for freeholder as well the hon gentleman make valid point and it be certainly one that the minister should listen to and take into account be conclude when he intervene so will finish with this our home should be place where we get to dream not where we have nightmare as member of the housing communities and local government committee want to bring the house attention to the work we do in the summer look into property management company the chair of the committee the hon member for vauxhall and camberwell green florence eshalomi would have be here if she be not already commit to westminster hall debate at the same time so send her apology thank my hon friend the member for reigate rebecca paul for secure this important debate like many in this house my constituent have be affect by property charge and the lack of transparency from certain company we have already hear about firstport and wish to expand on what have be say about it in penn place in rickmansworth in my constituency firstport look after about apartment on an estate many of my constituent who live there have contact regard the ever increase service charge that they face their monthly payment have more than double on occasion they receive no communication as to why an increase be need and that place extortionate pressure both financial and emotional on those live there we all be aware of the cost of live in our community at the moment give the cost of council tax energy price and licence fee for renting property in certain london borough many of my constituent have be unable to sell or move as people do not want to purchase property that come with ever increase service charge and we have already hear about that this be not just an issue in my constituency have work with many of my fellow conservative mp on this and indeed know it to be proper cross party issue have huge amount of respect for the minister who know will continue to ensure that this issue be address build on the legacy of my government and continue to push the matter forward hopefully at speed look forward to he give that commitment when he respond to this debate despite its expensive charge firstport do not even provide an adequate property management service one of my constituent make aware that carpet be not be replace and wall be not be repaint there be also high turnover of property manager which be ineffective for maintain the estate and symptomatic of poorly run company when we be in government we bring in the leasehold and freehold reform act which require transparency about leasehold service charge it would have allow leaseholder such as those in penn place in my constituency to scrutinise and challenge increase if they be unreasonable the act have receive royal assent but it be yet to be bring fully into force understand some of the reason behind that but urge the minister to get move on this be sure he will give we that reassurance bit later in closing what assurance will the minister provide to my constituent and many across the country who constantly face service charge increase but no increase in service and how we can well protect those resident be so pleased that we be take the time today to debate property service charge in depth across my constituency resident be drown in soar bill defer maintenance opaque account and carousel of management company pass the buck these charge do not exist in vacuum they sit alongside dodgy contract conflict of interest and unadopted road structural failure that leave resident feel trapped and powerless since be elect have have so many constituent come to with leasehold horror story of course it be the service charge hike be that be bring up most in one case charge in be due to increase to over this year in property where many resident be retire and on fix income that be not to mention the lack of transparency over what the charge be for in this instance resident point out that charge for staffing be levy during time when there be no permanent on site manager want to give credit where it be due when meet the team at that management company for an explanation they hold their hand up and acknowledge that thing need to improve and they have since follow up with resident other company however be not quite as reflective have think about this will not name the company in my speech because do not want to blight the development in question but must warn these company that that be an option in the future if we do not see improvement the manage agent of one development in my constituency do not respond positively to my letter set out resident concern indeed it be display what have come to call the four horseman of the manage agent hike in service charge inadequate maintenance poor communication with resident and lack of financial transparency in previous contribution in the house say that resident have inform of increase in the service charge in two year in its very blunt reply the manage agent say that that be wrong and that the real increase be only doubling in four year which it consider reasonable do not and nor do my affected constituent who have point out that if we factor in various additional cost that use to be in the service charge but be then separate out it be close to the increase they cite maintenance work do not get do when resident take around their development this year see for myself the shoddily construct step that create hazard plus defective drainage malfunction lighting and so much more the responsibility for some of these issue be not clear as the developer should be take on some issue that arise shortly after development the lack of clarity mean that resident be deal with onerous back and forth whereby responsibility be forever pass on and it seem like maintenance issue will never be solve just today resident describe to how there be rat infestation at one point and contractor be apparently pay of resident money to resolve it it do not the resident association be later able to sort it out but not before that huge sum of their money be fritter away that bring on to the poor communication when highlight the above problem as well as concern from resident about service charge breakdown ask the manage agent what it would do to improve communication expect an answer that push back but at least agree to look into the concern raise do not even get that the response say it all we do not consider that communication require improvement then we come to the fourth horseman lack of financial transparency have be tell by resident that they be contractually bind to an insurance policy with excess make it completely unusable resident have show figure for one block that show total insurance premium charge of over of which just under around commission in confusing brokerage set up with much of that go to company link to the manage agent in quite clear way which smack of conflict of interest or bad there be so many other example of this at another development in my constituency account be provide late to resident for three of the last five year and in the most recent two year account have not be provide at all despite much push from resident and leaseholder it be not just leaseholder in flat who be affect by service charge have not yet discuss the fleecehold scandal sweep up so many of my resident in the newly build development of hampton unadopted road be rife in new development mean that resident be pay twice for their local area to be maintain once in their council tax and once in separate service charge count the number of road that need to be adopt but be without section agreement mean there be long way to go before they be adopt in the peterborough part of my constituency there be of they and they be mostly housing road that be an unjust extra charge for thousand of resident in hampton stanground orton and elsewhere because road be not be adopt some proposal have be make on how we could tackle this problem the home builders federation for example have make useful suggestion about common adoptable standard and mandatory adoption by public authority many member have raise the issue of the adoption of road obviously physical road be easy to define but there be part of private estate that be only for that estate do my hon friend agree that there be challenge give the current financial situation because it usually cost council money to adopt road and under the current law it could be big hit for those leaseholder to pay the fee up front for the council to adopt the road my hon friend make very useful point should have clarify that the figure give do not include the private road that be not suppose to be adopt it be purely the one that be have this issue as my hon friend say council be in difficult financial situation the precarious state of local government finance after year of cut and freeze certainly have not help we also have lot of council blame developer and developer blame council and there be an increase divergence between what council planning department be require to grant permission for development and what the highway department of say council be willing to adopt that be particularly vexing when there be two tier system with plan at one level and highway at another hope local government reorganisation will help with that but it be happen in unitary authority too and we need to explore way to deal with that ultimately these be symptom of wide issue in how the system treat freeholder and leaseholder alike the leasehold and commonhold reform bill will be vital step forward be pleased the government be commit to end leasehold for new development from my experience that change can not come soon enough key advantage of commonhold become the default tenure be that manage agent will be appoint by and responsible to leaseholder rather than absentee corporate freeholder of course the situation with manage agent still need to be improve and be very supportive of mandatory regulation as core step towards that which hope the minister will comment on this debate come in week of real progress the renters rights act have become law finally give tenant the fair treatment they deserve let keep up that progress because nobody should have to pay through the nose for poor service broken promise and system that put profit before resident be grateful to the hon member for reigate rebecca paul for secure this important debate across the country and certainly across my constituency leaseholder be trap in system that too often leave they feel powerless they face spiral service charge opaque management practice and little or no accountability from the agent or freeholder who control their live environment in my experience these problem be particularly acute for elderly and more vulnerable resident many of whom live in retirement development and depend on the professionalism of those entrust with manage their estate far too often what they experience be mismanagement confusion and financial anxiety to illustrate the scale of the issue want to draw on two case from my surrey heath constituency that encapsulate the national failing first mytchett heath retirement complex manage by cognatum estates not for profit developer and operator base in the south and south east of england and secondly the courtyard in camberley residential building currently undergo cladding remediation in effect two scandal roll into one at the courtyard one of my constituent sharon have see her annual service charge rise by between and and have pay total of over that period on top of council tax in alone her bill rise by with no clear explanation when she seek answer from pinnacle property management the manage agent the response be slow incomplete and unhelpful she have be leave anxious powerless and deeply mistrustful of those manage her building at mytchett heath resident face an equally troubling pattern and be grateful to the hon member for north dorset simon hoare and my hon friend the member for honiton and sidmouth richard foord for support in my investigation of the organisation maintenance cost appear without warning or justification worse still the manage fee at mytchett heath the basic charge that resident pay for estate management have increase by since at an average rate of per year as all of we know that far exceed inflation wage growth and pension increase yet resident have be give no clear explanation of how those rise be justify nor any transparent breakdown of where their money be go there be no effective oversight mechanism for manage agent or freeholder although resident can in theory appeal to the industry ombudsman many be deter from that process because it be too long too complex and often too costly what be particularly concern for my resident at mytchett heath be that the manage director of cognatum estates mr john lavin also sit on the board of the association of retirement housing managers the very trade body that purport to regulate and uphold standard across the sector that be textbook case of mark one own homework elderly resident meanwhile be leave financially trap emotionally exhausted and with nowhere to turn the human cost of all this be immense stress anxiety deplete saving and complete loss of peace of mind these be retiree spend their later year pore over spreadsheet and unanswered email when they should be enjoy the comfort and security they have work for back in april meet the board of cognatum estates to hear its side of the story be tell that some resident be encourage other to protest in recent letter from cognatum chief executive officer hear that complaint be in fact part of co ordinate campaign to denigrate the organisation these be not political agitator should know because have meet enough of they but elderly homeowner who be ask basic question about the bill they receive they deserve answer not accusation in conclusion ask the minister three simple question when can leaseholder particularly elderly resident expect to be able to receive clear itemised explanation of how their service charge be calculate secondly when manage agent fail to communicate or justify large increase such as the rise in mytchett heath managing fee since what meaningful sanction might they face finally will the government review the governance of trade association such as the association of retirement housing managers to ensure genuine independence and oversight rather than industry insider mark their own homework the scandal of property service charge be one of the most unjust indefensible and generally enrage issue face my constituent in many case the charge amount to little more than form of parasitic exploitation of ordinary people by absentee landlord and business it have be allow to fester for far too long across the country million people be trap in broken system that leave they beholden to obscure often overseas company with licence to cream off their hard earn earning with almost complete impunity they have get away with it for year because leaseholder simply can not effectively challenge this unfairness as so often in britain today wealth be translate directly into power and ordinary people be leave without any sense of agency over something as basic as their month to month finance the issue of unfair and arbitrary property service charge be impact every corner of north east hertfordshire from royston to tewin and from baldock to buntingford there be fleecehold estate where constituent have purchase new build property under freehold condition but find they be hostage to the whim and desire of service company who can charge any amount of service fee they wish and without redress make mockery of the notion of freehold there be housing association tenant pay eye watering fee yet leave with neglect and inadequate service resident in retirement accommodation face extortionate maintenance cost that leave family struggle to pay care fee and trap with property that have little resale value and leaseholder face huge hike in service charge by freeholder yet see little evidence of the maintenance they be supposedly pay for one constituent put the experience plainly they be commit service charge abuse and they be make people live miserable have previously criticise privatised water company and housing developer for rake in vast profit despite substandard delivery but in many way they pale in comparison with the sheer audacity of the leasehold scandal these be issue root in feudal concept of property ownership and those trap pay these fee with next to no ability to challenge or escape they be in effect still suffer from form of economic serfdom where those with the right title deed can levy private taxis on ordinary people that bear practically no relation to service render nearly year after william conquest think the english have suffer under this norman yoke quite enough the government own competition and markets authority find no persuasive evidence that consumer receive anything in return for the ground rent they pay in community like letchworth that ring painfully true we should all welcome the government recent victory in the high court over wealthy private interest who throw million at try to block vital reform also welcome minister commitment to finish the job of reform leasehold look forward to support further step to end this scandal once and for all the solution be clear municipal estate ownership and the ability to move to commonhold as quickly as be reasonably possible home ownership should mean own the brick and mortar and should come with sense of freedom not exposure to exploitation no one should be leave behind as we put this injustice to bed would also like to take this opportunity to highlight the broad campaign for charter of community empowerment many of its principle be relevant to the debate if the government be to achieve that historic labour mission of redistribute not just wealth but power into the hand of the majority in today context that must mean trust that ordinary people be more capable of upkeepe their own estate and manage their home fairly than offshore firm or the landowne aristocracy for once will not rain down series of detailed demand on the minister as know he face complex legal situation leave by the previous administration today want only to urge he to cut this gordian knot in this parliament and give my constituent forward way out of be forever tie to service fee by unaccountable company the economic benefit to our high street which be desperately need in village and market town such as those represent would be enormous as thousand of family across the country find their disposable income no long slash every month by charge that can not be justify the resistance that the government have face from the freehold lobby cling desperately to their ill get gain and the sacred right to turn hard work people into cash cow should only renew our sense of urgency be sure that we will see more appeal and outcry from vested interest the government should know the labour party and million outside this place be unite behind they after the high court ruling the residential freehold association warn that the decision open the door for government to intervene in market far beyond the leasehold sector in other word the terrible spectre that democracy may be empower to secure the public good before private profit as my constituent lose out in an economy rig against ordinary people one that reward wealthy property owner and unearned income rather than those who go out and work for living say quite simply hope it be right commend my hon friend the member for reigate rebecca paul for secure this important debate understand more than most the issue with property service charge because be leaseholder where live in hoddesdon quarter of my constituent live in flat or maisonette and of property transaction in broxbourne last year involve leasehold property but shockingly as we have hear it be hard to find any leaseholder who have good word to say about their landlord or their service charge landlord and solicitor do not provide enough information to new resident and far too often prospective resident be not properly inform before they move in about how much service charge have increase in previous year they be then hit with huge rise down the line it be also unclear where the money be go resident in waltham cross tell the service charge have skyrocket from around to for each leaseholder yet live condition remain extremely dire resident here face ongoing issue include trespasser mould broken security door mice infestation and squatter our building also have several defect include weak floor fire safety issue and ongoing leakage at one point my flat become uninhabitable after severe leak that take month to resolve hear these story again and again from constituent who come to as the contact of last resort after month and sometimes year of neglect to their property in that case meet the management company involve rmg early this year but nothing have change whether it be rmg firstport bamptons homes or warwick estates leaseholder deserve well from their landlord and management company who focus purely on collect ever high charge for bad service however by far the bad treatment of leaseholder in my constituency have be at the hand of hope the minister be listen to this point labour run enfield council be first contact by resident on the whitefields estate in may this year and what hear leave outraged completely out of the blue enfield council be demand up to from each leaseholder for urgent repair roof that have never have leak be earmark to be replace and window would be fix even though they have be use for year without issue understandably my resident immediately ask what about my service charge well as the leasehold advisory service say many landlord collect money out of the service charge for sink fund to help cover the cost of exactly these kind of major work but not enfield council no it expect my constituent to stump up all the cash even after raise the service charge that year and as far as the resident be concern have not spend single penny on the estate in decade the whitefields estate tenant association and in particular leaseholder nicky mccabe have work incredibly hard to bring the community together in response to this issue they simply demand straightforward answer to straightforward question but they be meet with confusing statement from enfield council representative who find it far too easy to say that not my job attend the meeting there be number of director from enfield council there all of whom earn significant sum of money and they could not answer basic question from my constituent about how much they would have to pay and what be go to change on the estate the communication be shocking my constituent fight be still ongoing and they have my full support be sure that many member have attend meeting with group of resident who in try to resolve issue that be cause they so much anxiety be at their wit end we have an example in fylde that be actually pre the management company an estate have be develop but it flood during the construction and twice since and now the estate company be desperate to get it into management company and to transfer all the flood risk liability to that company do my hon friend agree that kind of thing will just cause further problem down the line agree with my hon friend who make an excellent point in stand up for his constituent this be an important point all mp across the house have probably attend such meeting and these company be unable to answer the most basic question they be pay considerable amount of money and they can not answer simple question from constituent about how much money they will have to pay where the liability sit and what work they be go to do do not know the case the hon gentleman be talk about but agree that good communication be important however it be his government under margaret thatcher who introduce the right to buy that mean we have leaseholder mix with council tenant so where council have to improve property it need to go to the leaseholder for their share of the cost there be always go to be tension there and he must acknowledge that that will be reality where we have pepper pot estate notwithstanding that he obviously need to fight for proper information for his constituent fully support the right to buy which be good be just state that it be good policy and support that the hon lady make an interesting point about communication which must be there as have mention enfield council do not collect sink fund which can go some way towards mitigate some of the issue as she and have raise with leaseholder be ask to stump up for large bill we need more transparency and well regulation and we must ensure here agree with hon member across the chamber that council adopt outside amenity space we need real improvement in the way that leaseholder be treat abolish ground rent be good first step and the government need to get on with deliver that also agree that commonhold must be more widespread but be by no mean silver bullet or right for everyone urge the government to get on with it improve the life of hundred of my constituent and urgently implement more of the leasehold and freehold reform act we must get on with those improvement and help hundred of our constituent rise order with an immediate five minute time limit call ms julie minns thank the hon member for reigate rebecca paul for secure the debate and enable member across the house to give voice to our constituent like mine in carlisle who be quite frankly feed up they be feed up with be charge hundred of pound year in estate management fee for service that be either not deliver or deliver poorly they be feed up with ask for transparency and get vague spreadsheet instead of receipt for the service that they be tell have be deliver and they be feed up with be tell that they have no choice no voice and no way to challenge that one of my first piece of casework after my election last year concern firstport and one of the more recent case concern another estate management company gateway they be different company but there be the same problem with charge for thing like grass cutting street cleaning and lighting maintenance one might say that those charge be to be expect but too often they be levy while the grass become overgrown the rubbish be not pick up and the road remain unlit quite rightly resident then ask for proof of where their money have be go and quite consistently they be give list of cost not invoice no evidence and no accountability in some case the same service appear more than once under different name it be confusing opaque and unfair acknowledge the work do by the last government and continue by our government be pleased to see swift action in the early month of this government to implement key provision of the leasehold and freehold reform act welcome the government wide programme of reform remove the threat of forfeiture tackle abuse by manage agent and implement the law commission recommendation on right to manage but we must go far especially as we build new home the government house building agenda be ambitious and rightly so we need more home and we need they quickly but we also need to ensure that when people move into those home they be not be rip off by management company they do not choose it be not enough just to get the brick and mortar down we need to ensure that the regulation around property charge be construct properly too we need enforceable standard for transparency if company charge for service they must be require to show that it be deliver and provide proof of what it cost if the grass become overgrown the litter pile up and the road remain unlit resident should not be expect to pay we also need clear route to redress at the moment too many people feel trap by be tie to management company that they do not choose with no meaningful way to hold it to account ask for reform be not about undermine the sector it be about fairness restore trust and ensure that when people buy home they be not buy into system that take advantage of they we have make start but if we be serious about protect homeowner we need to finish the job and to bring cowboy estate management company to heel pay tribute to the hon member for reigate rebecca paul for secure today debate and set out the deep concern about property service charge that many of we hear about from our constituent since be elect have receive countless email from constituent across bexleyheath crayford and slade green who be struggle with rise service charge lack of transparency and poor communication from manage agent in the word of constituent who live in development where the service charge have increase from year to year we honestly do have clue what we be pay for other describe themselves as cash cow and speak of financial hardship to those trap in their clutch one constituent pensioner have to borrow money from her adult child and she be now consider sell her car if another unexpected bill arrive another who ask to spread an additional bill over monthly payment be tell that she would be charge for the trouble have be hold public meeting with resident across my constituency this year to discuss these issue the meeting have see large turnout and resident understandably at the end of their tether accept that some increase in service charge can be explain by rise insurance cost build safety cost and other economic factor but other item on service charge bill beggar belief year for cctv when there be no cctv service charge for gym that have not be build service charge for concierge service that operate from be to pm and year to empty one dog bin that member of the public live outside of the estate be use on communal open space despite those cost maintenance often remain poor will focus on one example the eastside quarter development in bexleyheath on the site of our former council or civic office build few year ago the development be originally manage by djc which be then buy by firstport which have be relieve of its duty and replace by new manage agent the director of the management company take action to remove firstport in due to concern about performance level and lack of financial transparency which be raise by resident firstport be responsible for produce audit account for the year and but in the most recent correspondence have receive it fail to do so as result the developer be legally pursue those account at their cost firstport be unable to provide any fund on account to the new manage agent in correspondence to the new manage agent state that the service charge bank account be empty and that many supplier be owe substantial sum with many of they have withdraw service as result continue management on the estate be possible only because the developer provide substantial funding to the new manage agent to enable it to pay supplier have see similar issue on talehangers close in bexleyheath at vickers green in crayford where firstport have attend public meeting and where believe we be make some progress have see that some of the fault lie in my view with the local authority which agree planning development back in in which resident take on responsibility for the road the lighting and the public space which be then cost back to the resident welcome the government consultation on plan to strengthen protection over charge and service and hope that they will bring forward measure to support my constituent be proud to sponsor the managing agents regulation bill of my hon friend the member for uxbridge and south ruislip danny beales and support call from across the chamber for the need for clear manage agent standard and regulation welcome the minister comment on these matter and the measure to be bring forward in secondary legislation support the government work in this area but will continue to press for further action to empower resident and deal with service charge to protect resident across the bexleyheath and crayford constituency join other in congratulate the hon member for reigate rebecca paul on secure this debate know that leaseholder across the country will be watch this debate very closely because the cost of be leaseholder have contribute to the cost of living challenge that so many of our constituent have face for such long time my leaseholder action group in kensington and bayswater which the minister kindly meet with recently regularly share story of escalate unaccountable and untransparent service charge levy by manage agent that they have no control over at worst the current system can represent cartel with broken market in which competition between manage agent be undermine by monopoly type relationship with some freeholder and broken connection between those who pay the bill and those who deliver the service the impact can be devastating one of my constituent adriana have take her housing provider to tribunal three separate time simply to get clarity on how her service charge be calculate each time she have win but the housing provider be still not provide the information indeed it be now offer to withdraw all the charge rather than provide that information that be not transparency it rely on the assumption that the other resident many of whom be elderly or financially strained will not have the resource to challenge rather than give up adriana now support other resident in help they to understand their right and how to contest these unfair practice her determination be admirable but it should not fall to resident themselves to protect one another from system that be suppose to protect they another group of resident who speak to regularly about these issue who live in building call shaftesbury place have be hit with crippling increase to their charge after increase in their building insurance premium that annual cost which be up from to year have be pass directly to the leaseholder through their service charge the housing provider say that the freeholder procure the insurance the resident have see evidence suggest otherwise but the confusion over who procure the insurance and how the premium be calculate have leave leaseholder catch in the middle the justification appear to rest on fire risk assessment that many resident believe be flawed but the result be that ordinary homeowner include shared ownership homeowner try to climb the ladder have be leave with unaffordable bill and no clear line of accountability for how those cost have be allow to spiral commend my hon friend for explain the problem so clearly problem that be share by my elderly resident in aire valley court and sutton court in bingley they too have see above inflation rise in service charge and lack of transparency about account with no evidence to justify they do my hon friend agree that it be now time that we bring in licensing and strong regulation of manage agent such as firstport agree entirely with my hon friend there be now an overwhelming case for introduce mandatory professional standard which know the government be bring forward and for consider what regulation might look like whether that be new regulator or expand on the current system it be clear that some of the suggestion that the government have consult on in their strengthen leaseholder protection over charge and service consultation have the potential to deliver for resident such as mine and my hon friend that include right to veto their property agent and hope the threshold for that will be set at level that will work in place such as my constituency with large number of overseas and absent owner reach high threshold can be challenge so hope the threshold will be accessible my constituent would appreciate hearing from the minister or from different minister at later stage about our progress on tackle the issue of build insurance it be big issue particularly for metropolitan members of parliament of course that must go hand in hand with continue on the path to full reform of the system be delighted by the high court decision to comprehensively dismiss challenge to the leasehold and freehold reform act that be vital step that will enable progress towards implement reform that will make it easy and cheap for leaseholder to extend their lease or buy their freehold hope it will smooth the way for new bill that will deliver on our manifesto commitment to leaseholder to bring the feudal leasehold system to an end in this parliament be incredibly proud of that commitment and know that million of leaseholder watch this debate also want to see it deliver it be something that previous government promise but fail to deliver this government have already take decisive action to dramatically improve the right of million private rent household in england by abolish no fault eviction increase security in tenancy and ensure safe and healthy home for all we have take action to dramatically improve the right of million social rent household in england by bring awaab law into force guarantee emergency repair within statutory timeframe now we have the opportunity to deliver on our promise to the million leasehold household too place on record my thank to the hon member for reigate rebecca paul for bring this debate before the house and to the backbench business committee for scheduling time for it from the number of members present in the chamber today we can all see that property service charge be problem across the entire country but they certainly be for people in lichfield burntwood and the village in the time have will focus on just one of the estate where these charge be an issue the roman heights estate in the village of streethay on the edge of lichfield the people who live on that estate know just how difficult manage agent can be have have dozen of household get in touch to tell about the appalling service they have receive from their manage agent will not name it but be sure it be the first name we would think of over the summer hold town hall with resident at which hear the same thing over and over again bill for management be come through completely irregularly sometimes with three bill for three year be receive in the space of three month which be interesting there be absolutely no transparency about the level of charge with demand to come up with huge sum of money at moment notice all the while basic maintenance such as cut the grass just be not be do leave resident wonder what exactly they be pay for thank my hon friend who be also from staffordshire for give way constituent have get in touch with to say it genuinely feel like they be steal money from we another say just feel like we be cash cow for these company do my hon friend agree that if manage agent and company want to continue operate these service they must increase transparency and make thing more regular for their customer my hon friend be right she be very good friend and often she have see speech before give they but she have not see this one and she give the perfect segue into my next point transparency be so important when survey resident in the affected estate tell that billing be either poor or very poor some have tell that the management of the estate be poor or very poor have write to that management company and be look forward to meet it because its write response be simply not good enough much like my hon friend in staffordshire have constituent who be under the same management company even when try to use mechanism to see thing such as by section request under the landlord and tenancy act they have be ignore and dismiss or often be give incorrect information do my hon friend hope like do that when the minister sum up he will talk little bit about the technical measure for hold these organisation to account and why they be not work so well enforcement of the exist rule should be enough whether or not those should be change there be mechanism available that my constituent be try to access that be simply not work my hon friend be well apprise over the specific issue part of the issue we may be face be that he refer to an act of parliament that be old than either of we there may be significant space for an update in this area it be clear from my hon friend comment and from everything we have hear this afternoon that this situation be all too common up and down the country manage agent be just let people down the long term solution have to be council take on the management of these estate themselves it be an absolute travesty that we have bizarre situation where some people be be charge twice for the same service last week other labour mp and meet the house builders federation to discuss this issue and place on record my thank to my hon friend the member for hitchin alistair strathern for organise that the message that come out of that be clear that adoption be hold up those company too they want to see adoption happen fast there be massive issue with how they be approach for thing we hear one story of particular local authority that demand semi permeable paving as part of its planning process but its highway department will apparently never adopt anything with semi permeable paving that be totally bizarre situation it be case not of two council but of one organisation where the different part be not talk to each other council need to work hard on this issue they need to ensure that they be work with resident and company to get it right but they also need to have the money and expertise to be able to do so fourteen year of cut freeze and austerity on council have leave planning department hollow out and we need to ensure we be rebuild that capacity so that thing can be do correctly it be important that we take this issue seriously so that resident in my constituency and across the country get the service they so deeply need for which they apparently be pay through the nose rise be impose an immediate four minute time limit will see what can do madam deputy speaker property service charge and the behaviour of the company that levy they be cause real distress across the country thank the hon member for reigate rebecca paul for her speech set out those challenge in colchester have hear from resident in orchard gardens colne view and kingswood heath who be be charge astonishing amount often thousand of pound year for service that be either poorly deliver or not deliver at all many of those home be manage by one company and the house could guess that that company be firstport when walk into the chamber firstport have be name time in the chamber this year but imagine that have double in the course of this afternoon it claim to be an win property management service that make sure customer feel safe and happy in their home think we all have little bit of news for firstport retire resident in orchard gardens show demand for payment for service that they never receive or for which they have already pay resident at the colne view development have face year battle over neglect overcharging and obfuscation they have face extortionate service charge sometimes double in year yet their building be leave mouldy unsafe and unclean they feel bully belittle and beyond hope that they will ever resolve what have become living nightmare be pleased to say that one of those resident chia be able to come into parliament last week to give some evidence to panel of mp organise by my hon friend the members for hendon david pinto duschinsky and for cities of london and westminster rachel blake who have be work on this issue for some time hope the minister will consider the evidence that be gather will my hon friend give way be advise not to so that we can keep to time lord best chair of the regulation of property agents working group say in his recent evidence to the housing communities and local government committee that this be an unregulated sector and his group have call for proper regulation if property agent can not behave responsibly they must be hold to account this be about fairness restore trust and ensure that nobody in colchester or anywhere else have to pay over the odd for basic service or fight tooth and nail just to get straight answer from company like firstport urge the minister to move at pace to implement this new framework welcome this debate warmly pay tribute to the hon member for reigate rebecca paul for secure it and for her excellent speech introduce it and to other member for their great contribution property service charge whether for freeholder who have purchase home on unadopted new build estate or for leaseholder live in flat be huge concern to resident across dartford it be no exaggeration to say that the charge be cause misery to my constituent home to ebbsfleet garden city ingress park in greenhithe and the bridge estate near dartford the constituency that be proud to represent have among the high number of leaseholder and freeholder pay property service charge of any in the country as other have have survey my resident on manage agent and cost and it be fair to say in summary that resident be bemuse by what seem to be the lack of framework for assess what reasonable service charge should cover long term trend in rise building insurance cost and energy price and opaque charging practice by manage agent have create toxic mix for resident as if that be not enough long after buy their new property resident have be shock to receive demand for three to five year worth of backdate service charge in some case they even predate their ownership of the property or apply soon after they buy the property and the bill often contain immediate demand for repayment despite come year after people start occupy their home another incredibly frustrating issue for resident which the minister might be able to pick up directly with developer be lack of transparency for buyer regard the service charge they should expect to pay one constituent end up in debt as he be be charge for the maintenance of the estate around his house on which construction have not even be complete much of the area around new build estate in my constituency remain unadopted by the local authority an issue that we discuss early this year in westminster hall debate secure by my hon friend the member for hitchin alistair strathern there be huge sense of unease and unfairness among resident live on those unadopted estate they be pay full council tax in addition to hefty service charge they be pay for the local authority to maintain road and park in other part of the area but not those on the estate on which they live warmly welcome the minister response in that debate in which he confirm that it remain commitment to end the injustice of so call fleecehold estate and hope we can have an update on that at the end of this debate be grateful to have be among more than government members who have since november band together to hold to account manage agent include firstport and rmg we will not let manage agent off the hook for the extremely poor service that they deliver to our resident we need road map from the government on how unadopted road and estate will be take on by the local authority finally perhaps the minister might could remind house builder that their choice of manage agent for new development will cause they long term reputational damage if they continue to select company that simply be not up to the job let we get this right on behalf of freeholder and leaseholder across the country while we have hear countless example of grievance about property service charge today for many resident this ultimately boil down to one fundamental issue disparity far be it from to play devil advocate for broken sector market failure but some resident do face affordable service charge and benefit from management company that be responsive and effective in resolve their problem yet other often live in similar development be saddle with soar fee and management company that be slow unaccountable and uncommunicative leave basic issue unresolved for month on end when people be force to pay ever high price for worsen service it be no wonder that frustration and resentment towards the sector as whole be grow one of my constituent recently write to to say that they be alarm by their service charge which have rise from month to the following year staggering increase which might be record today the justification provide be that the management company which will not name the house can hazard guess have simply overspend on work that it have carry out such an arbitrary rise be unaffordable for so many household and illustrate the dramatic and damaging impact that unchecked service charge inflation can have beyond the question of cost lie an equally important issue transparency too often resident have no idea what they be pay for and why as we have hear service charge statement be opaque and when people ask for explanation they be often meet with obfuscation and silence there be also chronic lack of oversight and accountability and look forward to hear from the minister about the potential to address that as we have hear when resident wish to challenge high or unjustified cost their option for any form of recourse except through the court be limited the balance of power lie entirely with the manage agent not the homeowner foot the bill bad of all many people discover only after move in that the management company responsible for the estate be unfit for purpose and provide poor and inconsistent service in exchange for their hard earn money resident still have to pay council tax in addition to their service charge lead to feeling of be double charge it be therefore no surprise that my constituent be cry out for strong ability to take on the right to manage area that be manage locally be often extraordinarily effective with well service well value for money and well local oversight all compound to support community to thrive one of my constituent share her frustration that her estate management company consistently fail to maintain communal ground she write my issue be that we the resident have no real power or control over the management of the communal ground but we be expect to pay all the cost want that control we should have the right to make our own choice of property manager that sentiment be share by thousand across the country it speak to an urgent need for regulation of sector that have have licence to print money its high yield give private equity company perverse incentive dynamic which the hon member for reigate rebecca paul describe so eloquently at the start of this debate as we have hear problem also arise from the failure of local authority to adopt highway which be due to the poor incentive structure hope to see all these issue particularly transparency value for money accountability and professional standard address in the leasehold and commonhold reform bill after all the progress we have make on renter right in the past week the bill represent huge opportunity for leaseholder across the country thank to this labour government until we rebalance those relationship resident will continue to feel powerless exploit and unheard and that be completely unacceptable declare an interest as leaseholder myself like my hon friend the member for north west cambridgeshire sam carling will not name any manage agent or development because many of my resident be concerned that if their block be name it will cause they very big issue be delighted to hear from my hon friend the member for st austell and newquay noah law that there be some good management company because the picture be certainly mix in my patch the company that have be name often in this debate manage some estate in my area and some be well run than other lot seem to depend on the individual property manager and how they run their development and the size and age of development definitely have an impact in the short time that have will raise couple of important issue one be about insurance we know that cost go up post grenfell because insurance move from insure just the floor that flat be on to the entire block but other increase have arise that be difficult to explain and there be danger that we will struggle to get insurance one block in my patch be able to get one insurer quote for month only and it be quote an extortionately high excess rate at the beginning somewhere in the region of that be the excess that the housing association freeholder would have to pay before anything happen it manage to get that down but it could only get one month period of insurance think we need to be careful in our discussion about the relationship between insurance company and manage agent know from my role as chair of the treasury committee that there be very strict rule on ringfence operation so insurance company and manage agent should not have cosy relationship in law they be not entitle to do so thank my hon friend for her work on this issue on the treasury committee in my speech raise an insurance issue that my constituent have go to the financial ombudsman service about but they be have problem about whether it be fos issue or property ombudsman issue and it be just not very clear would she join in call for more clarity completely agree with my hon friend that we need clarity on this issue we be talk lot about service charge but the insurance industry have responsibility because it account for large chunk of they regulator have clear role to play and it be important that that be consider in all the change we be discuss be pleased that the government have be consult on these issue the consultation on service charge end in february so hope the minister can give we an update about it it be important to touch on couple of other issue we know that poor maintenance lead to high cost so standard and expectation should be set on maintenance which cost leaseholder but cost they less in the long run if thing be maintain that be repeat theme across my constituency as some very modern block have not be maintain properly which mean leaseholder end up pay more in the end than they should have do there be also an issue with greening block have constituent work very effectively to try to get electric vehicle charge point and well insulation in block that be an old warehouse the famous loft apartment be very popular in my constituency at one point however improve such thing create betterment which increase the ground rent because the owner of the building can say it be an improvement and can charge more such tenant be make their property greener clean and more efficient cost they less in lot of way but they be end up with their cost be put up somewhere else which seem to be complete imbalance that we have not discuss on the right to manage and commonhold be labour and co op mp and be very proud to be push for commonhold there can be issue where there be right to manage be work with development where there be right to manage company but the director have hide themselves away and be not act responsibly in answer and provide information to their neighbour in the development think governance need an overhaul in this area it be not go to solve everything if resident take over the management but then do not do good job so there need to be transparency all round as we know this be on top of increase mortgage charge and let we not forget what the budget do to mortgage charge shared owner be pay mortgage rent and service charge and this be all add to the cost of live and cause huge upset on top of the spending on build safety requirement that be hit so many of my constituent that be cause real problem but we need to be clear so rather than go through the list myself will endorse all the ask that my hon friend the member for doncaster east and the isle of axholme lee pitcher list about transparency openness and get clear right for resident to challenge service charge and to make sure they absolutely understand why they be be charge such fee that be the basic minimum but we should be make sure it happen call the liberal democrat spokesperson warmly congratulate the hon member for reigate rebecca paul on secure what give the number of member take part have clearly be an important debate liberal members of this place have be campaign to end residential leasehold and the charge it entail since lloyd george who at the time his people budget in say that the practice be not business it be blackmail ground rent be part of it fine fee you be to make no alteration without consent his word ring true today over century later we still have the same feudal system and charge that trap homeowner in cycle of uncapped ground rent exploitative charge and similarly unreasonable estate management fee the scale of the problem be staggering there be million leasehold property in england which be more than fifth of the housing stock but england wales and australia be the only country still operate such residential leasehold approach most other country be perfectly able to ensure building maintenance and safety without rely on such outdated practice one of the thing hear most often from my constituent be how long it take to get change in this place and property service charge be perfect example they have be around for decade but very little seem to have happen in the government commission the independent lord best to write report and he lay out sensible solution and clear path ahead new property regulator to establish code of practice the licensing of property manager and agent and minimum qualification for those work in the sector while acknowledge the last government work in this area it take they five year to bring forward legislation and when they do in the form of the leasehold and freehold reform act they completely neglect to regulate property management or spiral service charge that be measure of how leaseholder have be let down despite the overwhelming evidence of the need for action the labour government promise that they would implement the rest of the act but well over year later little progress have be make progress that would give redress to those saddle with charge they can not contest and marriage value that be wholly unreasonable these delay be fail the people who be trap in these property recently hear from one constituent about their experience of leasehold service charge when they purchase their property in the service charge be in they rise to which be increase the next year they go up to which be further increase the follow they reach which be another increase overall the service charge triple in just three year and for what after huge effort by resident ask to see quote and invoice it turn out that the answer be that it be for nothing or rather for incompetence and as lloyd george might have put it for greed there be invoice relate to other building entirely and gap difference between maintenance quote and actual cost eventually through the right to manage the resident appoint new manage agent and get their charge back down to around that mean that over those four year resident pay approximately in service charge if the charge have remain at the proper level it would have be year so they have overpay by each and they will never get that money back the money go straight into the pocket of unregulated manager that be the cost of delay it be real cost be bear by constituent of mine and other member the constituent say to that the process be akin to have full time job which be an entirely unreasonable way for the property industry to be work and what about resident who be less able than my constituent some resident may be old or in poor health or simply ill equipped for the massive task of navigate that bureaucracy they may be so busy with work or child that they do not know they have be rip off until it be too late folk should not have to devote that level of time and energy to get redress the issue of fleecehold which have be refer to by hon member include my hon friend the members for surrey heath dr pinkerton and for honiton and sidmouth richard foord must not be forget company such as firstport have be mention and assure members that they be as much of problem in taunton and wellington as they be elsewhere freeholder often have even few right to challenge estate management charge than those who have lease the arrangement operate almost like leasehold such resident pay double both their council tax and estate management charge and often receive far bad service than those who live on estate fully adopt by local authority where the only charge be council tax they have all the financial burden of leasehold without the legal protection another constituent freeholder in taunton have be await the regulation for year now so that he can take his case to tribunal even the right that exist on paper be worthless without effective enforcement currently neither leaseholder nor those pay estate management charge have any easy way to ensure that their right be uphold that be why we need both the provision of the act to be commence and an independent regulator with tooth and the ability to cap unreasonable charge levy on both leaseholder and freeholder even the british property federation say back in that the lack of any provision to introduce competency standard or regulation to our sector be miss opportunity the property institute have welcome proposal for oversight when even those who would be regulate be ask for it surely it be time to act the government rightly have an ambition to build new home year but we lib dems would prefer that to include stretching target of social home we agree that home be need however in build they we must not create next generation of fleecehold property the practice of developer build estate with share roadway and public space then retain ownership through management company and charge resident for their upkeep while those same resident be pay council tax have to end for the vast majority of standard development there need to be presumption that share area must be adopt by the local authority crucially council need to be give the proper resource to allow that the ability to recoup the cost of manage those space from developer or landowner and power to sanction those who fail to complete road and similar infrastructure to the right standard we can not allow developer to profit from management company while resident pay twice for the same service it have be year since lloyd george call out these practice we have have six year since lord best report lay out clear path forward we have have over year with the new government in office the evidence be overwhelming and the solution be clear liberal democrats be therefore call for new property regulator as recommend in the good report establish code of practice minimum qualification and the licensing of property manager leaseholder to be enable to get alternative quote for maintenance power for resident to act in common to take ownership of management company and common area the strengthening of council power to adopt with resource from developer or landowner the urgent abolition of ground rent for exist residential lease and crucially the capping of unreasonable service and estate management charge million of leaseholder and freeholder be wait they have wait long enough it be time for the government to act and end what have become the great british property rip off call the shadow secretary of state start by put on record my gratitude which suspect echo the view of many right hon and hon member to my hon friend the member for reigate rebecca paul for secure the debate and set out so clearly in her opening remark the significance of this issue and the corrosive impact it have on so many people the number of speech the tone of those speech and sadly the regular theme we have hear through those speech tell really tragic and frustrating story the experience of constituent across many different part of the country be unfortunately consistent they be in situation where they feel trapped powerless and voiceless and where the balance of power be completely unfair and that be all wrap up in something that should be positive experience own home and be able to enjoy your home and its surrounding the hon member for doncaster east and the isle of axholme lee pitcher sum it up very well as something that be mean to be dream turn into nightmare that consistent theme we have hear pay tribute to the hon member for ellesmere port and bromborough justin madders he clearly have not just passion on this issue but real experience of it also pay tribute to my hon and gallant friend the member for exmouth and exeter east david reed be strike by his confession that his normal mild mannered demeanour be sacrifice after meeting know his background be not sure if all right hon and hon member know it and can assure the house and the management company that he be not someone they should inspire to lose his temper today debate have be hold in very positive spirit this be an issue as have be evident today that generate genuine cross party agreement be proud of the fact that my party in government start the process of reform in this area will concede that we do not complete the process we absolutely recognise that number of thing that we put in place have make difference but we recognise that there be more to do have no intention of try to play party politic on this matter this debate have show that whether leaseholder be live in currently labour hold constituency lib dem constituency or conservative constituency their pain and suffering be real and think we be all collectively duty bind to do something about it that be why encourage the government to continue with the process of implement the leasehold and freehold reform act and ensure that the appropriate secondary legislation be fully in place and to do so quickly like other have receive numerous piece of correspondence from people whose property be manage by firstport and other and our constituent want we to get grip of this situation there be political and legitimate philosophical difference across this house the hon member for hackney south and shoreditch dame meg hillier make great point about by product of what my side of the house regard as an incredibly positive move by the thatcher government in the know that not everyone will agree that it be positive for completely legitimate reason one of the practical implication of that move be mixture of ownership type within block of property and that have to be resolve that resolution be not political issue but practical one find opportunity to work across the house to deliver those practical response be absolutely key my hon friend the member for south west hertfordshire mr mohindra recognise in his speech that there be cross party unity and focus on this matter and my hon friend the member for weald of kent katie lam make it clear that implementation be key people do not want grandstand on this issue they want actual shoulder to the wheel delivery have no doubt that speak for all member of my party when say that in the boring behind the scene get stuff do bit of this house business the government will enjoy our support in use the legislation that we start off to bring about well live environment for the people whom we serve will not detain the house much long because the message we need to send to the people we serve be that we recognise this challenge and we recognise that the market force that provide consumer choice be not work properly in this situation people be not able to choose between alternative provider the professionalism that be force on commercial organisation through the pressure of competition be not work here which be why we be see cost that be hide obscure and in some instance completely create out of thin air that be not how market be mean to work there have to be government intervention in this as free marketeer conservative that be not my default setting but in this instance it be clearly what we have to do will conclude by say that when the government take action to deliver on this matter they can rest assure that the opposition will give they practical support and will be chivy they along at every opportunity it be genuine pleasure to follow that constructive speech by the shadow secretary of state the right hon member for braintree sir james cleverly congratulate the hon member for reigate rebecca paul on secure debate on what be without question critically important and press issue for residential freeholder and leaseholder alike across the country and one that as the shadow secretary of state rightly say enjoy significant cross party consensus in open the debate the hon lady speak forcefully and eloquently on behalf of her constituent in redhill and in share their plight with the house bring alive the financial and emotional toll that leasehold term can take on homeowner across the country the many excellent contribution that follow from hon and right hon member powerfully reinforce the argument that the hon lady make the case study litter across those contribution be shocking but will not have surprise anyone in this house we all know from the work we do support leaseholder and residential freeholder in our constituency that for far too many of they the reality of home ownership have fall woefully short of the dream it be precisely because this government be no long prepared to accept that situation that we be determined to honour the commitment make in our manifesto and do what be necessary to finally bring the feudal leasehold system to an end in this parliament do not intend to detain the house for huge amount of time know there be another debate to follow but in the time have available would like to address the main issue that have be raise in the debate start with the various problem affect homeowner on private and mixed tenure housing estate but as ever be more than happy to meet any hon or right hon member who have raise an issue that be unable to cover as several hon member argue in their contribution we have see over recent year significant shift away from situation where local authority and utility company would generally adopt the respective amenity and public space within new residential development to one where private management arrangement take hold so call fleecehold arrangement share amenity and open space be now routinely not adopt and maintain at the public expense and the maintenance cost fall to resident through an estate rent charge fee pay in addition to council tax the estate charge also normally cover the management cost of the estate management company although as have be evidence in the debate residential freeholder frequently complain that these company deliver little if anything beyond what local authority would usually provide in an area where amenity would have be adopt my department estimate that up to million home in england be locate on such private and mixed tenure estate although not all be subject to charge property on these estate often have restrictive covenant register at the land registry they may require homeowner to seek permission often for fee from the management company for action such as sell or let their home or alter its appearance in the bad case resident face excessive or unjustified charge levy for minimal service those may include fee for service normally provide by local authority arbitrary and costly administration fee unexplained increase in charge and fee impose during the sale of their home just want to add one more case study to the plethora that have already be provide today have resident who have one bed flat who see their charge rise by thousand of pound in just few year that financial burden also make it even hard to sell their property simply too many rogue developer and estate management company as allude to be exploit resident and demand excessive fee for maintain share and public space in development will the minister as many member have call for today commit finally to crack down on these money grab company cap unreasonable service and management charge and urgently abolish ground rent on exist lease if the hon lady have be present for the debate she would have hear extensive exchange on this subject but will set out what the government intend to do to provide leaseholder and residential freeholder with redress in these area will the minister give way will be more than happy to meet the right hon gentleman about this issue as do on regular basis and pick up these exchange but want to make bit of progress lastly the fragmentation of management on many of these estate compound the problem we experience even on relatively new development homeowner often have to deal with multiple management company each levy fee in way that reduce transparency and increase the risk of exploitation in those situation owner understandably often feel mislead and trap will the minister give way no will not give way any far there be another debate to follow and will not test your patience madam deputy speaker it be worth say that the competition and markets authority publish study of the house building industry last year it recommend strong protection for homeowner and call for the mandatory adoption of certain amenity on new estate and crucially common adoptable standard for those amenity the government response to that report accept many of its recommendation in principle but acknowledge that further work be require reiterate the government firm commitment to end the injustice of fleecehold entirely as set out in my write ministerial statement of november we will consult this year on legislative and policy option to reduce the prevalence of private estate management arrangement which be the root cause of the problem experience by many residential freeholder on that point say to the hon member for exmouth and exeter east david reed congratulate he on the birth of his child that must gently push back on his assertion that we do not need to consult through the consultation response that we be receive on issue such as service charge protection we be gather huge amount of information that will allow we to implement these change effectively to the last benefit of leaseholder it be also vital that homebuyer understand what will happen to the estate that they be move into the government be currently consult on guidance to support estate agent with their legal responsibility to provide potential buyer with relevant material information during property transaction as well as consult on what should be consider material information for buyer the government also want to empower owner who be already live on estate under these arrangement in september this year the law commission publish its programme of law reform which include project on the management of housing estate it will consider how resident could be give great control over the management of their housing estate my department be proud to be the sponsoring department for the project in the short term it be imperative that we protect residential freeholder on privately manage estate from unfair charge as hon member will be aware the leasehold and freehold reform act contain provision for new regulatory framework broadly mirror the right already enjoy by leaseholder and design to give residential freeholder new consumer protection we intend to consult again this year on how to implement those new protection to ensure that the framework be effective but want to assure hon member that be determined to bring they into force as quickly as possible many hon member mention service charge in wide sense and it be right that they champion the cause of leaseholder in their constituency as have make clear on many occasion in this house this government recognise the considerable financial strain that rise service charge place on leaseholder and tenant reiterate the government firm view that overcharge through service charge be completely unacceptable in july this year we consult on the measure in the leasehold and freehold reform act that be design to drive up the transparency of service charge we also consult on proposal to introduce fair litigation cost regime help leaseholder to challenge service charge and protect they from disproportionate legal expense the consultation include proposal on mandate reserve fund and reform the major work process as have say we have receive huge amount of useful feedback from the consultation which close on september assure hon member that the story have hear today will inform my thinking on how the government respond in due course on that point let say briefly that would welcome correspondence from my hon friend the members for kensington and bayswater joe powell for stoke on trent central gareth snell and for stafford leigh ingham with some further detail about why judgment of the tribunal be not be enforce in the case that they raise before conclude my remark must address the legitimate concern that have be raise in respect of the performance of manage agent both on freehold estate and in leasehold block we know that there be good manage agent who work hard to ensure that the resident they be responsible for be safe and secure and that home be properly look after but we also know that far too many leaseholder suffer from poor practice at the hand of unscrupulous manage agent hear so many reference to firstport during the debate that while be sit on the front bench ask my private office to send request to its manage director ask that he come and meet so that can convey some of the concern that have be raise manage agent play key role in the maintenance of multi occupancy building and freehold estate and their importance will only increase as we transition toward commonhold so it be essential that we strengthen their regulation to drive up the standard of their service as hon member will know the previous government commit to regulate the property agent sector in they ask working group chair by lord best to advise they on how to do it yet they fail to respond to the group final report publish in july this government have engage seriously and constructively with the finding set out in that report and we have already take forward number of its recommendation in the recent consultation on strengthen leaseholder protection from charge and service which reference early we consult on power to appoint manager or replace manage agent as well as on mandatory professional qualification for manage agent in england but that be not the final step in this process and we will set out our full position on regulation of estate let and manage agent in due course to conclude be grateful to the hon member for reigate for give the house an opportunity to debate these important matter thank all member who have participate in the debate today for share their concern and insight and say this genuinely very much look forward to further engagement with right hon and hon member as the government continue to implement the reform to the leasehold system that be already in statute and to progress the wide set of reform necessary to end the feudal leasehold system for good in this parliament and not least the ambitious draft commonhold and leasehold reform bill which we will publish before the end of the year call rebecca paul to wind up thank all right hon and hon member for participate today also thank all member for leave politic at the door on the whole everyone recognise that there be challenge we all agree that that challenge be impact our constituent live in detrimental way and think everyone come here today to try to solve that and thank they for that also thank the minister who have clearly listen closely to everything that be say today be grateful to he for take this with the seriousness that it deserve he have already contact firstport that be incredible and thank he for it thank the shadow secretary of state my right hon friend the member for braintree sir james cleverly for his contribution and the liberal democrat person the hon member for taunton and wellington gideon amos also thank the backbench business committee for allow time for this debate think we can all agree that it be time well spend and be sure that the committee will be happy with the number of hon member who be here to speak today in summary we have hear some truly astounding thing today be sure that we be all horrify by what some leaseholder have to endure it be clear that some property service company be exploit leaseholder for their own benefit and profit some do not provide value for money service do not adequately maintain communal area and be most certainly not transparent in their dealing their action trap resident in home they can not afford and can not sell but the law of the land currently allow those company to do that it be travesty and an absolute scandal look forward to the minister and the government act quickly to prevent further abuse and will support they and cheer they on in that question put and agree to resolve that this house have consider property service charge ageing and end of life care beg to move that this house have consider the age community and end of life care thank the backbench business committee for select this subject for debate declare an interest as the son of mona shannon who be year young and reside in nursing home near killyleagh in my constituency along with most other middle aged son or daughter in my case maybe wee bit more than middle aged be acutely aware that time be march on and so be my mum need the wee five foot nothing lady who keep three six foot son under control be no long to live alone but she be as sharp as tack and be thankful for the wisdom she give when visit she twice weekly indeed suspect that every friday and every sunday get wee bit of wisdom and maybe wee bit of telling off she always like to know what happen in this house and be able to tell she that but she will also give her opinion which never ignore indeed probably keep to it as much as can those visit to the nursing home couple with the focus on assist dying have highlight to with great effect the change that be need in how we handle our old generation and their need have speak with representative of both sue ryder and marie curie not simply to highlight the difficulty that most of we will be aware of but to offer some way that we can improve be pleased to see the under secretary of state for health and social care the hon member for glasgow south west dr ahmed in his place he and be become bit of tag team because on three day this week he have be the minister respond to the debate that have be involve in the shadow minister the hon member for hinckley and bosworth dr evans have be there as well so he should not be leave out accord to marie curie in the next year in northern ireland know it be not the minister responsibility but want to give the stat because they be important there will be people require this type of care which be rise of that include doubling of need by those age over it be also project that the number of death in the community in northern ireland could rise by during that time approximately of the cost of care deliver through the independent hospice sector in northern ireland be reliant on charity that be unsustainable new palliative care strategy for northern ireland that take account of demographic change and associate requirement for service transformation and investment be urgently need that be what be happen in northern ireland and in the mainland thing be very similar marie curie have highlight that as the population age more people will be live with and die with multiple complex condition every week in my office when it come to assist those of my mum generation and perhaps some of my own with benefit see people with multiple complex need more than ever it be not just one thing that people be suffer from but multitude of thing by the number of people in need of palliative and end of life care in the uk will rise by to over every year and that increase will be drive by growth in the number of people die over the age of these be really important stat and we can not ignore they indeed believe the minister will be focus on they around of the people who die each year need palliative care but one in four of they be miss out old people and particularly those with non cancer diagnosis be at risk of miss out on the palliative care they need at the end of life research indicate that most people want to receive care at the end of their life and die at home elderly people tell that all the time they want to be at home be grateful to the hon member for give way know he be press for time the charity together for short life point out that where child palliative care be concern there be wide variation across different region in the country be he afraid that this apply to the age population as well that there be no consistency in the amount of palliative care available thank the right hon member for his intervention and for the wisdom that he bring to all the debate he participate in the minister be listen and he be good minister so know he will come back with the response we hope to have how often have we listen to family member who be past themselves with exhaustion and guilt about how they be care for their love one and who feel unprepared and yet unwilling to let they go into nursing care with more support their life would be easy and their love one life happy this knowledge be why be not surprised to learn that almost billion of public fund be spend on healthcare for people in their last year of life of which be spend in hospital with only spend on primary and community care access to palliative care advice and support telephone line have be recommend as minimum service requirement for nearly two decade but research show that very little have happen which underline the issue that the right hon member for new forest east sir julian lewis raise only seven of the integrate care board in england say they have dedicated single point of access to palliative and end of life care advice guidance and onward referral to other service when need those be all important factor despite the introduction of new legal duty for icb to commission palliative care service in the health and care act the urgency and importance of ensure that everyone have the good possible care and support at the end of life have yet to be recognise as national priority hope the minister will be able to provide assurance on this because that be what marie curie want it be what sue ryder want and it be what every mum dad and family member want as well the day get to intervene on such an amazing member be remarkable day live in very rural area where there be place with real socioeconomic deprivation know for fact that there be huge inequality in those kind of area when it come to palliative care do he agree that the minister and the government need to look at how to reduce that inequality over the next year the hon member be absolutely right politic aside want the minister and the government to do the job it do not matter who the politician or the political party be let we just give our people some hope that be what wish to see come out of this what assessment have the government make of the need for national strategy for palliative and end of life care how will the government ensure that palliative care specialist be include in neighbourhood health centre what progress be the government make on ensure that every person with palliative care need in the uk have access to support and advice line believe that we can find route towards an acceptable standard of life not simply for those who can afford private healthcare but for all in our age community understand that the minister have copy of my note and my seven point will be in there to realise the year plan objective which have clearly say support and want to see happen as soon as possible palliative and end of life care must be recognise as vital part of our health and social care system without make palliative and end of life care priority for health reform the government will not achieve their bold ambition to provide more care in the community want the government to achieve that ambition speak early to the hon gentleman to ask if he would take an intervention when early this year my mum be place on end of life care she be put into the local hospital to receive that care have to repeatedly ask hospital staff to transfer she to our local excellent eden valley hospice it take three day for that request to be action do the hon gentleman agree that one change we could make be that when someone in our hospital be place on end of life care their family could be immediately apprise of the alternative provision that exist in our community the hon lady be absolutely right by the way that be one of my seven point we have speak but not exactly about that the debate bring we together with our request for the minister and the government we be thankful for that only of those who die aged or old receive care from palliative care specialist compare with of those age to and of those age to to the point make by the right hon member for new forest east most aged to spend most of their final month in private home but few than of those age or old do so one in seven die in hospital have be in there for less than hour when someone be come to their last day many complex need be involve there be also the problem for the family but they will have to deal with two thing in particular pain and probably breathlessness almost two third of unpaid carer feel anxious most or all the time about the die person illness or treatment shift care from the hospital to the community would benefit old people support the shift from hospital to community analogue to digital and prevent avoidable emergency care admission those be all thing that the government must develop in national strategy for palliative and end of life care the strategy must deliver on these seven point first an integrate whole system approach be need enable patient at the end of life to move seamlessly through service as their health change secondly the government must place palliative care at the centre of plan for neighbourhood health centre and ensure the inclusion of palliative care specialist key benefit of include palliative and end of life care in neighbourhood health centre will be the early identification of palliative care need and great uptake of advance care planning thirdly the government implement model of emergency and urgent care that can minimise avoidable accident and emergency visit that would provide financial saving for the nhs as well as give well care in well system that also come to the input of the family which be the very thing we all wish to see fourthly the government need to strengthen the statutory guidance on the legal duty to commission palliative care service in the health and care act hold integrate care board to account for the delivery of this duty must be part of that fifthly we must introduce national quality standard for palliative and end of life care that must be meet in all health and care setting that would strengthen accountability while catalyse the year health plan target shift from hospital to community for patient at the end of life they must also support more equitable implementation of the vision set out in the ambitious national framework for local action sixthly there must be access to support the very thing be ask for by create universal gateway to specialist palliative and end of life care advice guidance and support through nhs in my constituency we would say yin yin yin seventhly there must be long term sustainable funding solution for palliative and end of life care that can reduce reliance on charitable fundraising and ensure parity of esteem for the nhs and non nhs palliative care workforce transformation fund must also be create to invest in innovative and integrated model of care to meet different community need the minister be probably say my goodness be it just seven point but yes will stop at those seven although would like to comment on sue ryder if may all of these stat can become figure on page but when read they think of the wee mummy lie on her bathroom floor after fall all night in tear think of my constituent who sob in my office beg for help with their die parent think of carer who be run ragged and know that minute call with that elderly person can not possibly cater to their hygiene need as well as feed they think of district nurse who be late home because they would not leave their elderly patient upset after wound change and who make they wee cup of tea and stay for that comfort chat that time have not be allocate for professor jugdeep dhesi president of the british geriatrics society say everyone should have access to high quality care until the end of their life include palliative and end of life care when they need it sadly this be not the case for many old people across the united kingdom sue ryder also ask to highlight some issue it be work to create new ecosystem around palliative and end of life care and to unlock hospital productivity through swiftly shift care to the community in progressive way that be sensitive to the resource available across the wide system and focus on genuine collaboration at local place and system level the envisage ecosystem would absorb patient from across the acute setting and increase referral to community setting help our wonderful nhs to use its bed capacity more effectively and relieve strain on the discharge system the sue ryder model will shift care into the community by increase hospice at home service and virtual ward fund in line with national currency and fast track chc reform it be believe that this new approach to hospital care will develop dedicated care alongside suite on nhs site to provide compassionate tailor care for those approach the end of life and to relieve pressure on hospital team we must increase support for people in their own home that be what want what the hon member for carlisle ms minns want and probably what we be all seek it be about expand care in the community through partnership virtual ward and increase hospice at home service to help more people die at home and reduce emergency admission we must aim to make full use of hospice expertise and space to support people with complex multi morbidity and those in the last day of life prevent emergency admission and help people to live well will keep to your timescale madam deputy speaker be come to the end the end of life be not happy topic but believe it be necessary conversation we must open that conversation to ensure that people feel able to record their wish for the end of life so that more of their need be meet by the people involve in their care we must ensure that there be information and above all funding to deal with the grow pressure the family issue that the hon member for carlisle refer to because how we treat the most vulnerable in our society be the measure that we will all be judge by be no well than anybody else but as elect representative you and madam deputy speaker and everyone in the chamber want to do the good for our people today we ask for the good for our people work alongside my mum to ensure that her last time on earth be the good we can make it and know can safely say that it be the desire of this house and the minister to provide that for every person in the united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland but we can not do it without government buy in or without help from the minister and from the labour government and those in power the hospice sector be look for way to do thing well so ask the minister to join those who know this issue inside out and find route to help our age community and those in end of life care that be also from marie curie sue ryder and professor dhesi all those people and all of we as mps on behalf our constituent thank you for your time minister and look forward to your response rise order before call the first speaker members will have notice that we be push ish for time so ask they to keep their comment to around eight minute thank the hon member for strangford jim shannon for secure this debate and draw the house attention to my entry in the register of member financial interests be an officer of the all party group on carer and on housing and care for old people and be formerly chief executive of the centre for ageing better as age be subject close to my heart decide to check out my late personal life expectancy projection accord to the office for national statistics life expectancy calculator and it turn out that have one in four chance of live to many people would think oh how fantastic yes we all want to live long but not everybody will enjoy that same life expectancy we know that there be significant gap about year in life expectancy between the most and the least deprived that gap be reflect across the country as well as in my own constituency between wharfedale and windhill and wrose despite the tech bros try to defy ageing and death through all sort of technique in reality we be mortal and we will all face death at some point more of we will die at old age because of increase life expectancy to be honest with hon member death be boom industry and if they have not already invest in funeral director that might be something to look at the post war baby boomer be now in their and head into their so more of we will be die in the come decade society need to change in number of way to respond to our age society department across government be look at relate issue include work for long which be matter for the department for work and pensions and ensure that we build new home that be accessible will be speak to the minister for housing and planning who sum up in the previous debate about bring in new regulation to make home more accessible in addition we need to reform end of life care by it be project that an additional people will die per year bring the total to per year as the hon member for strangford say the people who miss out on end of life care be more likely to be old from black and minority ethnic community from low socioeconomic community or to have non cancer diagnosis there be lot to do to close the gap in access to palliative and end of life care particularly for old people an example of really good practice in bradford be the react model the responsive emergency assessment and community team model if you have not already visit madam deputy speaker you may wish to do so it be partnership between the marie curie hospice and bradford royal infirmary palliative care doctor be embed in so when people who be at the end of life be hit the accident and emergency department they get an intervention assessment and referral back to proactive multidisciplinary community base team the result be staggering in reduce the number of hospital bed day that people at end of life experience as we have hear most people do not want to die in hospital commend the shift that this government be look to make from hospital to community which hope be as true around end of life care as around other service however there be huge lack of consistency between integrate care board in how and what they commission there be much to do to support well care in the community include provide well support to gps particularly those with specialist interest in end of life care have district nurse work more closely with primary care team and embed within the new neighbourhood health team more example of hospice at home and multidisciplinary community team more training for care home manager and staff and the innovative use of unused hospital ward to provide hospice service in hospital where appropriate as have be mention we must ensure that there be hotline for patient and importantly for their carer so that when they find themselves in crisis at home they can get access to the advice that they need the national institute for health and care excellence have say they should have have access to such advice since but accord to marie curie only one in three area have such hotline while there be example of good practice there be much to do it be good news that more of we be live long but society have to adapt be pleased that we be do thing as government we have pension commission and the casey review look at social care but say to the minister now be the time to have national strategy for palliative and end of life care we be an age society and we need that along with reform of continue healthcare in his response hope he will set out how we ensure that everybody die well in old age and have good death thank the hon member for strangford jim shannon for secure this debate it have be pleasure to see his passion for his community and for the people of northern ireland especially as member of the northern ireland affairs committee care at the end of life and ensure dignity compassion and community in every chapter of life be so incredibly important pay tribute to weston hospicecare and particularly to paul winspear and his amazing team who be an extraordinary example of what compassionate community base care can achieve their current director of patient service john bailey retire in december after year of dedicated service paul the chief exec describe john as truly exceptional person and absolutely agree found in weston hospicecare support more than patient and family each year serve population of around people from clevedon to burnham on sea and from cheddar to weston super mare worle and the village that surround my constituency it be hard to find somebody in my town whose life have not be touch by weston hospicecare dedicated team my family be no exception weston hospicecare help we during some of our dark time have personal mission to help safeguard the future of this important facility its dedicated team provide in patient day hospice and community nursing service alongside physiotherapy counselling and bereavement support all free of charge weston hospicecare truly embody the spirit of my home town caring community minded and determine to do the right thing but it be important to acknowledge the pressure that it face daily weston hospicecare receive only around of its operating cost from the nhs compare with national average close to the rest must be raise through community fundraising shop and donation the generosity of our community be remarkable but it be be stretch to its limit despite some of the most innovative approach to fundraise that have witness be genuinely truly impressed by what weston hospicecare have be able to achieve over recent year hospice funding increase have fall well behind inflation the national living wage increase have rightly lift income and be entirely in favour of it but that and other factor have increase staffing cost for many hospice weston hospicecare face an annual deficit of roughly of its million budget and it have have to dip into reserve which now stand at less than six month cover for such vital service that mean so much to my community and to the community around we we must find well way despite that weston hospicecare continue to deliver outstanding value it provide care for patient with complex multi morbid condition who would otherwise occupy hospital bed or require costly community nursing and it be relieve pressure on the nhs in my town weston hospicecare save the health system money while deliver really outstanding outcome for patient and family the government recent million capital investment in hospice have be so important weston hospicecare have benefit from it and be particularly grateful for it as be but we all recognise that while one off capital investment be welcome it can not by itself secure the future we need sustainable commission model and fair funding for the essential specialist care that hospice provide while allow they to continue raise community fund for service that be so often see as optional but which be in reality vital such as family support bereavement care and the holistic and therapeutic service that help people to live and die well this issue be also about the wide fabric of our community in coastal town such as weston super mare where we have high proportion of old resident few large employer and sometimes high level of isolation hospice in particular my hospice be part of what hold our community together they offer not just care and employment but training volunteering and opportunity for young people to build meaningful career in care one of my good friend john williams have be carer his whole life all too often what consider to be vocation profession be undervalue that be something that we must change when we talk about age and end of life care we must see it not as burden but as mark of who we be society that value every life at every stage and see worth in all human life weston hospicecare be beacon of that principle and with the right long term funding framework believe it and other provider like it across the country can continue to serve our community for decade to come call the liberal democrat spokesperson congratulate the hon member for strangford jim shannon on secure this important debate it be well know that our population be age with the late census show that people age and over account for of the total population in surrey that figure be predict to increase to by in my constituency of epsom and ewell there be brilliant charity work to support the old population include age concern which empower old people to live the most fulfilling life they can while provide service include advice medical transport social support and befriending organisation such as age concern be vital lifeline for many especially follow the conservatives failure to fix social care and invest in preventive measure that support old people to stay in good health our old and ageing community also need to be able to access public service include gp provision accord to age uk the number of full time equivalent gps include trainee increase by just between and which be not keep pace with the population growth of old people age and over many gps be head towards retirement leave an even big gap so the government must go far with plan for recruitment there need to be concerted effort to build strong resilient gp workforce that prioritise retention and deliver service that stop old people from end up in hospital due to delay in primary care along with gp provision access to social care service be vital with an age population we be see more and more old and frail carer support their spouse put further strain on the carer own health we need to do more to support protect and empower old people so will the minister commit to reverse the conservatives cut to public health funding and facilitate social care system that be accessible to old people encourage preventive care and tackle key issue such as loneliness and frailty as our population age more people will be live with and die with multiple complex condition marie curie report that by the number of people in need of palliative and end of life care will rise to over people per year which be more than at present one local family in epsom and ewell have share their experience of struggle to access hospice care for love one with terminal illness despite their effort no hospice place be available and delay in pain relief make their love one final day distress something that could have be alleviate by well funding and co ordination of end of life service funding cut and year of neglect under the previous conservative government have lead to reduce service which have direct impact on patient and their family who deserve dignity and support in their final day the liberal democrats have propose exempt health and care provider from increase in employer national insurance contribution yet the government have ignore that proposal and have not provide much need support to the social care sector in far damn development report release just this week by the national audit office reveal that nearly two third of independent hospice in england report deficit in as result service have be slash and hospice have be force to cut the number of bed available due to lack of government funding with hospice and care service under strain people desperately need support and family often have no place to turn there have be number of successful and ongoing pilot by local nhs trust of dedicated phone line for palliative and end of life care need the thames valley pilot advice line lead to reduction in ambulance conveyance reduction in referral to out of hour primary care and fourfold increase in call close with no further intervention require nhs be brilliant service but it be not always appropriate access to specialised palliative care expert can alleviate patient anxiety streamline support and facilitate well care that be something that urge the minister to investigate will the minister commit to end the postcode lottery of funding for palliative care create dedicated hospice workforce plan expand carer allowance and provide guarantee respite care before end of life care eligibility begin as we manage the age population and navigate end of life care this government must put patient first and prevent devastating erosion of public service tackle dangerous understaffing and support people to age well in their community call the shadow minister yet again thank the hon member for strangford jim shannon he should be proud of mona shannon and she will be proud of he not just for raise this topic today but for all the work he do across this house talk about health because he be assiduous and dedicated to timely health intervention and that should be applaud across the house and this nation be indebted to he for secure this debate in the hon member speech he mention who he have speak to too have meet the organisation sue ryder and marie curie include at party conference and have meet many other organisation include loros and rainbows that cover my area when see the title ageing community for this debate must admit that think the hon member should have apply for five day debate consider what we could cover also notice the expertise in this debate we have secondary care surgeon someone with public health experience at the back and as gp it be turn into multidisciplinary team and there be lot to unpack whether it be prevention mitigation healthy lifestyle or look at the good example across the world recently travel to japan and korea and see how they look after their elderly and their approach to the lifestyle of the elderly there be lot to be learn out there as across the world we all grapple with an age population there be other topic that we could talk about and some be touch on on social care it be shame that there have be change from cross party talk to an independent commission note that baroness casey be be take back to the home office which mean she be spread thinly there be wide debate to be have on social care which be what do the british public actually want often we look at the scandinavian model but say that we do not want to pay the taxis for it we want the household or family approach like the bangladeshi or pakistani model but we certainly do not actually want grandma or grandpa come to stay with we and we want to stay work therein lie the problem in british culture we be not sure what we want when we cross over from the nhs into social care and we be not sure how to provide it some hard evidence of policy on an age community have be talk about and unfortunately have to raise the issue of winter fuel in the government analysis when they take away winter fuel payment despite all the warning they know that it would put people into absolute poverty and people into relative poverty we can contrast that with the opposition and our recent announcement on stamp duty jackson stops estimate that in the first year alone up to people above the age of would consider downsize because of that policy do not call that downsize as we hear in the debate on stamp duty it be right sizing because it give real chance not only for more family to go upwards but for people to move into more appropriate accommodation as they age there be lot to be say in the debate about an age population as the hon member for shipley anna dixon point out but will focus my comment on the three question that think catch from the hon member for strangford the assessment of the need for national strategy for palliative care what the government be do to ensure that palliative care be include in neighbourhood health centre and the progress be make on hour support will start with the national strategy and funding and let we give credit to the government where it be due when it come to child hospice funding they have continue the payment and extend it which be welcome although it do not offer enough mitigation for national insurance contribution the government will say that when it come to adult funding they have give million that be capital funding though and as one hospice worker put it to there be no point in have new curtain and lick of paint if there be no staff as the liberal democrats point out the national audit office report on the hospice sector that come out only yesterday state dhsc and nhs england do not know what proportion of the total amount of palliative and end of life care provide in england be deliver by the independent adult hospice sector and therefore how reliant they be on the sector or what the real impact of government funding be it continue in independent adult hospice in england report service reduction or staff redundancy and other hospice announce plan to reduce service in response to reduce income or increase cost cut appear to be across all type of service offer by hospice most hospice report the increase in the cost of service delivery within the palliative and end of life care sector as be the primary reason for service reduction six hospice have be designate by icb as commissioner request service mechanism to forewarn icb of potential difficulty with service that should they discontinue would have significant impact on the local population hospice uk respond to that say unfortunately the whole hospice sector be struggle just as demand for their service be rise surge cost mean in english hospice be plan cut this year and end last year with deficit of over what do that actually look like in real life in my area loros be face deficit of million it have already have to reduce its in patient capacity from to bed and it be reduce its day therapy and cut its physiotherapy occupational therapy social work chaplaincy and complementary therapy and close the volunteer home visit service it be not just my region that be affect cursory look at hansard will show that the kirkwood hospice in kirklees have make redundancy the ashgate hospice in derbyshire have job at risk with bed cut from to st catherine hospice in west sussex be look at job cut with half of its new room be mothball weston hospicecare highlight both here today by the hon member for weston super mare dan aldridge and by other include my hon friend the member for bridgwater sir ashley fox at other time face an increase national insurance bill of the arthur rank hospice in cambridgeshire be lose which be force the closure of nine bed of its capacity and marie curie have point out that its national insurance contribution cost have rise by million through all this we have still never hear whether the health team know that this be go to happen and choose to push it through or whether it be simply an oversight when it come to challenge the treasury ever since the budget we have never hear an answer to that at the time of the budget the ceo of marie curie matthew reed say the health secretary himself have acknowledge that palliative and end of life care be not good enough so we be shock by the lack of measure in the budget to fix it palliative care need be project to rise by over the next year around more people each year yet this government lack strategy to tackle the magnitude of this challenge have the government make an assessment of how much the nics increase have impact the hospice sector as have be mention together for short life estimate that the average hospice be face bill of about raise lot of these question in debate in january and the minister for care kindly write to in response it be not just about the financial side we be look at the structural aspect too he write as you be aware integrate care board be responsible for the commissioning of palliative and end of life care service to meet the need of their local population to support icb in this duty nhs england have publish statutory guidance and service specification in addition the national institute for health and care excellence have publish quality standard and guideline to support commissioner to carry out this duty while the nice guideline be not legally binding they act as regulatory benchmark for good practice in palliative and end of life care whilst the majority of palliative and end of life care be provide by nhs staff and service we recognise the vital part that voluntary sector organisation include hospice also play in provide support to people at the end of life and their loved one so there be grey area about where hospice be cover and that fit in with the nao report as the hon member rightly say icb be under legal duty to commission palliative care service do he not recognise that the problem we be have not just with hospice care but with the lack of availability of palliative and end of life care often come down to poor commissioning icb fail to commission in line with that statutory guidance and the confusion that arise between charitable donation and that which should be commission by the nhs the hon lady be spot on that be exactly the point that be get at while there be legal duty in term of palliation what that palliation look like be important her question be also raise by the hon member for strangford who ask whether it be now time to have strategy dedicate to palliative care give the rise in demand the letter go on to say charitable hospice be autonomous organisation that provide range of service that go beyond that which statutory service be legally require to provide consequently the funding arrangement reflect this we be in grey area and palliative care strategy could well be way to unlock this problem will be interested to hear what the government have to say on this issue however it be not just about finance and commission it be also about the workforce that be partly address in the letter as set out above we have commit to develop ten year plan to deliver an nhs fit for the future this summer we will publish refresh nhs long term workforce plan to deliver the transform health service we will build over the next decade so that patient can be treat on time again by my calculation we be come up to halloween and even bonfire night and we still have not see workforce plan my question to the government be when be we likely to see that that lead on to my next point how do the government intend to ensure that palliative care specialist be include in neighbourhood health centre the year plan be laudable and think there be agreement across the political spectrum on its content but the one thing it be miss be delivery chapter how be we go to do it the shift be correct but we do not know how we be go to get there so would be grateful if the minister could address that the year plan explicitly talk about public private partnership and there be concern on both side of the house that we could see pfi mark if member need to have their memory jogged private finance initiative bring in billion to build hospital and service but at cost of billion to taxpayer why do this all matter in my last few moment will turn to the final question that be pose by the hon member for strangford which be about access to hour support will quickly read out couple of comment from one of my constituent whose husband mat sadly pass away from brain tumour she highlight this issue during the day the support be outstanding because could call the community nurse and the palliative nurse and they would always call straight back they would visit mat daily to administer the medication need in his syringe driver they be kind caring and so supportive to we and our family the night time be different and frightening often during the night when be try to get support he could see how scared and stress be which make he more scared often tell he be okay just to try and not make worry every night use to be think what might happen tonight will mat have another seizure will he be in so much pain again will they call back if need support how long will it take to get help to arrive marie curie point out that only seven of the icb in england have single point of access raise this issue with the minister in letter in august and he kindly respond in september he point out that integrate care board must commission on this basis there be nice guidance on end of life care for adult under quality standard and on end of life care for adult service delivery under nice guideline which talk about the fact that there should be some form of hour care but at no point do the letter address the issue of the phoneline when ask the department about datum be tell in letter regard datum about palliative care helpline such as average waiting response time the department do not collect or hold this information will the minister look at that and consider whether the department should hold such information the letter go on to say we recognise that more could be do to support the palliative and end of life care sector have tasked official within the department and at nhs england to look at how improve the access quality and sustainability of all age palliative and end of life care to ensure that their proposal be in line with the ten year plan would be grateful if the minister could ask the minister responsible whether there be indeed an update and what that look like at the end of the day we be concerned not necessarily about input but much more about output we know that death be certain for we all only our willingness to face it seem optional this be very much british mentality and believe we need to change that when it come to talk about death and our mortality we need to speak more openly and candidly about what an age population look like for that be what we be that be why the hon member for strangford bring forward this debate and he remind we that we chase the day ahead while never quite notice how swiftly they turn into year behind we that lead to reflect on the fact that as politician and as society we build world to live long yet we all too easily forget to ask how do we want to grow old thank the hon member for strangford jim shannon for bring forward this debate the range of topic about which he be knowledgeable never cease to surprise we be grateful for his contribution to this house and wish his mother well be also grateful for the speech of my hon friend the member for shipley anna dixon she be too modest to say so but she be indeed an expert in social care and ageing and her call for national strategy for end of life care and ageing have be hear thank my hon friend the member for carlisle ms minns for share her powerful story about her mother that can not have be easy so be grateful for her bravery like my hon friend the member for weston super mare dan aldridge pay tribute to the hospice in weston and the dedicated team there will be happy to pass on any correspondence require regard the issue that the hon member for epsom and ewell helen maguire highlight about the service the planning funding and delivery of health service be devolve matter but be delighted to answer on behalf of the government on what we be do to improve palliative care and end of life care in england would like to take this opportunity to thank all of those who work and volunteer in palliative care both in the nhs and in our hospice sector for the support they provide to patient family and love one it would be remiss of not to mention the prince princess of wales hospice in my own constituency which recently take such good care of my cousin as she pass away from breast cancer this government want society in which every person receive high quality compassionate care from diagnosis through to the end of their life irrespective of their age condition or geographical region as the hon member for strangford have adumbrate end of life care and palliative care be much more than cancer care it be about age and age well we recognise that there be currently high number of hospital admission and bed day at the end of people life and the last year of people live account for of emergency admission and approximately third of all bed day be passionate about ensure that old people in medical setting be not subject to coercion over their medical decision have recently be contact by whistleblower from the jehovah witness who have express concern that some of the religious assistant who come in to support patient with their decision be actually coerce they will he offer any thought more broadly on how we can ensure that people be not be subject to coercion in old care setting be very concerned to hear what my hon friend have report to the house clearly coercion be unacceptable in all form safeguarding be take very seriously by the national health service and by the department of health and social care and as the minister with responsibility for patient safety be very happy to look into that far and to take it up with he after the debate as set out in the year health plan we be go to shift more care out of hospital and into community and make care more personalised if there be anywhere where that be most important it be palliative care and end of life care palliative care and end of life care include hospice have big role to play in that shift and they be highlight in the year plan as an integral component of neighbourhood health team in england integrate care board be responsible for the commissioning of palliative care and end of life care to meet the need of the local population to support icb in this duty nhs england have produce statutory guidance that include the need for access to palliative care and advice and palliative care and end of life care dashboard that bring together all relevant datum in one place the dashboard help commissioner understand the palliative care need of the local population of course the majority of palliative care and end of life care be provide by nhs staff and nhs service and that have benefit from the record funding in the nhs that the chancellor deliver in the last budget will not be able to address all the point make by the hon member for hinckley and bosworth dr evans as he be in typically verbose mood but if he will the end he must will the mean and if he do not agree with the mean he must present his thesis as to the alternative model of funding that he wish to see otherwise it be case of cut service however we recognise the vital part that voluntary sector organisation include hospice play in provide support to people at the end of their life and to their love one in recognition of that million of capital funding have be make available to hospice in england to ensure that they have the good physical environment for care that include help hospice to provide the good end of life care to patient and their family in supportive and dignified environment it include funding to deliver it system and provide refurbishment and facility for patient and visitor so that they can see their family member at the end of their life in dignified environment much more than just lick of paint give the recent national audit office report and the fact that the tax increase to national insurance contribution have have the big impact on the voluntary sector have an impact assessment be carry out into how much the cost have go up for hospice in england to provide their service if not will the minister consider it the hon gentleman know that the nao report cover period both when his party be in government and beyond go back to the point about nic if he will the end he must understand the mean be very happy to have that conversation with he at length after the debate respect the confine of the time that have do not want to test your patience madam deputy speaker be delighted that the first million of the million fund have be pass to hospice uk and have be spend on capital project already the minister for care my hon friend the member for aberafan maesteg stephen kinnock visit katharine house hospice early this year wigan and leigh hospice in july and noah ark child hospice early this month to see directly for himself how that record investment be make meaningful impact on the ground we can confirm that the department of health and social care have now transfer the rest of the million to hospice uk for onward spending in we be also provide million of revenue funding to support child and young people hospice this be continuation of the funding that up until recently be know as the child hospice grant that funding will see circa million allocate to child and young people hospice in england each year via local integrate care board on behalf of nhs england this amount in total to million of hospice funding over the next three year for many of we who be in good health manage complexity and ageing seem distant idea the government recognise that the number of people with palliative care and ageing need be project to rise significantly over the next quarter of century that be why we be shift more healthcare out of hospital and into community through our plan for change that be why we be invest through the national institute for health and care research over million in policy research unit in palliative and end of life care the unit launch in january and be build the evidence base on palliative care and end of life care early this year the minister of state for care and more recently the secretary of state meet key palliative care and end of life care and hospice stakeholder at dedicated roundtable and focus that discussion on long term sector sustainability within the context of the year plan follow the recent publication of the plan the minister of state for care tasked official to work at speed to generate proposal to improve the access quality and sustainability of all age palliative care and end of life care as we start to implement the plan in closing hope that those measure assure the hon member for

in his speech some million for hospice and some million for child hospice which the right hon member for new forest east also mention we be see palliative care and end of life care be central to the government year plan not one of we in this chamber will not welcome that plan if it bring forward what our people want it be the right plan with that in mind thank the minister and thank you madam deputy speaker for your patience question put and agree to resolve that this house have consider the age community and end of life care gp services melton and syston motion make and question propose that this house do now poynton thank you for call madam deputy speaker and through you thank mr speaker for grant this important adjournment debate congratulate the under secretary of state for health and social care the hon member for glasgow south west dr ahmed on his well deserve promotion to ministerial office it be in very short order but it be very well deserved thank he for be present to respond to this debate tonight because he have as have just indicate rather long journey home to his constituency than do back to leicestershire at the outset of this debate should put on the record that be of course register as patient at one of the nhs gp practice in my constituency which may refer to in the course of this debate as every member of this house will recognise general practice be in many way the gateway to the nhs for our constituent it have the potential to do huge amount more sadly on some occasion the gateway to nhs service for our constituent be simply to go to rather than seek to go to their general practitioner or indeed rather than use to the extent that it have the potential to be use pharmacy as first port of call as people can see pharmacist for some advice in the first instance for the vast majority of people though it be the gp practice that be the route into the nhs and where people go when they be concerned about their health be sure that all member of the house would recognise the challenge and pressure face by general practice irrespective of government in recent year there be number of factor behind that we should not forget the impact of the pandemic with the change pattern of attendance that follow it and the increase demand that come immediately after it we be also see the consequence of an age population in our country with people live long with more chronic condition we also see the increase pressure in many of our community irrespective of where they be in the country that arise from increase in housing development that be not meet with increase in the provision of key local infrastructure this have be especially true in recent year in my constituency where we have see huge increase local development without that infrastructure there be also the prospect of significantly more development be go to talk primarily today about the particular issue in melton mowbray and the surround village as have indicate to the minister as be keen that he be able to give pragmatic and helpful response for my constituent will also touch on some broad theme and on the provision of general practice in the village of sileby in my constituency which also face pressure and challenge find in my constituency and think the right hon gentleman will find the same that the extra responsibility of fill in form such as for personal independence payment universal credit employment and support allowance and disability living allowance fall on the gp have he find that provide the evidence for those benefit add even more to the already large workload of gps motion lapse standing order no motion make and question propose that this house do now poynton the hon gentleman be right although spend two and half year as minister in the department of health and social care be never the minister for primary care but be very much aware as suspect member across the house be that that be an additional pressure on time for general practitioner we in government seek to do what we could to reduce that and to be fair to the new government know the secretary of state be actively look at what can be do to far streamline administrative process to allow general practitioner and their team to spend more time with patient although my focus be on gp service in melton mowbray and sileby it be true that all gp surgery in my area whether that be the county practice and jubilee medical practice in syston or practice in thurmaston bottesford long clawson and other nearby village continue to face huge pressure it be important to say that these practice really do their good their staff not just the gps but the whole team work incredibly hard and know they care deeply about the service they provide to their patient in melton mowbray especially they see acute pressure particularly on appointment we have just one gp practice for grow town latham house medical practice have over patient on its book make it one of the large in the country timely access to gp appointment be one of the large regular issue to appear in my constituency inbox with wait accord to the correspondence receive of at least six week and it can be eight or week before an appointment be available clearly that be not right it be important to say to be fair to latham house medical practice that when my constituent get to see either nurse an allied health professional or gp they regularly cite in their email the quality of the care and the kindness show by the staff indeed we recently see cavell star award give to debra gilbert one of the nurse at the practice so the team there work hard and be passionate about what they do in they see an average of appointment per of the population on their list that be high than the national average but would urge little caution because that be crude statistic that do not necessarily comparatively reflect the different demographic of different area such as whether an old population or deprivation in an area lead to high need it be important to put on the record that they be do what they can to try to improve access but clearly an increase in provision be need locally back in the then clinical commissioning group agree that it recognise the need for increase provision of gp service in melton mowbray in the integrate care board continue with that and agree to explore second gp practice recognise the need for it believe that be sensible decision by the icb but regrettably just few week ago in early october it announce that it be pause its work to develop such plan until have be around the department of health and social care and work with the nhs long enough to know what pause sadly all too often mean in melton mowbray we have see pause of six month at the st mary birth centre midwifery lead unit to allow for staffing shortage to be address four month into that pause we have yet to see any suggestion of how it might be bring to an end when hear the word pause fear that will run on into something more permanent this issue which be hugely important to my constituent have be cover extensively and powerfully in the local medium in particular by the excellent local paper the melton times it be important to say that be conscious that neither as member of parliament nor melton borough council which be equally keen for increase provision and with which have speak or indeed the minister himself have the power to simply overrule decision take by an integrate care board in local matter such as this take through the act so have vague recollection of how that work that remain deeply disappointing decision and believe the wrong one the value of access to general practice and the impact that lack of access have be writ large early today have one of my regular catch up with councillor ronan browne the leader of the opposition on melton borough council who do lot to get we to the point where we be hopeful of see second gp practice he set out his deep disappointment about this decision there be clear remain need the icb in its announcement on reach its decision state that the section payment on which it be aim to base the provision of capital for the new building be now insufficient it also state that slow growth in new registration and slow population growth than have be anticipate be relevant to its decision making however that do not help my constituent be conscious of the challenge of funding building as the minister and have discuss in sense ironic though it may sound find money for building be sometimes easy than the second part of the equation which be secure the staff and manage the oncost to fund that should say that be grateful to the icb for its engagement and to toby sanders its chief executive for his open engagement with as say he have emphasise that he believe that section payment be not enough and the icb have say that it have no fund to backfill that or pay for anything from its own fund it be important to remember that as the minister will be aware general practitioner and general practice be in many way private business contract to provide service to the nhs but they be not direct employee of the nhs so they can not be directly instruct by the minister by icb or by nhs england it be important to put that context on the record in respect of the argument by the icb that there be insufficient increase in new registration and new patient to justify second gp practice at this time note the pause be afraid that that fail to reflect the importance of choice for patient in switch to different service in their locality if they so wish and in so do potentially ease pressure on the exist practice list pause without clear alternative long term plan be simply not good enough latham house surgery have recently announce that it have take step to help to address this in the short term on october it announce that it be recruit an extra five gps and additional nursing staff that its asfordby satellite surgery would be open full time in the future and that it be look to create new provision in small premise on sherrard street in the town those be welcome step for which be grateful and look forward to hear more about those proposal from the practice but they do not alter my view on the long term need of melton mowbray and the surround village the icb need to act and be support in do so by the department of health and social care it be true to say as well that icb face real challenge include the government require they to force cut in staff and to restructure but without seemingly provide they with additional ringfenced funding for the cost of that restructuring be they redundancie or otherwise that mean that regardless of whether the end be good one that is lean icb icb will potentially have to cut from the frontline in the short to medium term to fund that restructuring as have allude to there be also the challenge of oncost and funding gps to staff surgery gps have choice as to where they choose to work and suspect the old carr hill formula which the minister and have speak about in the past do not aid that it be challenge that government of all complexion have face and hope that he if he be willing will take on the challenge of look at the carr hill formula he will have my constructive support in do so latham house practice have cite the challenge in securing and retain staff so recognise that but again those be challenge for the government and the icb to assist and support with and not one that should be bear as consequence by my constituent will briefly mention sileby another village in my constituency it have two good gp practice but it be rapidly grow village and large premise be need again the icb have indicate that it will not have fund to fund or support that and once again section money be likely to be insufficient it be real challenge face by gp practice up and down the country as to how they take that step often have to accept more patient as house be build even when there be section payment it be only trigger later in the process once they have already have to absorb an increase in patient hope that the minister might look at that although recognise and welcome latham house action and hard work and hope that deliver result fear it simply be not enough to tackle the long term need the secretary of state new neighbourhood health centre programme may well help we in the long term for example one of those could be allocate to melton mowbray which already have melton mowbray hospital in my view an underused and therefore perfect site and the minister can take that as potential early bid for such centre that may help in the long term but we still need action now for my constituent to improve access and to build for the long term be sure the minister will know that melton mowbray and the surround village and town be fantastic place with real sense of community proud history great present and huge future potential just like the other part of my constituency melton mowbray resident be good decent people who need and frankly deserve improve access to gp appointment and an increase focus on tackle this for their community will the minister set out what step the government be take in partnership with icb to help address increase need for access to gp appointment both nationally and locally be he willing to take on the challenge of look at the carr hill formula and how gps be fund per patient for their activity will he reassure icb that all restructure cost over and above their current budget will be centrally fund to avoid they cut frontline service will he work for well link between section money and the need of healthcare provision locally will he meet ideally in melton mowbray he be very welcome to discuss what can be do locally to improve gp provision genuinely hope that he share my view that melton mowbray and the nearby village not only need further enhancement to exist service which latham house be try to put in place but genuinely need that second gp practice to meet their future need will continue to campaign on behalf of my constituent for that but will also as hope he have see in the brief time we have know each other be willing to work with the nhs and with any political party that help facilitate that locally and nationally finally will he agree to work with and my constituent to deliver the improved premise and service need to meet the current and future primary care need of my fantastic constituent in melton mowbray and the surround village thank the right hon member for melton and syston edward argar for raise the crucial issue of gp provision as relatively junior member of this place have always look around at the benches on both side of the house for eld statesman and woman who be exemplar of how to conduct oneself in this chamber he be certainly one of those member we miss he on the front bench and we be grateful for all his contribution be grateful to the minister for that the only point would make be that when at the age of one be describe as an eld statesman one can see retirement loom want to reassure he that have no intention of retire or step back from my duty in this house as medical practitioner can assure the right hon member that he be age well and be sure he have many more year of service to give will now take on some of the challenge that the right hon member say face gp service in melton mowbray and syston he be knowledgeable possibly more knowledgeable than about the carr hill formula can assure he that my hon friend the minister for care whose portfolio this come under be very engaged in reform the carr hill formula be sure he would be pleased to give an update on how he be get on with that the right hon member wish for meeting with the minister of state and would be delighted to arrange that for he be afraid can not confirm the location but can certainly arrange the meeting when ask about their top priority for the nhs the public overwhelmingly call for we to fix general practice and access to it that be at the heart of what people care about in this country and it be what they need first and foremost from their health service general practice remain the front door to our nhs deliver vital care to million across this country yet we all know the challenge face by both patient and gps the right hon member allude to many of they in his excellent speech access to appointment capacity and workforce pressure to name but few the government be absolutely committed to tackle these issue to ensure that everyone receive the care they deserve on the subject of capacity one of the big concern that be raise with when new house be propose for particular area of doncaster east and the isle of axholme be access to appointment in the future can the minister reassure and my resident that discussion take place between his department and the ministry of housing communities and local government on forecast future appointment to ensure that everyone get the support that they require that relate to the point make by the right hon member for melton and syston about section funding it would definitely be in the spirit of mission drive government to work collaboratively across departments in this case the department of health and social care and the ministry of housing communities and local government to ensure that as we build the million of home that we wish to in the lifetime of this parliament we do not neglect the service require to make those home happy and fulfil for the community who live in
