government have come in with purpose to bring growth and with it opportunity to the country in just six month we have take the tough decision to make that possible we be take on the responsibility of government who deliver real change for people no long the hollow promise of the conservative party but change deliver under this labour government work with business and local leader to drive the growth that will lift up this country now we must go far and fast so that the next generation and the generation after will have the opportunity they deserve to ensure that britain be strong and successful once again in fast change world and so that everybody in this country can have the chance to succeed today announcement will help make that reality and show how our plan for change will build well britain commend the statement to the house call the shadow chancellor of the exchequer the chief secretary tell we that growth be the no mission of this government and add now we must go fast which have to tell he suggest certain lack of ambition what we do not need be some hasty mañana moment of unquantified vague promise of well tomorrow we need action now to reverse the grievous damage that this chancellor have work in just her first six month in office why do the government deliver budget that the independent office for budget responsibility say would lead to low growth high inflation and high interest rate and would cost job have to tell the right hon gentleman that go for growth in the mean nothing to the business that have already stop hire shed worker and put up price thank to labour ruinous policy it be hard to escape the conclusion that these announcement have be hastily cobble together by government who be under increase pressure to change course but be seemingly incapable of do so why have these announcement come only now the labour party have year in opposition and month in government lead up to its first budget if the government really want to unleash investment innovation and the private sector they should not have decide in the autumn to increase substantially the tax burden and the size of the state by do so far from encourage private investment they be actively squeeze it out will the chief secretary to the treasury reassure business right now that there will be no further growth destroy fiscal measure in the spring statement include tax rise be the truth not that the damage be already be do even before labour tax rise bite in april the economy be flatline right now so will any of the announcement have an impact within this parliament and what if any impact be they likely to have on the obr forecast in march incredibly the chancellor say in her speech that business be what drive growth and that the government should support they yet this be government who have drive business confidence off cliff they have tax business to the hilt and through their upcoming employment legislation will be hit they still far with ever more job destroy red tape can the chief secretary to the treasury set out what the overall impact of government policy decision since july have be on regulatory cost for business do he agree with the business secretary extraordinary utterance on the medium this morning that the government have not hammer business the chancellor claim this morning that she have see no alternative suggestion from the opposition so let give she one now last year the conservative manifesto include billion in welfare saving at the time the labour party say that the money simply be not there now we be tell that the government will shortly be come forward with plan for welfare reform another damascene conversion if they have grasp this issue when they come into office they could have tackle the rise welfare bill rather than tax job and kill growth the government failure to act mean that business and million of people be pay the price so can the chief secretary to the treasury commit today to match that billion or can he at least tell we the scale of saving that we can expect from his promise reform some of the announcement make today be of course welcome the role of the opposition be not to oppose for opposition sake not least because many of the measure announce be reheat from the previous conservative government the plan on pension investment for example seem oddly familiar to we probably because they be simply to continue the reform that be bring in when be secretary of state for work and pensions even in this area though we must wait and see before pass judgment because this government have show that we simply can not trust their word they promise not to raise taxis but they do they promise not to cut winter fuel payment but they do they promise not to borrow more but they do we need to see action not just word the chancellor talk about remove barrier to growth oh yes she talk about it but that talk come from the same person whose budget kill the economy and growth stone dead if we be look to remove the great barrier to growth in this country perhaps we should start with the prime minister and the chancellor of the exchequer the house be indebted to the shadow chancellor mr melmentum himself for his lecture on the need for speed from this government let tell he that we have do more in the last six or seven month than that lot do in the last year the shadow chancellor ask about our plan to work with business the comment today from business leader and investor speak for themselves our plan be welcome by business and we will be work in partnership with they to deliver for this country he also ask about work those of we in the labour party make no secret of the fact that we like to support people into work strong secure work with workplace right and secure income to help make people family finance add up that be why our party be create in the first place the real truth from the data be that under the last government too many people be wait at home sick unable to get nhs appointment or access to mental health service so that they could be help back into work too many people be wait at home wait for training and unable to seize the opportunity advertise in front of they this labour government will not treat those thing as luxury but will work at speed to give people the work they deserve at the heart of the shadow chancellor statement be truth for the country to consider under the last administration it be promise cancel under this administration it be promise be deliver call the chair of the treasury committee welcome this government commitment to infrastructure investment and to tell the world that britain be open for business but to achieve all of this we will need really skilled workforce to deliver on those major construction project may ask my right hon friend to set out how the government will ensure that we have the skill to deliver what he have promise thank the chair of the treasury committee for her question this be an important test of turn policy into real world delivery through our infrastructure and industrial strategy we be engage right now with business and investor across the country so that as we bring forward our plan we have skill and training system that create opportunity for people to take up the job that we need they to do in order to help get britain building that will be crucial part of our approach to infrastructure so that every person across the country can seize the benefit of this government plan call the liberal democrat spokesperson the government be absolutely right to focus on economic growth but their blinker approach on europe be hold back british business and stifle the very growth that we need to fund our public service by rule out negotiation with the eu on bespoke customs union and youth mobility scheme the chancellor dash for growth will be more like slow crawl in car with the handbrake on in order to turbocharge economic growth will the government start negotiate those initiative now to unleash growth through our small business the chancellor should scrap her national insurance contribution rise and instead seek to raise the same amount of money through the measure that we liberal democrats have suggest reverse the tax cut on the big bank increase taxis on the big tech and gaming company and reform capital gain tax in way that would be fair and raise more money will the government look again at those alternative revenue raiser and lift the burden that the government have place on small business on airport the chancellor have voice her support for heathrow expansion and have suggest that expansion will be forthcoming for other airport we liberal democrats oppose this because it will deliver minimal growth at huge cost to the climate can the government confirm whether they intend to abide by the advice of their own climate change adviser that no airport expansion should proceed until uk wide capacity management framework be in place in the midst of climate emergency can the government give cast iron guarantee that the so call refresh carbon budget that the chancellor refer to will not water down climate target and what do they have to say to those expert who say that sustainable aviation fuel be not realistic or scalable turn to the oxford cambridge growth corridor we really welcome plan that far boost the uk position as european and global science leader can the government confirm that there will be enough money for the whole of the route to be construct on the east west rail route and that they will work hand in glove with local authority to minimise the environmental impact introduce infrastructure before or alongside housing and maximise local community benefit as the hon lady know this government commit in their manifesto to not rejoin the single market or the custom union we will honour that promise but the trade deal that the previous government put together be clearly not good enough there be room for we to improve our trading energy and security relationship with our friend in the european union and my ministerial colleague be in active discussion with their counterpart to take that work forward the hon lady invite to speculate on any future budgets that be above my pay grade but be sure the chancellor hear her suggestion on airport as say in my statement all our plan will be in line with our legal obligation of course we recognise the need for more sustainable fuel and sustainable transport as part of those expansion plan lastly the hon lady ask about something that can not read east west rail thank you think it be eu again could not read my own handwriting the whole premise of the growth corridor be that we will have transport spine through that corridor that allow for all the development housing lab space or community around it that be crucial part of our plan and we will make sure that it be deliver congratulate the chief secretary to the treasury and the chancellor of the exchequer on plan for growth that be both concrete shovel in the ground now and forward look build on our scientific and skill base to drive long term job and high living standard heathrow expansion will help business in the north east but for the sake of those of we who be not manchester united fan will the chief secretary to the treasury make it clear that much of the investment in the man development will be private sector base will he also set out how that will help the rest of the north particularly newcastle united fan such as myself thank the chair of the science innovation and technology committee for her question she and her committee know the huge advantage we have in the uk with our brilliant university and research and development ecosystem which be why we be support they and put rocket booster underneath their activity to develop world lead and frontier research and innovation and stimulate economic growth across the country my hon friend be right that the development in manchester be broad set of privately finance housing and commercial opportunity as well as the work that manchester united want to do with its football stadium should inform the house that can not give running commentary on the stadium application for all football club across the country and she will have to forgive for not know the late plan for newcastle welcome the government conversion on third runway at heathrow the sort of connectivity that that enable particularly with fast grow economy in asia and the gulf be essential to growth however what assurance can the chief secretary to the treasury give the house that this project will not subsequently be stymie by an absolutist approach drive by ideology towards carbon emission which will drive it into the ground we have be down this path before the right hon member have be down this path before because it be his government who go down it and block all these development over the past year this government be work on reform to the planning system look at national policy statement think about skill and infrastructure supply chain and unlock private capital because we be government who want to get britain build again and not block the project that be stall for year under the previous administration call dr jeevun sandher member of the select committee investment be what make we more prosperous it produce more work it get wage rise and it create good job be an east midlands mp and we have some of the low investment rate in the country the least transport infrastructure and some of the low private investment that be why welcome the announcement today of billion go to the manufacturing and logistic hub at east midlands airport especially welcome the extra job that will benefit my constituent in loughborough shepshed and hathern will the chief secretary assure that this be just the beginning of the investment we can expect in the region and for my constituent thank my hon friend who be strong advocate for the economy in the east midlands and for his constituency he will know that visit the region last week and meet business and investor with our mayor claire ward the region be do brilliant job of secure inward investment and there be huge untapped potential in the east midlands be pleased that the chancellor be able to make those announcement today and we very much look forward to hear about more business case and more potential so that we can unlock growth in the east midlands call select committee member dame harriett baldwin be sure the chief secretary know and admire the plan for growth of conservative lead worcestershire county council it have be work through the plan and it have build new train station on the north cotswold line which connect worcestershire to oxford but lot of that line be still single track will he urge the oxford growth commission to look at the extensive work do by oxfordshire county council and worcestershire county council to find way to double the frequency of the train service on that stretch of track thank the hon lady the growth commission will be look at all potential option for stimulate growth we want to find strategic enable investment across the country to unlock for example house building and inward investment and be sure it will look at those proposal with interest call select committee member rachel blake thank the chief secretary for his statement about investment and growth do he agree with about the role that new town will play in tackle our country housing crisis and how important it be that alongside the home in the new town we see the delivery of new social infrastructure can he outline how those plan will work thank my hon friend as inform the house recently our infrastructure

infrastructure for the first time we will be make strategic decision about the place where people live on the house building target meet tenant who will be move into new social home in erewash last week we talk about million home and about economic growth but in every one of those building be someone life their opportunity and the dream they want to fulfil this government be deliver on economic growth and we be do so because the people at the heart of all these decision be the people we need to get the economy move and britain do well in the future call select committee member john glen among the fundamental enabler of growth in the economy be financial service and open up market to invest think there be consensus across this house in the last parliament on the financial services and markets act which provide the framework to do that what concrete proposal have come forward from the financial conduct authority and the prudential regulation authority consideration of change some of the restriction that stop the right level of investment this week the government enable about billion of surplus fund from define benefit pension scheme to be make available what proportion of that money will be invest and in what timeframe the concern around these announcement be the delay to tangible calculable economic impact point the right hon member to the chancellor mansion house speech which set out in detail this government approach to financial service they be an important enabler for the uk and particular strength globally as know he know very well on his particular question will need to write to he with the answer but he can see that this government be take action to unlock investment in the uk economy as have be report the prime minister and the chancellor have be meet regulator to make sure that they be gear for growth as well as for protect consumer also welcome the chief secretary statement and the chancellor announcement about the many excellent transport scheme that this country so badly need the transport committee will look at these proposal start with the new proposal for runway at heathrow he link that proposal to uk wide growth but do the treasury consider the department for transport figure predict that between and there would be cut in flight between regional airport in the uk and heathrow because of the way the market for slot at heathrow operate regardless of what regional airport might want thank my hon friend the chair of the transport committee for her question think it allude to the fact that this be the announcement not just of runway but of project which we must make sure be optimise for deliver growth for the whole of the united kingdom as make clear in my statement that mean that we need to work with regional airport and look at how the slot be allocate at heathrow to make sure that heathrow business model optimise opportunity for regional airport and the whole of the united kingdom that be commitment that the government have make very clear today call select committee member bobby dean the whole house support focus on growth which be good for our prosperity and key to fund our public service however growth have not only rate but direction and how we seek to achieve growth be about choice if we choose to back measure that undermine our net zero target we may be go for growth today with severe consequence for tomorrow how do the government justify their choice to back heathrow expansion over more sustainable rail transport project across the country be sure the hon member share my view that we can achieve growth through our net zero plan these thing be not an either or for example the announcement of this government support investment in heathrow and in the sustainable aviation fuel sector will stimulate investment in net zero technology and industry in the uk this can be win win for the economy and the environment welcome my right hon friend statement which think demonstrate real commitment by this government to take the shackle off our economy particularly welcome his commitment to year transport infrastructure plan as well as the measure already announce to boost connectivity across the pennines and elsewhere will he commit to continue to see what can be do to address connectivity and capacity challenge north of birmingham arise from the cancellation of those be exactly the issue that department be now consider as they submit bid to the treasury in the spending review as we move into those negotiation in march we will have to look at the good growth potential and what we can get deliver on what timeframe we will be able to confirm those plan in the come month there be nothing in the statement about the low thames crossing which have already be delay twice by this government the crossing be one of the big infrastructure project and will have huge impact on the entire country for my constituent the big issue around growth have be about the taxis on business particularly on family company and the job tax why be the government not address those real issue which be not address in the statement the chancellor will be disappoint that the right hon member do not listen to her speech she announce we be in negotiation with the project leader at the low thames crossing we be committed to bring that forward and will have further announcement to make in due course may congratulate the chief secretary on his statement but add word of caution about his plan for heathrow will he ensure that there be full cost benefit analysis of any plan for third runway which look at the cost to the climate to public health and to the already saturate transport infrastructure almost year of deal with heathrow have teach that what be good for heathrow shareholder be usually bad for its neighbour and for the climate leave government at all level pick up the cost and clean up the mess know that my hon friend have be work on this issue for many year as have say we want the heathrow project to be success for the whole country and that mean in relation to sustainable low carbon transport and connectivity as well as for local job and the local economy as say in the statement as proposal be put forward by heathrow the government will consider they in the normal way in line with all our legal obligation in november when give evidence to the treasury committee the head of the office for budget responsibility richard hughes state that further investment in infrastructure such as extend airport capacity would not deliver high economic return as the uk be already highly connected without proposal on the table for heathrow how can the chancellor be so sure that third runway will drive high national economic growth we hear from business investor businesspeople traveller and people who want to be able to come through london or the uk that we be lose trade and investment in comparison with other hub airport on mainland europe we have every opportunity to secure that here in the uk and that will by its very nature secure investment job and economic growth the chancellor highlight the redevelopment of old trafford in her speech but similar investment be happen in luton where power court be set to be the new home of luton town football club that mixed use housing and commercial development will bring new opportunity and support the regeneration of our town may invite the minister to join on visit to see how that will be key driver of economic growth across bedfordshire and the eastern region my hon friend know that be not let out of the treasury often but when be will be delighted to visit these be classic example of how by work together with private investor and local business to co ordinate investment on road junction rail housing development or even football stadium we can get to point where we can unlock economic growth for people and improve their community we be absolutely interested in look at all those opportunity what assessment have the treasury make of whether the increase in employer national insurance contribution will increase or decrease business investment the right hon member be invite to speculate on the obr forecast which will be present to the house on march there be so much to be welcome in the statement but sadly it have be taint by the decision on the third runway at heathrow when such decision be make by the government it be important that there be full openness and transparency so that we can explain the government thinking to our constituent will the minister ensure that the paper that lead to this damascene conversion among some member of the cabinet be publish openly particularly those on how increase carbon emission will be tackle how we will meet our carbon capacity statement how agriculture in this country will be convert to meet the sustainable aviation fuel requirement how the noise contour will impact on so many more million people how current emission will be tackle as air pollution be already above the legal limit and how the to of my constituent will be rehouse when property be demolish as result of this decision as have confirm to the house we be invite application from heathrow which will be consider in the normal way when those application have be receive and due diligence have be undertake we will be able to report the detail that will answer the right hon member question it say on the cover that this be about grow the uk economy but the statement substance be much more about grow the english economy it have pass reference to wrexham and nebulous acknowledgement that the government will build pipeline of investable proposition start with strategic partnership in the glasgow city region will the chief secretary perhaps flesh out what that mean and at the same time explain why he do not allocate any funding to reimburse edinburgh university for the supercomputer invest in saf in grangemouth or invest in the acorn project in the north east scotland be an important part of our united kingdom economy we will continue to invest in the country as we do at the recent budget with the large real term increase in spending since devolution be always ear open to opportunity for growth but the hon member might want to speak to his snp colleague in the scottish government and try to stimulate some investment there as well warmly welcome the plan for growth which stand in stark contrast to the low growth low wage and low investment economy of the last year but as welcome as the old trafford development be the house will know that be dale fan may therefore urge the treasury and chief secretary to warmly support the atom valley mayoral development zone which be be push by andy burnham to help advanced manufacturing in rochdale that sound like an excellent initiative that will benefit from the huge untapped potential in the greater manchester and regional economy which we be try to stimulate with our announcement today would be delighted to meet my hon friend in due course to understand more of the detail the chief secretary say that he want economic growth to spread to every town city and community something we can all agree with have be campaign for many year to restore the direct train service between cleethorpes grimsby and king cross that would boost the local economy and be support by the hull and humber chamber of commerce businesse up and down my constituency and on the government benches by my mp the hon member for great grimsby and cleethorpes melanie onn all that be need to provide the service at the next timetable change be the go ahead from the transport secretary will the chief secretary urge she to do just that be sure that the transport secretary have hear the hon member request as he will know from our announcement today and at the budget the investment that we seek to unlock in his region be crucial part of our industrial plan not least the investment in sustainable aviation fuel that set out if the transport project that he mention will unlock investment housing and opportunity in the region be sure that we will look at it closely have consistently call for new investment in the eastern region and nothing be more exciting than the proposal to build universal studios theme park the first of its kind in europe in bedford the project have huge potential to transform the region will the chief secretary provide an update and reassure that progress be be make on turn that plan into reality hopefully the minister can meet that enthusiasm thank my hon friend who have campaign tirelessly for this investment in the region since he have be the house as he will know the government be in negotiation with partner for the development unfortunately can not update the house at this stage but look forward to do so in due course as the mp for the dream spire may thank the government for their vote of confidence in my constituent ability to deliver the growth that this country and arguably the world need take umbrage with one thing the chief secretary talk about the oxford plan give that the chancellor give her speech not in oxford city or its environ but in eynsham will he name the growth commission not the oxford commission but the oxfordshire commission will he meet and my many liberal democrat colleague so that we can work with he to maximise the potential of the plan thank the hon lady for her suggestion it be not for to get in the middle of boundary dispute but will take that back to the treasury and see what we can do as united fan hugely welcome the economic and social benefit that the old trafford redevelopment could bring to the city of salford how will the chief secretary require those who be award contract to do all they can to employ train and retain local people and to ensure that that ethos be mirror across supply chain my hon friend make an excellent point these project have to benefit local community local worker and local business as well as other there can be no great advocate of that approach than the mayor of greater manchester between his work and good office and the government approach to social value and procurement be sure that will be able to deliver that outcome give that construction of the oxford to milton keynes section of east west rail be complete when hugh merriman the last conservative rail minister pull the last rail clip into place it be bit rich of the chief secretary to try to claim credit for it in one breath he say that he want to work in partnership with local leader and in the next he reheat the idea of top down government know good ox cam arc rebrande it the oxford to cambridge growth commission local leader in buckinghamshire have consistently say no to that top down spatial strategy choose instead to grow job locally include at westcott space cluster do he really want to work with local leader in buckinghamshire or do he just want to tell they what to do the hon member be what we call blocker that be not in the nature of this government we will get on and deliver welcome the minister statement on growth do he agree that alongside upgrade transport infrastructure we should create more home and infrastructure around exist commuter line such as the bolton to manchester line in my constituency my hon friend be absolutely right in work on the plan for change priority of million new home the deputy prime minister have already identify that as great opportunity for the government work with partner in network rail and elsewhere we can unlock the land adjacent to exist infrastructure for new development some of that be reference in the part of the chancellor speech about the oxford cambridge growth corridor but we be actively look at opportunity across the country as well the chief secretary to the treasury do good job of name check place across the country that might benefit from growth except not once do he mention anywhere in the south west he be the member for bristol north west so why be that do he have no confidence in the potential of the south west will he redeem himself by visit trowbridge the county town of wiltshire and specifically the tech trowbridge initiative which be try to create the condition for growth the government might like to be involve in that the right hon member be confused be enormously proud of my region of bristol and the south west not least because of our heritage and the potential that we have to offer the country the aerospace industry in north bristol will benefit enormously from our announcement which be great for worker and business in our region he may be interested in an announcement from the national wealth fund today of investment in the cornish economy to get we mining again so that we get the rare earth material that we need to fuel development in the uk and create the job and investment in the south west that he ask for barrier to growth be in place in this country for so long that think they would be permanent but we have government so committed to growth that they be tear they down daily and welcome that also welcome the pilot announce by the office for investment which will benefit the liverpool city region it bring government and industry together to unlock private investment how will that benefit my constituent in wirral west today we have announce that the office for investment which partner with foreign direct investment into the uk will be give line of sight to opportunity across the country and not just to the large project that the government be interested in on particular day work with mayor in our combined authority will be great way to bring together prospectus of investable proposition for investor across the country let reassure my hon friend that the blocker to delivery be not permanent because we vote they out at the last election be sure that the chief secretary will correct if be wrong but the only three word about scotland in his statement be glasgow city region they be welcome but do he appreciate that while the scottish government may have receive its big settlement every uk government statement that have come out of this place since the general election have undermine support in scotland for this government in my city of edinburgh we be concerned that every statement on investment in ai and research leave we out down the line expansion at heathrow will mean more air traffic over our city and there be no emission management plan in place will the chief secretary reassure my constituent that there be something in this for edinburgh be not sure agree with the premise of the question we do not seek to undermine scotland but to enable it as an important part of the united kingdom that be why we have put significant money into the scottish government why gb energy will be base in scotland and why exciting plan on energy infrastructure have already be announce be sure there will be more to come not least for edinburgh give its expertise in the technology space which we be very aware of encourage the hon lady not to be so gloomy we be here to support scotland as much as england wales and northern ireland after decade and half of dither by the conservatives who claim to be the good yet constrain the vital force of positive economic change it fall to labour government to unleash our country potential which require government action in partnership with other do my right hon friend agree that in order to deliver the growth that our people need we must block the blocker and vanquish vested interest and that it be time to coin phrase to build baby build be pleased to announce to the house today the government commitment to build baby build we will deliver that for this country my hon friend be right to point out the difference that change in government can make this labour government be get on with the job of deal with planning regulation and blocker bring forward investment and deliver for the country whereas the conservative party promise the earth and deliver nothing call dr kieran mullan assume you have lot to say away from labour rhetoric suspect that member on both side of this house be hear the reality from our constituent on friday visit saxonwood care home in my constituency and st michael hospice just across the border which look after my constituent have also hear from bexhill chamber of commerce and they be all clear that labour plan national insurance rise will do enormous damage to their attempt to grow and to employ people do the chief secretary agree with the obr forecast that the job tax will harm growth not help it as have be rehearse repeatedly on the floor of the house the chancellor have to make difficult decision to get grip on the public finance give the state in which the hon member party leave this country today announcement make it very clear that business small and large and this government share the ambition of deliver growth for the economy that be why we be go far fast in pursuit of that make our economy work for people across this country be vital after year of conservative mismanagement but the new economics foundation have find that expand the uk airport would not deliver serious economic growth meanwhile analysis by carbon brief show that offset expansion at heathrow gatwick and luton would require forest twice the size of london our climate goal would be in jeopardy be it realistic to expand heathrow and other airport and still meet our climate obligation be the risk to our future really worth it my hon friend know that have long be an advocate and campaigner for climate justice and our net zero plan but be clear that by work with partner and investor to unlock investment in the uk we will also unlock investment in the net zero transition and get the industry the job and the capability that we need to deliver net zero future that will allow people across the country to do other thing that they want to do such as go on holiday as listen to the chief secretary declare that this be all about put our country on new path towards bright future be remind of wee song that we use to sing when we be child there be happy land but it far far away unfortunately many of these project be long term they will not be deliver even in the lifetime of this parliament and they will not offset the anti growth policy that the government have already announce which be devastating industry the chief secretary say that he want to deliver for people in every part of the country but there be not one mention of project in northern ireland or any indication of what the government will do with the anti growth impact of the protocol and the windsor framework what be there in the statement for the people of northern ireland and for growth prospect in northern ireland we always get bit grumpy as we get old do we madam deputy speaker but agree with the right hon gentleman we should go back to our childhood and sing the song of that bright future that be ahead for all of we it will cheer our spirit and lift the house as we look forward to the future with positivity look we have make announcement today that will benefit the northern ireland economy not least in the aerospace life science and pharmaceutical sector on recent visit to northern ireland hear about the business innovate and invest in these space and they will benefit from the announcement today as he know the government be in negotiation with our counterpart in europe to improve trade barrier which be sure in time will benefit the northern ireland economy as well it have be joy to have apprentice from rolls royce submarines in my constituency in parliament this week especially in the wake of the billion investment the government make in rolls royce last week do the chief secretary agree that it be only by work with manufacturing company like rolls royce that we will deliver the economic growth we badly need my hon friend be exactly right we need business to invest train and employ and to sell their good and service the government partnership work with rolls royce be great example of how we have be able to unlock billion in investment not just for the region but for its export around the world whether it be the drastic reduction in business property relief and agricultural property relief which will decimate many family business or the increase in employer national insurance which will negatively impact all business include the gp surgery in keighley that have tell they be now decide to freeze recruitment or the increase in the minimum wage or in business rate or perhaps the employment rights bill which will cost business billion year will the chief secretary to the treasury say in his statement on grow the economy which of these measure he think will grow the economy most from the nature of his question be not sure the hon gentleman enjoy the statement today look there be lot of example today both in this statement and in the chancellor commitment that have stimulate investment and as consequence will stimulate growth in the economy the key question here be be business see the uk as place to invest be they invest in the country and be they build in britain the answer be yes yes and yes we have today hear full throate commitment from the treasury to the teesside sustainable aviation fuel industry thank the treasury for listen to teesside mps on the revenue certainty mechanism which will unlock million of pound of investment in the industry from company such as alfanar and iogen will the chief secretary deliver message from the dispatch box to saf investor the world over that teesside be open for business thank my hon friend and all my hon friend from the teesside region who have campaign hard for investment in their area visit the plant in question when be chair of the business committee in the former parliament and remember clearly the company say how frustrating it be that the previous government would not allow they to invest and grow the development of sustainable aviation fuel but be instead allow it to be import at cost from other country this government be take different approach which be unlock investment and job in teesside and across the country in the interest of work people welcome the chief secretary commitment to invest in my oxfordshire constituency and particularly in our science centre of milton park culham and harwell campus however the commitment to the south east strategic reservoir option sesro will be meet with far more question give thames water track record on january in new civil engineer water engineer suggest that the reservoir billion cost could be much well spend tackle leak and reduce water demand and waste will the chief secretary meet to discuss these unanswered question about the reservoir the environment secretary work with the regulator ofwat have agree the large investment in the water industry on record with more than billion over the year ahead to tackle issue with sewage and leak in the victorian infrastructure and crucially for the first time in decade to actually build reservoir which this country need that be why it be important that we have announce those two plan today they will of course go through the normal process and be sure he will be pay attention to that as they come forward enthusiastically welcome the government commitment to growth and commend they for take the difficult decision require to generate it it be important that all part of our country benefit from the proceed of growth in my capacity as leeds mp and chair of the all party parliamentary group for yorkshire and northern lincolnshire ask the chief secretary how the national wealth fund and the strategic partnership in west yorkshire will benefit my region through growth agreement and crucially share the proceed of growth these partnership with the national wealth fund be crucial to ensure that local entrepreneur business and investor have access to the service provide by the government too often it be only people who know how the system work or who know the people involve who can get deal do which mean that people especially in the region have historically low level of investment than company in particular in london that be why we want to ensure the door be open to entrepreneur and investor in area of high growth potential include in leeds so they can get their business grow and deliver for the uk economy it have be interesting listen to the statement on grow the uk economy when everything the labour government have do so far be have the exact reverse effect in epping forest business and vital service be talk about job loss and freeze in recruitment due to the job tax while across the country family farm and business be worried about their future with the government heartless inheritance tax policy child be have to move school and some independent school be have to close due to the punitive school fee policy when will this government admit they have get thing wrong and for the sake of opportunity and growth reverse their ill judge policy just to reassure the hon gentleman will point to three thing he may wish to look at in its long term forecast the obr forecast growth increase in this country unlike what he have say the international monetary fund have just upgrade the growth projection for the uk and pwc just release report show that for the first time ever the uk be the second most investable country in the world hope the hon gentleman welcome those thing almost decade ago have the interesting experience of work for the labour party on aviation policy and on heathrow the fundamental have not change the exhaustion of that sovereign hub capacity be offshore our emission and be stopper on growth in every part of the country do the chief secretary agree that this decision be long overdue in respect of comment from those on the opposition front bench will the chief secretary also confirm that in the two month since the budget redundancy as notify by

opposition members be listen closely he be right behind the support for the plan for heathrow come forward be not only that we think that we be lose investment and job to other country but that we be offshore the emission of good be bring in from around the world via other place before they come the uk by other mean that be why we think this plan be good for the country but can also be in line with our net zero commitment as say those detail will be set out far in due course it be hearten to hear the chief secretary talk about the importance of inclusive growth in every nation and region of the united kingdom and that regional growth will be hardwire into the comprehensive spending review and the government infrastructure plan however he will be aware that such promise have previously be make to area such as ceredigion preseli but remain unfulfilled will the chief secretary therefore explain what investment the people of mid and west wales can expect to see under his government plan thank the hon gentleman for his question and his campaigning on behalf of his constituent as be sure he will have see the government recently announce hundred of million of pound of inward investment for skill in the green economy in his side of wales in pembrokeshire where there be enormous potential both for onshore and offshore wind development and train people to be able to build those bit of

while we should commend the progress make on pavement parking in london increasingly we be see abandon rental scooter and bike obstruct pavement that remain problem in my constituency this bill would increase the power of local authority to introduce penalty for operator and rider of bike and scooter leave on pavement it would replicate the exist offence of park heavy good vehicle on pavement or kerb and extend it to all motor vehicle civil enforcement officer could actually enforce that although it have long be specific offence to drive on pavement outside london and scotland it be not specific offence to park on pavement in most circumstance that be reflect in highway code rule which state you must not park partially or wholly on the pavement in london and should not do so elsewhere unless sign permit it civil traffic enforcement be possible in some limited case such as for parking over drop kerb or adjacent to double yellow line but in most case local traffic warden do not actually have power to act council can use traffic regulation order or install physical barrier to prevent pavement parking but tro be not design to be use to cover wide area and require considerable signage and street marking make their widespread use expensive in some case car block pavement can be consider an obstruction under the highways act however as this be criminal offence it can be enforce only by police give the lack of clear definition of what constitute an obstruction and the lack of police resource rely on police enforcement have not prove effective there be clear need for law that bring the rest of england in line with london and scotland council need to be empower to take action as they know their area well this bill would give they the flexibility to create limited exemption in response to consultation with their local community change in the law have widespread support include from over of the public and of councillor in england sustran guide dogs living streets transport for all the royal national institute of blind people and the thomas pocklington trust all support new law this morning be delighted to join group of campaigner in support an open letter sign by almost people that urge party leader to support change in the law this be not new debate indeed the measure introduce in london in be originally intend to apply to the rest of the country in the then conservative government consult on tackle pavement parking that consultation consider range of option but today mark day since it close indeed on february last year call on the then government to get on and publish their response welcome the roads minister commitment that this government be look at all option and will come forward with response to the consultation in due course and look forward to work with she on that understand that she be due to meet some of the charity and group campaign on this issue and know that they hope to speak to she before any final decision be make also welcome the reference to pavement parking in the white paper on the english devolution bill and the consideration of licensing for micro mobility device however there need to be an explicit commitment and clear timetable to address these problem the government be rightly commit to deliver record investment in infrastructure and transport project but it be important that we get the fundamental right and make sure that our street be safe for everyone pavement parking prevent many people from live their life work socialise take their child to school or get to vital appointment and that have to change we have clear evidence that law like this can and do work and urge the house to support this bill question put and agree to order that marsha de cordova kate osamor steve darling jim shannon daniel francis shockat adam martin vickers dr scott arthur jen craft florence eshalomi rosie duffield and dr rosena allin khan present the bill marsha de cordova accordingly present the bill bill read the first time to be read second time on friday may and to be print bill arbitration bill lords second reading beg to move that the bill be now read second time be pleased to be open this second reading debate on the government arbitration bill this legislation be direct response to recommendation make by the law commission of england and wales in its report on arbitral reform publish in september if enact the bill will make targeted reform to the arbitration act which govern arbitration in england wales and northern ireland scotland have its own devolve arbitral framework under the arbitration scotland act which this bill will not affect arbitration be major area of business activity for example the chartered institute of arbitrators headquarter in london have more than member across country as the house will know arbitration be greatly value by individual and business alike as an alternative to go to court give party the ability to appoint private tribunal to resolve dispute by issue binding and enforceable award for example when party enter into commercial contract it be common to find clause that provide that any dispute will be resolve through arbitration in this great capital city of london rather than through litigation in court that be often true even where contract have no other connection to the uk such be the prestige of arbitration here furthermore thank to an international convention commonly call the new york convention which date from arbitration award make in the uk can be enforce anywhere in the world study suggest that such enforcement be often fast and more reliable than seek to enforce court judgment the new york convention may date from but arbitration have be feature of our justice system for century arbitration be common way of settle dispute back in anglo saxon time it be largely public affair with enforcement through community pressure by norman time party could choose their arbitrator someone know to both side and well place to facilitate reconciliation in the the opposition spokesman the hon member for bexhill and battle dr mullan be enjoy my little canter through the historical background which be sure the mass attendance this afternoon be also enjoy in the century the mayor and aldermen of london set up in effect an arbitration centre here in this great city this also provide service to foreign trader whose dispute have no other connection to england arbitration then grow in elizabethan time and by the century arbitration clause be very common as be professional arbitrator it be say that our first arbitration act the arbitration act be single handedly draft by the famous political philosopher john locke after he have be task by the then board of trade to devise scheme that would help merchant to reach satisfactory settlement of their dispute john locke arbitral framework fit on one or two side of paper which be real achievement be it not if only we could emulate that today but thing have get more complicated and therefore more precise arbitration have come long way since then though we salute john locke and his effort in set we on this journey today arbitration happen in very wide range of setting from rent review through commodity trade and shipping to international commercial contract and investor claim against state in each instance it enable party to resolve the dispute at hand and move on from it the party can choose neutral venue to resolve their dispute they can choose trust arbitrator or arbitral institution to preside over the proceeding add with emphasis that some of the world lead trade and arbitral institution be headquarter here in london may have mention that before but we need to be proud of it they range from the aforementioned chartered institute of arbitrators and the london court of international arbitration to important specialist organisation concern with matter such as shipping and trade in grain oil and sugar party can tailor the arbitration process to their own need which result in an award that be internationally enforceable at the same time the process be respect for its integrity at least that be the position here in the uk thank in large measure to the regulation of arbitration through the arbitration act the act ensure that arbitration be conduct in way that be impartial fair and without unnecessary cost and delay the english court which command much respect worldwide retain supervisory jurisdiction build on its extensive history of arbitration and thank to its legislative framework london have become the world lead destination for international arbitration it be highly respect as neutral venue for resolve dispute across the world something in which we all rightly take immense pride in fact the law commission estimate that at least arbitration take place in england and wales each year directly contribute at least billion year to our economy in fee alone so arbitration and the bill be part of our growth agenda for our great country however as arbitration be largely private affair we may speculate that its direct value be likely to be even great than that billion arbitration be also an important offering in our country international business package one that include legal service banking insurance and trade it be great advantage of our jurisdiction that business can be do here in the knowledge that when legal dispute arise they can be resolve swiftly and fairly we enjoy worldwide reputation for the quality independence and ethic of our legal profession it be therefore no surprise that arbitration here in london be showcase for that or that it be very much in demand give that the arbitration act be approach year of age the previous government rightly ask the law commission to undertake thorough review of the legislation back in it be task with determine whether the act require amendment to reflect modern practice and maintain its effectiveness in grow global market when compete jurisdiction have already update their own arbitral framework the law commission be painstaking in its review carry out the commission give to it by the previous government and pay tribute to the member of the law commission for their painstaking work on this matter from which we all benefit an initial consultation paper be publish in september it lay out the law commission analysis of the law as it stand and propose small number of area for reform that consultation receive response from abroad and from an expert base of consultee include individual practitioner academic specialist body and international firm and institution as well as from our judiciary take this feedback on board the law commission refine its proposal and publish second consultation paper in march after yet another round of engagement final proposal and draft bill be publish in september as say this process have be painstaking and thorough and we need to credit everybody involve include the conservatives for their leadership of the process during that time it be testament to the longevity and flexibility of our arbitral framework that only target update be recommend with the law commission conclude that while some modernisation of the act be need and desirable root and branch reform be not and it be testament to the law commission thorough consultation that the bill command such support in the arbitral and legal sector can not resist add that the work have be watch carefully by our competitor jurisdiction abroad the law commission report be cite by the singapore court of its own initiative and in the last few month see the positive development here france have announce need to review its own arbitration law we lead the way and this bill will ensure that we stay ahead as hon and right hon member will be aware the previous government introduce an arbitration bill in that also seek to implement the law commission recommendation that bill have make its way through committee in the other place when parliament be dissolve for the general election the legal sector be emphatic in express the view that the propose reform be vital for update the arbitral framework and make sure that our jurisdiction remain competitive we be first in global class on arbitration and this bill will ensure that we stay first in global class the government agree wholeheartedly with the legal sector view not least because of our commitment to foster economic growth in our country as such this bill be introduce in the other place at the very early opportunity in july as one of the first act of this government after the general election be pleased to see the bill finally arrive in this house as be sure you be madam deputy speaker it be worth say that the act boast some key strength it provide flexible procedure that allow party to shape proceeding to well suit they party can for example arbitrate their dispute with one of our jurisdiction many world lead arbitral institution which have develop procedure that party trust will deliver fair and timely outcome our current framework also permit effective recourse to our court where need party can request that our court determine preliminary matter in the arbitration such as jurisdiction or later challenge an award produce by arbitration arbitrator can similarly apply to the court to assist their proceeding such as by enforce their order at the same time the regime of court support be carefully balance to prevent party from drag their foot and re litigate case this give party huge confidence that arbitration take place in our jurisdiction be both efficient and fair many of this bill reform be design to build on the strength of the act will now go through the key clause because can tell that member be deeply interested in check through the detail so that should we move to vote we know exactly what we be vote on quite right be pleased to see the opposition spokesman give willing eye of encouragement for which be duly grateful start at the beginning clause will make it much simple to determine what law apply to an arbitration agreement currently the rule for identify the governing law be find in the common law and recent supreme court decision that decision show both immense learning and the complexity of the current approach the supreme court be split in its judgment and its approach be different from that of the court of appeal which use an approach different from that at first instance instead to make the law clear and more predictable clause provide that the govern law will align with the legal location that is the seat of the arbitration by default this will ensure that arbitration where seat in england and wales and northern ireland will be fully support by our law which be among the most supportive of arbitration globally clause codify duty for arbitrator to disclose circumstance that may cause doubt as to their impartiality this will codify the common law and align domestic law with international good practice such as the united nations commission on international trade law model law which our expert lawyer have major hand in draft the model law influence can be find in other jurisdiction as far apart as scotland and switzerland it will promote trust in arbitration by promote trust in the integrity and impartiality of arbitrator clause and in the interest of briskness clause will support arbitrator in make impartial and proper decision by extend their immunity against liability when they resign for good reason or be remove for no fault of their own this will support arbitrator to make robust and impartial decision without fear clause clarify the two pathway for party that want to challenge the jurisdiction of the arbitrator that want to question whether the dispute should be arbitrate at all the party can either apply to the court for an early ruling or it can wait until the award be issue and then go to court clause clarifie that it can not do both it be either or clause ensure that where arbitrator agree that they should not be hear dispute after all they can still award the cost incur up to that point against the party that generate those cost clause will allow arbitrator to adopt expedite procedure to dispense with issue that have no real prospect of success this align with summary judgment available in court proceeding and will make arbitration more efficient we move seamlessly to clause which will help emergency arbitrator emergency arbitrator be appoint on temporary basis while full tribunal be be establish that process can sometimes take week they be therefore very important to arbitration they be often task with vital preliminary matter such as preserve evidence or asset and be important to ensure that arbitration can proceed smoothly as the practice of emergency arbitrator post date the act our framework do not make explicit provision for they so look again give we an opportunity to examine their role clause empower emergency arbitrator to handle urgent matter well and ensure compliance with their direction by equip they with final order and court enforcement that will give emergency arbitrator the same pathway to enforce their order as other arbitrator and will enhance their effectiveness clause provide that court order make in support of arbitral proceeding can be make against third party which align with the position in court proceeding for example it would enable party to arbitration to get an order freeze asset hold by third party such as bank clause ensure that when party challenge an arbitral award at court the court have the full range of remedy available regardless of the pathway this clause iron out discrepancy that court and practitioner have otherwise seek to work around clause provide more efficient court challenge to the tribunal jurisdiction through rule of court that would prohibit repeat evidence and argument already debate in front of the tribunal that will avoid such challenge become full re hearing reduce cost and delay can deal with clause pretty quickly you will be pleased to know madam deputy speaker clause ensure that the time limit for challenge award be consistent across the act clause correct rare example of drafting error what the act mean to say be that court order could be appeal but in some case there would be restriction what it actually say be that court order could be appeal only where there be restriction to its credit the judicial committee of the house of lords spot this error and interpret the statute as it be mean to be read we have take this opportunity to correct the drafting to reflect the judicial ruling as useful bit of tidy up clause streamline the requirement for apply to court to obtain preliminary ruling from the court on question of law or on whether the arbitrator have jurisdiction to hear the dispute early ruling such as those from expert judge can save time and cost be get towards the end of go through the clause in fact have come to the last and final clause that wish to comment upon clause as you have probably work out madam deputy speaker because that usually come after clause laughter there be no clause so clause be the final report february vol correction clause repeal provision that be never bring into force simply to tidy up the act those provision would have mean slight difference in approach between domestic arbitration and international arbitration in the event they be never use or need never bring into force and there remain no demand for they our arbitration law be first class and apply equally to domestic and international arbitration so remove the provision be helpful way to tidy thing up in sum the bill will greatly approve the arbitral process in our jurisdiction and far cement our position as top global business destination where legal dispute can be resolve fairly and quickly the bill have already go through the other place where it receive considerable examination and support from noble and learn member include many experienced arbitrator there be apparently lot of experienced arbitrator in

current legislation we should continue to monitor and revisit that issue the arbitration bill introduce range of reform design to improve clarity efficiency and fairness in arbitration proceeding those reform address practical change while reinforce the uk position as global leader will highlight few key provision as the minister have explain in detail which make the bill significant first the

comprehensive history of arbitration in the united kingdom it have be long time since have consider john locke have study he as part of history of political thought paper which feel almost as long ago as the starting point of the minister survey the liberal democrats welcome the reintroduction of the bill and its wide support across the house as the minister say the arbitration act which govern arbitration in england wales and northern ireland be more than year old as he also say the law commission estimate that there be at least arbitration annually in england and wales worth at least billion to the economy in arbitrator and legal fee alone arbitration be also important in support whole range of business activity as have be outline an effective legal and dispute resolution process

commission review of arbitration law to support more efficient dispute resolution the legal sector have widely support the target reform in the bill with positive feedback from public consultation hold by the law commission two key issue be raise in committee in the other place which we be happy to see resolve the first be on the subject of corruption risk the liberal democrats press the government to provide more information to ensure that confidential arbitration be not abuse to hide corruption from public scrutiny we thank the minister for detail the action be take by arbitral institution to militate against the risk of arbitration be misuse and we be satisfied with the reassurance give the second concern the right of appeal the liberal democrats be glad to support the two amendment table by the government to correct the drafting of clause follow concern that the original clause provide more limited access to the court of appeal than be establish in case law in conclusion the liberal democrats be pleased to support the bill give some of the other discussion in this house today we welcome an uncontroversial contribution to the economic growth that this country need we now come to the wind up believe the shadow minister have few comment he wish to make with the leave of the house will speak briefly focus my remark early on the bill as hon member might expect but want to take this opportunity as important matter such as arbitration be before the house and as have the minister attention to reiterate our thank to everybody involve both in this bill and in the previous one in both houses particularly we thank lord hacking for his work in highlight other issue encourage the minister to recognise that although the bill be welcome and will be positive the government will need to continue work on some issue as mention early the interplay between arbitration and corruption the need for expedite hearing the role of third party funding and the authority to mandate mediation between party the minister may not have an immediate response but would welcome future work from the government in those area call the minister thank all member for their contribution thank the conservative spokesperson for recognise as we do the work of lord bellamy lord hacking and other peer in the other place as well as everybody who have contribute to where we be today also very much welcome what the liberal democrats spokesman say on the tackling of issue through the process that is give great confidence about tackle corruption risk and the issue around the right of appeal be grateful for the constructive way in which this debate have be pursue the bill mirror that of the last government save for two change which will note here for completeness the first as mention in my opening speech be the amendment to clause to well reflect the case law on appeal the drafting error it fix be in section of the senior courts act and in section of its northern ireland equivalent the judicature northern ireland act that suggest that appeal to the court of appeal under part of the arbitration act would only be permit if expressly permit in the act however case law establish that the intend regime for appeal under the act be to permit appeal to the court of appeal unless there be provision in the act that add an explicit restriction on those appeal hope that deal with that issue clause therefore correct the drafting error identify in the house of lords judgment in inco europe first choice distribution and make it clear that appeal from high court decision under part of the arbitration act may subject to provision in that part be make to the court of appeal slight amendment to the long title be also require to reflect that change the second change be to clause which we make prior to the bill introduction to parliament that be to address concern about the effect on arbitration between investor and state in particular those that follow from an open invitation to arbitrate make in trade agreement or in domestic legislation the current position be that those arbitration be govern by international law and foreign domestic law sector feedback make clear that that be what should continue our change therefore provide that new section of the arbitration act do not apply to arbitration agreement derive from stand offer to arbitrate contain in treaty or non uk legislation interruption do the hon member for north bedfordshire richard fuller wish to interject indicate dissent just pause for little reflection while gather my thought on the other issue to do with arbitral corruption be sure the hon member for north bedfordshire for whom have the high regard would not want to skimp on deal with arbitral corruption which have be raise by both the speaker in the debate so far indicate assent be encourage by his nodding we take corruption very seriously however we have conclude that arbitral corruption be not cause by any issue with our domestic arbitral framework the arbitration act and common law already provide remedy to deal with corrupt conduct the court be empower to set aside arbitral award where there be serious irregularity as they have do recently in the well know case of nigeria furthermore arbitrator be under statutory duty to be impartial and to reach fair resolution of the dispute they can issue an award that prevent the corrupt party from benefit although arbitration procedure be often private corruption can be expose common law allow an exception to confidentiality when disclosure be in the public interest however there be need for arbitral practitioner and institution across the world to ensure that their practice be continually develop to weed out attempt to exploit they we shall support and keep track of initiative that be under way such as that of the international chamber of commerce anti corruption taskforce we will engage with the sector to adopt the very good practice as they be develop hope that that assure the shadow minister and the hon member for didcot and wantage olly glover give my sincere thank to right hon and hon member who have contribute to the debate it have be measured and helpful debate which underscore the broad support for this legislative programme be happy to have hear so much support for this bill particularly those contribution that emphasise its importance to economic growth our legal service be vital element of our economy both for create favourable domestic business condition and for attract investment in the uk and this government will continue to support they re emphasise that these reform be very much appreciated many business will be decide whether to designate london as their seat of arbitration versus competitor such as singapore hong kong sweden or dubai which have update their arbitral framework in recent time this decision be not just to settle dispute via arbitration now arbitration agreement be often pre emptive so these business will be make decision as to where and how dispute may be settle many year in the future for the past quarter of century our arbitration act and our law have be key draw make our shore the natural choice for arbitration in we create truly world lead legislative framework which contribute to london become the preferred forum for arbitration proceeding across the globe we must maintain our lead position and continue to attract business to ensure economic growth it be therefore important that these measure seek only to improve the arbitral process and promote trust in arbitration it would have be no good have these reform create red tape we would not want to see that arbitration must remain quick and more flexible mean by which to resolve legal dispute versus go to court but also it be key to promote trust in arbitration to ensure that proceeding on our shore remain robust and respect internationally the law commission need to be commend for do such brilliant job superb job review our framework line by line and see where improvement can be make this bill contain as have say the expertise and wisdom of myriad practitioner expert firm judge and other will if may indulge in share some of the supportive quote from the sector about the law commission work no have only few laughter the house would be the poor for not hear these member hear hear feel that it be important to share they more be available but will restrict myself to just few the bar council say we welcome the law commission characteristically careful and balanced review of the arbitration act and we support the proposal for reform which it make it be extremely important that the government find parliamentary time we be do that for the short bill which the law commission propose london have well deserve reputation as the foremost centre the foremost centre for international arbitration it be important to legislate to make the modest change to the arbitration regime which the law commission have recommend in order to maintain and enhance that reputation the chartered institute of arbitrators say that it welcome the propose change the majority of which be in line with our recommendation which be inform by input from our membership it be sign of the arbitration act strength and value that only specific change to ensure that act remain current have be recommend as oppose to an overhaul as well as underpin the attractiveness and competitiveness of london as an arbitration seat the act form the basis of legislation in many other jurisdiction lend global significance to this development the chartered institute of arbitrators work closely with the uk law commission to inform the review we support regular review of such legislation to ensure arbitration remain effective fit for purpose and viable mean of justice in modern world white case llp say that we expect that the amendment propose by the law commission will promote the efficiency and finality of arbitration proceeding whilst not unnecessarily introduce drastic reform to exist legislation the report therefore be to be welcome as positive incremental step in maintain london position as major centre for international arbitration and dispute resolution more generally the last quote be one of many positive comment that have be receive on what we be do today and on the law commission work herbert smith freehills llp say there can be no suggestion that any change be be make for change sake the law commission have respect the importance of this legislation and seek only to make change that be necessary if enact into law they will continue to ensure that the arbitration legislation of england and wales maintain its market lead status that be what we all want madam deputy speaker we want this arbitration bill which begin under the previous government and be complete under this government to maintain our market lead status we be determined to do that by work together across this house those be assure the house only small sample of those who engage with and support the law commission review however will also highlight that these comment be make almost year and half ago now on the publication of the law commission final report although it be indeed the case that law reform can take some time this government be commit to ensure that these reform find their way on to our statute book as quickly as possible we must ensure that the bill face no further delay these measure must now proceed at pace through the house dispute resolution matter dispute that go unresolved be bad for the party and have knock on consequence for everyone else at well dispute distract from firm get on with their business and individual get on with their life at worst the slow and stressful impact of legal dispute can have much great impact elsewhere business may have money tie up in litigation that could and should go towards investment individual may find that protract court battle with its cost and delay may lead to sickness which of course will have its own knock on effect on economic productivity resolve dispute allow everyone to move forward all the more so if dispute can be resolve by process that be trust and respected and that can be tailor flexibly to the need of those involve it be no wonder that arbitration have prove such popular method for resolve dispute in the uk and why uk arbitration have prove such popular method for resolve dispute worldwide will also take moment to compliment the other excellent form of dispute resolution on our shore in the construction sector many dispute will by default go to an expedite adjudication with expert allow for quick determination that enable the project to proceed without further delay we also boast an excellent network of ombudsman which deal with all manner of dispute include consumer matter we also have grow mediation sector which in both commercial and family matter be expert at facilitate negotiation between party to come to truly consensual resolution to dispute the bill will enact long await reform to our arbitration law framework which will enable more efficient dispute resolution

precondition to healthy grow economy because it give uk business and household the essential confidence that they need to spend and invest encourage innovation and boost our economy in outline our new robust and transparent fiscal framework the charter for budget responsibility that we be vote on today provide vital and stable foundation from which our economy can grow what the instability of the last year have give we be clear low productivity rise debt level and decline public service performance public sector net debt be of gdp and net financial debt remain close to its high record level as share of gdp which be reach in the pandemic per capita gdp remain below pre pandemic level in contrast have the uk economy grow at the average rate of oecd economy over the past year it would be over billion large than it be today public investment in the uk have historically be low and inconsistent our public capital stock as share of gdp be the joint low in the and more than percentage point below the median underneath all those challenge be billion black hole of in year spending pressure that be not disclose by the previous government to parliament the public or the office for budget my colleague the shadow chief secretary to the treasury the hon member for north bedfordshire richard fuller seem to have comment on the billion black hole will happily take an intervention from he interruption be tell that can not take an intervention madam deputy speaker that be very sad but in that context look forward to the shadow chief secretary outline in his speech how that billion black hole come into being for the record the minister can take an intervention if he wish to this remind of the many year all three of we spend on the business and trade committee when we could not agree on anything either be always enamoured of your argument madam deputy speaker as continue to be today look forward to the prospect of many intervention from member across the house as part of this important debate and encourage the shadow chief secretary to intervene be grateful for the opportunity to intervene can the chief secretary to the treasury confirm whether the obr validate his billion claim the obr be very clear as member will see in its publication in the house of commons library that the spending plan announce by the previous government be to quote the chair of the obr in his evidence to the treasury committee fiction the obr forecast provide to the government make it clear that have the in year spending pressure be report transparently the last forecast under the previous administration would have be materially different that show that the lack of transparency on in year spending be secret hold by only few ministers in the last government and neither the public parliament we in opposition nor the obr know about that problem that be why this government have already legislate to bring forward additional strengthened power for independent check and balance and transparency and we have commit to share in year spending pressure with the office for budget responsibility so that we never end up in situation like the one we inherit the chancellor autumn budget put the public finance back on track and we will keep they there our commitment to sound public finance be non negotiable our new charter for budget responsibility underpin by the new fiscal rule ensure more transparent fiscal framework and provide stable foundation for growth today will outline the change that we have make to the charter for budget responsibility as publish in draft at the autumn budget and lay before this house last week fiscal rule be key part of the uk fiscal framework at the autumn budget in the chancellor confirm the government fiscal rule as set out in our manifesto which will play vital role in unlock investment these rule will put the public finance on sustainable path and prioritise investment to support long term growth they consist of two rule the stability rule and the investment rule the stability rule aim to move the current budget into balance so that day to day spending be meet by revenue mean that the government will borrow only for investment we will meet this rule in until that become the third year of the forecast from that point on we will balance the current budget in the third year of every budget hold annually each autumn this will provide tough constraint on day to day spending so that difficult decision can not be constantly delay or defer as they be under the last government be sure the house would recommend that the government should live within their mean that mean that public service have to be able to live within their budget and it mean that tax revenue have to pay for day to day spending never again will we end up in the position the country end up in under the last government when every week and every month the country borrow more and more in order to pay the day to day bill that be why when hon member on the opposition benches complain about the debt burden this country be have to deal with they should look in the mirror because they build up that debt burden the people responsible for fill up the country credit card just to pay the bill every month even in advance of the pandemic be conservative ministers that will never happen under labour government because of our clear fiscal rule it be why for the first time in year we be do zero base review of all public spending not once do under the last administration but do in the first spending review of this labour government secondly our investment rule require the government to reduce net financial debt define as public sector net financial liability as share of the economy public sector net financial liability be an accredited official statistic produce by the office for national statistics since base on international statistical guidance it have be forecast by the obr since that time the institute for fiscal studies have note that the metric offer more complete picture of the government financial position while remove some of the perverse incentive associate with narrow focus on psnd public sector net debt this rule keep debt on sustainable path while allow the step change need in investment by target measure of debt that capture not just the debt that government owe but financial asset that be expect to generate future return by target net financial debt for the investment rule the government be prioritise investment to drive long term growth while get debt fall as share of the economy the move to net financial debt will be support by comprehensive set of guardrail to give confidence that there be rule around the investment the country can make like our stability rule our investment rule will apply in until that year become the third year of the forecast and from that point onwards net financial debt will fall in the third year of every forecast the move to net financial debt mean that at the autumn budget the government be in position to confirm public investment that will be billion high over the forecast period compare to the previous government plan be pleased to say that in its autumn forecast the obr confirm that the government be on track to meet both fiscal rule two year early in display the government commitment to sound finance the chancellor have ask the obr to produce forecast on march which will assess we against these rule once again our commitment to these fiscal rule be iron clothe the uk have change its fiscal rule in the past more than any other country but this government know that stability matter that be why the new charter set out clear circumstance under which the fiscal rule can temporarily be suspend through new strengthen escape clause the new escape clause require decision on suspension be support by the obr analysis so that the rule can be suspend only with sufficient justification as well as new fiscal rule the update charter for budget responsibility include set of wide reform that ensure more stable and transparent fiscal framework because fiscal responsibility be so central to this government mission the first piece of legislation pass in this parliament be the budget responsibility act it deliver our manifesto commitment to introduce fiscal lock do not think member on either side of the house need reminding of what happen when huge unfunded fiscal commitment be make without proper scrutiny and key economic institution such as the obr be sideline we will not let that happen again the fiscal lock therefore guarantee in law that from now on every fiscally significant change to tax and spending will be subject to scrutiny by the independent obr the charter set out the detail of how the fiscal lock will operate as well as the new guide fiscal principle to move towards only borrow for investment and to keep debt on sustainable path the obr will monitor progress against dashboard of key debt sustainability metric to ensure the government be take broad view of fiscal sustainability broad view will allow the government to form full assessment of the sustainability of the public finance and support we in seek to improve sustainability over time we be also enhance fiscal and economic stability by confirm in the charter today that the government intention to move to one major fiscal event per year will be honour give family and business certainty on tax and spending plan as will the requirement on the treasury to conduct regular spending review every two year and set spending for at least three year ensure public service have certainty on their funding and that spending decision can not again be repeatedly delay in addition it guarantee three year rolling budget for the obr to support its independence we be far strengthen fiscal transparency and accountability by accept all the recommendation of the obr review of the march forecast for departmental expenditure limit include to improve the spending information the treasury share with the obr the obr be widely recognise as provide independent credible and high quality analysis it be guarantor of economic stability go forward the treasury will provide the obr with information on the in year position allow it to forecast underspending and overspend against departmental expenditure limit where appropriate this will ensure the unfunded pressure identify at the public spending audit never happen again we be government who will consider the impact of our current spending decision on future generation and to show how the long term health of the public balance sheet be bolster by sound investment the charter require the obr to report on the long term impact of capital investment and other policy at fiscal event finally turn to the welfare cap which we be also debate today the government be retain the welfare cap within our fiscal framework to support our ambition to keep welfare spending sustainable in the medium term the obr will assess whether the new cap have be meet at the first fiscal event of the next parliament the late obr forecast judge the previous welfare cap to be breach by billion follow trend of forecast breach by the previous government this be clearly an unsustainable path for welfare spending this breach underline the inheritance leave by the previous government failure to control welfare spending and to bring forward radical reform and crucially failure by the last government to support people to get the treatment or skill they need to return to work in his assessment what estimate have the minister make of the increase in poverty and child poverty in our society and the effect of largely uncontrolle rent in the private rented sector often well above the local housing allowance which lead people into poverty the right hon member know that the labour party take child poverty seriously that be why we launch the child poverty taskforce at the start of this government co chair by the work and pensions secretary and the education secretary to do root and branch review of the long term structural cause of child poverty and the intervention the government could take to reverse those grow trend that none of we across the house want to see the taskforce will report in the come month but he be right to point out that housing cost and insecure housing have become ever more important driver of child poverty in recent year that be why through the renters rights bill introduce to the house by the deputy prime minister we be take action in the private rent sector to provide additional protection and support for family in rental accommodation for example ban no fault eviction and give more security of tenure for people who be rent like the right hon member will have have lot of casework where hard work family who be just try to make end meet and to provide security of income and roof over their head for they and their family be fail by market in which house price to buy and rent be out of reach and the rate at which we build affordable and social housing be not meet the demand of the people who need it that be why we increase funding at the budget by half billion pound to build more affordable and social housing which we know can be deliver quickly on visit last week to erewash visit social housing development support by homes england and learn from the company build those home for emh home the east midland housing association that it take only to week from lay the foundation through to give the key to the person move in that remind we why our reform agenda be so important because the time involve in building planning consent infrastructure and financing deal have be significantly hold back the rate of development of social and affordable housing across the country those be exactly the sort of issue where government have the ability to make difference which be why we be committed to accelerate our plan to build million home year but crucially to tilt that towards more affordable and social housing to support people across the country the government be reset the welfare cap give that the previous one be repeatedly breach and we be do so base on the late office for budget responsibility forecast that will set new target for alongside our action to control welfare spending and to help people who deserve the assistance the government have demonstrate that they will not shy away from do what be need to put welfare spending on more sustainable path for example with different decision such as target winter fuel payment to those who need they the most and reclaim billion of public money lose to fraud and error in the welfare system in and billion over five year we have also announce step to tackle inactivity through the get britain work white paper and will set out further proposal in the health and disability green paper later in spring progress against the cap will be monitor by the treasury and the department for work and pensions that will include strengthened accountability framework and the dwp publish an annual report on welfare spending by strengthen the accountability of the welfare cap get more people into work and reform the welfare system for long term sustainability we be take the necessary step to keep spend under control but crucially we be also serve the people of this country by ensure that people who for too long have be at home unable to be see in the nhs or to get access to mental health service who have be unable to get the training or support they need to take advantage of the job available in our country and who have be unable to find job near where they be see hope in their future and know they have government on their side who will support they to get back into work that outcome be well for they their family finance and their future but it also support we in ensure fiscal stability the reform to the fiscal framework outline in the new charter for budget responsibility will ensure more stable approach to tax and spend as well as well transparency and accountability for our government and future government that stability be inseparable from our plan for growth alongside that growth restore stability mean the government can pay for increase funding to repair reform and modernise our public service and to invest in the infrastructure need to rebuild britain for those reason commend the motion to the house to clear up any confusion this be the debate and motion on the charter for budget responsibility the next motion and debate will be on the welfare cap call the shadow minister as the chancellor scour the nation turn over every stone in her desperate effort to mitigate the damage from her choice in last year budget of broken promise it fall to the chief secretary to the treasury to keep his face straight as he lecture the house on the importance of fiscal responsibility he have show the performative skill of one of the great of the west end but his mouthing of the word of economic stewardship even as his audience of wealth creator get up out of their seat and leave the show leave few of we impress they know what the british public know that this be treasury team and government who day after day create more problem and day after day demonstrate that they be clearly out of their depth as the shadow minister and hope the house know be humble man and be always ear open to advice wisdom and feedback on how we can do thing well give his opening remark on fiscal stability wonder whether he have any reflection to offer the house from the time of his party be in government and indeed from his time in the treasury under former prime minister liz truss about what go wrong and what we might do differently the chief secretary to the treasury like so many on the labour benches love to talk almost fondly about the former prime minister liz truss well at least she know her time be up after day we be stick with the chancellor for five year when it be note few month back that the entire labour cabinet could barely scrape together year worth of business experience between they it be think to be just curiosity little do we know it be an early warning sign of their lack of suitability for the task of manage the british economy business confidence down job loss up consumer confidence in the gutter and government debt spiral far upwards and they be just get start there be of course potential benefit from the investment that be be announce today we share desire for more competitive less regulated economy base on passion for free enterprise but while labour celebrate the exodus of millionaire from our country we recognise that it represent loss of skill low job creation and the evaporation of potential future taxation to support public service while labour see the attack on family farm and family business as vital part of its warped class war ideology we recognise that put family at the heart of enterprise be critical piece of our nation proud heritage of freedom the shadow minister talk fondly about the importance of family farm where be his comment on that topic when his party be negotiate trade deal with australia and new zealand that have sorely impact farm around the country my friend the liberal democrat spokesman on economic make fair point about the impact of trade agreement on family finance however as she know that be very different from the pain that farmer be feel right now about labour attack on the ability of family to pass on their farm to their child it be different in scale and in type it be damaging policy by the labour party that we know or at least hope that labour will change in due course be sure that today the chief secretary to the treasury be also engage in series of phone conversation with his departmental colleague as ahead of the march update on the obr financial forecast they review what it will mean for their departmental expenditure as he have those difficult phone conversation say to the chief secretary that we stand ready to support effective step on prudent financial responsibility on the point of prudent financial think the house be interested in long and detailed debate this evening so it be important that we dive into the detail on this issue of prudent fiscal responsibility the hon gentleman presumably welcome our fiscal rule that day to day cost will be meet by revenue as oppose to have to borrow money all the time to pay those day to day cost that be something that consistently happen under the last conservative administration which be mistake in the context of fiscal responsibility be it not be aware that the chief secretary to the treasury be interested in prolong debate today be not sure whether that be because of the content of the debate or for other reason would say gently to he that write rule be different from follow rule so he will be judge by this house on how he meet the rule that he have set my purpose today be to cover some of those rule and will have some comment on they but first although we will be have separate debate on the welfare cap the chief secretary to the treasury make some point about it my hon friend the member for faversham and mid kent helen whately will respond formally on that issue so these be just my thought really the welfare cap of course be introduce in by conservative chancellor george osborne who recognise the particular difficulty with forecasting and manage certain welfare budget at the budget he explain his rationale britain should always be proud of have welfare system that help those most in need but never again should we allow its cost to spiral out of control and its incentive to become so distorted that it pay not to work in future any government who want to spend more on benefit will have to be honest with the public about the cost will need the approval of parliament and will be hold to account by this permanent cap on welfare official report march vol george osborne initiative have show its value over the past decade and it be right that the new government be follow its intent in principle and one hope also in practice our task today be to listen to the explanation for the breaching of the welfare cap for fiscal year and the rationale for the particular limit that the chief secretary government will set on the welfare cap for future fiscal year through as the chief secretary say in october as part of the first budget of the parliament the obr provide its assessment of the status of welfare spending compare with the cap that be set in that assessment be an excess of billion which indicate breach with the country now spend over billion on welfare every year and with the obvious pressure on public expenditure there should be determination to find saving in the welfare budget indeed that be the intention of the conservative party at the last election with commitment to reduce expenditure by billion through well target of disability benefit amend the level of payment for those whose disability would not routinely be expect to lead to additional life expense overhaul the fit note process and introduce tough sanction on those who shirk the opportunity to work and contribute to society but the labour government today appear to be set on different course with pathway for the welfare cap that be up not down grow from this year cap of billion to reach billion by that be increase in the welfare cap it be important to note that at the same point in the last parliament when the conservative party set the rule on the welfare cap that increase be limit to rise that difference between and be important be it not it be important think we should reflect on what some of the driver be behind the increase spend in the welfare budget because the evidence be very clear for people who can be and indeed wish to be economically active but be in receipt of universal credit support and other form of payment the main reason be be unable to get access to the treatment they need in the health and mental health service space or be unable to access training opportunity for the job that be available in the market without dive too much into the weed that be the issue about the difference between the approach to austerity in day to day resource spending where we cut spending to frontline public service and annually manage expenditure that be all very well but the chief secretary be talk about the wrong budget he be talk about increase to the health budget or change to aspect of the dwp budget he be not talk about why this government be allow an increase of up to in welfare payment in this country that be different issue it show laxity on the part of the government serious question need to be ask and be sure will be ask in the next debate let return to the charter for budget responsibility which be establish by former chancellor george osborne as part of the budget responsibility and national audit act on second reading the economic secretary to the treasury explain why the measure be necessary we inherit the large budget deficit in our peacetime history we inherit budget deficit forecast to be the large in the and we inherit the large structural deficit in the whole of europe official report february vol she do not have to make up number as this government have do about some fanciful black hole these be fact and my former colleague justine greening be tell the truth to the nation indeed truth be the foundation upon which any charter for budget responsibility be base let be clear when the chancellor say on november that she be not go to fiddle the figure or make something to get different result the fiscal rule include in this charter demonstrate that she be not tell the truth in this charter the chancellor have change the rule on the measurement of debt from public sector net debt or psnd exclude the bank of england to public sector net financial liability or psnfl this fiddling of the figure open the tap for the chancellor to borrow more even while our debt to gdp ratio stand at historically high level follow the pandemic and the ukraine war the guardian newspaper which be sure the chief secretary read avidly report on october that if my right hon friend the member for godalming and ash jeremy hunt the former conservative chancellor have act similarly to the current chancellor his fiscal headroom would have balloon from billion to billion but he know well than the current chancellor the chancellor have even have to create her own name for thing just so that she can claim she be get debt fall she say in her budget statement that she will call psnfl net financial debt for short official report october vol the reality be that the proper measure of government debt as per the previous fiscal rule be rise in every single year of the forecast the obr have confirm that on the previous definition which she have say she would keep to the fiscal rule be be break at the last election labour say it would get debt fall and the government continue to claim that they be deliver that they be do nothing of the sort let we be very clear debt be rise and it be forecast to continue to rise we will be spend nearly billion more on debt interest over the next five year as result of their first budget alone there be also concern about the rolling three year target for the rule that the current budget should be in surplus and the rule that debt the government dubious definition of debt should be fall as share of the economy like the water and fruit for tantalus the rule permit these reasonable target to remain just out of reach every time they be always there but never meet to extend my simile the charter rule be to the chancellor and the chief secretary as st augustine regard self control grant chastity and self control but not yet the charter begin on shaky ground with weak treasury team but it remain an important part of our country fiscal framework under the rule of the house the motion be not amendable so we shall not oppose the measure we do need fiscal rule but we condemn the government approach of fiddle the figure to add more borrowing they promise that they would not but as so many time before they have break their promise once again it be great pleasure to speak in the debate and something of privilege to be the only back bench speaker shall make series of point include welcome the chancellor commitment to growth and the announcement that she make today before move on to number of other area commend what the chancellor say this morning in oxfordshire and in particular what she say about the importance of investment in infrastructure for the long term whether in transport new power to streamline the planning process or indeed attract more tech investment to the uk my reading central constituency and the whole of berkshire benefit enormously from such investment so wholeheartedly welcome her announcement and commend she for her work on that if may will somewhat cheekily ask the chief secretary to take few point back to the chancellor in our area we be look for further investment to drive economic growth will highlight couple of point of local importance in particular the western rail link to heathrow scheme be support by all berkshire mp and colleague from across much wide area heathrow airport be unusual in be hub airport in western europe without rail link in both direction number of local authority parliamentary colleague and the rail industry have push for this measure which compare with some point discuss in the chancellor speech and more widely in the house this afternoon would require only modest investment short stretch of railway line from langley just outside slough into the airport where space for station already exist would significantly cut journey time for worker at the airport commuter and many other and attract business to berkshire the scheme be support by local business group to give an idea of the importance to read at the moment it take around minute from read station to travel to heathrow by bus but it would be just minute with rail link many of the firm relocate to the read area from across the country would be encourage far by that and have far great connectivity to international market through swift access to heathrow equally it would appeal to inward investor come to our part of england there would be an additional benefit the chief secretary may know well know about this for traveller from the west of england and south wales in vastly speed up their journey to heathrow airport want to flag that up to he may ask the chief secretary to relay to the chancellor my wholehearte support for the oxford cambridge corridor the area that represent sit at the south western edge of that corridor give the excellent rail and road connection between reading berkshire and oxford it take as little as minute to get from read town centre to oxford city centre by rail that route could extend the corridor which will run through northamptonshire and bedfordshire as the chancellor highlight indeed the rail corridor into berkshire and through southern oxfordshire pass culham an area of significant science investment that be formerly the site of the uk and europe joint european torus project it also run through didcot which be major centre of inward investment as well as to read there would be enormous benefit to resident and business in oxfordshire and to business in berkshire if that be see as whole rather than the line stop in oxford hope that he will take that back to his colleague appreciate that many colleague may want to speak later on the welfare cap motion so will limit my remark and not stray too far would however like to describe some of the benefit to the berkshire local economy of the stability that the chief secretary outline we have fundamentally strong local economy we be lucky to have high level of growth relative to other part of the uk we face the same challenge as area from across the country which he outline early the importance of stability and long term investment and make sure that business understand that there be stability so that they invest and spend their own money create job let draw out some example from local business represent constituency that have high tech and telecom employment something like people work in those sector in the county of berkshire in reading there be significant cluster near the station which have be foster not just by the rebuilding of the station but by read be the western terminus of the elizabeth line that have lead to significant number of employer move to the town centre it be good example of the benefit of investment that the chancellor talk about early and of the importance of high speed rail and other improvement to rail and public transport to connect major centre of employment and allow employer to recruit from much wide pool that be exactly the message have be tell when visit employer in that area they have base themselves near the station because they can access much wide pool of worker with high level of skill and that drive productivity and growth in their business there be strong local example which at microeconomic level make the point that the chief secretary have make today let also draw the house attention to the importance of education which the chief secretary hint at to manage public finance in my experience have university in the constituency be huge driver of economic activity particularly for create skilled workforce who often wish to remain in the constituency that be certainly the case for many place the chancellor describe in her speech particularly the great university city of oxford and cambridge it also apply to london and many other centre such as manchester high education be central it must be link with employment and offer the right programme to attract wide range of young people into high education it be privilege to meet staff at reading university recently they brief on some of their work to encourage young people from family who traditionally might not have think about go to university to consider high education at their local university that be an important part of the big picture commend the chief secretary for his wide approach on the importance of investment and stability link to investment in transport infrastructure as well as it and tech infrastructure such as data centre and range of other form of infrastructure let move on to some of the point make early it be important to note that we be at turning point we have have long period of low growth the government be right to make growth their top priority to move on from year of historically low growth compare with the uk average over the past or year and go back to the industrial revolution the chief secretary rightly make the connection between growth and investment and so do the chancellor today welcome and wholeheartedly support the chancellor emphasis on release pension saving to drive economic growth that have be successful policy both in canada and in australia although they be much big country and have more natural resource they have significant similarity to the uk the benefit of english common law and many other historical advantage of our system and history there be some important point to be make on that front above all we must avoid the mistake of recent year the instability the disastrous mini budget the gambling with public finance and the lack of transparency the chief secretary be right to commend this charter today will draw out two particular point to flag to the house that think be vital the first be report on capital investment which be an important measure in the charter the second be in year pressure which from the point of view of manage public finance be vital as he rightly say it will allow policymaker much great insight into what be happen in near real time which be important in avoid future problem commend those measure in summary the macro level change that we have describe today will do great deal to support my local small business as well as large investor come into my constituency wholeheartedly support and welcome the measure set out today and be grateful for the opportunity to speak call the liberal democrat spokesperson the charter for budget responsibility be at the heart of the obr function set the government fiscal rule as well as the obr broad remit and how it be to perform its duty it be important to stress just how vital the obr be for the sound management of our public finance and for the uk economic stability be very proud that the obr be set up during my party time in office and the liberal democrats have back it at every turn since in our most recent general election manifesto we say that every fiscal event should be accompany by an obr report and we be pleased that this government be take the same approach we also call on the government at the time to establish the obr to assess general election manifesto independently unfortunately commitment to the obr as an institution can not be take for grant as we have see over the past few year we see liz truss conservative government sideline the independent watchdog at the mini budget and cast doubt on its forecast at every turn equally unfortunately we all witness the consequence soar interest rate sky high mortgage bill and spike in the cost of service our national debt we liberal democrats be crystal clear that we can never have repeat of that debacle the hon lady be make an excellent speech will she also reflect on the disastrous impact on pension saving and particularly on people who be draw their define contribution pension at that point in time some of my constituent have awful experience which they relay to the hon gentleman be right to point to the fact that many people be impact by the mini budget in different way interruption hear chuntere from sedentary position from the shadow minister the hon member for north bedfordshire richard fuller those on the conservative benches may want to forget the impact of the mini budget but many of our constituent across the country continue to live with the consequence in the run up to the labour government budget we liberal democrats welcome one of the government new fiscal rule namely the switch to public sector net financial liability as the target measure of debt we be pleased that the chancellor make change that will create more room for productive public investment while also make commitment that debt as share of gdp should keep fall we liberal democrats have long recognise the need to boost public investment in responsible way and we be glad that the government have move in that direction however as we debate the new charter it be also worth reflect on how fiscal rule be treat in our politic more broadly although they be absolutely necessary for economic stability there be too often sense that fiscal target can be arbitrary and that they be choose base on what be convenient for each government previous conservative chancellors change the fiscal rule five time in seven year between and what often seem to be lack throughout the process be sober pragmatic dialogue about what the good fiscal rule be for our economy for everything from growth and investment to job and net zero discussion perhaps ideally not affect by politic but focus on what be right for our economy notwithstanding that and although hope we will all agree to these change in the borrowing rule the cost of borrow clearly rely on good economic management which in turn as the chief secretary say rely on stability borrowing cost have go up in part due to event abroad but they have also rise because of the government job tax the uncertainty over their business rate reform and the impact that that will have on small business it be therefore clearly important that we recognise that any change to productive borrowing must go hand in hand with the responsible management of day to day spending and tax change second point which make in an early debate around the time of the budget be that although the liberal democrats welcome productive borrowing for investment we recognise that the government headroom be quite slim will the minister be able to offer word or two about which measure the government be take to ensure that we have resilient economy that can withstand any external shock we live in very uncertain world there be rumour of trade war and tariff and god forbid we have another pandemic it be only by have resilient economy that we can withstand unpredictable external shock there be several element in the charter that we support and we do not want to stand in its way but express the hope that from here on in we may be able to adopt an approach to fiscal rule that be more pragmatic open and ground in what be good for our british economy thank right hon and hon member for this afternoon debate will reflect on some of their question and comment in wind up the debate to begin can provide assurance to the shadow chief secretary the hon member for north bedfordshire richard fuller he be concerned that the labour party have mislead the public there could not be anything far from the truth in the manifesto the wording be very clear we would have two fiscal rule first to bring day to day spending in line with receipt and secondly that debt would fall as share of the economy those be our fiscal rule now he be right that we define debt at the budget but that do not change the fiscal rule the fiscal rule be that debt should be fall as share of the economy that be the fiscal rule interruption it be the fiscal rule there be no debate about it it be as clear as the letter on page as be allude to in the debate the chancellor choose well establish metric for debt psnfl public sector net financial liability which recognise the fact that competent government can invest in the country and get return for the taxpayer the chief secretary to the treasury be make bizarre comment the point be that the chancellor state in that she would not fiddle the figure she have now change the number the definition of debt for public sector net debt exclude the bank of england be different from her psnfl they be different it enable the chancellor to borrow more that be fiddle the figure to achieve an objective it be not the same and she do not tell the truth when she say that she would not fiddle the figure that be very strong accusation which refute in the strong term the chancellor be very clear that debt would be fall as share of the economy that be the fiscal rule as predict by the obr we will deliver on that promise it be right that the chancellor choose at the budget to define debt as public sector net financial liability the big question be why as the liberal democrat spokesperson the hon member for st albans daisy cooper say it be because have government with stability and competence at their core mean that we be borrow not to pay for out of control day to day spending which think everyone in the house would agree be an unsustainable path to high debt burden but instead borrow responsibly within guard rail for investment predominantly alongside the private sector to enable for example infrastructure delivery across the country or investment in business for example through the national wealth fund the reason that the public sector net financial liability debt rule be important in that context be because it reflect the fact that where government have an equity stake or have provide debt for non commercial term there be rate of return the taxpayer receive some of the benefit of that investment and growth in the economy which be sure we would all welcome there be the important difference about the type of debt under the last administration debt be spiral out of control because the last government could not pay their day to day bill everybody know whether they be run their household finance or the country finance that that be not sustainable thing to do that have change under this government debt will be for productive investment only and day to day cost will be meet by revenue yes that mean that public service have to live within their mean and often that mean difficult discussion in the spending review that have to conduct with secretaries of state to which the hon gentleman allude however all of we around the cabinet table recognise not only the non negotiable nature of the fiscal rule which be the foundation of economic stability but the prize of the modernisation and reform of our public service he will have hear the prime minister and other secretaries of state talk about just that fact there be huge amount of opportunity to achieve well outcome for people at low cost not just through basic technology but by improve the way we deliver public service that mean deliver service design around the person and how they wish to interact with the government it mean that people can receive support from different departments and different function and they can receive the information they need at the time they need it let give one example in the constituency of my hon friend the member for filton and bradley stoke claire hazelgrove just north of my bristol north west constituency visit community diagnostic centre the cdc programme begin under the last administration but we have commit ourselves to it the provider work in partnership with the nhs trust charge exactly the same rate as the hospital for diagnostic scan the company involve do not make profit in comparison with the hospital cost it be the same nhs tariff rate people can have mri and ct scan gastroscopy and other test the centre be attach to branch of asda and there be plenty of free parking ask the owner why be you able to charge the same rate as the hospital in my constituency while run this service more effectively they say we be open for hour day from monday to saturday and for hour on sunday we sweat the asset more than hospital can and we have new bit of kit with ai that be more productive to be why the health secretary want to roll those out across the nhs they also say that the customer service be the key driver for productivity because customer could book their appointment and move they if necessary they could visit the centre after work and they could go there between shopping trip essentially the service have be design around the patient patient turn up pretty much all the time and they be never not able to do so that be just one example of the way we be modernise public service the chief secretary have give fantastic example of how improve capital infrastructure in the nhs can improve productivity but one of the big frustration in the nhs be the fact that staff can not be productive because the building around they be fall apart have see that in watford general hospital where staff can not be as productive as they might be because they be in crumbling cramped hospital have the treasury consider conduct any assessment of the productivity gain that could be produce by the new hospital programme and by potentially speed up the delivery of those hospital the health secretary be actively work on this there be huge opportunity not just in the nhs but in the department for work and pensions where my right hon and hon friend be work and throughout government as whole imagine have jobcentre in your pocket on your phone where you can gain access to the support that you need as oppose to service that be often out of town or not available when you be available and where there be difficult process to go through that be not great for the people who work in those service they be there to serve the public but they be not help to achieve the right outcome for people this government be commit to reform but also to investment because we can achieve well outcome for people and reduce the cost of run public service in the long run we be committed to unlock investment whether it be through the psnfl debt definition for infrastructure and business or as consequence free up public sector grant for public sector investment my hon friend the member for read central matt rodda make number of excellent point be pleased that he be supportive of the commitment make by the chancellor today to back the heathrow plan and the enormous opportunity present by the oxford cambridge growth corridor he give the great example of his local technology and telecom cluster and its development around rail infrastructure include extra capacity on the elizabeth line it be classic and probably obvious example if rail and other transport infrastructure be build people will come and invest in lab space office and home that be why the chancellor make such strong commitment today to get infrastructure build and enable private sector investment my hon friend also make good point about the role of university our university sector be one of our great strength we have number of world lead university as well as the brilliant university that be teach and carry out research in every part of our country these be often the engine of economic growth in their region and also the gateway to opportunity for many people the chief secretary have refer to the great benefit of infrastructure project the elizabeth line be very good example of that but it be way over budget and very late and the same apply to and most other big infrastructure project what plan do the government have in that regard later we will discuss the welfare cap an attempt to control welfare spending for the next five year do the same cap apply to infrastructure project thank the right hon member for his question because he invite to talk the house through our infrastructure strategy for the first time we be bring together government plan on economic infrastructure housing and social infrastructure in the same place it mean that when we go through the spending review in the treasury work with colleague across whitehall we will be much well than the previous government at take place base decision in the past it be bilateral discussion between department and the treasury with no dot be connect between different type of infrastructure that have lead to the failure to capture the growth potential in different place we will take different approach and make sure that infrastructure investment relate to public investment be cap by the number set out in the budget that be the spending envelope that we have and we have to prioritise those investment but they will be base on drive growth and opportunity for people in the place in which they live my hon friend the member for reading central make great point about the oxford cambridge growth corridor the role of connect some of our great university and unleash the opportunity that exist between they as say to the house early the living connectivity arrangement between oxford and cambridge be basically non existent by connect these two hub of innovation and investment the opportunity be endless have to be careful because have significant constituency interest in this issue but want to ask more general question about the role of infrastructure investment and the fiscal rule east west rail proposal to complete the railway line have benefit cost ratio of in its last business case building it would basically lose of every pound of taxpayer money do the chief secretary to the treasury regard that as loss if not will there be business case that show that the project have benefit cost ratio that do not lose taxpayer money that be great question all these infrastructure opportunity will go through both value for money assessment and growth assessment the argument that we have be make today be that initiate project such as the east west rail line in co ordinate way with private capital university and our house building plan lift the growth opportunity that come from those project that be why patrick vallance have be appoint as the champion of the growth corridor we will take whole corridor view on the investment and the opportunity across different investment regardless of whether they be public or private but they will all have to go through value for money and growth assessment the infrastructure strategy will be year strategy it will give long term view on economic housing and social infrastructure but they will be underpin by long term capital budget the capital budget that we will set in june will be for four year until but the normal approach as set out in the charter will be that the capital budget will be for five year as the house know we have commit to do the next spending review every subsequent two year in when we conduct the next spending review we will have the year infrastructure strategy but also pretty much year of capital budget be allocate for those project that be hugely important signal to investor we be work with industry and investor on what the biannual pipeline might look like so that we can publish in real term the investable proposition but also so that business know that work be come if they invest in their supply chain or their workforce that be crucial part of unlock investment in skill and training in our country much like we have just see in the water industry which have agree long term investment settlement supplier be already tell we that they be now able to invest in staff training and capability because they know that the flow of investment will be come over period of time we be seek to do that across range of infrastructure in order to unlock the investment that this country need should like to ask my right hon friend some further question on the point he be make the elizabeth line demonstrate the case that he be make for the importance of place base investment and the way in which house flat and business have be build near station there have be combination of public and private investment in the project which be arguably part of its success so welcome the point he be make about the longevity of the infrastructure investment the role of the joint investment or co ordinate investment with the private sector and above all the place base nature of this the role of patrick vallance in particular be an important one in that corridor would also urge my right hon friend again to look at the far end of the corridor both at the oxfordshire and berkshire end and also possibly towards norwich and far into east anglia know that former minister in the previous government have be highlight the potential benefit of investment along rail in east anglia thank my hon friend for his intervention he remind that the right hon member for islington north jeremy corbyn ask about broad reform to ensure that infrastructure be deliver differently from how it have be in the past and would point the house to the action that minister have already take to call in project that have be gum up in the system for long time which we have allow to take place and also to the planning and infrastructure bill that will be present to the house in due course which will show the level of ambition this government have for streamline planning and consent process so that we can get thing build as have already mention think today in the house the fact that we can build house for someone in to week but it seem to take year to get plan approve show the size of the prize for deliver for people across the country will end by thank the liberal democrat spokesperson the hon member for st albans for her comment and for remind the house why this debate matter and why the fiscal rule matter because as we see under the last administration this be not an obscure debate here in the house of commons or kind of whitehall guidance debate this be important to people life because when government lose control of the economy nationally it hit family finance we all know from talk to our constituent how stressful it be when the conservative party lose control of the economy and when inflation go through the roof it have direct impact on people mortgage and on their ability to buy house so many people lose their mortgage offer overnight because of the action of the last government it also affect people in the private rent sector when their landlord increase the rent and because no fault eviction be allow under the last government many people lose their home this fundamental insecurity in people life stem from the action of politician here in government that be why the fiscal rule be so important and why the chancellor and indeed the whole government be so iron clothe in their commitment to they that be why the fiscal rule be non negotiable interruption shadow ministers on the conservative benches laugh but would encourage they to meet some of our constituent and to explain why their action lead to such hardship for they have not even start to talk about the cost of energy bill or the food inflation that we be still struggle with today directly as consequence of the mismanagement of the economy under the last administration the soon the conservatives should they wish to receive advice from apologise for the consequence of their action the soon the public might start to listen to they again but while they be listen to this labour government can reassure hon and right hon member in the house today that the fiscal rule be non negotiable they be the bedrock of economic stability they enable we to invest in our public service in sustainable way to secure growth in the economy and ultimately as set out in the prime minister plan for change to deliver for work people so that they will know in the year ahead that life be well under labour government than it be under conservative government question put and agree to resolve that the charter for budget responsibility autumn which be lay before this house on january be approve welfare cap with the permission of the house the motion relate to the welfare cap will be debate together beg to move that pursuant to the charter for budget responsibility autumn update which be approve by this house on february under section of the budget responsibility and national audit act this house agree that the forecast breach of the welfare cap in due to high forecast expenditure on universal credit and disability benefit be justify and that no further debate will be require in relation to this specific breach with this it will be convenient to discuss the follow motion that the level of the welfare cap as specify in the autumn budget which be lay before this house on october be approve before this government be elect we say that we would change this country and we will to get change do any government have to stand on firm foundation which be why as we have just hear from the chief secretary to the treasury we promise to be responsible with the public money we know that every penny count in this mission because if we fail to protect the public purse we fail to protect the purse of the public family finance can never withstand fantasy economic that be suppose to be the whole point of the welfare cap it be design to help well control public spending count the cost of the rise price of failure will come to some of the failure we be now see and the people throw on the scrapheap as result of the failure of year of economic policy particularly on the labour market the welfare cap be intend to ensure that the cost of important part of the social security system such as universal credit though not count those actively look for work the personal independence payment and pension credit remain predictable and affordable only the state pension and benefit for unemployed household be exclude what be the result of decade of conservative welfare cap repeat breach of the cap with ever high limit the late cap be now on course to be breach by an billion overspend this be not tolerable give the state of our economy and the public report february vol correction worse still there be the human cost for every single person who could be enjoy the benefit of work but have be deny the choice and chance they deserve regularly meet people in that position there be the young person who have not recover from the dreadful legacy of the pandemic not in college not start their first job barely even able to go out with friend and bear the burden of the mental health crisis that our young people face believe the pandemic generation be completely let down there be our old relative who have be push out of work before their time with hip or knee pain the nhs be just not able to help they at the moment and they be not even get advice about how to make end meet that be the legacy we inherit and it be not good enough for anybody it be also the legacy of low growth the high cost of living and high inactivity with employment and social security system ill equip to meet the requirement of an old sicker nation that be the conservative party record unfortunately this breach forecast as far back as march but ignore be now wholly unavoidable in this fiscal year give the scale of failure we have inherit we will not duck the difficult decision need to restore economic stability and we will deal with the failure we see before we before say how we will do that want to reflect on exactly how we end up in this situation the sad truth be that in way too many part of the country too many people be deny the opportunity to have good job so that they can support themselves and put roof over their family head the benefit bill only reflect that failure with million people lock out of the workforce due to poor health and million more working age people report long term health condition than year ago we have large number of people turn up to social security system that be not gear up to meet what have become the great unemployment challenge of generation my hon friend be do compelling job of set out the damn state of the welfare system we inherit when we take charge do she agree that investment in the nhs so that people finally have the healthcare support they need be fundamental to make sure they can get back to work contribute as they would like and build secure future for themselves and their family the nhs be the bedrock that ensure people can thrive and contribute to society economically and in every other way we also need to ensure that the health support people get be the right support at the moment we be not do enough on occupational therapy and other thing that provide health support tailor to people work we will have more to say about that in the near future be sure huge number of people be turn to social security system that be not gear up to meet the huge employment challenge at the moment social security can not cope hon member may ask themselves how on earth we get to this place after year of so call benefit crackdown by the conservatives well invite everybody to look at their record when universal credit be introduce year ago the government of the day make all sort of promise they say it would break the cycle of benefit dependency and offer great incentive to find job the former secretary of state for work and pensions the right hon member for chingford and woodford green sir iain duncan smith say that universal credit will ensure that work always pay and be see to pay but what have we see since disastrous series of wrong head choice that have achieve precisely the opposite effect new datum which we be publish today for the first time show the extent of the effect of universal credit on incapacity benefit there have be increase of people receive incapacity benefit between and around of that increase be because of the rise state pension age and another because of the way change be make in the move from employment support allowance and other benefit to universal credit situation that should have be foresee and plan for by the previous government that leave an increase of over people to which will now turn the conservatives need to take long hard look at the change they make to universal credit we must consider how people transition between the look for work group in the universal credit health journey where they be tell that they have limit capacity to do any work or work relate activity to actively look for work how do people move between be tell they can not work and be tell to actively look for work people move between those two group use to receive top up to their benefit but that be remove in create hard barrier between those categorise as incapable for work and those look for work in addition there be four year freeze to the rate of universal credit in the late except the high tier of health relate benefit as result the income of those try to find work be squeeze and the barrier between those on universal credit actively look for work and those who have be tell that they be unable to work be harden we have see steady rise in the number of people on the high tier of health benefit where there be no requirement to look for work or to get any help to make the step on that journey and no support to find job when many people actually want to work all the while there have be more and more condition and box tick in system that have fail social security be design to smooth people income over time and to take account of life event that could happen to any of we but the result of all the change be that either by design or mismanagement probably both the previous government create social security system that segregate people away from work and forget about they there be no help back to work and only the promise that they would be leave alone the office for budget responsibility have say that the wide benefit system in particular the conditionality and generosity associate with incapacity benefit relative to other part of the system have affect incapacity benefit flow over time unfortunately that situation create by the last government be far from the only problem because social security will only ever function where the government take their wide duty seriously on the point of support for people who be on benefit the social security act end the requirement on the now department for work and pensions to provide advice and welfare support to people will it now be the policy of the dwp to automatically offer advice and support to people on the benefit they be entitle to claim or to give more support to voluntary advice agency so that people get what they be entitle to we publish in november an extensive reform programme for the department to get britain work we show how in some part of the country will come to this in more detail shortly people have be abandon and their labour market have not support enough good job for very long time we show how by act on well health and well local support service we will reintroduce ambition into our support service we want to help people get into job that will support their family finance and help our economy thrive we have huge change programme underway in the department for work and pensions and we will be do even more than we set out in that white paper the challenge be huge but the potential be also massive worry about everybody who be out of work but particularly our young people who have effectively be throw on the scrapheap it be disaster now in exactly the same way that it be disaster bring about by the economic turbulence that grow up in in the which be the period the right hon member refer to we will therefore take the challenge of restore employment proper employment in this country extremely seriously in do that want to talk about the government wide responsibility not just in reform the social security system but far beyond that you will forgive madam deputy speaker if return to the found document of our social security system the beveridge report in william beveridge identify the establishment of comprehensive health and rehabilitation service and maintenance of employment as necessary condition of success in social security that lesson be forget again and again in this country and we will never have social security system that function well unless we have an nhs that work and we maintain policy design to move towards full employment social security can not soak up every single problem in this country if the government forget their wide responsibility note that the beveridge report consider the consequence of war and the injury to the nation that that have bring about in many way we ought to learn the lesson of the pandemic that the health of the nation can never be take for grant and that in set we on the right path in term of both health and employment we can plot course towards more sustainable future as have say be it any wonder that our social security system be break give the health of the nation give what we have be through and give the last government neglect of the nhs and the state of our labour market to look backwards again for moment we know that in our country economic history we have period when whole town and city be deindustrialise and leave to fend for themselves economy simply fail and while great progress have be make include in my constituency in my city region in merseyside and in other place whose economy have move on greatly since that time sadly too many have never properly recover as result we have labour market that simply fail to offer good work everywhere as part of our get britain work white paper analysis we find that when student be not count the inactivity rate to give the example of blackpool be that be nearly third of working age people that can never be good platform on which to build thriving economy and be determined that we will turn it around more than half of the local authority with the high rate of inactivity in england be in the north while none be in the south east it be however far from north south divide we have identify type of labour market in the united kingdom and consider their feature what they share and what divide they we want to identify those place that be furth behind precisely so that we can help it be not just the prevail economic circumstance or what have happen in the recent past to local authority that defeat people but unfortunately the jobcentre that be suppose to be there to help when we do our analysis for our get britain work white paper we uncover the record of the last conservative government be shocked to find that only around universal credit claimant in the search for work group move into work from one month to the next in the no work requirement group be still there after six month that be the very definition of be on the scrapheap no work and no help to get work that be just fail people then there be the price tag spend on universal credit and disability benefit be billion high than anticipate when the level of the welfare cap be calculate that be dreadful record for the reason that set out early the breach of the cap be unavoidable this year but this government be take the action necessary to drive up opportunity in employment while drive down the benefit bill our get britain work white paper as have mention set out the big reform to employment in generation with radical new approach back by million of investment we be overhaul our jobcentre and create new job and career service do away with needless admin and free up work coach time so that my colleague can give real high quality support to people although be often disappointed in the help that people receive in jobcentre be never disappoint by what our work coach do the thing that let the work coach down be the system in which they work for example they be tell that they can see someone for only minute how be they suppose to help in minute they have to carry out numerous admin check that could be do with modern technology when the person in front of they be just sit there wait not receive any help our work coach be full of idea full of local knowledge and full of determination that we will make new system work take this opportunity to put on record my thank to every single dwp member of staff who have embrace change with gusto when visit the jobcentre in st albans last year too be strike by the fantastic support give by some of the work coach however be also strike by what some of the jobseeker have to say one say that she have be in full employment but have to give up her job to look after her two child because they could not get the special educational need and disability support that they need in school another say that they be struggle with addiction and could not hold down job because they could not get the support need from the nhs do the minister agree that while our work coach be do really good job ultimately we need to get our public service particularly the nhs back on their foot agree with the hon lady can we just take this moment to thank the dwp team in st albans they sound like they be do great job and they be also brief their local mp which be really good of they encourage all colleague in the house to ensure that they have regular catch up with their jobcentre colleague so that they know the kind of thing that our work coach have to deal with often member of parliament can be quite helpful in put people in touch with other organisation so encourage all colleague to do as the hon lady have do on the point that the hon lady make about send she be absolutely right this be major barrier if member want to understand what struggle to get to work and to stay in work look like they should ask the parent of disabled child this issue of where the effect of poverty and the send crisis can compound be be consider by the child poverty taskforce in particular the hon lady be absolutely right good public service and good strong economy go hand in hand it be not public service or strong call that ideology austerity and it do not work the two go hand in hand we need to look in that rounded way to see how we can help people and that be the approach that we be take we want to make every jobcentre in the country place that people who be look for work and employer will actually want to use we know that what happen early on in career echo down the year as have say our young people the pandemic generation be fail that be why our youth guarantee will give every to year old access to quality education training or employment on top of that we be work with local leader who know their town and city well support they to produce their own local get britain work plan that join up work health and skill to support their community have mention the major fracture still in the uk economy follow previous economic event that be not manage properly that be how we know that the same thing just will not work everywhere the dwp will reform itself so that we be able to localise support service and we will work with local leader to do that all of that will ensure that we help people to enjoy the benefit that good work bring to wellbee and do mean good work the choice in this country should never be between the scar of unemployment and the scar of poor work that do nothing but keep people poor poor work do not reduce the pressure on our social security system it just mean more people work too hard for their poverty that be why we will improve the security and quality of work through our plan to make work pay we will create more good job in every part of the country with modern industrial strategy and local growth plan together they will help we to meet our long term ambition for an employment rate we will create the condition for success in social security as have outline the change make to social security be ill thought through fresh approach be need to make our social security system sustainable and we will build that system to give people the help that they need to find great job and feel the benefit of work we want to tackle poverty and target support at those who need it most we will set out our proposal in green paper on reform the health and disability system in the spring we will work with disabled people and their organisation to get that right strong social security system need the confidence of we all anyone might suddenly find themselves unwell or with the extra cost that child bring and we all hope one day to enjoy the benefit of the state pension so we must protect the social security system now and in the future not only do we confirm at the autumn budget that we would keep welfare cap in place with margin of to account for the volatility of recent forecast but later this year we will publish new annual report on social security spending across government set out the dwp plan to ensure that it be on sustainable path the day of set spending target without proper plan to meet they be over if next year report recommend an increase in welfare spending would that be impossible within this cap or will she come back to parliament to ask for change in the cap well ahead of its expiration in the specific of our proposal we will publish green paper on health and disability in the come month with regard to the financial control we will do all that the chief secretary to the treasury set out some moment ago on allow the office for budget responsibility to perform its function that be the good way to ensure that we take fiscal decision within the guardrail that he set out the result of year of failure be unfortunately only too obvious as say early everywhere we look in this country we can see the impact of what the previous government do too many people in far too many place be neglect and fail starve of opportunity and leave to turn to social security system that just be not work everybody in this country suffer the consequence be not sure how long the minister have leave in her speech but have question about the welfare cap we be be ask to make two decision to approve the welfare cap and to note the breach she have make the case for how the government be try to get britain work and why the breach have happen this year but so far she have not make the case for why they be put in welfare cap this year and why we parliamentarian should agree to it do make the case for the overall welfare cap and for that policy at the beginning of my speech because it be important that we have proper control on public spending fantasy economic will do absolutely nothing to support family finance and the government be determined that we will manage public finance in responsible fashion the result of failure be far too obvious we all pay the consequence that be why we will not stand for it every penny count but so do the future of every person in this country that be why in order to ensure we save every penny for the thing we want to spend on in social security we be bring forward the big welfare fraud and error package in recent history we be not just tweak broken system we be go to fundamentally change the way we approach reform start with the principle of focus on people we will tackle the root cause of unemployment whether you be out of work because you can not find job or be out of work because the last government write you off everybody deserve to build well life and fulfil their potential be proud to be labour mp labour be the party of the dignity of work we know that for those who be able to the good place to be be in work with well pay job with good right do my hon friend agree that the previous government do far too little to ensure that people who could work be help back into work to get all the benefit and dignity that work can bring and that they write off far too many people which have leave we in this sorry state be glad that my hon friend be proud to be labour mp as be and be glad he be proud of the approach we be take on employment because so be we can not afford this failure any long in the cost to our public finance we will never tolerate the failure in hope dignity ambition and opportunity that the level of unemployment in this country now represent the welfare cap we be debate today be introduce back in by the conservative chancellor at the time george osborne to hold the government to account on the cost of our welfare system through the in government we broadly keep to that cap it be part of the discipline we apply to the welfare system to make it fair for the taxpayer and to put into practice the strongly hold conservative principle that if you can work you should work we introduce universal credit to ensure that work always pay and support business to create million of job and we help thousand of people into work and drive down economic inactivity and be oppose at every step of the way by the labour party but in the year during and since the pandemic will not shy away from tell the truth thing change while the number of job keep go up the number of people economically inactive also start to go up and with that the welfare bill and that be big problem it be financial problem that mean we be today debate welfare cap which have be breach it be an economic problem because our economy need the talent and energy of everyone and it be social problem of the million people of working age define as economically inactive million be not work because of ill health that include grow number of young people young people be start out on life on benefit instead of start out on career miss out on the opportunity that work bring the sense of purpose the connection with other people the chance to learn and develop skill miss out on the experience of be pay for their effort and miss out on the chance to build financial independence and security we as country have moral and financial imperative to turn this around and in government we be work flat out to tackle it will the hon lady acknowledge that under the last conservative government inactivity rate among the young be the high in the oecd and that they be work on it but it be not work as be sure the hon gentleman hear be just acknowledge the fact that the economic inactivity rate start go up in the run up to and particularly follow the pandemic we have particular concern which be sure the government share around grow inactivity among young people it be challenge that we be experience more than other country and there be lot of work to do to get to the bottom of it be involve in that work in government as health minister and it be imperative that the new government get grip on that issue will the right hon member give way will make some progress in government we be work flat out to tackle that problem we be change how we assess people capability for work recognise that the world of work have change we develop workwell to help people with health condition or disability find and stay in work and we be reform the fit note that gps give people once again we be oppose by labour every step of the way we also have plan to go far in our manifesto we commit to billion worth of saving by reform sickness benefit labour respond at the time by say that the money be simply not there and the present chancellor say that not single penny could be save from welfare it turn out that on this one occasion labour have stick to its word it have no plan to control welfare spending today the government be set welfare cap that do not include penny worth of saving at staggering billion by increase on this year cap in cash term that be more than our entire defence budget not content with not save single penny they have give themselves billion buffer on top of that that lack of ambition be terrifying we believe that money can and should be save from the welfare bill the chancellor finally seem to agree with we because she have be busy brief the paper in panic about cut spending but where be those plan unfortunately she have not get any because as say until now she do not believe any saving could be make perhaps the employment minister can give we some clue believe she have can my fit note reform so what will she do to get the welfare bill down and by when how on earth do she expect to get people into work when people be add to the unemployment figure in december alone think be be ask whether we stop the extensive work that the previous government be do on rise inactivity have to say that when get into the department for work and pensions there be not an extensive plan available that be why we have have to embark on fundamental reform which we set out in white paper in november and that be why we will shortly be bring forward green paper on health and disability reform the idea that somehow there be an instruction list leave in the department that we could just crack on with be fantasy the hon lady will know at least think she will know that the vast majority of what she set out in the white paper be the continuation of thing we be do in government in fact if she have read it she will see that it even say that the youth guarantee be essentially new name for repackage set of measure that be already in place that be literally in the white paper be happy to follow up with she afterwards on the page that she will find that phrase on have yet to see single sign to suggest that this government can tackle the welfare bill and the cap they be set today tell we that they agree the opposition will support effort to bring down welfare cost sensibly we need compassionate safety net but that net should never become trap if the government do not get grip of the problem it will put our entire social contract at risk minister have finally twig that action be require green paper be they say on its way urge the hon lady to get on with it because each month that pass see thousand more drift out of work and into life of inactivity every person in this country should be able to live decent life but too many of we be unable to earn decent wage that be what be push up social security spending lead to the motion that we be debate today too many people be force to claim sickness benefit because the nhs have fail they there be not enough well pay job and people do not engage with the social security system that the conservative party leave we because it demonise and attack they that leave we as an incoming labour government with choice between massive implement cut to social security this year and technically breach the welfare cap be proud that this government have choose to breach that cap rather than drive people into destitution be proud that we will get people who want to work into work and that we will change the system for the future to ensure that people be not leave as they have be for the past year be proud that this government will ensure that every person have the support they need when they need it our nation be sick and thing need to change specifically three thing first our nhs need to shift after year of mismanagement and the disastrous lansley reform we have almost million people out of work we be the only nation to see sickness rise during the pandemic and after it as well every single one of we see that degradation and damage when we try to get an appointment with our local gp that be what we need to fix in the year ahead secondly we must transform our low pay low training economy which do not provide enough good job or pay enough to live thousand of people be unable to turn on the heating because they can not afford it and thousand be unable to eat nurse be force to go to food bank around of child in poverty be in work family and be cold and hungry make people sicker too many people in this country go straight from school into sickness the number of young people in this nation who be too sick to be active in the labour market have almost double since those be the problem that we will be fix in the year ahead the third thing that need to change of course be the punitive social security system that push people to the brink when people could not see their gp could not earn enough to live decent life and be too scared to go to the jobcentre they stop work altogether that have lead we in this country into toxic doom loop with sicker people have less money in their pocket and become too sick to work lead to high social security payment the amount we be spend on social security be sign not of the former conservative government generosity but of their failure that be what we will be address in the year ahead the amount that we be spend on sickness and disability benefit have rise from billion in to billion today and that be in real term not nominal term that be an increase of around to that be why we will breach the cap by billion this year rather than impose devastating and swingeing cut on those who already can not afford to eat we on the labour benches know that food bank be not an integral part of our welfare system they be symbol of failure these be the thing that we must change in the future we need change not simply to policy but in attitude for year it be say that every person who be fail to earn enough be somehow skiver that be wrong and it drive those who need to engage with the social security system not to engage with it at all use to work at the department for work and pensions and can tell the house that people on both side those who want to work and those who want to help people into work be good people who be let down by bad system somebody who work in my local jobcentre in milton keynes come to visit last week and tell about his experience he currently have to conduct minute appointment and as lot of that time be spend on admin he be not able to give the necessary help and support to people who be desperate to find job do my hon friend agree that it be really important that this government unlike the previous government focus on provide the support necessary to get people into work rather than set narrative about people be workshy and not want to work which be not the truth could not agree more with my hon friend ten minute be nowhere near enough time for people to get the job support they need it be not enough for those who be seek help or for those seek to give that help especially as the economy be change and get well pay job require more training the country change before with the automative revolution and it be now change with the artificial intelligence revolution those people need support and help in order to get security but they be not guarantee it or give it at the moment and that be the precise intention of the change we be put forward it be not easy to put forward these change and it will not take short time but by start that work today and by change the relationship between those who be seek to give help and those who be receive that help we can ensure that those who need help will actually receive it this be not just about those on the ground who be do great work or indeed about my former brilliant colleague at the dwp it be also about how we in this house speak about those who need help who be in poverty or who receive social security payment we must understand that every single person in this country want to work and want the dignity that come with it but they be too often let down because of lack of well pay job lack of support and lack of dignity afford to they by party that seek only to demonise that be what we seek to change in this house and indeed in this country that be the choice before we and it be why we be make these decision technical breach of the welfare cap this year and more accurate welfare cap in the year ahead so that we can begin to provide the support that people need people go to food bank because work do not pay and the two child cap for example mean that they do not have enough money to live on or to support their family why be the hon member support welfare cap that bake in the two child limit do not believe that the hon member be correct the welfare cap do not define future decision the welfare cap in future year define the total amount that will be spend at that time we should be clear what the welfare cap refer to she mention the two child limit in particular and government members have be clear that choice have to be make in straiten time we know that child be drive into poverty and that no child deserve to be bear into such circumstance indeed we know about the huge and shocking rise in child poverty and child hunger in this country know that member across the house be shock by that but the truth be that we can not make every such decision in this house because these be straiten time however appreciate the intervention and indeed the good faith in which it be make there be lot we have to change in this country and be sure we will do so in the year ahead the choice before we today be simple the technical breach this year and the change in the year to come be the right choice and we be make they for the right reason many in work today can not make it pay and that be why we will make sure that people who be in work get the training they need that be not just about the training they need to get well job it be about the support they need to ensure that their healthcare and indeed their health be good enough to continue work more broadly we must ensure that every single person in the country can have decent job that pay enough and we be take action in three area to do that first and foremost there be our action on the nhs and through the darzi review because we should not live country where almost million people be too sick to work we have offer thousand more appointment to get waiting list down because people who can not see gp today be far more likely to end up out of work tomorrow secondly we be help people get into work there be the trailblazer programme to join up work skill and health support and the million to help those with complex need get back into work thirdly we be create good job for young people with the youth guarantee so that every single young person in this country can access the training they need and the apprenticeship they require the fundamental reform the chancellor set out in her speech today be also about support people into work so they can contribute to our economy and do what they need to do to get decent life for themselves and their family have decent job and earn enough to live be about more than the pound in person pocket it be about sense of contentment and something to talk about with their mate it give meaning to each day the hon member have talk eloquently about the challenge of get into the workplace do he realise that large number of people across our society who be economically inactive have the desire to look for work and have welfare payment to support they get into work but sometimes through no fault of their own the system work against they thank the hon member for that point indeed that be the entire reason why we be change the system today yes it be about practical change and provide more support but it be also about change of tone change of attitude and treat people like human being that be exactly what labour member believe these reform and support at their core be about ensure that every single person have decent job which give they meaning and something to talk about with their mate previous labour government do that so well and that be how we get poverty down previous member for sedgefield who be shin light for we on the labour benches promise to end child poverty in generation and previous member for dunfermline who be hero to we put that into practice and reduce child poverty by almost million it be that labour tradition to which speak that labour tradition be why be proud to stand here today and that be why be proud to vote in favour of these motion call the liberal democrat spokesperson year of mismanagement by the previous conservative government damage our economy hit people living standard and leave our public service on their knee especially our nhs and care so it be no wonder that we have see the welfare bill go up the conservatives leave gp and hospital waiting time soar they also see staff vacancy spiral and local public health funding be slash the cancer treatment target have be miss every year since they promise gps and leave government with few of they of course the new hospital fall apart literally in some case lead to inefficiency in our health service as staff and patient battle cramp and crumble building remember former conservative prime minister stand on the step of no and promise to fix social care once and for all but as we know million of people around the uk be leave to pick up the piece of broken social care system that disgraceful legacy and the blatant mismanagement of our economy have leave million of people unable to work due to long term illness and have to rely on support instead impact growth and productivity under the last conservative government the number of people not look for work especially due to ill health reach record level and government spending on welfare go up drastically as result their mismanagement have leave so many people unable to seek work and reliant instead on government support we liberal democrats have always understand that healthy economy require healthy people as have say number of time in the house health and wealth be two side of the same coin the good way to bring down welfare spending be for the government to act with urgency and ambition to end the crisis in our nhs and care empower people to join the workforce and reduce the need for welfare support in the first place the conservatives mismanagement of the economy have have direct impact on decision be make today at informal assessment in and the obr clearly say that the welfare cap be on track to be breach this year but the new labour government must do far more to fix our health and care service so that few people require government support in the first place have to say that the conservative party have lose every right to criticise the current situation when its fingerprint of failure be all over it we have previously discuss the impact of the government national insurance contribution rise and other change the government have say repeatedly that these change be inevitable as way to fund the nhs but they know and we know that some of this be really not need the national insurance contribution rise will impact our gps dentist public health provider primary care provider pharmacist social care provider and hospice the list go on those people and business be prop up our nhs use this opportunity once again to encourage the government to reverse the national insurance contribution rise and look to other mean of raise those fund fundamentally the good way to bring down welfare spending be for the government to act with urgency and ambition to end the crisis in our nhs and social care we liberal democrats make that our no priority during the general election and with mp it remain our no priority in this house thank my hon friend the minister for her opening speech on timely subject as the government have just lay out their bold and striking ambition to grow our economy and take the tough decision need after year of dither and delay by the conservative party today more than on other day we have see lay out in stark relief the choice before we of either double down on the failure more of the same or pick new route that be what this debate be about want to talk about the root cause of some of the growth issue that we face but first want to focus on number billion that be how much the welfare cap be breach by because of the conservatives failure time and again that be not small amount to put it in some context it be as much as the entire programme budget of the department for work and pensions to give another comparison it be half the entire police grant for all police in england and wales it be phenomenal failure on the part of the conservatives that we face this issue today and it be not their only failure in the dwp my hon friend the minister lay out fantastically well the litany of failure let pick up one in particular the conservatives breach the welfare cap but we have not have much time to talk about their failure on fraud and error because of failure on their watch the number more than double and be now stick at an elevated post covid rate they leave we with an entrenched fraud and error problem we could go on the litany of catastrophic mismanagement be almost endless the hon member for faversham and mid kent helen whately say that she could make saving the conservatives have year where be they instead we get lot of dog eat my homework excuse they should be hang their head in shame as hon friend have point out it be tell that behind the shadow minister the opposition benches be empty they know how badly they let the country down it be not just about the billion the conservatives failure shine spotlight on two deep failure that be the root cause of today motion failure to grow the economy and failure to get people into work and to help those with health condition move on in the labour market let turn to growth first we have hear lot today about the economy but it be worth pause to remember how bad thing be under the conservatives from on their watch the economy grow slow than any other economy bar one in the last decade of their rule gdp rise in real term by only if it have grow at the same rate as comparable country on average we would each be more than well off welcome the fact that after year of this country be hold back by previous incompetent government this government be finally take the decision to realise our country potential that be what we hear today billion be release through support the ox cam arc billion through the chancellor excellent announcement over the weekend to allow investment of pension surplus billion of infrastructure to give we nine new reservoir the conservatives have year in government do you know how many reservoir they build madam deputy speaker zero that be the difference be proud of our chancellor who have make the tough decision that have give we the foundation of stability and allow we to make these announcement today it be because of the stability create by the budget and her other decision that we now have inflation of that interest rate have be cut twice because the bank have confidence in the government fiscal management that investment be at year high and that wage be grow at their fast rate in three year could go on it be only because of the tough decision that we have make that we be in that position beyond the conservatives failure on growth the breach of the welfare cap also shine spotlight on their terrible failure to get people into work and to combat poverty the figure be extraordinarily stark thank my hon friend the member for loughborough dr sandher for share some of they today one in five adult be economically inactive because of the conservatives legacy we be the only country where employment rate remain below the pre covid level note that the hon member for faversham and mid kent when ask acknowledge the fact but she could not tell we why that be well have clue for she it be because of the incompetence and the failure of her party what be more we know that these problem be drive overwhelmingly by ill health with of those who have drop out of the labour market have do so due to ill health this disproportionately hit those over but scandalously also affect the young in our society the number of neet those not in employment education or training go up by third in the last three year of the previous government it go deep than that beneath the shocking rise in to year old who be out of work and inactive stunning be also low skilled with skill level low than gcse because of conservative failure so many of our young people have be catch in downward spiral of low skill poor opportunity low self esteem and poor mental health this failure by the conservatives be moral disgrace but it be also massive economic problem if not address the sickness bill they bequeath the country could exceed billion by the end of this parliament would like to say that this be the first time they conservative have do something like this but that would not be true those of we old enough to remember will know that in the outgoing conservative government bequeath more than million inactive people to the incoming labour government it be just what conservative government do my hon friend the minister also mention the fact that many of the technical change the previous government make to universal credit and other benefit actually drag people far away from the labour market put up barrier and make it hard to get work this be an absolute scandal especially because we know that dwp staff the people who work on this want to make difference work for the new deal taskforce year ago work on the previous labour government strong effort to get people back into work know that dwp staff want to make difference but because of the previous government terrible policy design and incompetence they be often prevent from do so this be massive human tragedy we know from survey work that at least half of the people who be million people say that they want to work if they can have the right support we also know that work be the good tonic for many of the issue face by those who be inactive we know from university of cambridge study for instance that just eight hour week of pay work can reduce mental health issue in large portion of the population by up to what be more the conservative party do far too little to tackle the underlie dynamic of low work and no work face by so many people in poverty we know that the average family in poverty go through up to seven separate spell in poverty all too often it be like hotel california they can check out but they can never leave rather than try to deal with that problem all we get from the conservative party be stick plaster and political slogan be incredibly proud to sit on the labour benches and support government who will take different approach and be absolutely determined to make an actual difference and tackle the root cause we hear from the minister the action that will be take to give our young people choice through the youth guarantee between earn and learning real proper stable start in life we hear about the change we will make to the dwp to actually get it work we hear about the change that will actually tackle the barrier to work real practical step rather than the slogan of the conservative party we hear about the work on fraud and error so that our public money be spend on help people to get back to work rather than leak out of the system we hear about the effort that will be make to get people not just into job but into good job it be worth pause on that point for second the labour market have change lot in the past year it be no long give that all job provide ladder to good fulfilling family support work for too long the conservative party when it be in government ignore that it be such good news that through the good work lay out by the minister on the industrial strategy and through bring the career service together with jobcentre plus so that we have system that focus not just on get people into work but on help they get on we finally have government who be take the problem seriously our ambition be no less than to give people proper power over their own life as my hon friend the member for loughborough point out the conservative government so often just seek to demonise and sloganise we be try to put power back into people hand and give they the real power over their own life that only fulfil and decent work can offer as say start work in the new deal taskforce in the dwp predecessor department be lucky enough later on to work on similar issue in the prime minister strategy unit what characterise the administration then be real passion to change life and real passion to make thing well that have be so lacking for the past year and it be so refreshing to hear that it be back be absolutely proud to stand here and support the motion be pleased we be have this debate although be sorry that it be relatively short my concern about the proposal before we be that it recognise an overspend on the welfare cap support the idea that we should be allow to overshoot the cap but hardwire decision on welfare spending for the next five year it therefore restrict any future change to any element of welfare spending the cap do not include pension and work relate benefit what it do include in particular be disability living allowance housing benefit and personal independence payment those benefit relate to the area in which it seem to there be often the great level of poverty and people face the great problem in simply try to survive the government have already remove the winter fuel allowance which be include in the estimate for the next five year and be maintain the two child benefit cap which restrict the amount of money pay on benefit to family understand all the point the hon member for loughborough dr sandher make and the passion with which he make they but the reality of not remove this ridiculous cap put in place by the right hon member for chingford and woodford green sir iain duncan smith when he be secretary of state for work and pensions be that we have lot of child live in desperate poverty any member who go to food bank we all have food bank in our constituency and talk to the parent pick up food will find wholly disproportionate number of usually mother of child in very large family who can not make end meet because their benefit apply only to the first two child we need to get rid of the two child benefit cap but what we be be invite to support today will ensure that we keep it while maintain the removal of the winter fuel payment and box we in when it come to what we can do to improve both the take up and the availability of disability benefit as whole must therefore caution the minister and question her optimism recognise the need to overshoot the cap today because understand why it have come about but we need to look at the level of poverty in our society also understand all the point that have be make about the role of the department for work and pensions in relation to people seek work in be member of the bill committee that take sledgehammer to the then department of health and social security method of support people who be out of work and help they into work we have suffer ever since as result and be pleased that the dwp be reform its way of do thing and will help people into work by provide more advice and support the reality be however that many people in this country suffer because of the mental health crisis that we be in have suffer industrial injury or be live in great poverty and they need support surely we should be measure the level of poverty the increase level of child poverty and the educational underachievement of child live in poverty rather than say that the most important thing to do be limit the level of welfare spending there be reason for that meet many people in my constituency and in other place who be receive dwp benefit some be in work some be unemployed and some have sickness problem and can not work they be not shirker they be not skiver they be people who need help within our society for too long we have have culture of blame anyone who seek help within the law through our benefit system hope that we will hear reply from the government in which they accept the need for re examination of the level of poverty in society and demonstrate preparedness to change the welfare cap in the future to accommodate any increase need that result from it the thinking behind the cap be not about eliminate poverty from our society it be all about limit the level of welfare payment and the benefit that people gain from they in an intervention in the early debate point out to the chief secretary to the treasury that huge infrastructure project have go massively over budget and have be finance support the elizabeth line it be wonderful thing but it be way over budget like plenty of other project there seem to be one approach to investment in major infrastructure project that run way over budget and another when it come to welfare budget anything that might go over will be prevent from go over by the treasury we can not predict who will be injure next year what illness will come or what need will arise surely the principle of the welfare state must be that we help and support people when they need that help and support and yes help they to be available for work and get back into work and say to employer you need more flexible work arrangement so that people can work part time we must look at the level of unemployment among people with disability who simply can not get work because the employment law be not strong enough to require employer to provide work for people who despite have disability be well able to work think we should be more cautious rather than adopt gung ho approach and say we be crack down on welfare want to crack down on poverty want to crack down on unemployment and want to crack down on those who prevent people from achieve the good that they can in their life and in our society hope that the government will consider completely scrap this debate in future year because it have become farcical the right hon member for islington north jeremy corbyn will remember that the welfare cap be introduce because of the dutch auction that be go on in this chamber about who could be more brutal on the poor the welfare cap be part of that period of debate in which anyone claim benefit be allegedly welfare benefit scrounger who be not willing to work for living that be the atmosphere that be engender in this chamber at that stage to be frank it be deeply worrying in many way humanity almost leave the chamber the farcical nature of the debate be that have introduce the cap minister after minister would have to come back each year and report that the cap have be breach because more expenditure have be force on the government as result of the increase level of poverty suppose that it at least give member the opportunity to have some discretion over issue of poverty may suggest to those on the labour front bench that they should remove the cap because it have become farcical exercise if we be to have debate on poverty there should be an annual report by the labour government on the poverty strategy that they be now develop believe that the commission establish by the labour party be now work and it would be so much well if we have report and do not have the farcical pantomime that we have today thank the right hon gentleman for allow to intervene briefly to say that the child poverty taskforce work be ongoing and that it regularly engage with parliamentarian and other to update they know that many parliamentarian have be pleased to involve themselves in that work give the importance of tackle child poverty that be really helpful response but it do not respond to the fact that if we be to have focus on poverty rather than debate on the welfare cap which be breach on virtually an annual basis it might be well to have debate on the government strategy to tackle poverty overall then we could have proper discussion and even debate with motion that could be amend where we want to see improvement that be what want to get on to now hope that people have see today joseph rowntree foundation report on overall poverty which reflect what most of we know and experience in our constituency it be shatteringly depressing to be frank because it do not show any improvement over the last few decade the hon member for faversham and mid kent helen whately mention that the tory government introduce this measure when they come into power it be during the period of austerity and it be worth reflect on what that mean the london school of economics report and other independent report say that people lose their life as result of austerity other have estimate that the figure could be up to in part that be because of the grind poverty that be impose on people as reflect in all our constituency we see it remember time when there be no food bank in any of our constituency because they be not necessary but now they be as result of year of austerity if we be to have proper debate on poverty we need to highlight as individual constituency mps where we think the government should be go so will briefly do so on the basis of what we have see in the joseph rowntree foundation report always cite the overall figure we have million people live in poverty include million child think the joseph rowntree foundation report say that there be million people live in deep poverty and nearly million in destitution the statistic that always shock be that million child be in destitution never think we would use the word destitution again in our society always think we would improve year by year and lift people out of poverty never think that child would live in poverty in the way that some of my generation do there be group that clearly need to be on the agenda and my hon friend the minister have mention some of they thank goodness chair group of unpaid carer of whom there be million in this country if an unpaid carer be look after disabled member of their family it be almost inevitable that they will be live in poverty unless we face up to the central demand of unpaid carer which be to address their income it be not just about how much they can earn which the government have look at recently it be about the carer allowance be at such level that people can not survive on it look at the report with regard to family with child live in poverty can not at the moment see fast way of get child out of poverty than scrap the two child limit be hop that will be on the agenda as priority when the child poverty action group report to parliament the joseph rowntree foundation have identify that the poverty rate among disabled people be now the government be about to consult again on the work capability assessment reform because they lose in court to ellen clifford two week ago be pleased that the government lose in court to be frank the basis of that decision be the lack of consultation on the previous government reform do not understand why our government continue the appeal within the court but they do they have now lose and have be force to bring forward their consultation on the reform of the work capability assessment be hop that those reform will be do in co production with disabled people on the basis of the disability group principle nothing about we without we my fear be that an overhanging billion worth of saving be require from the dwp on this issue if that result in cut to individual benefit think there will be uproar within our community and across this house what be also interesting in the joseph rowntree foundation report be that the poverty rate among people who be suffer long term health condition be the work that the department of health will now do in walk in advice surgery for example and the focus on mental health will be key the household benefit cap overall be iniquitous it force family into poverty particularly in place such as london because of the high rent that be hit people accord to the joseph rowntree report the poverty rate among renter in social housing be and in the private rent sector it be the government refusal to accept the amendment to introduce rent control which be table by number of labour members be extremely disappointing the government could at least devolve that power to the individual mayors so that they can represent their community and introduce rent control where necessary believe that sadiq khan have express his support for that power to be devolve with rent control we could tackle the housing crisis that we face within our constituency when we talk about poverty we need to come forward with an agenda that will tackle it at pace and do not think that in our discussion in the future welfare benefit cap in any form will assist in bring forward the reform that our constituent so desperately need agree with number of the comment that have be make across the house today find myself nod along with the right hon member for hayes and harlington john mcdonnell there and particularly with the right hon member for islington north jeremy corbyn just want to highlight couple of thing before get into the meat of my speech we know that of universal credit claimant be in work so be glad that the government be talk about how to make work pay and how to get more people into work be glad that the government be invest in strategy that will get young people into work and that will get people who have be long term unemployed or even short term unemployed back into work be glad that they be reform jobcentre so that they will be assist people in way that they maybe have not be do in recent time be pleased about all of that but we need to recognise that of those on universal credit be already work it be just that their work be not pay enough or be not offer flexible enough hour if they have childcare or other caring commitment and therefore they need that top up the welfare cap cover not only benefit and other element of social security provide to people who be out of work but child benefit and huge number of different thing it be not entirely focused on people who be out of work although appreciate the government action on that the right hon member for islington north talk about how the welfare cap be bit backwards everyone would be jump up and down say that backwards if we say we be go to put cap on the number of people who can receive chemotherapy and on the amount spend on it because we be go to reduce the rate of smoking obesity and other risk factor we be go to have healthy population so it be okay for we to cap chemotherapy we be go to put all this stuff in place to ensure that we reduce the spend on chemotherapy we should first spend the money and solve the problem and then the spend will reduce that be the whole point about the welfare cap it be backwards by have welfare cap the government be say that they will reduce the spend on welfare by do all the thing that they be not yet do they have not solve the problem once they have solve the problem and once the welfare system have improve in the way they be try to improve it the number and the spend will reduce be however not entirely convinced that everything the government be put in place will reduce the spend because they be battle against number of factor even if they manage to get job to pay well even if they far increase the minimum wage so it be close to living wage even if they ensure there be more opportunity and even if the chancellor opportunity for growth actually exist and create many more job there will still be significant number of people whom the system be not set up to support have deal with people in my constituency surgery who be be support by third sector organisation which be be hammer by the national insurance change and will not be able to provide the support they have be provide have deal with individual who be six month away from have the consistency in their life to be able to get up at every morning my concern be that all government be not specifically blame the labour government look for quick win they look for the low hang fruit where can we try to improve thing so that people who be pretty close to work anyway who be not that far out who have pretty stable life and who do not have an incredibly chaotic lifestyle can access work we will be let down those people who have chaotic lifestyle and who be so far away from be able to get into pay work particularly full time pay work if we reduce the amount of disability benefit they can claim or reduce the amount of support they can receive when they be year away from have the stability to be able to access work the social security safety net be not safety net unless it provide support to people who absolutely can not work right now and who will need or month or two year of intensive support to get to position where they can achieve part time work do not think that support be in place and do not think any government have provide enough support to ensure that people be not leave on the scrapheap we talk about label people and we use to have that awful acronym people who be not in education employment or training and thank goodness we have move away from that the hon lady be talk about programme and the programme we have in northern ireland under the european social fund and the uk share prosperity fund be now be withdraw from those community those organisation be crucial in help people who be far from employment get into gainful work it take time to build up young people confidence in society so that they see the value of work agree with the hon lady that the problem require long term plan but the government be look for short term plan it be absolutely about long term planning that be why we be make the case that we can not have welfare cap and that thing be be do backwards we should put in place all the support that the government be promise and more to get people to the position where they can get into work the welfare cap be an unfortunate hurdle particularly as it bake in some of the cut that have be make such as the winter fuel payment it seem that there will not be an increase in the level of paternity pay it would be nice to see an increase in paternity pay level and in the number of man take up paternity leave on young people not in education employment or training phrase that be use early when somebody say neet it would be great if young people have more chance and choice finally on issue relate to specific geographical location the minister mention blackpool hon member would not expect as the hon member for aberdeen north to avoid talk about the importance for aberdeen of have just transition mention do thing backwards the minister need to ensure we build up renewable energy job before we knock down the job in fossil fuel be concerned that the government be fail to do that in the right order and that we will have gap where people will become unemployed because of the uk government action thank the secretary of state for all the work on these important issue be aware that we be close to the end of the debate so will raise just one issue small business owner in my constituency of chipping barnet in north london tell about the way the jobcentre fail to support people into work when the previous government be in charge it be encouraging to see what be come forward in the white paper but the small business owner whose name be simon tell how he have advertise some job in his company he and his team spend seven hour go through lot of issue with applicant all of whom be refer by the jobcentre but none of whom have any desire to take up the job they be apply because they be be force to do so by the work coach in the jobcentre in those minute appointment be happy that the government have set out proposal in the white paper there will be more to come soon in the green paper to help people who want to work to find job that be right for they and to help employer to get good match to improve productivity and growth in this country thank every member who contribute to the debate my hon friend the member for loughborough dr sandher for hendon david pinto duschinsky and for chipping barnet dan tomlinson the hon member for st albans daisy cooper and for aberdeen north kirsty blackman and the right hon member for hayes and harlington john mcdonnell all make important contribution all of we have point out that our social security system should be safety net and springboard and should help people be and do all the thing they might wish however when we look at what we have inherit it be mess and it do not serve the purpose it be suppose to serve that present crisis for this country because each and every one of we know that one day it could be we that get sick and need help and that one day hopefully we will receive state pension we need the social security system to do its job we be not in good place but we will move on we be all impatient to get the change we need we have already set out plan that be be discuss we need big fundamental reform because the scale of the challenge be huge there be an billion breach this year the obr see the breach come for over month but the previous government do absolutely nothing to prevent it that be not number that you get because of one or two one and half hour have elapse since the commencement of proceeding on the motion the deputy speaker put the question order this day question agree to resolve that pursuant to the charter for budget responsibility autumn update which be approve by this house on february under section of the budget responsibility and national audit act this house agree that the forecast breach of the welfare cap in due to high forecast expenditure on universal credit and disability benefit be justify and that no further debate will be require in relation to this specific breach welfare cap resolved that the level of the welfare cap as specify in the autumn budget which be lay before this house on october be mcgovern business without debate delegated legislation motion make and question put forthwith standing order no defence that the draft armed forces court martial amendment no rules which be lay before this house on december be jones question agree to badminton road bridge motion make and question propose that this house do now jones want to start by set the scene the overbridge form part of key route from my constituency into bristol it be erect in when the be build and be post tensione concrete bridge that is it have high strength steel tendon in duct within concrete to which tension be apply after the concrete set before they be anchor in concrete and the duct fill in with grout will come back to the problem of such bridge later but for now the key point to note be that it usually take around vehicle day over the motorway to the wick wick roundabout where driver can continue on the into bristol or take the ring road say usually because in june national highways close the bridge have give hour notice to south gloucestershire council of which be leader at the time in december after six month of investigation national highways announce that the bridge would have to be replace and could not reopen in the meantime and that the work would take between two and three year backdate to june at one point an end date of be mention but that have now become the spring of the closure be have massive impact on local resident the official diversion be long so many of the vehicle be end up on local country lane such as henfield road ram hill and down road even part of the official diversion route be only road the council have put in extensive measure to improve traffic flow but road be take load that they be never design to take that be result in long queue resident be unable to get out of their property safely or at all and more pothole and the edge of road break up heavy good vehicle be use road with weight limit and there be no enforcement to stop they henfield road and ram hill be in quiet lane scheme where walker cyclist horse rider and driver be suppose to share the road respectfully but that be not happen the situation have also exacerbate flooding on henfield road and high level of traffic be push water on to people property that have leave villager feel cut off especially when flooding have take other route out of action far when the bridge be demolish which we be tell be due to happen in march pedestrian and cyclist will also be force to divert above all people question the length of time that it be take to replace the bridge one write for the past month we have have just one route to exit yate to reach the city centre which have be plague by continuous temporary traffic light often two set on bristol road why be it take so long another say when the bridge be eventually replace it likely to be the good part of year to fix the issue this be an utter embarrassment and quite frankly an absolute disgrace the inconvenience this be cause to business commuter and homeowner to name but few be immeasurable those responsible for this debacle should hang their head in shame the closure have leave the usually busy stretch of badminton road between coalpit heath and the bridge practically deserted which have have huge impact on local business kevin at the bigger eater burger van have be trade in that lay by for year he provide great service to local people during the pandemic but the loss of pass trade because of the closure could be the final straw there be also kebab van in the lay by in the evening viaduct café have lose of its turnover since the bridge close result in its lose half of its staff the premise where it be locate have lose two business tenant pm auto which service car and have an agreement to take vehicle for their mot to garage in downend on the other side of the closure have to take round about route that add significantly to the time take and cut into their taking the golden heart pub have lose the pass trade of people decide to stop for meal on their way home from work heritage sheds and fencing have complain that potential customer be not sure whether it be still open again it be lose trade the impact on the local economy do not seem to be fully recognise this be not something that business can reasonably insure against yet when write to the minister be tell simply that there be no right to pass trade in the same way that viable business need help to see they through covid these business need support to ensure that they survive this closure although the bridge be the responsibility of national highways it have fall to south gloucestershire council to deal with the impact that have describe on the local road network wish to put on record my thank to the many officer involve for their effort in respond to such an unexpected event after initial monitoring they put in place temporary measure include traffic light road closure and temporary signage and when it be confirm that the road would remain closed for two to three year they review the exist measure and implement more although some be fund by national highways other be deem to be an exist the fact that the closure be exacerbate those exist problem or too far away to be relate to the bridge despite the fact that close such major route have ripple effect across the local road network unfortunately the measure that the council put in place be not enough for example to stop the hgv use unsuitable road because any physical measure that stop lorry also stop bus and the police do not have the resource to enforce the restriction for long term issue such as this it be vital that the police have the resource to manage it also highlight the impact on other council service carer waste lorry and so on all have to take long route the council have be deal with extensive communication from the public and liaise with national highways the police and bus operator which have be significant drain on resource in itself one thing that be determined to do when become leader of south gloucestershire council be improve communication with our resident in the case of the bridge closure that mean do video update in which we put resident question to national highways officer at the beginning it feel that get information out of national highways to share with the public would be challenge but be pleased to say that it get on board with the update so much so that understand it be consider roll they out elsewhere in the country not only have the video update continue with my successor but national highways have attend public engagement session alongside councillor and council officer although communication can not remove all the frustration and disruption it be vital that people know what be go on and can get answer to their question why be bring what could appear to be hyper local issue to the house believe that there be significant wide risk national highways manage tensione concrete bridge on the strategic road network in the south west alone and nationwide in addition there be an estimate that be the responsibility of local highway authority of those research by the rac foundation in report that whopping require intrusive inspection that could cost cs management of post tensione concrete bridge document be sure we be all familiar with say in its introduction that tendon can be vulnerable to corrosion and severe deterioration where internal grouting of tendon duct be incomplete and moist air water and contaminant can enter the ducting system it go on to say that construction practice and lack of maintenance be the key factor affect deterioration in the case of the bridge worker discover when they drill through to the tendon that the grouting be missing cs also explain that the problem with post tensioned concrete bridge be that safety critical defect in post tensioned concrete be typically hide very difficult to detect and may result in brittle mode of failure unfortunately visual inspection alone will not give warning of imminent collapse and intrusive investigation can be expensive and potentially damaging if problem be identify these bridge have to be remove very carefully as the tendon be under tension if we think about what happen when we release taut elastic band we can see why that would be dangerous with many bridge have be build during the height of motorway building in the and it be entirely possible that this sort of major disruption be come to many other community across the country come now to my ask of the minister give the high level of disruption and the local dismay about the length of time the work be take will the minister work with national highways to try to bring forward the reopening of the road turn to the wide issue what reassurance can the public have that all the thousand of post tension concrete bridge in the uk be safe what be the plan to ensure that that be the case and have it be review in the month since this bridge be discover to be fail how will lesson be learn from this experience to reduce the time need to replace other bridge that be identify as fail will the minister review how resident and business be support and compensate when national highway inflict significant disruption on they for an extended period will he also look at how the local highway authority be help to manage its road network when impact by national highways closure and at how the police be resource to help it to do that will he review how the assessment be make of which measure should fall within the cost ascribe to national highways whether an exist problem be be worsen by the closure and how widely the impact be recognise so that local highway authority be not leave with huge bill will the minister consider the approach take to communication in this case and work with national highways so that initiative such as the video update be roll out to other incident to ensure timely communication with the public have previously speak in this house about the financial challenge face local authority in simply try to maintain basic infrastructure even without additional problem such as this road closure will the minister commit to give south gloucestershire council the money that it need to restore the damage road when the bridge have reopen welcome the debate of my constituency neighbour the hon member for thornbury and yate claire young although would have appreciate some notification of the debate give that the bridge also sit within my constituency and impact my resident every single day in exactly the same way as it do hers completely agree with the challenge that have be describe delay in get home to work or to doctor appointment be very real challenge as the leader of the council at the time the big challenge with the bridge be discover when national highways think that it need to intervene to close the bridge because thing have get to that stage the hon lady have deep insight into those challenge welcome the work that she and other include ian boulton who be co leader of the council at the time have do alongside council officer to mitigate the impact of the bridge closure work closely with they and get regular update for which be very grateful as constituency mp that close relationship between the council and mps be what our constituent want they want we to work together with council leader in south gloucestershire and be fully committed to that although there be delay and we wish the bridge could be open soon echo that desire understand that national highways have bring about this work as quickly as it could we seek to communicate that to resident know that do as an mp so that they know the hard and fast work be do national highways recognise the importance of this bridge as an artery across and between our community for people to get to work and see family member my hon friend the member for north somerset sadik al hassan who be sit beside know the situation well he have live just on the other side of the bridge for long time he can attest to the delay and the challenge that the situation be cause hard work family and individual across our community lot of local people recognise not only the challenge but the ambition be lead by the council alongside national highways to ensure that the new bridge can serve our community in the way that it need to in the long term that be positive the consultation work do over long while on way to bring in active travel measure and offer more opportunity will serve our community well in the long term hear and echo the challenge that have be describe which my resident and share and understand but be optimistic about the long term future of the bridge hope that it can be an example of the good type of bridge that we want to see elsewhere across our country will leave it there for now want to share those additional and important factor as well as the view of local people on my side of the bridge it be pleasure to respond to the important point raise by the hon member for thornbury and yate claire young and by my hon friend the member for filton and bradley stoke claire hazelgrove thank the hon member for thornbury and yate for secure the debate on such an important matter the replacement of the badminton road overbridge safety on our road be of the upmost importance which be why the government have announce that we intend to publish new road safety strategy the first in over decade work be already underway on that the maintenance and renewal of vital structure on our road be also of the utmost importance and contribute to the safety of everyone who use the strategic road network note from the hon member effort to secure debate on this subject that she be indeed strong advocate for her constituent business and road user as be my hon friend the member for filton and bradley stoke and she have be campaign extensively to see improvement and to see how quickly this vital structure over the can be replace with minimal impact on local people and business and to protect the safety of everyone who use it our strategic road network be the backbone of our country economy with mile of motorway and major road it connect people build community create opportunity and help the country to thrive although it make up only of england overall road network it be the most heavily used and carry third of all traffic and two third of all freight investment in our strategic road network be make through the road investment strategy process which be focus on create road network that be safe accessible and reliable for all road user and which address its impact on those who use it and live near it we be commit to put road transport at the heart of our mission drive government transform infrastructure so that it work for the whole country unlock growth promote social mobility and tackle regional inequality the hon member for thornbury and yate may be aware that locally manage road make up of the road network and that almost every journey start and end on local road we understand how critical it be to keep the local road network function as this promote growth locally and nationally and have daily impact on the life of million of people where these local road interact with the strategic road network we aim to ensure that that be seamless and there be minimal impact on local people and business while recognise safety need the overbridge have be close since july follow detailed structural survey conduct by national highways the survey identify accelerate deterioration and crack on the underside of the bridge as the hon member will understand the safety of all road user be paramount and decision be make to close the bridge to traffic while maintain access for cyclist and pedestrian understand the concern that the hon member may have due to the length of the closure but want to highlight that this be complex scheme that have involve numerous specialist include utility provider in preparation for the demolition to begin the demolition be plan for march this year with new bridge plan to open for motorist early next year the hon member call for the work to be expedite and can assure she that national highways have already work hard to accelerate many of the activity that support the replacement to ensure that the bridge be available for the community as soon as possible indeed have be talk to national highways and understand that normally project of this scale would take about five year whereas the period for this project be three year my department will continue to engage readily with national highways as the project progress be sure that the hon member will understand that national highways have no intention of inconvenience road user but it accept that due to the nature of this type of work and especially when road closure be necessary some level of disruption be unavoidable understand the concern that there will be period when no crossing of any kind be possible over the on badminton road as mention the hon member be strong champion for local business in her constituency and have call for compensation due to the impact of traffic diversion national highways provide compensation as require by legislation across its project and scheme the compensation arrangement generally cover permanent adverse impact and the generally hold principle be that the public purse do not compensate business for loss of earning due to temporary road work national highways have work with south gloucestershire council on funding and implement the traffic management it require on its network mitigation provide include significant volume of static signing variable electronic message sign and temporary traffic signal the diversion route use during the closure have be agree with the council and be the optimum route available the council will have consider the impact of the reassigned traffic its implication and the limited alternative available on its network none the less understand the hon member view on the impact that increase traffic may have on local road that be not design for heavy traffic volume however the strategic and local road network use each other when diversion opportunity be for mutual benefit assure the hon member that national highways will continue to work with south gloucestershire council to ensure that work be complete efficiently and to mitigate as much as be practically possible the disruption cause by the closure of the bridge that include work with south gloucestershire council to refine the traffic management arrangement on local road want to take this opportunity to affirm that national highways have robust inspection regime ensure the delivery of safe and reliable motorway and trunk road network in england it have programme of structural inspection investigation and assessment to ensure that potentially vulnerable structure be identify that safeguard measure be adopt and that maintenance work be program and prioritise national highways inspect all its bridge and other structure in line with the publish guidance in the design manual for road and bridge that include general visual inspection every two year and more detailed principal inspection every six year which identify and record defect in reinforce concrete steelwork and other construction material where necessary further investigation which may include material test be undertake to establish the extent severity and specific cause of the defect if maintenance work be require they be prioritise and the necessary repair be carry out to ensure that the structure remain safe and fit for purpose national highways apply any lesson learn on challenging project across the organisation as standard practice however it be worth mention that inspection be base on standard set out in the design manual for road and bridge protect the safety of all road user will always be priority of this government road safety be shared responsibility and it be important that we all recognise the part we can play as it can not be achieve in isolation disruption will occur when action must be take to address safety issue on the network but we also acknowledge that maintenance of our road ultimately benefit the whole community thank the hon member for thornbury and yate once again not only for secure the debate but for the important point she have raise and for her campaign on behalf of her constituent also thank my hon friend the
