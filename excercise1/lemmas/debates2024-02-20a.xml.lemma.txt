prison need to be see as deterrent but if inmate be have it easy with designer wear and no consequence how be that deterrent may ask the secretary of state what be be do to address this and to make prison the deterrent that it should be know that the whole house will want to send its deep sympathy to zoey mcgill follow the shocking murder of her son in it be dreadful crime of which man be

and the crown prosecution service for consideration of further charge last year be grateful for the government support for my private member bill to limit friday release for vulnerable prisoner it be an important measure and be now an act but it be only one of the measure that we should be take to reduce reoffende and help people get back on their foot when they leave prison the excellent charity switchback have suggest that at the very minimum people should be leave prison with access to id and an internet enable mobile phone just to get their life in order so that they can access universal credit and other service what consideration have my right hon and learn friend give to those suggestion pay tribute to my hon friend for his excellent work in successfully champion the limit on friday prison release the change for which he call come into force last november and be exceptionally helpful and he deserve great credit for that he be also right to point to the brilliant work of switchback which have support our resettlement work that work include the roll out of week guarantee accommodation and the introduction of resettlement passport which contain precisely the basic information to which my hon friend refer such as prisoner name date of birth national insurance number and release date they help prisoner to access essential service such as housing and healthcare and contribute to the driving down of reoffending which as be recognise by the hon member for york central rachael maskell be significantly low than it be in the wife of remand prisoner at wormwood scrubs write to recently to say that the prison be so cold that prisoner be shake that they have to choose between work social time and showering and that the food be lack in basic nutrition can explore these matter with the prisons minister in couple of week time during our joint visit to the scrubs but do the secretary of state agree that such condition be not conducive to rehabilitation this be an important point we do deprive people of liberty and sometimes we have to do so in the case of those on remand but the condition must be safe decent and humane austere yes but humane as well commend the hon gentleman for go to see the scrubs with the prisons minister my right hon friend the member for charnwood edward argar and shall be very interested to hear his view thereafter call shadow minister ruth cadbury we need to tackle the revolving door of reoffende in our justice system yet the reoffende rate as proportion of those leave prison continue to rise whatever the secretary of state may say have hear time and again that the lack of secure housing adequate and appropriate healthcare education job training and job support mean that prisoner be be leave to fail after they be release it be the victim of crime who suffer when ex prisoner reoffend can the secretary of state announce when the government expect the reoffende rate to go down it be important to note that reoffende be down compare with under the last labour government the hon lady shake her head but one can dispute opinion in this house but not fact the reoffende rate in be around it be now that mean few people fall victim to crime the hon lady refer to accommodation and she be right to do so what she do not advert to be this government decision to provide week guarantee accommodation which do not happen under labour government when go to luton and dunstable speak to probation officer who have do the job for year and do you know what he say it be the single most effective measure to drive down reoffende who do that not the labour party but we dangerous offender increase sentences what step he be take to increase sentence for dangerous offender measure in the sentencing bill will ensure that those who commit the bad crime will receive the most severe punishment the bill create duty for the court to impose whole life order for murder currently subject to whole life order start point and for those that involve sexual or sadistic conduct unless there be exceptional circumstance the bill will also ensure that convict rapist must serve of their custodial term in prison follow by licence period thank the minister for his answer and welcome those measure the two bad case have have to deal with as an mp be where woman be brutally murder by partner or ex partner what be the government go to do in response to the clare wade review to increase sentence for people who commit those awful vile offence my hon friend be quite right to raise the issue of domestic homicide we be determined to act to protect the victim of domestic abuse and ensure that the appropriate punishment be in place for perpetrator that be why follow clare wade kc review we be increase sentence by introduce statutory aggravating factor for murder that be precede by control or coercive behaviour involve overkill or be connect with the end of relationship do the minister agree that wide society confidence in the judicial system be often determine by how dangerous offender be treat do he agree that it be vital that we get the message out there both to wide society and to potential offender that there be the ultimate price to pay which be long sentence in prison for criminal offence such as these thank the hon gentleman for his question agree with those sentiment entirely public bodies legal duty of candour with reference to his oral statement of december on hillsborough bishop james jones report column if he will bring forward legislative proposal to introduce legal duty of candour on public body in his excellent report the patronising disposition of unaccountable power bishop james jones call for the creation of the hillsborough charter for bereaved family as well as for the imposition of duty of candour on police officer we agree wholeheartedly which be why the government have sign the charter alongside the crown prosecution service the national police chiefs council and other and impose duty of candour on the police we be also legislate to create strong permanent and independent public advocate to speak up for victim and their family and to rigorously hold signatory to the charter to account we stand ready to discuss what further step may be necessary the parent of zane gbangbola be in the public gallery today zane be just seven when he die follow flood year ago this month the fire brigade detect hydrogen cyanide multiple time his parent kye and nicole have be fight for the truth about their son death ever since and duty of candour would have help they to get it in lieu of that will the government establish an independent panel inquiry with full disclosure so that all the evidence can be review by expert we can finally get the truth about what happen to an innocent seven year old boy and justice can be do be grateful to the hon gentleman for raise this deeply upsetting case and know the whole house will be think of kye and nicole as they continue to mourn the loss of zane the hon gentleman raise critically important case may suggest that he and discuss it and see what further step can properly be take in this difficult case call shadow minister kevin brennan welcome the meeting that the secretary of state have just offer the problem with the government response be that it ought to be centre on the experience of family not on the convenience of state bureaucracy in order to ensure that they be never repeat there be nothing in what we have see so far from the government that go as far as we and more importantly the family believe be necessary to require public authority to act with candour and transparency why be the secretary of state persist with piecemeal approach instead of commit to clear compelling and comprehensive duty of candour as propose in the hillsborough law as say the recommendation of bishop james jones report which we have consider extremely carefully contain the charter for bereaved family and it be worth reflect on what paragraph of the report say it require the public body to approach form of public scrutiny include public inquiry and inquest with candour in an open honest and transparent way make full disclosure of relevant document material and fact take together with the power that exist under the inquiries act there be potentially criminal culpability misconduct in public office and pervert the course of justice but of course we will keep this under review we want to make sure that public body do what they should that is act transparently and we will always consider what further step can be take horizon system exoneration of sub postmaster what step he be take to exonerate sub postmaster who be prosecute due to error in the post office horizon system what step he be take with cabinet colleague to exonerate sub postmaster who be convict due to error in the post office horizon system what step he be take with cabinet colleague to exonerate sub postmaster who be convict due to error in the post office horizon system in september public inquiry be set up into the failing associate with the post office horizon it system and it be expect to report back later this year in addition over million have already be pay out in compensation across three scheme however in its december letter the independent horizon compensation advisory board express concern that the pace of exoneration be too slow not least because evidence have be lose and many be simply too traumatised to come forward that be why the prime minister have decide to bring forward legislation to quash the relevant conviction and the department for business and trade will be announce detail shortly these wholly exceptional circumstance have lead to this wholly exceptional course while welcome the government commitment to quash the wrongful conviction of sub postmaster catch up in the horizon scandal also recognise that this be complex area of law that could even raise constitutional issue give that some sub postmaster have be suffer for an extremely long time do my right hon and learn friend agree that any legislation should deal with these issue swiftly and avoid any further delay thank my hon friend for the careful and thoughtful way in which he address this significant issue the judiciary and court have deal swiftly with the case before they but the scale and circumstance of the prosecution failure mean that this demand an unprecedented response and that be why the prime minister announce this major step forward in response to the horizon scandal we be keen to ensure that the legislation achieve its goal of bring prompt justice to all those who be wrongfully convict follow by rapid financial redress it be not right that wholly innocent people could potentially go to their graf with the mark and stigma of conviction hang over they every day we hear further revelation about the post office and today shocking well it should be shocking bbc story state that the swift review note that the post office have always know about the balance transaction capability of horizon and that the government know in that deloitte investigation into all horizon transaction be under way and that this investigation be suddenly halt after sub postmaster begin legal action will the secretary of state confirm whether the ministry of justice be aware of this and do he believe that that apparent non disclosure to the inquiry be threat to judicial freedom and independence in come up to four year ago now an independent inquiry be set up under mr justice wyn williams that be expect to report later this year and it will go into properly exhaustive detail about who know what and when we be absolutely clear that there have be an egregious failure of prosecution conduct frankly one that bring shame on those involve and it be absolutely right that that inquiry should get to the bottom of what take place and who know what and when the current chief executive of the post office say in evidence to the business and trade committee last month that despite various audits and investigation we still do not know the full scope of the money overclaime through horizon or where it go even the auditor be unable to give firm figure postmaster such as my constituent roger have suffer incredible stress and worry as well as significant financial loss but the prospect of get to the truth on these figure still seem far off will the secretary of state commit to work with the secretary of state for business and trade and set out timetable for update the house on how much the post office take and what it do with the money so that constituent like mine can start to get the answer and the justice that they deserve my heart go out to roger and people like he have constituent who be affect as be sure everyone in this house do we be fair minded nation which be why it strike we to the core the hon lady ask to liaise with the department for business and trade of course the moj will do everything it properly can but dbt be lead on this it be also worth reflect that million have already be pay out across the three scheme and there be very important swift and robust approach of pay to those who have their conviction quash that be the right approach it be exceptional but these be exceptional circumstance call the chair of the justice committee my right hon and learn friend will know that only last week the court of appeal criminal division preside over by the lady chief justice quash in bulk number of horizon appeal on the basis of half hour hearing when the case get to court the court can deal with they swiftly do my right hon and learn friend agree that in frame any legislation because of the constitutional implication it be important that we bear in mind that the failure be the failure of prosecutor to do their duty or perhaps the failure of the state to come to the aid of victim but they be not the failure of the court which always act entirely properly on the material put before they by the party at the time it be failure of the party not of the court as always my hon friend get to the heart of it this be failure of the post office which be an emanation of the state and it be the duty of the state to put it right the court have approach this entirely properly the post office fail to discharge the solemn obligation on any prosecutor to act fairly and to comply with their obligation under section of the criminal procedure and investigations act to disclose material that might reasonably be consider capable of undermine the case of the prosecution or of assist the case of the defence when be prosecute the first rule be that we do not seek conviction at all cost which be an important principle that the post office fail to appreciate call the snp spokesperson whistleblower have come forward to provide information that fujitsu be give an additional contract by the post office in to re platform transaction datum that be previously hold on an external storage system that be consider to be the gold standard it be replace by system that make it virtually impossible to investigate financial transaction in forensic audit do the justice secretary share our concern that this decision effectively destroy evidence prevent exactly the sort of audit trail that would exonerate those sub postmaster who be convict the department for business and trade be well place to answer those specific point but would say two thing first as matter of sacred principle if material come into prosecutor possession that might be consider capable of undermine the case of the prosecution that material should be disclose to the defence that be one of the thing that have be consider by sir wyn williams inquiry what do the post office know when do it know it and what do it do with the material before it across the house we want to get to the bottom of those question community payback pilots what assessment he have make of the effectiveness of the rapid deployment community payback pilot it be pleasure to respond to my first question from the hon gentleman since his election as part of the government antisocial behaviour action plan community payback team be work in partnership with local authority to rapidly clean up antisocial behaviour in the community the pilot start in july and we be in the process of analyse the outcome initial observation point to the pilot have be successful with thousand of hour of reparative work be do by hundred of people on probation within hour of local authority notification allow the public to see justice do these rapid deployment community payback scheme pilot be suppose to pave the way for the accelerated roll out of exactly the kind of swift transparent restorative justice that victim of crime in my constituency be desperate to see unfortunately understand that of plan hour of work only hour have be deliver by the pilot can the minister reveal whether that be the case if so what can be learn from the clear barrier to success be grateful to the hon gentleman but the clue be in the word pilot these pilot be carry out in area over three month in the run up to christmas and people complete around hour of unpaid work we be analyse the outcome of those pilot and base on what that analysis say look forward to explore how we can roll this out more widely across the country time spend in cells reoffende rates what assessment he have make of the potential impact of the length of time that prisoner spend in their cell on reoffende rate what assessment he have make of the potential impact of the length of time that prisoner spend in their cell on reoffende rate we know that activity such as education and training can help to give prisoner skill that they need to get job on release thus reduce the likelihood of reoffende that be why we launch our new national regime model for prisoner last month it set out core expectation for regime delivery so that prison be get the most out of the work day and aid the rehabilitation of prisoner of course we be also see improve staffing number to facilitate those regime reoffende cost billion year but there be not just the financial cost but the impact on society in general as well as on the individual some young prisoner be still get only one hour out of their cell so there be no time for rehabilitation they can perhaps do little exercise but that be not the same how confident be the minister that all young prisoner will get the re education that he have outline when do he think all young prisoner if these people have to be in prison will get proper rehabilitation and the support they need when they come out of prison to get home to have somewhere to stay and to go into further training will he please give some reassurance that well time be come not just for young offender but for society as whole be grateful to the hon lady for that as she know have huge amount of respect for she and she raise hugely important point we have hear from the lord chancellor that reoffende rate have come down from to since so we be make progress but we want to drive they down far she also rightly highlight the importance of purposeful activity lead to the opportunity on release for employment accommodation and so on that be central to the opportunity for prisoner to rehabilitate themselves we have see significant progress make in our youth estate the hon lady talk about young prisoner and rightly say that we need to go far but we believe the national regime model that we launch in january will go long way to do that the additional staff we have recruit into his majesty prison and probation service be central to do that as they enable that regime to be put in place however she be absolutely right to highlight this issue welcome the minister acknow ledgement that more education in prison mean cut the reoffende rate and that clear link to crime welcome the national regime model and will be interested to see how it play out because have see chronic staff shortage and sickness absence in particular at prison such as hmp wandsworth which have visit those thing mean that prisoner be entirely miss out on any education training and working opportunity when will be able to go back to hmp wandsworth and see the increase in staff and retention that be need there when will the government get grip on the prison officer recruitment and retention crisis again have lot of respect for the hon lady but be afraid that what she be suggest do not entirely reflect the fact if we compare the figure for and for band to prison officer we see that there be over more now which be an increase of in hmpps sick rate be down in the past year when just over people join and leave again that reflect an increase we be invest in our prison officer and increase their number and that be be reflect in retention pay tribute to they for the work they do we should be talk they up not down be encourage by my right hon friend comment about the number of additional prison officer recruit have see many of they and the fantastic work they do both at hmp aylesbury and across the prison estate will he say little more about how we can ensure that we retain they once they have be train and they go on to the wing this be an incredibly important career it be key to reduce reoffende and prison officer deserve credit and the support of everybody in this house be grateful to my hon friend for that he be absolutely right about the importance of not just recruit new prison officer but retain experienced one in our prison that be why the pay deal do last year with hmpps staff be hugely important in recognise the important work that prison officer do day in day out it be also reflect in the fact that the leave rate for prison officer be down in from where it be in however there be more to do and we will continue to do it call the shadow justice secretary prisoner be spend up to hour day lock up in their cell as direct result of overcrowding and the prison capacity crisis cause by this government however hear congratulation be in order follow an announcement last month not on the government actually deliver any of the new prison they have promise or on even get spade in the ground but on their submit yet another planning application for the leicestershire prison that the secretary of state for levelling up housing and communities have already rule on once be not about time that the minister rename the new prison programme the no prison programme for moment think the shadow justice secretary be refer to her own party record when in prison place in three titan prison that fail to be build whereas we be commit to build six new modern prison two have be build one be be build at the moment and two have planning permission while prisoner be serve their sentence they be not be allow to leave their cell but ironically the government be also release some of they early despite multitude of letter question and even point blank request from the justice committee the government be refuse to tell we how many prisoner be be release early and from where the public and parliament have right to know so will the minister finally come clean on how the early release scheme have be use so far if not can he tell the house what he have to hide as the shadow justice secretary will know my right hon and learn friend the lord chancellor have make clear that in line with other statistic for example death in custody statistic we will publish those figure on an annual basis be sure my right hon friend will agree with that the rehabilitation of offender can be greatly assist by activity and work outdoors in particular on farm and at horticultural establishment will the minister reassure that he be committed to increase the quantity of work available outdoors and let know what have happen to the prison estate in recent year my hon friend be right to highlight the importance of range of purposeful activity for those in prison from skilled industrial work in workshop to outside work good example mention recently on itv racing of all thing be about get farrier and those work in the equine world into prison the example be prison in solihull to teach prisoner about job opportunity in the equine world there be range of opportunity out there and it be important that they be available to those in our custody crown court backlog what progress his department have make on reduce the backlog of case in the crown court we remain committed to reduce the crown court outstanding case load and have introduce range of measure to achieve the same we fund over sitting day last year and plan to deliver the same again this year we have recruit over judge over all jurisdiction and plan to do the same again this year thank to the intervention of the lord chancellor we have secure million for essential modernisation repair work over the next two year as well as retain nightingale court the investment will also see new courtroom the fact be that the crown court how have backlog of over case if that be not bad enough expert say the court capacity to deal with processing case will not keep pace with demand do the minister agree that that lead to too many victim unfortunately give up on our justice system no do not accept that that mean we be give up on the system the government continue to invest in every single lever that we can pull to increase capacity in our criminal justice system give the additional work that the judiciary be do the disposal rate in our crown court be up and we be see record level of disposal so we will start to see the criminal justice system heal because we be still recover from covid and the criminal bar association strike call the shadow minister rape and serious sexual assault case have increase to of all crown court case and with nearly of they they make up one in seven of the backlog the average wait time for trial after charge have rise to month we also know from the criminal bar association that there have be tenfold increase in adjourn case due to the fall in the number of rape and serious sexual offence prosecution or defence barrister with the crown prosecution service now employ king counsel to fill the gap add to that the many legal aid desert due to the shortage of solicitor and we have major staffing crisis across the criminal justice system how be that go to be fix first the figure that the hon gentleman quote for the average time for rasso case be simply not true the government have continue to invest in ensure that rasso case be bring forward list be matter for the judiciary and they take great care to ensure that vulnerable victim be deal with expeditiously in addition we continue to invest in the legal aid system the lord chancellor recently increase the fee to ensure that there be people able to perform rasso case and section video recording on top of that we continue to engage with the criminal legal aid review to see how we can continue to invest in and incentivise criminal defence barrister in the right part of the system victim of crime support what step his department be take through the criminal justice system to support victim of crime since we have ramp up support for victim in three main way first we have drive down reoffende from around to so that few people suffer the misery of become victim of crime in the first place secondly we have create new offence such as stalk coercive and control behaviour revenge pornography upskirting and non fatal strangulation so that those who betray trust and shatter life can be hold to account thirdly we have quadruple victim funding enable massive investment in resource such as independent domestic violence adviser which be up from barely exist in to more than today and we will go far with the groundbreaking victims and prisoners bill as well thank my right hon and learn friend for all the sterling work that he have just outline which be make such huge difference to victim everywhere wish to talk about case that be raise with at an advice surgery after see an advert on the tube my constituent man of very good standing invest in what turn out to be fraudulent company to the tune of he be clearly victim of crime and mercifully his bank reimburse his life saving after some challenge he do get financial restitution but the whole experience have wide devastating impact those behind the company be register in serbia and to the good of our knowledge have never be bring to justice as my constituent do not go through the full criminal justice system may ask how victim such as he can be support in case like this thank my hon friend for raise her constituent case fraud be pernicious cruel crime and it can have an appalling impact as know from my own experience of prosecute for the serious fraud office to support victim in recover lose fund the financial services and markets act give the payment systems regulator further power to mandate reimbursement where need and be glad that that take place in this case but to bring wrongdoer to justice prosecutor include the cps the financial conduct authority and the sfo regularly co operate with their international counterpart to make arrest and secure evidence overseas so that in appropriate case defendant can be extradite to face trial in the uk the other critical point be that the victim code have be expand so that people such as her constituent can get the support they need would invite he perhaps through the hon lady good office to look at the support that be available online be the secretary of state aware of new crime that be spread throughout the north of england include in your constituency mr speaker and in mine group be prey on people who have cavity wall insulation those people get themselves into the legal process and find the expense be so high that they have to sell their home it be an epidemic it be also rather like the post office scandal this be an early warning of major scandal will the secretary of state agree to look into this matter as it be very important especially in the north of england thank the hon gentleman for raise that matter on the floor of the house he will understand know that he well appreciate this that it be not for the secretary of state to be order investigation but plainly the matter he raise be serious invite the police and prosecutor to take all appropriate step to investigate it if that be what be require joint enterprise cost of judicial processes if he will make an estimate of the cost to the public purse of judicial process under joint enterprise relate to violent crime in each year since although the ministry of justice collate statistic nationally on the principal criminal offence for which perpetrator be prosecute convict or sentence include datum on their ethnicity it do not collate datum on whether the crime that they commit be part of joint enterprise so unfortunately be unable to provide the information that the hon lady request however we be consider whether such datum could be collect as part of the common platform programme which aim to provide single case management system that would enable the sharing of such evidence and case information across the criminal justice system welcome that response but the minister will know that manchester metropolitan university have recently carry out some research into the cost of prosecute under joint enterprise some million be spend process joint enterprise case and an extra billion be spend incarcerate the just over people who be convict those be eye water amount of money so do the minister agree that we need to review the doctrine of joint enterprise to ensure that only those who be responsible for significant contribution to crime be punish for it there be cost to justice people who be find guilty of crime base on the evidence present to court of law have be sentence and there be cost to their incarceration simply put the cost of incarcerate people be not reason to review the law justice devolution of responsibility if he will make an assessment of the potential merit of devolving responsibility for justice to the welsh government the government be clear that it be in the good interest of the people of wales for justice to remain reserved matter the current arrangement work well and allow wales to benefit from be part of large world renowne justice system devolve justice to wales would mean lose those benefit and would be extremely expensive and complex require the duplication of function follow the publication last month of the final report by the independent commission on the constitutional future of wales the first minister of wales confirm unambiguously that it be the policy of the welsh government and indeed of the welsh labour party to support the devolution of the justice system in pursue the devolution of the probation service he say we will have to explore governance financial arrangement and the interface between welsh and english service when will the minister meet the counsel general for wales to discuss the devolution of justice if the representative for the welsh government wish to meet be more than happy to explain why wales be part of the english and welsh legal system remain the preferred option for this government why would wales want to leave the most successful legal service system in the world rape victims privacy rights what step his department be take to protect the privacy right of rape victim in criminal justice process what step his department be take to protect the privacy right of rape victim in criminal justice process it be paramount that victim come forward without fear that their privacy will be violate that be why we be take step through the victims and prisoners bill to create statutory restriction that limit police request to third party material that be necessary and proportionate and to inform victim of why such material be be request the government have also ask the law commission to undertake review on the use of evidence in sexual offence prosecution and it be due to report later this year my constituent have all her counselling record use against she in harrowing trial that she say be bad than the crime itself will the victims and prisoners bill be sufficiently amend so that medical and social service record be not use against victim in court and family court be not use to perpetuate such abuse against the victim particularly with the use of the term parental alienation be truly sorry to hear of what happen to the hon lady constituent hope that can reassure she by say that new regulation will be publish under the victims and prisoners bill to create code of practice set out the principle that the police should apply to all third party request include for counselling therapy and medical note the police will be require to complete new request form that set out the purpose and impact of their request the crown prosecution service also have robust case file review process to ensure that guidance on necessary and proportionate request be comply with the cps pre trial therapy guideline make it crystal clear that victim must not delay therapy for criminal investigation and prosecution recently be able to visit the gwent rape investigation unit and see what an excellent job the police officer there be do however can the minister explain why the government think it be appropriate to boast about the so call progress on the rape review when the proportion of case be charge have halve since and the key adviser quit because of the lack of drive to improve outcome for victim have also hear very good report of the work that gwent police be do so be glad to hear what the hon lady say must push back very slightly on what have happen since we launch the end to end rape review we be prosecute more rape case than we be in conviction rate be high and perpetrator be go to prison for almost long than they be in the average sentence increase from six and half year to nine and half year accept that the last independent adviser to the rape review go but last week we announce the appointment of professor katrin hohl legal academic who pioneer operation soteria which think every member of this house agree have transform the way in which police investigate and prosecute rape and be lead to well criminal justice outcome for victim non disclosure agreements what discussion he have have with cabinet colleague on the use of non disclosure agreement in judicial process non disclosure agreement can not prevent any disclosure that be require or protect by law nor can they preclude an individual from assert statutory right the court and judiciary apply the law in relation to nda as appropriate in individual case and where necessary determine whether or not they should be enforceable last year the legal services board state that incident of misconduct by lawyer deal with non disclosure agreement be cause for concern and that there be strong case for strengthened and harmonise regulatory approach do the minister agree that there be need for strong regulation in this area and will he support the bill table by my hon friend the member for oxford west and abingdon layla moran which would end the misuse of non disclosure agreement in the workplace be more than happy to have discussion with the hon lady but my understanding be that the solicitors regulation authority have already publish warning notice remind solicitor and law firm that potential professional misconduct by person or firm should be report to the regulator if she believe that there be still gap in that warning notice or that more need to be do be more than happy to have meeting topical questions if he will make statement on his departmental responsibility since the last justice question have meet with the family of those kill by valdo calocane barnaby webber grace kumar and ian coates they deserve answer and series of review be take place include by the attorney general on refer the sentence in that case to the court of appeal we have announce an early legal advice pilot to help family agree child arrangement quickly have visit leeds to see how million be be spend to roll out state of the art courtroom as part of our million investment in the court estate have travel to the usa to meet my counterpart to discuss how russia can be hold financially and legally to account and be fit with gps tag to experience for myself how effective modern technology be in hold offender and justice secretaries to account constant physical reminder that debt to society must be repay court order must be observe and transgressor face the very real risk of the clang of prison gate hon member do you have it on now no do not as my right hon and learn friend just mention he spend day wear gps tag along with jack elsom from the sun could he outline what he learn from that experience and say whether he think gps tag be robust and effective mean of monitor and punish low level offender will he reveal to the house who else from the lobby be on his list to be tag remind member that these be topical question thank my hon friend for his question there be serious point here our modern gps tag act as constant physical reminder that debt to society must be repay and that breach of court order will be detect so that person who step over the line literally or metaphorically and enter an area from which he be bar know that he be liable to be return to court and send to prison we could put the entire lobby on alcohol tag but think that would deal fatal blow to the uk drink industry call the shadow minister recently visit cookham wood young offender institution there officer tell about the challenge they face include staffing shortage and shocking recruitment issue which have lead to rise level of violence can the minister say when he last visit cookham wood and why this government continue to be unable to solve those crucial problem have visit cookham wood can not remember the precise date but the really important statistic to note be that in the period up to the end of september last year we recruit an additional prison officer the number be go up and the attrition rate be go down interruption hold on that be because we have introduce measure such as the new colleague mentor scheme roll out million on security and so on we recognise that the safety of our prison be in large measure down to the quality and quantity of our staff and we be improve on both count there be an interesting debate in the house of lords last night in which lord hoffmann confirm my understanding that the european court of human rights be wrong to impose rule injunction to stop flight to rwanda and that we could safely ignore such an injunction will the secretary of state confirm that that be his understanding of the law and if we get the bill through parliament and have flight on the ground will he ignore such an injunction and would that not be good issue on which to fight the election order sir edward you should know well this be topical you be member of the panel of chairs as well you be mean to set an example not abuse your position do not have the advantage of have listen to lord hoffmann but we do not think that the strasbourg court will need to intervene give that our domestic court will have carefully assess whether anyone we intend to remove to rwanda would suffer serious and irreversible harm call the snp spokesperson unison of which be proud member have criticise government plan to reintroduce employment tribunal fee on the ground that the only people who would benefit from their reintroduction be unscrupulous boss the resolution foundation have find that the lowest pay worker be least likely to bring claim so how can the justice secretary defend plan to reintroduce employment tribunal fee which will disproportionately affect those on low wage and present an obstacle to justice for those who need it most the claim issue fee be modest and this be completely different from the previous fee scheme so simply do not accept the hon gentleman characterisation be quite happy to defend that small reasonable fee as necessary to help defray the cost of our system what percentage of the backlog in crown court case be due to foreign national offender and what have be do to reduce that datum on foreign national offender be collect at the point when an individual become an offender in other word at the point of conviction but in addition the ministry of justice record the number in custody await trial who be fno and that stand at approximately on drive the figure down the home office be work to increase take up of conditional caution which lead to fno be expel from the uk in place of prosecution in appropriate case the vagrancy act be year old this year yes it be supposedly repeal in but it remain in force the criminal justice bill unamended represent genuine danger to rough sleeper everywhere when will conservative member stop this madness and when will we see that year old piece of legislation take off the book think the hon lady for her question the criminal justice bill deal with repeal provision for the vagrancy act and we be bring the bill back on report with more on rough sleeping welcome the fact that nightingale courtroom have be set up around the country to boost capacity but none of they appear to be in the east of england

disability of over in receipt and with the increase number of judge and panel member we be see increase in disposal this year we be try to address the issue of send with the department for education and if my hon friend think there be problem in this area be more than happy to meet he to discuss it have hear the minister defend the reintroduction of employment tribunal fee but the last time the government bring they in there be drop in application how many people will be deny access to justice this time the hon gentleman be compare apple with orange the two fee be completely different in term of quantum claim issue fee be small contribution towards the tribunal which cost we million year to run do not think that that be unreasonable this week we celebrate the fifth anniversary of my civil partnerships marriages and death registration etc act complete its parliamentary stage but it be also the fifth anniversary of the government take no action to enforce clause which give coroner

recently contact for help with the cost of live crisis and rise interest rate it be crucial that people can access legal help with their housing issue what be the minister do to ensure that housing legal aid be available to those who can not afford legal help we be invest an initial million to make sure that legal aid be available for exactly those problem under the homelessness reduction act there be solemn duty on prison governor to prepare ex offender for life outside prison seven year on from the introduction of that duty they be still not do what they be require to do we want reoffende end and if people be prepare properly for when they leave prison we increase the chance of prevent reoffende what action be my right hon and learn friend take on this my hon friend have do

homelessness be read it this morning and it contain template referral form and many other aid that be to be fill out at prescribe point in the prisoner journey governor be now hold to account as my hon friend rightly indicate for their record on prepare prisoner for life post release which be why be able to say that in some of prisoner be accommodate on the first night of release that be up from in know that question be on the order paper to be take before topical but if the justice secretary could shorten his answer to make sure everyone have time in topical that would help and other last week visit ida independent domestic abuse services which be an outstanding organisation support survivor of domestic and sexual violence they highlight that parent fear of have their child remove be prevent victim from present case in full and be prevent justice how will the minister ensure that power imbalance in the family court be address be grateful for the hon lady question she will know how much we be do on victim support particularly in term of sexual and domestic abuse would like to speak to she about this issue and about parental responsibility in the family court so think we should

good job there be two case in which decision appear to have be overturn because they be irrational and that be why be meet the parole board tomorrow the justice secretary mention the duty of candour that he impose on the police have he consider legislate to introduce the same for all public body can say that we want to extend that duty to healthcare setting because we do not want health professional closing rank when something go wrong it be important to say that since hillsborough there have be so many change include through the inquiries act which mean that there can be criminal liability for those who do not do what the hon gentleman and must think be matter of common sense which be to tell the truth wedding expert at hitched say that independent celebrant be the big trend for couple get marry this year and with the church registrar and humanist all provide additional option it be about time that we update the marriage law which be from will the government publish substantive response to the law commission report on wedding reform as someone who benefit from the last wedding reform on equal marriage can say that this government be entirely committed to ensure that we report as fast as possible on the law commission review if my hon friend would like to meet my noble friend lord bellamy to discuss it far we can make that happen the backlog of asylum and immigration tribunal case have soar from to in month result no doubt of the home office push through decision at the end of last year to clear its previous backlog what be the minister do to tackle this new backlog that they have create we be increase fee for legal aid practitioner we have see massive increase in case go through the system and that be why we be invest to make sure that legal representation be available give that the exist prison in buckinghamshire can not recruit to fill staffing vacancy where do the ministry of justice think it will magic up staff and prison officer for the mega prison that it now have plan permission for in my constituency my hon friend be champion of his constituent while we may disagree on this issue know that he speak for lot of his constituent and he do so vocally in this house we have highlight the increase of in the number of prison officer we be confident that we can staff all the new prison and that they be necessary to meet our obligation what can do to change the secretary of state view on joint enterprise have he read lord finkelstein recent and very good article in the times please can the minister have an open mind and look at it again there be more than young man in prison on long sentence joint enterprise be there to ensure that those who act as the burglary lookout those who provide the weapon in murder and those who drive the getaway vehicle do not escape the consequence of their crime which shatter live it be already the case as in the case of jogee that the person must have help or encourage the commission of the offence and intend to do so if the labour party position be that such people should escape culpability it should say so our advice on this side of the house be clear do not commit crime immigration rules and border security urgent question to ask the secretary of state for the home department if he will make statement on change to uk immigration rule and the security of the uk border the security of the uk border be top priority for the home secretary and the home office everything we do in this area be design to reduce risk to this country and its citizen border force perform check on of schedule passenger arrive in the uk and risk base intelligence lead check on general aviation it be deeply disturbing that information that have no basis in fact be leak by the independent chief inspector to national newspaper before the home office have the chance to respond we be urgently investigate this breach of confidential information in full in the normal way move to yesterday change to the immigration rule since the launch of our ukraine scheme the uk have offer or extend sanctuary to more than ukrainians thank to the immense generosity of the british public know that colleague across the house be grateful for all the work that have be go on in community to facilitate that support almost two year on from the start of the conflict the uk government commitment to the ukrainian cause remain undimmed it be right that we continue to adapt and develop our visa route to ensure that they keep pace with the rapidly shift situation in ukraine we must ensure that they remain as efficient and sustainable as possible while provide stability for those we have welcome to the uk and those who still need our sanctuary ukrainian national who may have previously be eligible to apply to come to the uk under the ukraine family scheme will remain eligible to apply for the homes for ukraine sponsorship scheme separately the government remain wholeheartedly committed to reduce level of legal migration measure to curb immigration abuse and far reduce net migration be be implement range from salary increase for work and family visa to reform the shortage occupation list remove the right for overseas care worker to bring dependant and require care provider to be register with the care quality commission before hire overseas carer the rule change outline yesterday which relate to the care sector pave the way for those measure to take effect it have be report today that hundred of high risk private flight have land in the uk without proper border security check have be do if the minister dispute the figure will he tell we the true one now be all the high risk private flight check or not minister have be warn repeatedly about border security risk on private flight the prime minister may think it be just all his own mate but there be risk from organised crime money laundering drug and weapon smuggling traffic and even terrorism there have be drop in class drug border seizure there have be drop in firearm seizure criminal gang be still organise dangerous boat crossing there have also be repeat failure in security check at western jet foil drop in foreign national offender removal drop in fail asylum seeker removal and new revelation of visa failure in the home office which issue visa to care home that do not even exist instead of get grip what be the minister response it be just to sack the border inspector and sit on his report as well as change the rule to stop ukrainian family member from come here what message of solidarity do that send to country we be suppose to be support in the face of russian aggression will the minister now publish all the outstanding inspector report be it true that no inspector will be in place for the next six month will he tell we the key border security fact have all high risk private flight be meet and check in the last year home office ministers promise in this chamber that that would happen year ago if not will he tell we how many high risk flight maybe involve dangerous people and weapon have be allow into the country without proper border security check the conservatives have break the asylum system bust the home office budget badly undermine britain border security and put our country security at risk will they ever get grip be very disappointed with the right hon lady response on the certainty provide by yesterday announcement on ukraine just before the february recess we have good debate involve colleague from across the house where there be call for certainty on the future of those visa scheme the government have come forward and provide that assurance about where we go from here of course the first of those visa do not expire until if we add on the month period that be an additional two and half year of certainty for individual from the here and now which think be very welcome there will continue to be an in country and out of country approach we of course engage with our ukrainian friend and ally and will support they in any way we can we be ahead of the curve internationally in give that assurance the right hon lady should be on the front foot in welcome that because it be good positive news we will publish the report by the independent chief inspector of border and immigration and our response to they that will happen soon on the right hon lady question about the flight at london city airport and the information put in the public domain the home office categorically reject the claim by david neal mr neal report on general aviation border check at london city airport be submit last week and undergo fact check as be standard practice mr neal be make aware of specific issue with the recording of datum at london city airport that mean that large proportion of flight record as high risk should have be reclassify as low risk it be disappointing that he have choose to put mislead datum into the public domain the home office priority be to deliver safe and secure border and we will never compromise on that when notify we clear of high risk general aviation flight either remotely or in person in accordance with the ga guidance and we be commit to respond effectively use an intelligence lead approach as well as to work thoroughly with the wide law enforcement community the right hon lady will appreciate that there be report on this issue we will respond to the inspector report and that response will have answer to the substantive point pose in it we will deal with it in entirely the proper way it be rather ironic that the right hon lady talk about the opposition stance on the security of our border because she quite happily vote against the nationality and borders act when we legislate to introduce electronic travel authorisation which be critical to the future of our border security and allow great automation for passenger they improve the passenger experience at the border while be robust on border security interruption she be chuntere away but she vote against those important measure when it come to dangerous foreign criminal on our street we hear those on the opposition benches oppose removal flight the leader of the opposition and other have take that stance they would allow dangerous criminal and dangerous individual to be on the street of the united kingdom this government have credible plan to stop the small boat crossing of the channel and the risk that they present to our security as well as the wide criminality again the right hon lady have oppose all those step we have plan and we be work through it that be the position and it be clear for all to see either misheard or the suggestion by the opposition that the measure the minister have introduce will prevent ukrainian family member from come to britain be deeply untrue and highly irresponsible be it my right hon friend summarise the situation neatly there will continue to be an in country opportunity for people to apply to extend their visa through the homes for ukraine scheme ukrainians will still be able to come to the uk to access the sanctuary that we proudly support we have see community across the country do an enormous amount of positive welcome work to support that national effort any suggestion that that will not be the case move forward be wrong it be deliberate scaremongering and people should stop it call the scottish national party spokesperson there be bitter irony in the uk government make change to health and social care visa sector that be cry out for people that will make it more difficult for people to come and look after our love one they say come and look after our love one but you can bring your own how utterly heartless the sector be dominate by woman who be more likely to have child with they what equality impact assessment have the minister carry out on these very poor plan what advice be he take from the migration advisory committee this be crisis of the government make the committee encourage the government to pay people in the health and social care sector more and commend scotland which have less reliance on people come in because we have workforce strategy and we pay care worker the real living wage will he do the same saturday february mark two year since the escalation of russian aggression in ukraine two year long than any of we would have want we be appalled that this week the uk government have make it more difficult for ukrainians to seek sanctuary here by close the ukraine family scheme with immediate effect at pm yesterday with absolutely no notice the minister talk of an month extension but for new application that have be reduce from year those who hold visa now can not sponsor so the wife who want to bring injured husband to live here presumably can no long do so how can he say that be fair how can this government say slava ukraini while close the door to those in need to deal with the latter point first that be not the case there continue to be route for ukrainians to come to the united kingdom it be arguably more effective route to facilitate sanctuary for people with all the enhance check and support that come with the homes for ukraine route there be the ability for people who be here in the uk to sustain and extend their sanctuary the hon lady should welcome that she be involve in the westminster hall debate before the recess as be be proud of the government work to support community to facilitate that sanctuary we will continue to be front footed and forward lean when it come to do so because it be morally critical that we be at the forefront and be give people that certainty way ahead of our international ally again she should welcome that when it come to care worker as have say on many occasion the current situation for dependant be disproportionate we see dependant come with care worker that be not sustainable in the long term that be why we be take forward these measure the hon lady mention specifically the migration advisory committee which have consistently say that migration be not the answer to workforce shortage in the social care sector that be why the government have invest billion to support the strategy for social care workforce development and to boost capacity in social care include through retention of the dedicated workforce already undertake these vital role as former minister for disabled people at the department for work and pensions can also say that firmly back the work the government be do to support more people domestically into work through the comprehensive back to work plan the hon lady should support those effort we be put real resourcing behind that that should be our first port of call welcome the news that the ukrainian visa scheme have be extend by month that be very generous could the minister confirm that while there be war in ukraine and while it be unsafe for these family to return they will have home in this country know that my hon friend care deeply about provide that sanctuary for our ukrainian friend as do colleague across government and would argue members across this house we be all incredibly move by what we have see in our community with people rally behind those ukrainians to support they and to provide that warm welcome we will continue to sustain that effort which we do in partnership with the ukrainian government we regularly discuss these matter with they of course we will continue to sustain that sanctuary for the duration of this invasion we be firmly on the side of the ukrainians in win this war call the chair of the home affairs committee accountability and oversight be critical to the effective management of uk border security the home affairs committee have repeatedly question the government about the delay in the home office publish the chief inspector report understand there be now report outstanding we be also concerned as the chief inspector be the statutory body and there be no deputy or provision for the institution to exist without the chief inspector in post with david neal leave at the end of march will the minister update the house on what have happen to the recruitment process that end in december when will the home affairs committee get the pre appointment hearing that we be entitle to have for the new chief inspector think the chairman of the committee will appreciate that it would not be appropriate for to comment on appointment relate matter but we will follow the proper process in appoint chief inspector of border and immigration the shadow home secretary also ask about the laying before parliament of the government response to the report as say in response to that question it will happen soon people who want to work in our care sector from other country be welcome to do so where it be appropriate however under the current model many people be pay thousand of pound to agent to contact care home owner in this country who even if there be no vacancy will allow people to come here and send they off to work in supermarket or other area the pay then go back to the agent the individual do not even get the pay will the minister take measure to combat what be clearly criminal conspiracy and prevent it from happen people who want to come and work here be be exploit ruthlessly where we see abuse of our migration route we will root that out and deal with it robustly that be one of the reason the care quality commission accreditation angle have be such an important part of the package of measure we be take forward ensure that the role people come here to fulfil be credible real job in these workplace we think it be right that there be well audit trail for those appointment not least for the very reason my hon friend highlight to minimise the risk of people be exploit cheat and sell fake prospectus for what they be sign up to that can not be right it be right that we as government take robust posture over it tapadh leibh mr speaker and thank you for take this urgent question as you know table something similar after the bbc and the guardian report that the family unification route for ukrainian family have be unexpectedly close warn the government against such mean mindedness the uk government be the meanest minded in europe at the outbreak of the ukrainian war which cause lot of work for civil servant for the government themselves and for mp all unnecessarily most importantly it cause angst for family in na eileanan an iar and elsewhere and concern and worry for those who want to come to the island and elsewhere why would ask they to think again can the minister confirm exactly what he have do have feeling he be be economical with clarity here be the bbc and the guardian wrong in what they have report the position very clearly be that we have arguably be the most generous with the approach we have adopt to provide sanctuary to our ukrainian friend there will continue to be an out of country route through the homes for ukraine scheme to enable people to come here as well as the visa extension as say we be get on the front foot early than other in provide certainty and in term of the length of those visa those be measure to be welcome not traduce there be certain irony about opposition members go on about border security when lot of they try to prevent load of convict criminal from be deport welcome the income threshold go up for get visa and the change for social care worker too have be very concerned that other country have produce evidence about how that route be abuse and it be right that we clamp down on dependant come here on the welcome change to net legal migration will the minister provide the evidence and datum soon to show the public that it be finally head in the right direction and that they be be hear be incredibly concerned that if mainstream party such as ourselves do not get it and show the public that we get it on migration it will fuel the extreme my hon friend speak with real passion and know that people in ipswich feel very strongly about this issue that be why as government we have credible plan to bring the number down we believe the inflow will be reduce by take into account the change we be deliver relative to the year prior on his request on what we can do to report around that and provide information about the progress we be make that be something be consider so when do the minister expect the next independent chief inspector of border and immigration to take up the post we will follow the proper process to make an appointment it be obviously right that we help those in ukraine who urgently need our help but most people in stoke on trent and wide north staffordshire think that the net migration figure have be unacceptably high and that that have put significant pressure on our local service do my hon friend the minister agree with that it be right that those who come here and use service but have not contribute to their cost should face high visa and nationality fee my hon friend be right to touch on the general feeling in stoke on trent about the net migration situation that be why we be take action the government feel that the border and migration system cost we charge people to access those service should reflect the cost we incur it should not fall to the uk taxpayer to pick up those cost it should be the individual who avail themselves of those service who cover their cost we continue to work towards that in great detail aviation have be consistently flag as danger to national security do the minister agree that the failure to check those arrive in the uk that way be put the united kingdom at risk refer the hon lady to what say in relation to the shadow home secretary early contribution and the question she ask on that issue we treat that subject with utmost seriousness we will of course respond to the icibi report in proper and thorough way have consider the point it raise and ensure that proper fact checking be carry out for the reason have touch on if the purpose of yesterday announcement be to provide some reassurance to ukrainian citizen who have seek refuge in the uk why be the government force they to go through yet another application every member of this house will have experience the problem support the initial application there will be delay different family member will get confirmation at different time and child will be drop off by mistake cause great distress my question to the minister be this should ukvi not be focus on its exist backlog rather than add unnecessary process to its workload and distress ukrainian family who be now our constituent and live in the united kingdom disagree with the hon and learn lady we think this be an appropriate approach to extend the visa it be right and proper that there be proper process around that and there be obviously reason why visa be handle in this particular way safeguard concern come into all these matter include extension and that be why we will take the approach we take want it to be as light touch as possible want it to be as easy as possible all parliamentarian in this house should be provide reassurance today that the ukrainian people in our country access sanctuary will continue to be able to do so would argue that that be the responsibility of all of we as leader in our country lot of people in this country include my constituent will be amazed that in the week of navalny murder by putin and the tough time that the ukrainians be face against russian reinforcement the government have announce restriction on ukrainian family come here have campaign for long time because so many wealthy russian plutocrat have be fly into this country on small private aircraft and helicopter for long time have ask question about that perhaps we should ask boris johnson friend in the other place lord lebedev of hampton and siberia what he know about it the fact be that we be provide the certainty that member across the house have be seek for the future of the ukraine scheme do not think the hon gentleman be in the debate we have prior to the february recess would argue that the house speak with one voice say that we need to afford sanctuary for long recognise that the war remain ongoing but that the ukrainian people continue to have our firm backing in their fight against russian aggression that be precisely what we have do through this announcement reject his characterisation of the situation the message need to go out that ukrainians who be here will continue to be able to have that sanctuary in the year ahead family in all our constituency include east renfrewshire rely on the skill and compassion of those who work in the care sector the chief executive of scottish care donald macaskill yesterday describe the government plan to ban overseas care worker from bring dependant as shameful and damaging say treat international colleague in this manner be contemptible he be right be he there will continue to be an opportunity for international recruitment for care purpose but we can not have situation where dependant come with visa holder that be not justifiable that be not acceptable that be why we be take the approach we be take there will in future need to be blend of approach to recruitment also happen to think it be right that we should strain every sinew to support people in this country to take on these role with the proper skill and that be precisely what the back to work plan do close the ukrainian family scheme almost two year to the day since putin illegal war begin be particularly cruel the government speak of rationalisation of the scheme but what we really need be further measure to support family reunification give the change what reassurance can the government give to those on these scheme that they will be able to bring family member to the uk we always keep under review the offer we have as part of the ukraine scheme and that will continue to be the case but reiterate the point that what we have do through this package of change in its entirety be to sustain an out of country route to enable ukrainians to come to the uk to seek sanctuary while give certainty ahead of many other country include european union country with which the hon lady have an affinity we have get ahead of the curve and provide certainty around sanctuary in way that think people in this country want to see the change the government keep make to the ukrainian scheme have unfortunately result in far too many ukrainians become homeless when will the minister finally as pledge by his predecessor meet glasgow members of parliament to discuss how home office policy be make refugee homeless in the city of glasgow in fact the announcement have provide real certainty about the future of the ukraine scheme at an early stage and we be ahead of the curve internationally the hon gentleman know well and we have always have constructive work relationship be very willing to meet he to discuss the issue of asylum accommodation and support for refugee in glasgow and know that my colleague in the department for levelling up housing and communities who lead on the accommodation side of the ukraine scheme would also be happy to engage with he thank the minister for all his helpful answer in the context of the open border may ask what step have be take to ensure that northern ireland do not become the back door to the rest of the united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland the hon gentleman be right to raise that point as he have recognise we must ensure that our approach to border security be adopt properly throughout the united kingdom be pleased to be able to have constructive meeting about the future of the ukraine scheme with the new deputy first minister of northern ireland last week as part of the conversation that be take place with the devolved government tell she that would be very willing to meet she again and be delighted to see she in her place and take on those responsibility be sure that these be matter that she will want to discuss point of order on point of order madam deputy speaker you will be aware that the northern ireland assembly be restore two week ago during the period when it be not sit member of the legislative assembly be not fulfil the full range of their function and the secretary of state reduce their salary write to the leader of the house last week about matter of which you may well also be aware madam deputy speaker the matter of the abstentionist sinn féin mps who have not fulfil the full range of their own function but have receive million of pound in representative money over not two but year while they receive no salary from the house the money that they do receive be allocate on the same basis as short money namely to assist opposition party with such process as scrutiny and preparation for debate in none of which sinn féin participate just wish to ascertain madam deputy speaker whether the leader of the house have receive my letter have as yet indicate her intention of table motion allow we to discuss this matter thank the hon gentleman for his point of order and for give notice of it have have no indication that the government intend to table motion on this matter and believe that mr speaker have have no such indication either however the hon gentleman will have an opportunity to ask the leader of the house question on thursday when she have announce the forthcoming business hope that that be helpful think that that be the direction in which he should go far to that point of order madam deputy speaker this be not something that have happen in the last while as we have just hear from my hon friend the member for east londonderry mr campbell it have be go on for number of year representation have be make to the government and to the minister responsible on numerous occasion so it be disappointing that my hon friend have have to bring the matter up yet again today be it not time for the minister to come to the house make statement and get this matter sort out do not think there be much that can add to what say early but be confident that those on the treasury bench and the whip have hear what both hon gentleman have to say and be sure that they will be report back urge the hon gentleman to take the matter up on thursday when the leader of the house will be here broadcasting listed sporting events scotland motion for leave to bring in bill standing order no beg to move that leave be give to bring in bill to expand the list of sporting event that must be make available for broadcast by free to air television channel to include all qualifying match play by the scotland man and woman national football team in the world cup and the uefa european football championship and for connected purpose like many people throughout the united kingdom look forward to watch the european football final in june not just scotland but england and hopefully wales too will be there if they win their qualifi be fortunate enough to attend the scotland game when the competition be hold in england in as well as go to france for the world cup in scotland be my team they represent our nation and steve clarke and his lad have do we proud we can dream of win the competition but in reality shall be happy with our qualifying from the group we have falter and fail to do that before sometimes through bad luck although at other time it have be self inflict but in andy robertson john mcginn scott mctominay and other we have squad who be skilled and determined as well as canny manager the tartan army who be go to germany will enjoy the spectacle while other include will simply watch the game on television that after all be how most people watch their national team go to the game be either too difficult or too expensive or else there be simply insufficient capacity for all to attend so it be at home on their tv screen that most people follow their team for quite some time however that have not be the case for scotland fan in the qualifying match for this tournament or the qualifying match for international competition which be why this bill be necessary like the world cup final the euro final be available on free to view channel that be specify by law but scotland qualifying match be not protect they have be available only through viaplay swedish medium company and at cost of per annum in these tough financial time that be cost that many can not afford no matter how much they would like to watch the game it be poll tax on scots watch their national team the qualifying game number of which be enthral with win at home against spain and away against norway be not available to view for many people other than those fortunate enough to be able to go to the match itself or able to pay for viaplay that be as unfair and unjust as refereeing error or var review which punish your team it have mean that scot fan have miss out on the well earn success of their team even worse when these euro final be past and the qualifier for the world cup in north america begin scot will again be deprive of the opportunity to watch their team on free to air tv the game go on as another competition beckon but many scot be exclude from watch their team journey and that be neither right nor fair it be not the norm in europe where only seven country include scotland and northern ireland be in this situation nor be it the case in england where qualifying game have be free to air on itv or channel since even in wales where right to the national team qualifying fixture be also sell to viaplay in access be available free to air on the charging for view extend from the major competition even to friendly fixture while they may lack the same bite as the competitive game many wish to see their hero perform or new star be give an opportunity but the four friendly fixture arrange for scotland warm up for germany be all to be behind pay wall on viaplay so even these non competitive fixture will be deny to many scottish fan meanwhile england warm up will be broadcast free to view on channel the anomaly between scotland and england international match extend beyond the man international team for the woman game itv have the right to the english national team have recently take over from the bbc scotland game be show on bbc alba channel know and enjoy but which although free to view have neither the reach nor the resource of the big channel indeed have see scottish and english fixture go head to head on the bbc and bbc alba why be there pan uk coverage of the england game but restrict access to the scottish one similarly the bbc hold the right to england international while scotland be leave to the scottish football association website which show that it be not just in respect of the man team but across gender and age that scot be be deprive of the right to watch their national team those fixture also matter to fan the scottish football press be once describe as fan with typewriter now it seem to be the uk broadcaster who be fan with tv station but while the scottish press support the scottish team the uk broadcaster only seem to support england uk broadcaster be reveal themselves not as uk television outlet but as team england only that be happen whether we be talk about the state fund bbc publicly own channel or the commercial itv or stv channel that have broadcast obligation beyond the border some may blame the scottish football association which sell the right to viaplay let say at the outset that do not hold the sfa responsible culpability rest with broadcaster who have not just right but duty and who be fail scotland the sfa have duty to the game in scotland that responsibility run from the grassroot and football simply be game to be enjoy by youngster through develop pathway for people to continue play at whatever age or standard and on to those enter into the professional rank and ultimately the pinnacle of the national team the sfa be also require to nurture and develop not just the man game but the grow woman game and football among people of different age and capacity the man and woman international team be the pinnacle but the sfa remit cover all all that come at cost however and the sfa be require to fund it money be tight for association as it be for individual broadcast money that apply in nation such as ireland when premier league game south of the border be show be deny to scotland the reason be that the uk be class as one broadcasting entity and international football divergence be of no relevance hence cash strap sfa need to maximise income and the right to show the national team fixture be its major asset viaplay offer more it be something the sfa be require to do to promote the game from grassroot to international team what about broadcaster why can the bbc channel and itv all have budget to pay for england game but not for scottish one it be not that the sfa be seek more than the fa quite the opposite the view right fee for scotland match be significantly low than for england match just as transfer fee in the scottish premier leagues be low than those in the english premier league but while uk broadcaster be prepared to pay top dollar to show england game they be not prepared to fund bawbee for scotland game indeed that be state by simon pitts of stv when he give evidence to the scottish affairs committee he say that there be very little prospect of large commercial return uk wide which in turn determine the level of bid scot tv licence fee do not therefore matter and obligation to scots viewer count for little the licence fee pay by scot and the right give in scotland to uk broadcaster be not be match by coverage that be why this bill be necessary it must be mandatory that scotland game should be available and broadcaster must live up to their obligation scot fan have right to see their team and to expect no less from their broadcaster question put and agree to order that kenny macaskill neale hanvey angus brendan macneil douglas chapman martyn day carol monaghan

when decide application relate to new seaward area production licence this new clause require the secretary of state to publish marine spatial prioritisation policy take into account relevant target under the climate change act and the environment act refer the house to my entry in the register of members financial interests on second reading say that this bill be something of distraction and not necessary on the basis that the north sea transition authority can already grant licence annually or indeed whenever it consider it necessary that will not change with the bill also note at the time that the two statutory test in the bill have be design in such way that the computer always say yes to new oil and gas licence but also say that would work with other like minded colleague to improve the bill and bring in further test that need to be meet before any new oil and gas production licence be grant that be what and other member have seek to do amendment seek to do two thing first it would stop the invitation of new production application licence until the secretary of state have introduce ban on the flaring and venting of methane by new offshore installation secondly it would require the secretary of state to prevent licensing round from if wide ban on flare and venting be not in place along with other member who have sign up to the amendment argue that this be an entirely reasonable ask that the government and all member should be able to get behind give that all it modestly seek to do be put into statute exist guidance on flare and venting that be issue by the north sea transition authority let set out the precise wording of the principle that the nsta expect industry to follow in relation to flare and venting across all uk continental shelf area first flaring and venting and associate emission should be at the low possible level in the circumstance secondly there should be zero routine flaring and venting for all by thirdly all new development should be plan and develop on the basis of zero routine flaring and venting that be set of nsta principle with which amendment in entirely consistent can my right hon friend explain why it would be well to import liquefy natural gas with four time the amount of produce rather than have our own gas his regulation would not apply to the foreign produce gas we import my right hon friend make an important point lng have high carbon intensity footprint but the majority of the gas that we import come by pipeline from norway and the production intensity of norwegian gas be around half that of the uk will my right hon friend give way if may will continue in their response last year to the environmental audit committee report on accelerate the transition from fossil fuel and secure energy supply the government double down on the nsta position respond to the eac recommendation which call for the banning of flare from uk installation the government note that they have already sign up to make every effort to ensure that routine flare from exist oil field end as soon as possible and no later than the government response go on to highlight the nsta guidance that new development be approve on the basis of zero routine flaring and venting my right hon friend the member for wokingham john redwood raise the issue of import gas will just point out to he that unfortunately flaring be still common practice in the uk by contrast norway ban routine flaring in and the carbon intensity of norwegian gas production be around half that of uk domestic production the marginal gas we would import would come from qatar or the united states of america there be not an infinite supply of norwegian gas so my right hon friend be miss the main point with respect do not think be miss the main point the point that the government be pursue be to ensure that we have less use of fossil fuel overall and that we expand our renewable capacity include nuclear which know my right hon friend support that be where we should be go with this strategy the ban on flare in norway be one of the key reason that norway have become leader in the clean production of oil and gas which this government have clearly indicate that they also want for uk production be look forward to hear the minister response to amendment hope he will say that give that it be consistent with government policy and guidance the government will introduce similar amendment in the other place if they choose not to do that be pretty sure that similar amendment will be table in the other place anyway and that it be likely to be support would just humbly observe that if the government whip against this or any similar amendment either in this house or in the other place they will put colleague in the absurd position of effectively have to vote against exist government policy be really look forward to listen to what the minister have to say rise order we be in committee so remind member that the chair should be address by name or as chair or madam chair as sir alok sharma do and not as mr deputy speaker or madam deputy speaker before call the shadow minister want to make it clear that will be call those who have amendment down first and will then move on to other go from side to side would like to speak to our amendment and to comment on other amendment before we today and then to place all this into the context of the bill as whole by way of what will effectively be stand part contribution this bill remain an ill advise pointless piece of political posturing do pull any punch that be the mild version as the right hon member for reading west sir alok sharma have inform we the bill legislate for something that happen anyway it will make no difference to bill accord to the secretary of state it will make no difference to our energy security accord to the former chair of bp it will undermine the independence of the north sea transition authority accord to the nsta own board and it and will reinforce the perception around the world that the uk be row back from climate action accord to the former cop president the right hon member for reading west we regret that this insubstantial and damaging bill have proceed this far and we will vote against it on third reading we do not need this one clause bill we need instead strategy for manage the north sea that support our energy security meet our climate commitment and secure the economic and job benefit of the transition to low carbon economy we would have like to debate new clause set out new principal objective for the north sea transition authority that would have put such strategy into effect however because the bill be so short and tightly draw around the narrow issue of mandatory licensing round amendment to put more sensible strategy into place be regrettably not in order we must therefore take the bill on its own term even if that mean treat it with significantly more respect than the drafter have treat this house with in present such trivial and nakedly political proposal we have in the bill at present two test that should be pass if the oil and gas authority be to proceed with mandatory licence issuance and we know that the two test can not be fail it be fact that if properly draft we might come to that in moment liquefy natural gas will always be more greenhouse gas intensive in production than uk natural gas and we will always be in position where gas and oil produce in the uk and in decline north sea field will not meet our total demand for gas and oil learn in my first year at university as think the minister do because he do similar degree to that proposition that can not be falsify can not stand as valid proposition here we have two completely non valid proposition in the bill they be bogus and cynically contrive to give the appearance that something have to be achieve before mandatory licencing take place at the very least we need test or test that can be fail and that produce proper level of judgment into the advisability of proceed with such mandatory licence the good test surely have to be whether such action be compatible with our climate change goal the government have previously introduce climate change compatibility test into production generally it be strange that these appear nowhere in the bill the shadow minister have say that get more of our own gas out of the north sea would help our security of supply and reduce because it would displace import lng so why do he not support that proposition the proposition before we today be for mandatory licence round in decline north sea field which would make no difference in the long term to the total amount of gas that we get out of the north sea as everybody know it would instead put we firmly on the back foot as far as international climate change discussion be concern that be the key issue that we need to address this afternoon follow on from the question from my right hon friend the member for wokingham john redwood be it therefore labour position not to allow any new oil and gas licence in the future if labour be to come into power it be labour position that we do not wish to see new energy exploration licence issue for the future but that do not mean that the north sea will not continue in production over long period of time and provide substantial amount of oil and gas for our domestic market our first amendment and would introduce new test that would safeguard the legally bind commitment that the uk and all other nation make in the paris agreement and have reaffirm ever since every credible independent analysis the intergovernmental panel on climate change the international energy agency the climate change committee show that new exploration licence be not compatible with limit warming and avoid the bad of the devastating impact that climate change will have and be have around the world and here in the uk the test that we have put in amendment and be possible if we have achieve or be achieve our climate change goal internationally amendment state the climate change test be meet in relation to relevant year if the late report of the intergovernmental panel on climate change on the mitigation of climate change find that the granting of additional seaward area production licence be consistent with limit warming to no one who be serious about this can take that to mean that exist field will not continue to produce for year to come of course they will but anyone who argue that business as usual and few new license be the route to good long term job and energy security be frankly peddle myth we must accelerate the transition to new opportunity for north sea worker in the low carbon economy include through carbon capture usage and storage through hydrogen and through float offshore wind we do not believe that test be the good route to achieve that goal we need holistic strategy but within the framework set out in this bill the climate change test we propose be the only way to achieve policy that be consistent with be responsible and leading actor on the world stage in the fight against climate change with manage our exist north sea asset carefully and for the long term and with maximise the low carbon economic potential of the north sea the other two amendment will speak to highlight the extent to which the bill fail even on the narrow term it have set out amendment and would address the glare deficiency in the bogus carbon intensity test set out by the government currently the test compare uk gas production carbon emission only against an aggregate of liquefy natural gas production emission ignore pipeline deliver gas which make up most of our import as the right hon member for reading west remind we this amendment would correct that as it stand the test be design to be impossible to fail so it be barely worthy of the name include only lng be serious logical flaw before the minister jump to his foot it be not true to say that every marginal unit of import gas must be lng indeed we support substantial amount of natural gas come into the uk via the pipeline from norway the production of that gas be substantially clean than that of uk natural gas apart from anything else the bill take no account of the uk likely future gas demand profile demand for gas will decline as we rapidly decarbonise our power sector and electrify more and more of our economy indeed this decline in demand not just supply be at the heart of successful net zero transition approve new exploration licence for field that will take year to come online on the assumption that the alternative must otherwise be lng without take any account of future demand be absurd fairer test would consider gas import in the round take on board the hon gentleman comment that overall of our gas come from norway yes that be the majority of our import but it be still overall nobody in this house have authority over norway future oil and gas prospect but would he be in favour of the norwegian government explore for new oil and gas to supply to we no in line with the iea and the ipcc be not in favour of new exploration licence the point be that in decline market norwegian supply will continue to be very substantial even if no new exploration licence be grant in norway the figure cite by the hon gentleman be almost right the actual figure be the united kingdom supply of its own gas with the united states supply qatar supply and other country supply small amount norway already occupy very substantial position in our present gas supply and be sure it will continue to do so do the hon gentleman agree that it might be useful to remind conservative members that accord to the un production gap report government be already plan for their exist development to produce more than double the amount of fossil fuel in than be consistent with keep global heating to or below the idea that anyone can have vast new development be not compatible with keep below our climate target the hon lady be absolutely right new licence be an international issue if we have new exploration licence around the world we would simply produce far more oil and gas than be compatible with the climate target we should just keep it in the ground finally amendment would go some way towards correct another element of the carbon intensity test as currently draft the minister will want to listen to this bit the test will not take account of methane emission which be serious flaw the whole case for compare uk base natural gas with lng be base only on production emission the emission of methane at various stage of the production and transportation of lng be in aggregate bad than the emission of uk produce and pip natural gas but they be not carbon dioxide emission which be what the bill say should be measure lng potential carbon dioxide emission upon burning be roughly the same as or perhaps slightly great than the carbon dioxide emission from uk natural gas as the right hon member for reading west say that be elevate by the current uk practice of flare surplus gas which can be measure in carbon dioxide emission methane be much more potent greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide over year and year timeframe its lifetime in the atmosphere be short than the lifetime of but its impact be far more significant the climate change act be quite specific on how this should be measure section which the bill mention but do not act on state that greenhouse gas emission and removal of greenhouse gas from the atmosphere shall be measure or calculate in tonne of carbon dioxide equivalent propose new section of the petroleum act mention the carbon intensity of natural gas but propose new subsection define carbon intensity as the carbon dioxide emission attributable to its production but carbon dioxide emission in production be not the principal concern here as the gas have not be burn at that point indeed can conceive of smart climate lawyer challenge the test validity on precisely that point the minister might therefore see amendment as provide vital lifeline to the integrity of his bill to that extent the amendment might be see as helpful but somehow doubt that he will take it up to coin phrase it the methane stupid the bill should say so propose new section already give the secretary of state the power to amend the carbon intensity test to include emission other than carbon dioxide perhaps the secretary of state or the minister will shortly take that up to save the test we can anticipate fairly amusing statutory instrument debate when he try to do that amendment would simply require the government to produce report analyse what the impact of that change will be in the spirit of try to improve bill that by design be fairly resistant to improvement we welcome the amendment table by the right hon member for reading west and the hon member for north devon selaine saxby the climate change committee and the environmental audit committee have call for ban on routine flaring and venting and such ban be long overdue marine spatial prioritisation policy would help to organise and plan an optimal long term low carbon economic strategy for the north sea there be clearly significant strength of feeling across the committee that this be an inadequate bill and some of the propose test could undoubtedly make bad bill little well although some of those test have internal problem we would not want to vote against those test but the only comprehensive climate change and net zero compatible test be the one that we and in principle the hon member for brighton pavilion caroline lucas have set out it be the well available route within severely constrain process to align this deeply flawed bill with our essential energy security and climate change priority rise to speak to new clause on spatial prioritisation the compete pressure on sea space mean there be essentially spatial squeeze fully understand the bill importance as we all know that the oil and gas industry will have key role as the uk transition towards clean energy the bill will provide reassurance to the industry be grateful that the government have state that each annual licensing round will take place only if key emission test be meet to support the transition to net zero thank the minister and his team for their ongoing engagement on this issue but as we seek to turn to renewable and clean energy we need to ensure that we have the space and infrastructure to carry this forward otherwise the energy transition will never come to fruition bring up this issue directly with the minister for food farming and fisheries my right hon friend the member for sherwood mark spencer at the environment food and rural affairs committee as my concern extend beyond just oil and gas be also concerned about how float offshore wind and fishing can cohabit the same ocean space and be also concerned about marine protect area there be clearly balance to strike it be good to hear the fisheries minister response about cross departmental work to ensure that our fisherman have future in the light of our need to expand our renewable energy source but there be an opportunity in this bill to ensure that we do not repeat these conversation as other energy source compete for space in the precious water around our coast this will help not only the uk energy security but our push towards renewable energy which will support our fishing fleet and retain simultaneous focus on biodiversity and improve the condition of marine protect area as coastal mp all these point be especially important to be an eternal optimist think we can do all these thing simultaneously if we can plan strategically where we have the opportunity my hon friend be make some very good point particularly on the spatial squeeze she say that this be not choice between one thing and another opposition member tend to see this debate as black and white and that we have to go in either one direction or the other do she agree that whether from the perspective of fishing offshore wind or offshore oil and gas it be very important that we come together so that everyone have say as always agree with the point my hon friend make prioritise space be critical as the government have commit to deliver of offshore wind which this represent approximately billion worth of investment and require nearly sq km of new marine space need to declare an interest as the chair of the all party group on the celtic sea as such my particular concern be about the deployment of float offshore wind as it will open up area such as the celtic sea so that we can generate energy no matter which way the wind blow as it can be deploy in water deep than metre that technology open up of our offshore wind resource the celtic sea be an environment where strategic planning at this early point in the development of flow not just for spatial prioritisation on the seabed but for clear planning of cable route to optimise how power transition to the grid minimise blue carbon disruption from our ocean floor and onshore environmental damage from multiple plug in point indeed give the long term commitment to energy generation in the celtic sea as well as the north sea the chance to plan strategically and include all future lease within national framework come now more renewable energy and great energy efficiency contribute more to energy security than new oil and gas this integrate spatial planning will require new licence to ensure that enough sea space be allocate for nature recovery and climate change mitigation otherwise there be risk that industrial activity could crowd out those important environmental purpose which with the right strategic planning early enough in the evolution of these vital new technology can coexist alongside those that be now wan currently the bill have no provision to require spatial prioritisation testing of the geographical block that become available for oil and gas search and production that mean that the north sea transition authority will be able to grant new licence in area of the sea where the cumulative impact of activity be incompatible with the achievement of government target in the climate change act and the environment act do my hon friend accept that in several case potentially useful oil and gas deposit in the north sea be adjacent to exist pipe and exist development production platform so one great advantage would be that the infrastructure be already in place and it have spare capacity because of the decline of traditional field that would be far less intrusive would it not my right hon friend make valid point however for this be about open up that conversation and make sure that these thing be consider in the round if we be go to put an extra pipe in we should consider what we be offset somewhere else polling find that of the uk public believe our ocean protection law must be strengthen and know how important our water be to the resident of north devon and the wide uk we must ensure that we do all we can on this while understand the vital role that oil and gas play and will play in our energy security spatial prioritisation be important to ensure that continue to drive forward our new green energy be not do at the expense of our traditional industry such as fishing and give due consideration to the marine environment which we on land owe so much to and be still find out more about balance and optimisation be the objective of this amendment and hope the minister will consider this opportunity so that we really can have it all and decarbonise our energy improve our biodiversity support our fisherman and improve our energy security call the scottish national party spokesman rise to speak to amendment and which have be table by the snp note that no substantive change have be make to the bill provision since we discuss it some week ago in this place it be no more responsive to the need of the climate the energy sector in scotland or bill payer who be haemorrhage money on their energy bill we know from the appropriation of scotland energy wealth by thatcher in the cameron cut the green crap at the beginning of this conservative regime and the weak minded and politically naive roll back of the green transition measure by the current prime minister that time and time again the tories will never look after ordinary worker scotland or the environment my hon friend be make an excellent start to his speech do he agree that it be outrageous that the prime minister have masquerade this legislation as way of reduce energy bill for consumer give that even the secretary of state could not defend those claim do he also agree that this government only intention be to unlock as much tax revenue from the north sea oil and gas sector as possible and that no consideration have be give to reduce domestic energy bill to energy security or to reach our climate commitment agree entirely with my hon friend she touch on some of the key element that will address in this speech in order to salvage some semblance of responsibility equity from this bill urge member to support the snp amendment they seek to amend the provision to facilitate licence issuance on case by case basis rather than it be do annually and by prescription that be reasonable improvement to the bill by any measure we would also like to incorporate real test for new issuance that would require the north sea transition authority to assess whether new licence will low energy bill for bill payer deliver energy security and reduce reliance on import fuel source for domestic consumption enhance sustained job security for the oil and gas workforce in area of the uk that be economically reliant on the oil and gas sector guarantee funding for domestic refinery to increase capacity to process sustainable fuel source and stimulate the north sea oil and gas sector to meet commitment set out in the north sea transition deal the snp also wish to ensure that henceforth of tax revenue from oil and gas be invest in the just transition just transition test would have to be meet for any give relevant year under which the nsta would issue new licence only if it assess that they will support the delivery of the north sea transition deal greenhouse gas emission reduction target of by by and by against baseline in order to meet the sector aim of net zero basin by and the secretary of state have provide funding to support the development of the renewable energy sector in area of the uk that be economically dependent on the oil and gas sector equivalent to tax revenue collect from uk oil and gas production that amendment mean that new licence can not be issue unless it can be show that the licence will meet the north sea transition deal greenhouse gas emission reduction target and unless the uk government be fund the renewable sector in oil and gas dependent area to at least the value of oil and gas revenue the hon gentleman be speak about condition for grant new licence but the snp draft energy strategy include presumption against any new licence be that his position be the snp position that there should be no new licence for oil and gas exploration be grateful to the hon gentleman for that it be lovely to see he in his place we know that he be busy man with his other two job be sure that hansard will correct if my memory do not serve correctly but believe that we rehearse this issue on second reading let point out to the hon gentleman who be certain be an ardent unionist that the position of the devolved government and whoever they be be irrelevant in debate what we do with oil and gas licence in the uk because sadly scotland oil and gas endowment as he well know he make excuse for this regularly be control remotely by dysfunctional uk government whoever they be so the point be moot will the hon gentleman allow to intervene just to provide clarity no will not the last snp amendment will prevent this government and the soon to be instal labour government from simply use scotland north sea oil and gas revenue to fund tax cut in the uk state that be demonstrably not pay its way in the world both labour and tory two cheek of the same face where scotland be concern will sacrifice scotland economic industrial and material welfare and those work in the energy sector if it will win they few more seat in this place they have do it before and they will do it again while we remain in this break and discredit union the prosperity that come from oil and gas in scotland be finite be not sure if the hon gentleman have move on from his glow appraisal of the north sea transition deal but can take it from his reference to that deal that the snp position be to support and welcome it in its entirety be not go to meet the hon gentleman ambition to nail those colour to the mast but will tell he that through the bill the uk government be turn blind eye to the implication of free for all when it come to emission and who benefit from revenue receipt be sorry if he find that difficult but he will to have to deal with it the prosperity that come from oil and gas in scotland be finite as we know all too well we have see what deindustrialisation with no transition plan look like we witness it at first hand in the when coal steel and heavy industry be all tear asunder on the altar of monetarism and share price in the city of london that be set to happen again for oil and gas under thatcher willing disciple the leader of the labour party and the prime minister we can not allow that to happen again it be therefore essential that north east scotland and other area reliant on oil and gas be afford the investment require that be what our amendment speak to it be about create new job and transition in manage strategic fashion to accelerate our post carbon future on that point will the hon gentleman give way no that be just ambition for just transition the billion of pound still to be yield from oil and gas revenue must not be waste on doom capital infrastructure project such as or use to fund exorbitant false economy such as nuclear power station in england it be moral and economic imperative that revenue be use to accelerate genuine just transition to protect job in response to my previous intervention the hon gentleman say that the scottish national party position on this issue be irrelevant but of course it be not it be vitally important the snp draft energy strategy say there be presumption against new exploration for oil and gas do he support that that question speak to mis representation there be no point in give way to the hon gentleman if he be go to misrepresent in that way what actually say be that it do not matter who be in government in devolved assembly where energy policy be decide by remote control from dysfunctional westminster government that be the beginning and the end of it if the hon gentleman do not like it then he be welcome to join the snp well perhaps not we know the fact on the ground the oil and gas sector be in decline because of finite reserve and because it be to be consider an industry with limited future whereas the green transition have an unlimited future job have already decrease in the sector government members be give the impression that with unlimited licensing there will be unlimited job but that be not the case job have decrease by since despite new drilling licence in five separate auction round production of gas in the north sea have already fall by two third since and will fall further with new licence as oppose to without the issuance of new licence in and of itself will not shift the dial especially if the revenue from scottish oil and gas continue to disappear into the black hole that be the treasury what be need be wholesale redistribution of fiscal receipt from scottish oil and gas to the renewable transition ringfence and guarantee by statute in scotland we be apt to wonder what we get for the billion in tax receipt from scotland oil question now be mirror for our renewable endowment note that member on the government benches have desist from repeat the nonsense that energy bill will be lower if we grant unlimited licence and not before time what will lower bill be ensure that the renewable energy we generate can find its way to consumer without need to be turn off because the grid can not cope after year of non investment by the tories new grid infrastructure will lower bill by dial gas out of the system government member talk about the relentless need for more and more gas as if that do not speak to flaky ambition on just transition it expose it and lay it bare we will dial gas out of the system by have network that can connect scotland renewable energy to the market where that be require and we will do so with proper investment in sub sea line rather than by scar scotland with metre pylon it be pity that the uk government would not invest the billion that they be plough into nuclear into environmentally optimal grid improvement instead of default to pylon and overhead line the bill be part of an ill fated tory miscalculation on make just transition wedge issue we know that because the bill be non existent solution to non existent problem some new licence be grant in and licensing round have be hold by the north sea transition authority every year and half since if the bill be the answer then be not certain what the question be it undermine the independence of the nsta by force it to hold new oil licensing round every year whereas currently the nsta undertake licensing round when it deem that they be require it be challenge so unwelcome that the nsta board unanimously agree that this legislation and the annual licensing round be unnecessary this be what happen when the energy sector so vital to broad base developed economy like scotland be subject to remote control renewable already account for the equivalent of of scotland gross electricity consumption yet we still pay sky high energy bill because of the amount of gas require for generation in england due in no small part to the tories small minded hysteria surround onshore wind and their year old ban on development of onshore invest far in the green hydrogen sector in scotland could support up to job it be pity that member on the government benches will not focus on that opportunity and it would add up to billion to scotland gross value add by further development of our renewable sector represent an extraordinary export opportunity for scotland one that we must grab much more instead of look back we should look to the enterprise of the future the hon gentleman rightly mention the sky high energy price that people in scotland face even though scotland generate so much energy what role do he think zonal and modal energy market modelling rather than one size fit all uk wide approach would play in substantially reduce energy cost in the like of sutherland in scotland and also in england in place like surrey everybody would be winner if we move away from the uk wide model and towards the zonal and modal method the hon gentleman raise an interesting question there have be lack of investment and the network that deliver energy around gb be design for small number of very large generator it be ill equipped to deal with many small system of generation that be why we find ourselves switch off wind turbine and where the demand still exit replace they with gas much to all our constituent cost and misery the failure to transition in the electricity distribution network across gb be exactly the same failure we see in our dependency and desire to keep look backwards we should transition from hydrocarbon to renewable in way that respect community in closing we should grasp scotland bright future with both hand in so do we will rid ourselves of the mismanagement of successive uk governments in westminster before bring in some of those who may not have table amendment remind member that we be at committee stage so discussion be of the amendment however as we be also discuss clause and stand part there be perhaps little more scope as mention on second reading the bill be of particular interest to because the oil and gas industry have play significant role as major employer in the waveney and lowestoft area for nearly year moreover the offshore wind industry and other low carbon energy technology such as nuclear and hydrogen will provide exciting local job create opportunity for generation to come dame rosie also chair the british offshore oil and gas industry all party parliamentary group as mention in the debate on january there be sound reason to support the bill in its current form as great deal have happen geopolitically in the past two to three year however as we have hear today some say that the bill be unnecessary because licensing round have in any case be hold on broadly annual basis up to the licensing round that open in be also mindful that give the enormous amount of private sector investment that we need to leverage in so as to secure the transition and deliver our net zero target there be need for both consistency of message and the avoidance of political meddling in the previous debate highlight that one of the conservative government most notable achievement in recent year be the creation in of the oil and gas authority which now operate as the north sea transition authority and which have correctly acknowledge that the delivery of net zero be its core mission also express the worry that the bill undermine the independence of the nsta it be through this prism dame rosie that consider these amendment many of which be well reason and well intentione the nsta work on deliver net zero derive as we have hear from the north sea transition deal which be an agreement between the uk government and the oil and gas industry facilitate by the nsta this should be the forum through which the amendment before we today be negotiate by pursue this partnership approach we shall retain the confidence of an industry which as have mention previously be globally footloose and which we need to deliver net zero and to secure the enormous job opportunity that be potentially available last month the east of england energy group publish its five core principle for energy in the east of england it also set out what be need from government so that it can deliver its vision its requirement include stable fiscal policy so as to boost investor confidence and project progression and stable and predictable regulation and policy mechanism that foster investor confidence and support energy security and the uk progress on meet its decarbonisation target it be against those parameter that we should judge the amendment would add that the opposition green prosperity plan have alarm industry and place at risk the inward investment that be so badly need however that be debate for another day on second reading suggest that we should consider more ambitious climate compatibility checkpoint and bring forward ban on routine venting and flaring those be sensible ambition as have say but they do need to be work up in conjunction and partnership with the nsta and industry and not impose on they on amendment and new clause it should be add that the nsta have good track record with regard to both venting and flaring and marine spatial planning my hon friend mention the role of the nsta in the facilitation and delivery of the north sea transition deal which as he say be negotiate between industry and the uk government do he agree that what he be advocate be precisely the purpose of the north sea transition deal to facilitate the delivery of energy transition to net zero my hon friend be quite right the north sea transition deal be the foundation stone on which we should be build involve industry involve the nsta and give industry the confidence to make the significant investment that we need the north sea transition deal include the target to cut greenhouse gas and emission by by and by by the nsta want to halve emission by it be also commit to all new development have no routine flaring and venting with zero routine flare across all north sea platform whether new or existing by at the late good progress be be make although figure be not yet available for emission be reduce by between and while flaring have be reduce by over the same period in addition to tracking monitor and reporting performance the nsta closely scrutinise operator application for flare consent push back against request to increase flaring and have order operator to restrict production to stay within agree limit it have where necessary issue fine for breach on marine spatial planning the nsta follow precautionary approach and be acutely aware of the need for co ordination and collaboration in what be increasingly crowded and sometimes very sensitive and precious water it be thus work closely with such organisation as the crown estate and the marine management organisation in deliver the marine spatial prioritisation programme of the department for environment food and rural affairs in conclusion the bill and the amendment raise very important matter but to tackle they properly we need to adopt long term approach that transcend the four to five year political cycle and that fully involve business rise to support amendment and and to speak to my amendment and on energy efficiency test and amendment and on the energy charter treaty let start with amendment at the moment the energy charter treaty of which we be member be fail international treaty it bind we to any contract that we sign for oil gas or any energy once it be sign we can not get out of it without pay the hope value of that contract what mean by the hope value be that member do not pay the actual material value if it want to stop that contract now it have to pay all the potential value of that contract if the oilfield for example be fully exploit the treaty have cost other european country billion and billion of pound when they have try to implement climate mitigation policy it be dangerous because the decision be make not by british court or by international court with british judge but by secretive tribunal where the corporation get to appoint the people who make the deliberation it be so outrageous that european union member have agree to withdraw en masse they be currently negotiate on how to do so in co ordinate way and to do side letter with each other to ensure they be not bind by the year clause under which any extant licence that have be sign must continue to be honour even after withdrawal what have that get to do with this because if we sign more licence while we be still part of the energy charter treaty the minister be bind the hand of future generation if we withdraw from the energy charter treaty as our ally and partner be try to do and then decide to award new licence future government and generation could without penalty withdraw or reduce those licence that very much relate to the bill because be say if you want to do this for short term do not believe the government premise to start least allow future generation and government to come and fix your mess do not bind their hand under international treaty think that that be relevant to the awarding of new licence the fact that so many country be flee the energy charter treaty mean that this be the moment to negotiate with our partner to work out new way forward the british government themselves accept that the energy charter treaty have fail they have try to make significant amendment to it to allow flexibility on climate change goal it have not be possible to amend it which be why european partner be try to withdraw this test would do two thing not only would it avoid bind future generation but it would put rocket up the derrière of our ministers and departments to ensure that they fulfil the pledge of reform or withdrawal which be pledge that we have already make let address amendment and on the energy efficiency test for home heating in reality the big proportion of domestic energy be spend on home heating huge domestic bill will not be solve one iota by the bill as the minister have admit because the product will be sell on the international market and the marginal price at which we buy it back will still be inflate our electricity market which be link to that marginal price will continue to be inflate the good and most efficient way to reduce energy bill and the demand and need for gas the way that we all know need to happen be to ensure that our home meet decent energy efficiency standard the amendment set out that the government need to redouble their effort to ensure energy efficiency before we commit to and invest in new licence for offshore drilling and that we need median rating of band in energy performance at the moment be see as standard and be common in private rental privately let home be the bad in the sector and great help be need we can not continue to rely on government programme that do not touch the side we need proper approach in which we go street by street with council and local government fully fund by central government with clawback in future year however we can not expect our citizen to pay penny out of their pocket up front homeowner be already overstretch with huge additional bill in mortgage market that have be destroy by the government they can not afford an extra cent an extra penny for home improvement that all need to be cover by the government my amendment would incentivise the government to do that and to ensure that we have make every effort to reduce gas demand before we go ahead with the foolish endeavour of drill more oil and gas which will not reduce price will not stop fuel poverty in this country and will not deal with any of our long last problem it would be sticking plaster that do not even stick work with the opposition front benchers on amendment which set out the climate change test so be delighted that they have table it similar amendment have be table by my constituency neighbour the hon member for brighton pavilion caroline lucas it be important to say that we can not meet our climate target if we do not honour and respect the ipcc work and report we be on hiding to nothing if we think that we can keep drill and extract more while meet our energy target remember phrase from the anti war movement such as you can bomb for peace and another about not be able to do something for virginity it feel to that this be very similar thing we be try to do something that be the very opposite of what we want to achieve if the government want to be commit to their climate target and if they think that more licence be need they need to ensure that those licence actively achieve our net zero target be afraid that the bill will not do that it will make thing bad energy bill will continue to be high and it will ensure that we be bind for generation that be why all my amendment should be support be sure that we will push the opposition front bench amendment to vote rise to speak in support of the bill and of all the employee of company right across the country include in my banff and buchan constituency that will play critical and successful role in the uk ongoing energy transition to net zero by remind the committee that for year prior to be elect in work in the energy sector in the oil and gas sector specifically in wide range of role for several different company and in various place around the world also declare that have close family member with financial interest in one of those company which be below the threshold require for register interest can also assure the committee that that financial interest have never have and will never have any bearing on my contribution in this or any other debate on second reading speak about the potential for increase confidence and certainty that the bill bring to the energy industry for many people watch include few hon and right hon member in this place there would appear to be perfectly polarise distinction between maximise oil and gas on one hand and promote renewable on the other the truth exist on continuum between those two extreme however we have in fact be on transition away from the most polluting of fossil fuel towards clean low carbon renewable source of energy for number of decade now that transition be happen at various rate in different part of the world but it be fair to say that the united kingdom be at the forefront as the first major economy not only to legislate for net zero but to set the most stringent decarbonisation target the conservative government have preside over the uk become the first major economy to have reduce carbon emission by from level that compare to only that have be achieve by the time the conservatives come to power in we have effectively transition away completely from coal power and continue to reduce our demand for oil and gas and increase our renewable and low carbon capacity but not as fast as our domestic supply will continue to decline even with new production critical point that need to be reinforce in consider this legislation be that new oil and gas do not mean more oil and gas mistake that hear in the speech of the hon member for brighton kemptown lloyd russell moyle even with new production the north sea transition authority predict that uk oil and gas production will decline not by the to suggest by the international energy authority to stay within the global target but by twice that rate of decline at around we be today dependent on oil and gas for our energy need and not just for electricity generation but for heat and transportation as well of that about be produce domestically with the rest have to be import the argument for produce our own oil and gas close to home have be well rehearse there be the obvious benefit of have that source of energy under our control not that of other state and country that be not always friendly we have also hear how liquefy natural gas for transportation and shipping that lng halfway around the world to then be de liquefy back into gas when it arrive in the uk can produce up to four time the carbon emission of domestically produce gas we know from the climate change committee that we be likely still to be up to dependent on oil and gas by it therefore follow that carbon capture utilisation and storage will be require for the uk to reach net zero by that include of course the acorn ccs and hydrogen project at st fergus in my constituency and in particular the role it will play in decarbonise gas fire power generation at peterhead what will also be require to get to net zero be precisely those skill technology and supply chain that currently exist and will no doubt continue to be develop within the oil and gas industry however those critical element would sadly no long be available to we if we shut down our domestic oil and gas industry prematurely which be what would happen if the opposition party have their way whether it be the snp presumption of no new exploration for oil and gas direct quote of the snp draft energy strategy or labour just stop oil approach be see some nod of agreement from across the floor but there have recently be something of war of word between the two main party be refer to labour and the snp in scotland follow labour screech turn on its billion year green investment plan of course we on the conservative benches always see that plan as undeliverable without massive tax increase labour announce that it would not only increase the energy profit levy and make it last long but remove the investment allowance will the hon gentleman give way before give way will gently point out to opposition front benchers be not sure whether they be aware of this that the tax rate they be so keen to copy from norway come with an equivalent investment allowance in that country labour plan would remove the investment allowance put future investment across the energy sector even far at risk of course as we hear early labour still maintain its position of ban all new oil and gas licence which have inevitably lead to an outcry from the sector in recent week among other offshore energies uk chief executive david whitehouse have say we remain deeply concerned about what labour proposal could do to our people if we can get company to invest here there be no job it that simple he go on to describe labour proposal as hammer blow to the energy we need today and to the homegrown transition to clean energy that everyone in the uk want to see that be the key point which often go over the head of so many on the opposition benches the skill and technology to deliver net zero be not go to appear magically over the horizon and the talent and expertise in what would become defunct oil and gas industry will not automatically and immediately transfer across to the renewable sector more likely company and their employee who will find themselves squeeze out of oil and gas in the uk will simply move overseas to deliver someone else energy security and someone else energy transition and no doubt deliver oil and gas that we would end up have to import of course the snp have come out of the woodwork to jump on the bandwagon criticise labour approach while completely contradict its previous stance and more than likely that of its scottish green coalition partner in holyrood snp leader humza yousaf say last september that he do not want scotland to be europe oil and gas capital presumably wish to pass that mantle to our north sea neighbour in norway little over year ago in its draft energy strategy the snp state quote again that there should be presumption against new exploration for oil and gas be not sure whether the hon member for angus dave doogan be still look to intervene but wonder whether he would take this opportunity to answer that question be grateful to the hon gentleman for take my intervention even though it be about five minute ago on different subject he make really interesting point in his speech that new licence do not mean more oil and gas conversely have more circumspect and rational approach to licence issuance take it out of the political arena and put it into the bureaucratic space do not mean less oil and gas be sure the hon gentleman will accept that if that be true for one it be true for the other do he not agree with my position and that of my party that as the oil and gas industry continue on its journey to its natural conclusion of much reduce industry for whatever reason the transition to renewable or deplete resource it be much more important and in fact elegant to make sure that those tax receipt be invest in the energy of the future not squander by his majesty treasury find myself look for point that might agree with in the hon gentleman intervention and sadly fail however his point about the decline of oil and gas in the uk have be make time and time again ever since we have be net importer of oil and gas so my point about new oil and gas not be more oil and gas be about manage that decline to make up for the fact that we be not replace that oil and gas generation with renewable as fast as we would like will address that point in more detail in moment those comment from the snp leader just go to show the staggering hypocrisy and inconsistency of the snp but neither the industry nor the electorate be so easily fool particularly in the north east of scotland if ask whether they support new oil and gas licence as we have see today some snp members and dare say some labour members as well may find it difficult to commit to position particularly when face their constituent in the north east of scotland however this conservative government and in particular the scottish conservatives have maintain consistent support for the oil and gas industry the company and the ten of thousand employ from right across the uk we recognise as this bill do the potential for the people in this industry not just to keep our light on and keep the economy move in the near term but to lead the world in show how successful energy transition from oil and gas to renewable can be do sadly as have be confirm couple of time today all his majesty opposition seem able to offer be to lead the world in virtue signal in follow the hon member for banff and buchan david duguid have to say that his speech be one of startling complacency which still seem to be base on the misunderstanding that just because we exploit oil and gas in the north sea that somehow mean that it be our that it get use here rather than be sell on global market at international price so many of we have say that so many time in this chamber but it still do not seem to have penetrate rise to speak in support of my amendment that have be select for debate amendment and before begin in earnest want to emphasise that seek to amend this sham of bill in no way legitimise what be nothing more than political stunt it be not serious piece of legislation rather it be desperate and dangerous attempt to create yet another culture war it will make no practical difference at all give that there have be annual licensing round for most of the past decade with even the board of the north sea transition authority express the unanimous view that this legislation be not need the amendment have table be design to expose the falsehood that have be tell by the government in attempt to justify new fossil fuel extraction in the midst of climate emergency the first be that new oil and gas licence can in any way be compatible with deliver our climate target and the second be that prop up oil and gas can possibly be in the interest of worker rather than genuinely engage with the need for just transition and the practicality of how it be deliver will first address my amendment and take together those amendment would insert new climate test into the bill alongside the government carbon intensity test and the net importer test which as we know be not so much robust assessment as they be free pass to pollute the climate test be very simple it would be meet in give year only if the ipcc find that current global fossil fuel infrastructure will not emit more greenhouse gas emission than be compatible with limit global heating to accord to the climate minister the right hon member for beverley and holderness graham stuart that critical threshold be supposedly the government north threshold that as we all know be pass for the first time across the entirety of last year therefore hope that the minister will support my amendment which would ensure that propose licensing round do not undermine global effort to secure safe and liveable planet for the future and keep that north star shin indeed as mention early the un production gap report have warn that government already plan to produce more than double the amount of fossil fuel in than would be consistent with limit heating to if we look at what the ipcc itself have say its sixth assessment report be clear project emission from exist fossil fuel infrastructure without additional abatement would exceed the remain carbon budget for close to home the climate change committee observe in its late progress report expansion of fossil fuel production be not in line with net zero regardless of the claim from conservative members that the uk will continue to need some oil and gas up to this and again use the word of the climate change committee do not in itself justify the development of new north sea field indeed last month its interim chair professor piers forster be force to correct the chancellor on this front reiterate uk oil and gas consumption need to fall by over to meet uk target this be especially critical because as reiterate on second reading the uk do not operate in vacuum and issue more licence in the wake of which see agreement to transition away from fossil fuel will encourage other government to go against the spirit of that commitment this be doubly the case give the uk historical responsibility for the climate crisis which require we to show leadership now in model the transition away from fossil fuel not double down on the very thing that be drive planetary breakdown more uk production will not displace extraction elsewhere it will fuel it and support large global market however much minister seek to distort the truth planetary boundary can not be appease by warm word as the un secretary general say at the opening of the degree limit be only possible if we ultimately stop burn all fossil fuel not reduce not abate phaseout now move on to my second test the just transition plan test as set out in amendment and frankly be sick and tired of the government use oil and gas worker as an excuse to issue new licence pretend that no transition be the same as just transition and ignore the fact that fail to act now actually leave those worker and community bad off and in the lurch later on the choice we be face be between manage and fair worker lead transition now or chaos later on when the reality of the climate crisis bite more fiercely and project in the north sea be no more than stranded asset leave community once again leave behind and hollow out offshore energies uk have itself observe in its workforce insight report that the time to act be now there be crucial window of opportunity for the workforce between and it go on to say that this be when the uk supply chain capacity can be sustain and that the transferability of the offshore energy workforce can be optimise be very familiar with the report the hon member have just quote do she recognise that what offshore energies uk be refer to the goldilocks zone as have hear it describe be the point at which we need to make maximum benefit of the skill supply chain and technology that currently exist in the oil and gas industry so that we can make the good use of those skill to deliver net zero the good way to make use of those skill be by make sure that we put resource behind those worker so that they can make the transition which so many of they want to do into renewable right now those worker be actually have to pay to make that transition themselves they have to pay for the training interruption they do table an amendment to previous piece of legislation on education and training to try to make it much less onerous for oil and gas worker to shift into say the renewable sector we need to have those plan and we need the resource behind they to make that lot easy than it be today the result and the reality be that the number of job in the oil and gas sector have already drop by more than half over the past decade despite hundred of drilling licence be issue the just transition plan test would be meet in year if the oil and gas authority assess that all exist seaward area production licence holder have publish just transition plan for their workforce that be compatible with limit global heating to amendment specifie that those plan must be agree through formalise collective agreement with union and that they apply to all worker whether they be directly or indirectly employ or self employ which be vital with the heavy casualisation in the oil and gas workforce indeed report in reveal high level of concern about job security and working condition in the oil and gas industry and that of survey worker would consider move to job outside that particular sector furthermore give the opportunity to retrain to work elsewhere in the energy sector more than half would be interested in renewable and offshore wind worker be ready to lead just transition yet more recent report have reveal that company be increasingly announce net zero target but there be no example in the uk oil and gas sector of worker involvement in decision making on decarbonisation that must change this amendment would be step towards deliver just transition that would see worker at the centre of transition planning with clear and accessible pathway out of high carbon job rather than prop up job that we know be not go to exist in the future the government should be actively support worker to transition out of the oil and gas sector now while also address their very real concern such as the cost of retraining which be often bear by worker themselves or the inferior employment protection offshore which can lead to wage under cutting there be even some case of seafarer work in the offshore wind sector be pay below the minimum wage that be scandal and the government should urgently establish wage floor to apply to all offshore energy worker regardless of nationality who be carry out any work on the uk continental shelf the failure to deliver just transition be not an inevitability but political choice if the government be serious about listen to worker and protect job they should have no problem support this amendment which put job security at the heart of the transition note that the hon member for angus dave doogan have table amendment and on just transition but have to say that do have two serious concern first accord to the drafting of amendment the snp test will be meet if the oga assess that new licence will support the delivery of the north sea transition deal emission reduction target yet as we know the reduction by which be in the nstd proposal against baseline be far weak than the reduction recommend by the climate change committee which it say be achievable it be also important to note that this only include scope and emission so it fail to take account of emission produce when oil and gas be burn secondly there be no provision to consult worker as part of this test therefore give that it would fail to deliver worker lead transition and it also exceed the advice of the ccc sadly can not vote for that before conclude offer my support to number of other amendment first support amendment on ban flaring and venting table by the right hon member for reading west sir alok sharma as other have mention norway ban routine flare back in give the lie to the government claim that uk gas have low emission secondly support amendment and table by the right hon member for doncaster north edward miliband to amend the carbon intensity test and to include all gas not just lng give that we import most of our gas through pipeline it be utterly ridiculous to compare uk production with lng that be vastly more polluting there have be much debate today about the alternative of lng from qatar but there have be failure to take into account whether our be more dependent on lng from qatar would in any way change what qatar do about its own production it have be record that qatar will increase its production by by which mean that that energy will be produce and will have certain emission at the end of the process we might have produce something with few carbon emission but it would be well not to produce they at all the hon member make characteristically wise and useful point that figure of be startling and deeply worrying thirdly support amendment and table by the hon member for brighton kemptown lloyd russell moyle hope can call he an hon friend set out home energy efficiency test as we all know by now that be the most effective way of deliver real energy security for household that be struggle so much to pay their bill fourthly support amendment and again table by the hon member for brighton kemptown require the uk to have make arrangement to withdraw from the energy charter treaty before new licence can be award it be totally unacceptable that the government be mandate annual licensing round without have withdraw from treaty that allow company to sue for lost profit the government previously commit to review the uk membership of the ect include consideration of withdrawal from the treaty if propose modernisation reform be not agree at november energy charter conference as understand it those proposal be not even discuss at the conference so may ask the minister when he sum up to say what be hold up their withdrawing from that treaty give that they acknowledge that there be now no clear route for modernisation to progress finally last week it be report that british gas profit soar tenfold last year follow the change ofgem have make to the price cap in the same week government figure show that almost million household well over third spend more than of their income after housing cost on domestic energy bill and it be also reveal that not single new proposal for public onshore wind be make in england last year despite the government policy change those three example be all from just one single week this week and next week there will be more and together they demonstrate the utter failure of this government to make decision that would benefit people and planet and to unleash our abundant renewable massively upscale energy efficiency installation and work to get we off expensive and volatile gas altogether instead each week we see yet more evidence that this tired and divisive government be prioritise increasingly desperate attempt to save their own skin over measure that would improve all our life by ensure that everyone have warm and comfortable home to live in community have be support to make the most of the green transition and our one precious and infinitely fragile planet be finally restore rise to speak to amendment table on behalf of the alba party the choice we face be not between shut down north sea oil and gas and carry on regardless but how to make its continue exploitation compatible with the environmental challenge and to acknowledge the role that oil can and will play in sustainable future for the planet do not disagree with the four broad objective of the uk government proposal and amendment would strengthen those ambition on energy independence safeguard domestic energy supply energy security reduce high emission import protect domestic oil and gas industry job and work towards our net zero target in pragmatic proportionate and realistic way but be not convince that the bill and certainly government policy as it be currently be deliver will meet those ambition if the provision be to be truly apply to all part of the uk as the government state then scotland the source of oil and gas and whose water contain the lion share of carbon storage site can not be leave out of the action depleting scotland industrial capacity have increasingly be the direction of travel from this government in recent year and this strategy will not strengthen the union as they claim they wish to do they should be aware that erode our industry and job will far drive up support for independence they should also be aware that of the scottish population support domestic oil and gas exploitation and of the scottish public support new licence be grant for that purpose our amendment be without question helpful to all those ambition and indeed other and should be support by all side its proposal be pragmatic realistic responsible and most importantly fair the infrastructure in scotland be already in place to meet these objective in the north east we have st fergus and the acorn project in my kirkcaldy and cowdenbeath constituency we have at mossmoran one of europe four cracker plant alongside an lng plant operate by exxon and shell and at grangemouth we have one of the uk current oil refinery reference the point make by the hon member for banff and buchan david duguid with regard to the environmental impact of export oil and gas abroad which should dissuade the government from even consider close the refinery at grangemouth all those operation have interconnect pipeline that be bi directional so the infrastructure be all there and it be completely feasible to transport carbon from grangemouth and mossmorran north to st fergus for offshore storage from my discussion with the operator in my constituency know their carbon reduction team have be willing and ready to look at the opportunity since be elect exxon have recently make multi million pound investment in mossmorran secure its future that be particularly relevant to some early comment on amendment with regard to flaring that be persistent problem at mossmorran where we have an elevated flare that cause light noise vibration and pollution not to mention the environmental impact of the flaring that investment have reduce flare significantly and all plant should seriously consider that to reduce the impact on the community and the environment around they that investment from exxon be well in excess of the modest amount that be require to keep grangemouth go it be multimillion pound investment and significantly more than what be require to keep the refinery operate at grangemouth so engagement with industry be essential if we really want to build confidence as the government claim they want to do but the uk and the scottish government have move with glacial speed on carbon capture and have in particular be hamper by the scottish green party resistance and call for the wholesale closure of mossmorran that have limit progress the capacity for carbon capture and storage in scottish water be enormous the uk carbon capture and storage research community estimate that the uk have between and gigatonne in abandon hydrocarbon field and an enormous to gigatonne worth of storage capacity in saline aquifer most of which be in scotland territorial water this be enough to store carbon worth year of the uk annual emission and of course we expect those emission to go down year on year carbon capture and storage be vital to the uk reach its net zero ambition by but the carbon must be separate or capture from the flue gas before it can be geologically store currently there be three main method of capture post combustion pre combustion and oxyfuel combustion these technology have great opportunity to advance responsible environmental exploration of north sea oil and gas but that require ongoing in field research and development through university and industrial partnership and the development of world class engineering expertise scotland and would extend this to the uk should be in the vanguard of global development but we be not my hon friend the member for east lothian kenny macaskill will make further point on the economic industrial and environmental case in support of the modest investment in retain the grangemouth plant and he have do so in the past not least with regard to the carbon footprint of offshore refinery activity as reference by the hon member for banff and buchan over billion in today money have flow from the north sea into the uk treasury since the oil tap be turn on and over the come year billion more will be raise successive uk government have betray north sea worker since by drag their foot on carbon capture and even though we now have the welcome green light for the st fergus acorn project it be merely an invitation for finance not firm commitment to invest yet the potential success of large scale carbon capture be great in the north sea geology than in any other oil province as equinor have already demonstrate with the sleipner field carbon capture can be at the heart of an energy revolution in scotland but political will and investment be require to make it happen and it be wholly at the mercy of westminster be reluctant to intervene because the hon gentleman be make some interesting point many of which agree with but have burn question he make point about the amount of storage we have around the uk which be equivalent to more than we have produce out of the north sea and we must take advantage of that in his amendment he refer to licensing condition for specific field be tie to have net zero effect through carbon capture and storage he have already explain that carbon capture and storage be typically take from flue gas from the like of mossmorran in his constituency or peterhead power station in mine so how do he make that link between offshore exploration licence and the resultant carbon capture which will be way down the production line the hon gentleman make an important point many of the operator be serious about exploit the resource not just in scottish or uk water but in other country and other country can leverage those type of concession when they grant licence the uk government can therefore make no serious argument that they can not do that one of the refrain we hear during the brexit debate be about the reclaiming of national sovereignty it be one of the reason for brexit one of the most limit factor for job creation in renewable be that contract for difference and european rule prevent conditionality from be apply to the granting of oil renewable and other licence if the uk now have that sovereignty why not use it to ensure that the community that be part of the supply line get some form of benefit out of the process one of the most obvious benefit be to reduce at source through levy on any licence the carbon footprint of the exploitation of that resource that would seem reasonable expectation and certainly we feel it be essential in grant any future licence amendment would create requirement for specific field commitment of net zero carbon footprint as we have just discuss that would be achieve mainly through connection to the carbon capture network the prize be to be world leader in research and development with an economy build on renewable energy of which scotland have an absolute abundance the uk government dither and delay on acorn have go on for far too long it be time for scots members on the government benches and their government colleague to back secure future for scotland north sea oil and gas sector and to back this amendment this february be on course to break an unprecedented number of heat record and the danger of fail to reach net zero be star we in the face this bill fly in the face of our climate change commitment and it will do nothing to secure energy security and nothing to lower energy bill and we liberal democrats continue to oppose it will mention two amendment that we strongly support as they be on area where we liberal democrats have table amendment in the past the bill be silent about methane and need amend we therefore strongly support new clause to prevent methane flaring methane be potent greenhouse gas with time the warm effect of it account for of global greenhouse gas emission it have often be see as quick win methane stay for much less time in the atmosphere but it be still there reduce methane emission be such an obvious thing to do the uk have sign global pledge to cut methane level by and ban on oil and gas flaring and venting in the north sea would dramatically reduce methane emission the international energy agency have say that uk oil and gas operator could reduce methane emission by more than by tackle venting flare and leak that be support by the environmental audit committee and the government commission independent review of net zero however the government track record be not good enough in his last few day in office the former energy secretary the right hon member for welwyn hatfield grant shapps unconditionally approve the new affleck oil and gas field whose operator will be able to burn methane until we must also mandate monthly leak detection and repair activity as we have say in the past it be incomprehensible why the government be on the one hand say one thing but on the other not act we must do something about methane it be complete dereliction of duty if we do not support that new clause the other amendment want to speak to new clause which would insert new energy charter test many of my constituent have voice strong concern about our continue to be part of the energy charter treaty that energy charter test would be meet if we withdraw from the treaty as it stand remain part of the treaty leave the uk vulnerable to compensation claim from investor for the early closure of coal oil and gas plant attempt to modernise the ect to protect country from libel and to drive investment in renewable have fail denmark france germany poland slovenia spain and the netherlands have all announce their intention to withdraw italy withdraw back in why should we not join they the new clause provide vehicle to do that it be incomprehensible that we have to discuss this bill it be bad bill but the amendment have just mention would make it little well wish to speak primarily to amendment and but also support the amendment table by the hon member for north devon selaine saxby the right hon member for reading west sir alok sharma my hon friend the member for brighton kemptown lloyd russell moyle and the hon member for brighton pavilion caroline lucas may begin by pay tribute to the newly elect member my hon friend the member for kingswood damien egan his electoral victory show that party with ambitious climate policy win election and those that choose to pursue culture war be punish at the ballot box hope the government can learn that lesson in relation to this bill which be textbook example of performative politic this bill will not secure british energy independence or help to meet uk or global climate target we know because the energy secretary tell we so herself that this bill will not lower energy bill yet here we be debate this bill instead of focus our mind and time on real solution that will accelerate the energy transition that be already happen all around we that energy transition be not only underpin by strong scientific consensus to address climate change but found in mission to make energy affordable and to unleash new economic opportunity across britain particularly in the region leave behind by previous energy transition pay tribute to all the worker in oil and gas who help to keep britain light on their hard work over many year power our country and their skill will be essential in make britain clean energy superpower that be why we must respect those worker and why we should be truthful with they they deserve no less than that and we in the labour movement remember only too well what happen when community be face with the sudden loss of job we remember the closure of the pit and the community that be leave with nothing because government fail to put in place genuine alternative and just transition know that british exceptionalism be almost an article of faith or mantra with this government but be the first country that sell the last drop of oil be not feasible strategy that be not just because the world sign up to transition away from fossil fuel at cop but because the north sea be decline basin that be nearly empty new licence between now and will only provide day of gas that be just four day of gas every year say that we will expand oil and gas licence in decline basin and pretend that that will make any real difference to job in the north sea be nothing short of dishonest it may provide campaigning material to pretend otherwise but people livelihood be more important than political game playing and we ought to stick to the fact it be fact that for the past year the government have sustain support for new north sea drilling and in the past decade they have hand out new drilling licence across five separate licensing round yet it be also fact that more than job in and around the wide oil and gas industry have be lose in that same period no matter where we look whether it be to the uk climate change committee the north sea transition deal ey transition economics or elsewhere the projection be the same there will be further decline in oil and gas employment in fact research by the university of aberdeen have find that the decline of oil and gas be already visible in place such as aberdeen and can not be reverse regardless of new licensing or other attempt to bolster the oil and gas industry an honest bill would set out the fact clearly and seek to manage that transition not to ignore it feel almost oblige to intervene if only to agree totally with what the hon member just say the aberdeen university study relate specifically to the decline over previous decade we have lose lot of worker in the industry not just because of the decline in production but because of new technology and the desire to remotely operate offshore platform in the interest of safety there have be decline what he seem to be miss be that we be talk not about return to the glory day of peak production in the late but manage that decline with reference to how much energy we need as be mention we need to promote goldilocks period in which we make the most of the skill and technology in that industry for the renewable base future the hon gentleman be absolutely right to say that we must manage the decline but we must manage the decline in the community livelihood which be not necessarily the same thing if we make sure that we have just transition and introduce support for retrain and gain skill as outline in the amendment that be support he will find that his constituent and many other around the country will much well weather that decline and prepare for the sort of future that we want the bill unfortunately do the opposite it ignore the hard work people directly employ in today oil and gas industry and the further individual support by the supply chain it provide false hope it send confusing signal to energy company to investor to the global community and indeed to union and the worker they represent it pretend that nothing need to change that business can continue as usual and that job in oil and gas be safe the government be act as if maxe out the north sea can happen indefinitely or at least until they be no long in office and therefore do not have to pick up the piece amendment set out the need for formalise collective agreement with union and the workforce to create just transition plan in spain we have see what can be achieve when government business worker and union come together the just transition agreement that the spanish government have negotiate with affected worker union and business be popular economically responsible and environmentally sound it be settlement for all involved that be the approach that ought to be take in the north sea the region need new settlement in which there be an increase in domestic manufacturing new generation of renewable such as green hydrogen turbocharge employment in energy intensive industry the technology of carbon capture usage and storage and the uk unique storage capacity for sequester carbon can provide new service that be exportable to the world the benefit of the energy system be share fairly job be truly safe and secure and above all those community who be once the proud purveyor of our fossil fuel energy become our proud sequesterer of the world emission and the champion of the renewable powerhouse of the future before conclude want to mention one further spurious reason that the government have put forward to justify the bill that it stop we from be dependent on oil and gas from dictatorial regime such as russia yesterday in the house my right hon friend the member for barking dame margaret hodge point out that loophole in our sanction regime mean that country such as china and india import russian crude oil process it and then sell it to the uk as refined oil in we import million barrel of that oil that mean we send something like million in tax revenue to the kremlin war chest britain be also the big insurer of russian oil move by sea most of which be sell at price well above the price cap again violate sanction if the government really want to stop such dependence they could tighten the sanction regime they know how to do so but they do not will not vote for this piece of century legislation that instruct the house to look backwards and not forwards will not vote to make britain cold and poor will not vote to increase flooding will not vote to leave community and worker behind will not vote to lock volatile fossil fuel into our already break energy system sadly we must wait for future parliament and trust future government look forward to work with member from across the house in pursuit of those goal rise to support amendment in the name of my hon friend the member for kirkcaldy and cowdenbeath neale hanvey and in particular subsection to propose new section which relate to grangemouth there be something perverse and absurd about use scottish oil if scotland refinery be to close we have to transition it have to be just transition which can not just be glib phrase it must also be pace because we can not get there overnight in my constituency of east lothian we can see the turbine on the lammermuirs and we can see they grow in number daily and the growth in the number of column as offshore wind capacity come but we require fossil fuel to deliver that renewable capacity we require diesel for the truck and marine diesel for the ship out set the column and turbine we also require the plastic that go with much of that so we need to continue use and exploit oil to get to renewable future we have to do so at pace that be appropriate but also ensure that our country benefit that be why subsection be so important there be something perverse in the fact that scotland be energy rich yet people face fuel poverty in my constituency we be not see the benefit in employment that should come from be in county that be so energy rich the county face the same problem as scotland it be energy rich yet people can only look wistfully at the turbine offshore while they be unable to pay their bill we must ensure that we get job and work here the refinery at grangemouth be pivotal to that grow up not in east lothian but in west lothian the grangemouth refinery have be there for century since not for north sea oil but for its precursor the shale industry which be centre in west lothian from which come bp paraffin young and other bp be the centrepiece along with imperial chemical industries in its various iteration it be now petroineo the refinery initially deal with the shale industry but once north sea oil be discover we use it for that oil the forties pipeline come ashore from the north sea at cruden bay and oil be pip down to grangemouth because it be mean to be refine there grangemouth be also capable of refine oil from elsewhere pipeline run from finnart in argyll through to grangemouth which allow oil import from abroad to be refine in scotland yet we face situation where unless we support the amendment grangemouth refinery will likely close although spat have be go on between the snp labour and the tories about the north sea and its oil little have be say about what be happen at grangemouth the threat have be grow and action from the government both here and in scotland have be in inverse proportion to that be sure that the hon gentleman will have hear reference grangemouth and its future in my contribution support his ambition to maintain our hydrocarbon future at grangemouth as long as it can be sustain economically and environmentally do he agree that if we be to prevent the jeopardy that worker at grangemouth face from ever re emerge we need to make sure that sustainable aviation fuel biofuel and hydrogen be an integral part of grangemouth output we need to ensure that they overlap with hydrocarbon and leave they behind have have discussion with the shop steward and union whom the scottish government may wish to follow and not brush off with cursory meeting we want biofuel strategy for grangemouth but that be for some significant time in the future unless we act now the refinery could close in biofuel will not be refine in grangemouth or anywhere else in the shop steward and the union wish we to get to biofuel and grangemouth must be declare hub for that but if it be to survive until then we must ensure that it be refinery not simply terminal and that we maintain those skill it be absurd that we will continue to exploit scotland oil yet its refinery will close there be something perverse about that scotland will be the only major oil produce nation in the world we be rank no along with the uk in the top oil producer that do not have refinery capacity that will put we with large develop country that produce less oil we will join club host by the like of the republic of congo and trinidad and tobago be sure that they be lovely country have never visit but they be not develop nation with an industrial economy the danger be that we will become develop nation in term of our industrial base it be not simply about the refinery the job there be important five hundred could go and thousand of contractor it be cluster that be why talk about bp and imperial chemical industries because ici cluster where bp refine petroineo and other now do it and we have to maintain that first it be fundamentally wrong that scotland should as nation lose its refinery capacity secondly it be absurd that in this world in which we see rocket attack on maritime vessel we risk our energy security the oil that go in and out of the clyde or the river forth will not necessarily be subject to attack by houthis but our energy security be lessen if we do not have and produce our own oil let we remember that of scotland fill station be provide by grangemouth the entirety of scotland aviation would be threaten and not just international flight because in scotland domestic flight to ireland and remote community be vital we would have no control over that and no impact on it energy security dictate it and so do the economy the loss of skill have happen in previous industrial closure such as the coal mine or ravenscraig we must remember that it be not just the current generation who lose those job grow up many year ago now not far from grangemouth when people leave school if they do not go to the pit lot of they go to bp and ici petroineo and its predecessor train lot of people who have skill in industry that we require even if they only work there for few month after their apprenticeship this be loss of skill not simply for one generation but for future generation it be loss to country that badly require skilled labour because we have shortage of it the young workforce there know that there will not be alternative employment by nip along the or the many will have to go south or go abroad our nation will lose as result there be argument about the extent of the economic devastation the put forward by petroineos be too high but it be certainly approach of scottish gdp that would be lose by the refinery become terminal that be simply unacceptable there be the economic argument but there be also the environmental argument those who oppose the continue use of refining have to bear that in mind people say the emission at grangemouth be dreadful have grow up there know that there be emission and the plant have take action but the footprint will be bad do some research and the house of commons library be very supportive the emission that come from the refinery at grangemouth would be replace and supersede gargantuanly by bring supertanker in and out oil will go out come ashore at grangemouth from the forties pipeline to be bring back in by another supertanker and sell in scotland we will face the ignominy of lose the skilled job then have to pay premium for the oil we import and have significant emission people have see the quotation for the emission that come from cruise liner in comparison with private car thousand if not ten of thousand of private car it be exactly the same for supertanker the average supertanker use gallon of marine diesel every day we will increase the number of ship go out and come in it be not just in the firth of forth we will be import into finnart in argyll because that be part of the plan have lose the refinery capacity the bonny bank of the clyde will not be so bonny when supertanker be come in what about the consideration of the risk ask parliamentary question about that and there seem to be no risk what about the environmental risk of increase traffic on the forth and the clyde if there be spillage or an accident with vessel we do not want to be another alaska ship have to come in and out at the end of the day if we have refinery capacity we should use it and we should maximise it because it guarantee economic security and retain the economic base of an industrial and developed country it be environmentally more sensible to refine it there with reduce emission than to spew out carbon footprint in supertanker go hither and thither out of the forth and the clyde around the uk and indeed around the whole of northern europe if not beyond on that basis it be about time that we commit into statute that scotland oil will be refine in scotland refinery our worker and our country should expect no less it be not great deal of money that be be seek we be talk about ten of million to provide the hydrocracker that will increase profitability threefold which the hon member for angus dave doogan should take into account if we do not get that hydrocracker go we will not have plant by the time biofuel be bring into consideration it be for that reason that of the billion that the uk government will get in receipt from the north sea modicum or fraction must be put into ensure that petroineo or its successor remain in grangemouth it be pleasure to take part in the debate this afternoon which have be wide range well informed and genuinely interesting thank member from across the committee for their participation and for play an important role in scrutinise this important piece of legislation before move on to specific amendment will if you allow dame rosie briefly outline the importance of this bill the uk lead the world on tackle climate change and be the first major economy to halve emission the bill will protect job tax receipt and sovereign capability so that we can continue that world leadership as one of the world most decarbonised major economy the uk remain dependent on oil and gas and will continue to be albeit in reduce amount accord to the climate change committee even when we be at net zero in we will require oil and gas however we be net importer and as have be discuss uk production be fall fast the ambition of the right hon member for doncaster north edward miliband to destroy uk supply ignore industry the union and his own back benchers and would simply replace uk oil and gas with high emission import that be at the heart of this that be why we want to pass this legislation it be because of the policy of the party opposite the hon member for angus dave doogan look little confused the party opposite be very clear that they want to end new licensing and we would thus have to import more from abroad it be as simple as that that would mean more lng which have four time the embed emission of domestically produce gas that be the reality that be at the heart of the bill that be why it be so important that we legislate today to send signal to industry that continue fast decline production in the north sea be the right thing to do environmentally economically in term of tax on every front if it be not we should not and would not do it will the minister give way will make little more progress annual licensing will improve our energy security and that of our neighbour it will support job and safeguard billion in tax revenue and as my hon friend the member for banff and buchan david duguid set out so well it will safeguard the skill need for successful energy transition hon member can listen to everyone from offshore energies uk to robert gordon university for evidence of the need for that these thing be not in tension they mutually complement each other and need to be support be the minister go to give way promise to come to the hon gentleman before finish turn to the amendment select today first thank my right hon friend the member for reading west sir alok sharma for amendment on flare and venting as have be discuss the guidance from the north sea transition authority be clear that all new development should be plan on the basis of zero routine flaring and venting the government have already commit to end routine flaring and venting by go far than the world bank zero routine flaring initiative that voluntary north sea transition deal be reap reward base on the late datum north sea flaring be down since and the sector be on track to deliver the target fear that the amendment would risk replace voluntary momentum with slow compliance base more resistant approach from industry however will continue to engage with my right hon friend as the bill move to the other place with view to deliver the end of flare and venting by at the late which be an ambition he and share as do the government with that if the hon member for brent north barry gardiner have not lose his mojo and his moment shall give way to he be very grateful to the minister for give way and no would not lose my mojo on this we all know that there be more oil and gas already in the world than we can use if we be to remain within the threshold do the minister think the climate really care where that oil and gas be use his argument about import imply that he do believe that the atmosphere care the damage will be do the only way we can reduce its impact be by ensure that the propose additional exploration licence be not achieve thank the hon gentleman for his question he have take long and deep interest in this issue for which pay he respect it be the burning of oil and gas that be the primary issue he mention probably have or there be country set out to massively increase their production that be all drive by demand if we as species as globe be to get to net zero we will have to cap well all over the world we will have to leave it in the ground the most important thing be to ensure that the demand curve be go in the right direction despite all the issue challenge and difficulty of maintain our role as the lead major economy in cut emission the uk big challenge in deal with climate change be not domestic despite the difficulty of that it be to get other to join we on net zero pathway the idea of produce our own emission to ever low standard and replace they with high emission product from abroad be for the bird it make no sense will the minister give way be go to press on interruption do not mean to be rude but think be unlikely give his previous performance to be terribly afeare of hear from the hon member for angus turn to series of amendment that seek to place condition on when oil and gas licensing round be run amendment relate to carbon capture usage and storage and the grangemouth refinery the oil and gas sector provide significant portion of the investment that the uk need to go into wind ccus and hydrogen and fear that the amendment would drive that investment elsewhere it would also tie uk production of oil and natural gas to the refining activity of one refinery grangemouth which be sure member across the house would agree be neither practical nor desirable amendment and would result in an inconsistent approach between oil and gas licensing and our ambition for domestic energy efficiency the government already have clear aim for as many home as possible to reach energy performance certificate band by where cost effective affordable and practical that be the minimum standard require to replace fossil fuel boiler with low carbon heating such as heat pump on amendment and we be already review our energy charter treaty membership as far as we be concern there be no long clear route for modernisation we will update the house in due course new clause be table by my hon friend the member for north devon selaine saxby who be right to highlight the importance of achieve strategic co existence between different us while maintain environmental protection work be under way to ensure that we strike the right balance between our different marine priority the soon to be commission strategic spatial energy plan and cross government marine spatial prioritisation programme will ensure as she rightly outline that we take strategic approach to identify future site for marine development and energy infrastructure and that these can co exist with our environmental and wide marine priority appreciate what my hon friend seek to achieve and assure she that the government share her desire to protect the marine environment not least of course in the celtic sea amendment and seek to add an additional climate test to the bill the uk produce far less oil and gas than we need and even with new licence production be expect to decline fast than the average that be require globally to align with the un pathway all that this test would do be stop license and increase dependence on import product like lng which have production emission that be four time high than those of domestically produce gas the right hon member for doncaster north know this he must so what other than ideology and desire to please his just stop oil backer could lead he to table an amendment that could raise emission lose british job and hammer our economy truly it be mystery my right hon friend be make powerful speech be the reality not that reduce producer emission in this country only to increase reliance on import consumer emission be entirely counterproductive for the environment and very damaging in term of public support for the direction of travel my right hon friend be absolutely right that be the absurdity end licence will simply increase our import it will not change our consumption if import such as liquefy natural gas have high emission embed in they they be counter to our net zero aim now turn to amendment and which together add new energy and job security test to the bill the test with its complex set of criterion would damage investor confidence and cause confusion for industry risk our energy security job and the skill and investment need for the green transition we all want to see it would make our system of administration of this area as opaque as the answer the hon member for angus give to straightforward question early amendment and introduce additional just transition test to the bill we be absolutely clear on the importance of achieve net zero basin by and be on track to deliver that we need the skill expertise and resource of the oil and gas industry to support our transition to clean technology maintain oil and gas job so that they be not lose before renewable and other clean technology grow to take up those skill amendment and would alter the propose carbon intensity test to include an assessment of all import natural gas provide the buffer source of supply last winter liquefy natural gas be critical to meet supply and demand fluctuation despite the expect fall in gas demand and continue north sea production in both the uk and norway we be go to become more reliant on lng import which be as have say four time more pollute than produce our own gas if we produce less domestically we import more lng it be very simple and why comparison with lng be the right one to make amendment would require the secretary of state to report on how the carbon intensity test would be affect by include gas other than carbon dioxide international initiative be under way to expand the scope of emission monitoring datum so if and when those effort bear fruit we can use the power in section of the petroleum act to amend the test and bring in other greenhouse gas as colleague across the committee have mention until then it will not assist parliament or the public to produce report about something that be not realistically possible due to lack of international emission monitor datum for gas beyond it be just worth say that overwhelmingly the greenhouse gas footprint of our north sea production be and not those other gas the bill provide certainty for industry to keep invest in ever clean though always decline uk oil and gas production as we transition to reach net zero fail to support the bill could forfeit ten of billion in tax revenue which the opposition have no plan to replace any more than they have any idea how to fund their here today go tomorrow maybe it be back again apparently vital billion plan which be no more it would betray the british worker who depend on healthy oil and gas sector to make living and it would mean more reliance on import lng with four time high production emission than domestically produce gas be grateful to hon member for the interest they have take in the bill and the valuable scrutiny they have bring to it hope they be reassure by what have outline and that they feel able to withdraw their amendment on that basis call on all member to support the bill have listen intently to the minister and welcome his willingness to work together on the issue of flaring and venting what do not hear from he be the clarity that want on whether government would look to introduce an amendment similar to amendment in the other place perhaps that be something we can discuss before the bill return to this house indicate assent be delighted to see the minister nod would just point out that even if the government do not support similar amendment in the other place be fairly confident that similar amendment will be move and expect support in the other place this place will then have the opportunity to opine on that particular amendment so will not divide the committee on this occasion beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment amendment by leave withdraw amendment propose page line at end insert aa the just transition test see section

question accordingly negative clause order to stand part of the bill clause order to stand part of the bill the deputy speaker resume the chair bill report without amendment third read beg to move that the bill be now read the third time it be my great pleasure to thank everyone who have support the progress of the bill recognise the excellent contribution of member from across the house who have engage closely with this important piece of legislation thank those on the government benches who speak for their engagement with the bill in particular thank my right hon friend the member for reading west sir alok sharma and my hon friend the members for north devon selaine saxby for waveney peter aldous and for banff and buchan david duguid for their contribution and the excellent point that they have raise in committee also welcome the robust scrutiny from the hon member for southampton test dr whitehead the hon member for angus dave doogan who speak for the scottish nationalist the hon member for kirkcaldy and cowdenbeath neale hanvey and for east lothian kenny macaskill who represent the alba party and other thank they all for their participation also pay tribute to my official for their work over these past month as well to parliamentary counsel for their commendable work the house authority parliamentary staff clerks and doorkeepers the offshore petroleum licensing bill will give industry the certainty that it need to continue to invest in the north sea to strengthen our energy security and to support the transition to net zero the uk be lead the world on our journey to net zero emission we have the fast reduction in emission of any major economy of any member of the on the planet in fact we recently celebrate not only fulfil and even exceed the target of the sixth carbon budget come out of the landmark climate change act but officially halve our emission since we be the first major economy on the planet to do so even when we have reach net zero in oil and gas will still play an important part in meet our energy need as datum from the climate change committee show as the most decarbonised major economy in the world of our primary energy come from oil and gas those who work in the north sea produce oil and gas there be job support by the industry should not be ashamed of what they do it be the demand end our car our home and our factory that we need to change we need to meet that challenge like don quixote we will be tilt at windmill if we net importer try to make our production the problem rather than demand interruption the hon member for glasgow central alison thewliss who could not be with we early but be very welcome now ask for the evidence of that the evidence be that we have cut our emission more than any other major economy that be not what be ask the minister say that we need to look at demand where be the national insulation programme so that we can insulate all our home and reduce demand in that way there be one the hon lady may not have be present for the previous stage of this bill but as she have be present for other debate in this house can not claim that she be an absentee member so it be extraordinary that she be unaware of the amazing transformation in insulation in this country since be she not aware that in just of home be decently insulate today the figure be well over we be spend billion in this parliament and will commit another billion between and precisely to deliver the transformation that she call for on top of that we have the eco scheme and obligation on industry that be how we have take ourselves from the parlous shameful situation leave behind by the labour party in to one where although there be still much more to do of home be decently insulate the minister be very kind to come to my constituency in northern ireland to look at the potential scheme for sea turbine and the contract for difference arrangement at the time he indicate that whenever the assembly be up and run the contract for difference scheme would be the responsibility of the northern ireland assembly he be very keen and eager to assist the assembly be it his intention to contact the northern ireland assembly to ensure that the cfd scheme can be promote his input into that will make big difference thank the hon gentleman who be consistent champion not only for his constituent but for the clean transition look forward to meet and work with the new minister for the economy who believe have the energy portfolio in northern ireland the bill will give industry the certainty that it need to continue invest in the north sea to strengthen our energy security and to support the transition to net zero the government position be clear we should as far as possible seek to meet continue uk demand for oil and gas from the uk own source that mean continue to use the north sea uk success story that have contribute billion of pound in tax revenue and support an industry of around worker the oil and gas industry with its strong supply chain expertise and skill be vital to drive forward the net zero transition and the investment in clean technology that we need to meet our net zero target we all want the energy transition deliver in an orderly way that do not risk thousand of those job artificially reduce our production from the north sea or ban new licensing would do just that and jeopardise the energy transition our progress towards net zero and our climate leadership not to mention the billion of pound in lose tax revenue the bill be about ensure smooth and orderly transition new licence award under the bill will manage the decline in domestic oil and gas production rather than increase production above current level and they will give industry certainty by send strong signal of support for continued investment in the sector investment that be necessary both for our energy security and to help deliver the energy transition commend the bill to the house it be customary on third reading to start with thank and would like to thank two group of people first thank the civil servant who hold their nose to write this pile of rubbish for the house consideration secondly thank the government for introduce the bill because as number of people will know it have lead directly to the election of new labour member of parliament for kingswood follow the resignation of the former government climate tsar who write the net zero report and have this to say about the bill this bill would in effect allow more frequent new oil and gas licence and the increase production of new fossil fuel in the north sea can also no long condone nor continue to support government that be commit to course of action that know be wrong and will cause future harm he then resign and the rest be history thank you minister for increase labour representation in this chamber by one seat although we hope to have lot more seat in the very near future that be progress the minister have form on this he be the minister in the adjournment debate on fracke some while ago it be not an adjournment debate get it right sorry the opposition day debate on fracke which effectively bring down the truss government as result of the various prevarication at the time thank the minister for that what do not thank the minister for be the completely misleading and almost erroneous way in which he have characterise the future under the bill on licence the bill will do thing that be already do and it will not make any change it will not suddenly increase confidence across the sector because the sector know that the bill be just piece of performative theatre and it will do nothing contrary to what the minister and other have claim to cut energy bill tackle the cost of live or improve our energy security at time when people across this country have suffer two year of crush energy cost and an inflationary crisis drive in large part by our significant exposure to gas price which as we all know by now be set internationally the bill offer no solution the secretary of state herself admit that it would not cut bill and lord browne the former chief executive officer of british petroleum say that it be not go to not make any difference to energy security the board of the north sea transition authority which be responsible for give out licence unanimously agree that the bill be unnecessary and would challenge its independence however even though the bill will achieve none of its state aim it be far from consequence free offshore energies uk have say that if labour policy be implement it could cost this country job and billion of economic value perhaps the shadow minister will respond to that consequence we be talk about what the government be do through this policy that be what we be concentrate on today hope we will have another much wide debate about the effect that comprehensive transition policy for the whole north sea field would have with associate arrangement for the transition of investment energy security and worker and job security in the context of future job and future energy security many people in the industry have already say that that be exactly what we need to secure the future of the north sea it be decline basin its output will not change greatly as result of the measure that the government be propose on the other hand unless urgent action be take to secure holistic transition for the north sea it certainly will not have the investment and the future that so many of we want to see we need to put that overall consideration alongside some people short term concern about what will happen to the oil and gas industry right this minute this have be an extremely crucial issue in the north east of scotland particularly this week do the shadow minister think it be small short term problem that highly skilled worker in that area could lose their job under labour plan they will not have try to make it very clear against what be frankly misinformed scaremongere by government members that under labour plan the north sea will of course continue to produce efficiently and effectively over very long period of time we know that the north sea be very mature field and be in decline and all authority have say that the government proposal would make no difference to that overall pattern we be look at how to make sure that the north sea continue to produce well and efficiently the oil and gas we will need for the future in decline amount while at the same time transform that economy to produce new form of energy for the future and maintain security of production that will be the big task for the future labour government be pleased that the hon member for moray douglas ross be envisage what the new labour government will shortly have to do the long term task in the north sea be not to pump every last drop of oil and gas it contain but to give it new lease of life new industry can come into the north sea alongside the infrastructure that already exist make it new energy powerhouse for the uk in the future can not let that go unchallenged this letter from the aberdeen and grampian chamber of commerce to the leader of the opposition the leader of the labour party in the uk say that if north sea production be to cease prematurely certain outcome of this labour policy then our entire energy transition be undermine this have massive consequence and have to say that the reaction of the shadow minister be quite tell the hon member rather give himself away by the first sentence he read out if north sea production be to cease north sea production will not cease it be certain outcome of this policy north sea production will not cease over long period of time and labour be committed to make sure that that production continue at the appropriate level for the maturity of the north sea basin that be something that all sensible people understand to be the case although it be unfortunate that certain conservative members pretend it be not the case for their own political purpose will the hon gentleman give way will make some progress the bill as have say will achieve none of its state aim but it be far from consequence free the consequence be that it make mockery of our country commitment to take serious and responsible action on climate change that be exactly the point the former right hon member for kingswood chris skidmore make in his resignation letter to the prime minister that point should not be partisan point indeed it have not be partisan point because number of member on all side of the house include number of conservative members can see the direction in which this short sighted prime minister and government be go and want no part of it some member be try to make change to the bill as have say one have resign and number be work hard to turn around the direction of this government in resile from our country climate change commitment commitment they so recently sign up to at the recent cop on move away from oil and gas regrettably the prime minister and the government include this minister be not have any part of that be particularly disappointed that the minister be not have any part of it because of his long and honourable commitment to these matter on the international stage over such long time the right hon member for reading west sir alok sharma the man who lead this country climate negotiation at in glasgow have call the bill smoke and mirror and distraction that will reinforce the unfortunate perception of the uk row back from climate report january vol the right hon member for maidenhead mrs may the former prime minister she sign this country net zero commitment into law and understand as the current prime minister sadly do not the value of cross party consensus on the science of climate change have say that she take different view from the government on oil and gas licence and that they will not provide for our energy security away from this chamber every credible independent expert have take dim view of the bill lord stern one of the uk foremost expert on climate change whose work have shape how the world understand the cost of inaction have call the bill deeply damaging mistake the reality be that the cost of living crisis we be in be to large extent cause by our country deep exposure to the volatile international price of gas the international monetary fund have say that this exposure mean the uk be hard hit by the crisis than any other western nation just today the energy and climate intelligence unit have find that this country have spend an additional in addition to normal billion on gas since the energy crisis begin four extra day of gas supply by can not possibly make the slight bit of difference to this price as have highlight the secretary of state herself concede that point on the very day the bill be announce the suppose argument on energy security and job be similarly flimsy the reality be that as we have begin to discuss this afternoon the north sea be an extremely mature and decline basin gas production will fall by by even with new licence the notion that this be firm basis on which to build our energy security or protect job be clearly absurd as have outline we need fair and balanced transition for north sea oil and gas worker that recognise the essential role they will continue to play in operate exist field which no one dispute will remain vital part of our energy mix and put they at the heart of our clean energy future to safeguard the job skill and livelihood of the community that have be the backbone of our energy system for decade we need government with proper industrial strategy to maximise the low carbon economic potential of the north sea labour will create national wealth fund to invest in low carbon industry it will launch british job bonus to ensure that the supply chain benefit of renewable investment finally come to our shore and it will create new publicly own energy company gb energy headquarter in scotland to invest in home grow clean energy and give we real energy independence that be the answer that the country need and that the community who have serve as the backbone of our energy system for decade need political theatre whether in westminster or holyrood help no one and do disservice to the people look to we for answer to the very real challenge we all face the final argument that the government have make in favour of the bill be that it be somehow as we have begin to unwrap climate positive piece of legislation this argument rest on series of partial and deliberately gameable test as we discuss in committee with skewed condition that look only at narrow band of emission ignore methane for example that look only at production emission ignore the impact of actually burn the fuel we be extract and that look only at liquefy natural gas ignore the fact that the majority of our import be pipeline deliver it include no test whatsoever for oil which make up the majority of remain reserve that be why have sympathy for the civil servant who write the bill who have to squeeze various thing into it such as ignore gas that be come into pipeline only have test against liquefied gas and ignore the methane emission in the various version of the arrangement in place for measure emission from production be very disappointed that the minister give no reaction at all this afternoon to that particular point on methane the datum simply do not exist as think set out it do not exist and we can not make comparison if the data do not exist we be world lead in have that datum other do not have it on the methane comparison we be already below the internationally set goal we have very low methane emission in the north sea on the comparison with lng which be the buffer fuel which be why it be the true comparator rather than norwegian gas which the hon gentleman be fail to admit methane be emit as it be ship so the methane story would make it even bad for lng versus domestically produce fuel perhaps the hon gentleman would put that into his argument would not put it into my argument but be little puzzled under those circumstance that the north sea transition authority recently publish factsheet on precisely this point about the relative emission of various contributor to gas and oil into the uk which look at the contribution from various country and at the various emission level of those contribution and set out how those contribution arise do not know whether the minister be quite up to date with what his own north sea transition authority be do but perhaps he ought to have little look at that because he would see that actually the data be there it do exist and we can draw the sort of conclusion draw this afternoon from it and indeed from number of other international data source that be come in the argument that the marginal unit of gas must always be lng be simply not correct because the bill make no provision whatsoever for the shape of uk gas demand at the point at which the gas be extract and use it effectively assume that our national demand for gas will remain unchanged in perpetuity when we be in crisis cause by our reliance on fossil fuel and commit to net zero transition that assumption be patently wrong hesitate to intervene again but to suggest that this bill have the assumption that our gas demand remain the same be absolute nonsense of course it be come right down we be on net zero pathway we be lead the world in that and our demand be fall fast it be just that our production will fall even fast the hon gentleman should not mislead the house and be sure he would not want to do so think have already indicate that gas production be predict to fall by by the addition of one or two licence will not make any difference at all to that precipitous fall in practice as it will be four day more of gas over the period that be the basis for why we say that the government commitment to net zero transition while produce large amount of additional gas and oil be patently wrong we should be sprint towards clean energy we should be invest in renewable rather than ban they as the conservatives have do with onshore wind we should be save the country billion by move to decarbonise power system by and make far great effort to insulate home and reduce gas demand there on climate change on energy security on job and on bill this bill have nothing to offer but false promise that frankly insult the public intelligence to support this bill we would need to believe that we can double down on the cause of the cost of live crisis and still solve it that we can somehow defy geology in the north sea and change the fundamental nature of international energy market and that we can ignore all the science and credible expert on climate change and still meet our commitment include our commitment to transition away from fossil fuel make by the minister at few short month ago it be clearly nonsense but it be emblematic of government who have run out of idea and run out of road government who can see the many real challenge our country face but have no answer to they beyond confect political drama in their misguided pursuit of political dividing line they have shrink our country on the international stage make we hypocrite in the eye of the world and open the door in this country to new divisive politic on climate change that sincerely believe the ministers sit opposite today be not comfortable with do not want as their legacy and will come to regret profoundly this bill will deliver nothing but it threaten much for that reason urge the house to vote against it it have be interesting follow the process of this bill speak on second reading and sit through most of the committee today and be pleased to speak on third reading to support the proposal bring forward by this uk conservative government the only party support our vital oil and gas industry across the united kingdom and particularly in the north of scotland my constituent in moray many of whom work in the oil and gas industry will be shock and annoy by what we have hear today from those on the snp benches and by the deeply disappointing remark we have just hear from the hon member for southampton test dr whitehead on the labour front bench if he think that misinformed scaremongere from offshore energies uk and from aberdeen chamber of commerce do not deserve to be raise in this chamber he be gravely wrong think it be an indication of labour position it have already turn its back on the oil and gas industry in scotland and by the sound of thing it will only get bad interruption he be look quizzical but let we just look at what be happen in scotland now and at some of the coverage do not know whether the hon gentleman be regular reader of the press and journal but its front page make clear what people in the north east of scotland think about labour proposal the scottish sun say that people in scotland could wave goodbye to ten of thousand of job that be not the paper or the opposition just say that it be paper report what expert in the field be say we know that the labour party change its policy quickly and can only hope this be another of those because its action be have deeply damaging effect be these policy ever implement they would have huge impact on the oil and gas sector and the people who work in it and rely on that oil and gas production ten of thousand of job and livelihood be at risk as we often want to articulate our own view in this chamber think it be only right that we repeat some of the concern raise by the industry offshore energies uk chief executive dave whitehouse be someone who must be listen to on this subject meet he recently on visit to aberdeen he say that labour proposal would deliver hammer blow to the energy we need today and to the homegrown transition he also say these be not faceless number but decent hardworke people work across the uk to provide the energy we will need today and in the future that be an expert view on the labour proposal aberdeen chamber of commerce have describe labour plan as betrayal chris wheaton an oil and gas analyst say the uncertainty create by threaten new windfall taxis be as bad as the tax itself perhaps most powerfully of all last week more than individual firm and trade group write to the leader of the opposition to express their deep concern about what be be speak about by the labour party sadly in scotland we can not get cigarette paper between the labour party and the snp it be almost as if they be in race to decimate our oil and gas industry and want to outmanoeuvre each other both support windfall tax both oppose the rosebank field both be speak about dangerous liberal democrat members think that be funny be sorry but do not think it be funny that ten of thousand of job across scotland be under threat take that issue extremely seriously speak about the snp try to get this out on second reading and in committee be delighted that the hon member for angus dave doogan be still in his place because we have to get to the bottom of this ask he to intervene on and explain whether he as the mp for angus represent north east constituency believe further licence should or should not be grant for production of oil and gas in the north sea do not know about you mr deputy speaker but have just about hear enough from the hon member today for the fourth time government members association between the number of licence issue and the number of oil and gas job protect be specious at well we have be accuse by they include think the hon member of want to put the oil and gas industry in scotland to the sword there be no such plan the leader of the snp and scotland first minister humza yousaf be in aberdeen just yesterday talk about how scottish oil and gas worker must never be leave behind be disappoint in the hon member for banff and buchan david duguid think more of he misquote humza yousaf who say that he would rather aberdeen be not the oil and gas capital of europe but the renewable energy capital of the world that promise vastly more economic opportunity for worker in scotland government members have well start deal with that order remind member that this be third reading and that we should not be reopen argument that be hear in committee or previous stage respect that ruling mr deputy speaker but do not think it be reopen anything because we have not get any far have try at second reading in committee and now at third reading why be it so difficult for snp members who represent community in the north east of scotland to say what be actually in their own draft energy strategy it say there be presumption against new exploration for oil and gas in the north sea the fact that the hon member for angus can not simply stand up and give his own position tell we exactly how people in the north east of scotland feel the snp have breathtake hypocrisy on this issue it want to run down the oil and gas sector it be no friend of the oil and gas sector of course the snp ask the green party into government that tell we everything we need to know be the hon member as confuse as be by the answer give by the hon member for angus dave doogan that somehow or other there be no need for licence to drill for oil to create and protect oil job and that we can protect oil job by not extract any oil from the ground that be just one example of the mixed and confused messaging from the snp which sadly we hear far too much in this chamber we have hear it across the north east this week and it have dominate much of our proceeding will the hon member give way will because this may be our final chance to hear if the hon gentleman believe in the snp draft energy strategy which include presumption against licence for new oil and gas exploration as much as be enjoy the hon member crocodile tear about protect job in scotland wonder if he could give confidence to those oil and gas worker in scotland by highlight an example from recent history when the tories have protect anyone job anywhere it be only this uk conservative government and the scottish conservatives at holyrood who be stand up for an industry that support more than people across the united kingdom and people in scotland we have hear that job be at risk under the labour proposal which be almost identical to those of the snp rise will briefly give way and then will bring my remark to close how do the hon gentleman propose to get to net zero by and temperature rise of no more than our current projection exceed all that all hear be that we have to increase oil and gas production in the north sea but that be the wrong path to net zero how will we limit temperature rise to and ensure that we do not carry on the current trajectory of well over the government do not have an answer for that the hon lady have misinterpret everything that have hear during the debate no one be say that there will be increase production we be look to protect what be happen at the moment and job as my hon friend the member for banff and buchan david duguid say in committee those job will go elsewhere let we make no bone about that they will not stay in scotland or the united kingdom under the proposal of other party they will go to other country in europe and around the world they will drill for oil and gas in those country they will pay their tax in other place and they will ensure that we buy that in as nation at high cost and with great carbon footprint that be why want we to maximise what we can do in the north sea support ten of thousand of job in the north east and right across scotland and the united kingdom and work towards that just transition which offshore energie uk and everyone else be fully behind that be why support this bill and the effort of my right hon friend the minister who have work constructively across the house have have very useful meeting with he the secretary of state and other the bill also send clear message that there be one party on the side of worker in the north east and those in the oil and gas sector across the united kingdom that be the conservative party here in government at uk level and the scottish conservatives at holyrood and across scotland more and more people be start to see that the labour party and the snp be turn their back on these worker and only the scottish conservatives and this uk government be support they the bill be completely lack in merit it seek to solve problem that do not exist the north sea transition authority can issue licence and it have be do so this be potemkin argument specious debate about the issuance or otherwise of licence when this bill pass which it will give the arithmetic in this house it will change not one jot the ability to issue licence or otherwise what it seek to do be put on pedestal and create conflict in what be previously broad consensus about the need for just transition to combat climate emergency in the tone and tenor of the debate today government members in particular have show desire to weaponise that we just hear from the hon member for moray douglas ross who say in his sum up that only the conservatives be stand up absolute and utter nonsense although if be work in oil and gas would not want to rely too heavily on labour if its billion plan be anything to go by it could have include measure to offset the rapacious appetite for more and more licence to drill for every drop of oil and gas within the north sea basin and receipt every available of tax into his majesty treasury it could have do those thing and chuck little bit over the wall to say but we go to put or of all those revenue directly into the just transition that would not have be brilliant but it would have be something but no there be not thing in this legislation to offset the appetite for further and further investment government members have speak at length about the need to ensure that we do not develop gap between that which we demand and that which we can supply it have already pass the uk can no long sustain its own demand we have to import oil and gas from elsewhere but that be myopic obsession with the supply side there be not nearly enough be do by the government after year to mitigate the demand side supply be function of demand the be supply requirement be such as result of that which be be demand if there have be truly ambitious programme at any stage over the past year to insulate house get people into electric vehicle and introduce further decarbonisation of our economy and lifestyle we would not have the demand that we have now the potential gap between that which can supply domestically and that which have to be import would inevitably be less in zero sum game however we do not have any of that will not go over an issue that be not go to get an answer to however the hon gentleman own party have be in government in scotland for year now and the scottish government have repeatedly miss their own climate change target largely because they have not do what he be accuse the uk government of not do how do he reflect on his own party and government in scotland who have not do enough to insulate home get more people into electric vehicle and put in the charging point that we need across the country not for the first time the hon gentleman have stand on political landmine if he think he be go to hold to account on the availability of charge point what he may not know although know he suspect he probably do be that someone want to find anywhere on these island with more vehicle charge point than scotland would need to come to london or the south east of england scotland have many more available charge point for electric vehicle rubbish well we can sort this out later scotland have the third high availability of electric vehicle charger of all geographical area in the united kingdom think the scottish government record be exemplary have as we do one hand tie behind our back due to be member of this non union with the freedom of movement and zero agency that come from be non sovereign state any other normal country could invest into whatever it want and could do so use the normal lever that an independent country would have scotland of course can not do that because it must wait for its cheque every year from westminster if the hon member for moray douglas ross do not like that he know what to do pay tribute to the hon member for banff and buchan david duguid for the work he do in finally grind out some progress from his partner and colleague in government on the acorn project but that just typify the slowness the absolute pedestrian nature of measure to protect consumer and the environment from the large possible demand if we have go into that with proper fund and with ambition and pace five six or seven year ago we would not be in this situation now the snp amendment propose an elegant solution to invest the additional receipt from oil and gas extraction in the north sea basin directly into the renewable transition protect people from high bill insulate their home and get they out of their petrol and diesel car and into electric car as we see in the prime minister roll back on heat pump and electric vehicle further weaponisation of the climate emergency that be not on the agenda of this fag end tory government they be try to scrabble around look for vote but that do not work they have achieve tremendous damage with that approach and judging by recent by election result they have gain zero political capital on the mess that be evident before get heckle by the hon member for moray and my snp colleague urge member to decline the bill third reading rise order proceeding must finish at minute past four people be stand please be considerate to other member so that everybody can get in it be hard to know what more can be say about this farcical and unnecessary bill it feel as if we be run out of adjective take part in this debate listen to the ridiculous heckle from the government front bench almost legitimise this desperate and dangerous attempt to create yet another culture war out of something as serious as the climate emergency but put on record my deep disappointment that the government be play such dangerous game ever since the climate change act be first introduce there have more or less be consensus of kind with recognition on both side of the house that the climate crisis be real and that we need to act fast to address it of course there be difference on some of the detail but not on that substantial issue now however it feel as if we have government who be put all that at risk and that the legislation be all of piece with ministers roll back pledge on home insulation the boiler replacement scheme electric vehicle and so on the ludicrous list we have from the prime minister about all sort of thing he be go to scrap that be never government policy in the first place will add one further argument to those we have hear over the past few hour project such as rosebank will not enhance our security not just because the oil be mainly export but because public opposition to such project and their unlawfulness mean that development be subject to lengthy legal battle that be very real risk would it therefore not be well to accelerate the roll out of clean energy which be much more popular with the public and not give in this case rosebank owner equinor nearly billion in tax break lawfulness be particularly topical today with law case go on right now about whether the government be meet their climate objective and whether the report they have produce contain enough policy detail to persuade the population that we be on track to meet our climate target that also demonstrate frankly that the boosterism we have hear from the minister be entirely misplace complacency do not address the climate crisis or the fact that while the uk once have leadership position on climate it have one no long when listen to some of the voice on the conservative benches sometimes feel as if this place be on another planet from the one that be overheat it be undeniable that we be live through what many be call the sixth mass extinction we be live through risk of earth system collapse scientist be run out of word to describe the seriousness and to try to wake up policymaker to exactly what be at stake we have just hear that there be risk of total loss of late summer sea ice in the arctic that be now bake in and could happen as early as the that in turn be likely to trigger even more extreme weather event in the northern hemisphere through the weakening of the jet stream in the antarctic melt of the sea ice have accelerate dramatically which could lead to cascade collapse of the fresh water ice shelf with catastrophic result for rise in global sea level new research in the amazon have find what scientist call precursor signal of an approach critical transition deforestation and climate breakdown could now cut off circulate rainfall in the basin trigger rapid flip from rainforest to savannah this be what we be talk about here future generation will look back to this time they may even look back who know to this debate and wonder what on earth we be think by give green light to more oil and gas licence when we ask ourselves why that be happen we might also reflect on the role of the fossil fuel lobbyist few week ago when hold an adjournment debate on the subject of the fossil fuel lobbying that go on in this place note that offshore energies uk and its member include bp and shell have meet uk government ministers more than time in the year follow russia invasion of ukraine that be nearly once every work day official report january vol the combined profit of shell and bp alone have reach billion and would suggest that that be not unrelated to the direction of the government discussion today let end by quote from letter from more than uk scientist who write to the prime minister last year urge he to halt the licensing of new oil and gas they include chris rapley former head of the science museum and professor at university college london and mark maslin world famous professor of earth system science at ucl and they all warn against any new development of oil and gas they write if the uk allow any new development of oil and gas field it will severely undermine claim of leadership by contribute to further oversupply of fossil fuel and make it more difficult for the world to limit warming to therefore the uk should commit to prevent any new oil and gas field development and the government should state this commitment clearly there be those who might claim that stop new development of oil and gas field would raise concern about the affordability and security of future energy supply but there be now overwhelming evidence that the uk be far well serve by rapid transition to domestic clean energy source particularly renewable and decarbonisation of our economy double down on fossil fuel will not lower energy bill or enhance our energy security the ipcc report state the choice and action implement in this decade now at time when we be all in decision make position will have impact now and for thousand of year the moment for political leadership be here and now and beg ministers to rise to the occasion there be about minute leave call wera hobhouse it be pleasure to follow the hon member for brighton pavilion caroline lucas who have make powerful case in explain why the bill should never have reach the house this month be on course to break an unprecedented number of heat record and the danger of fail to reach net zero be star we in the face say this again and again and the hon lady have make very powerful point this government in the name of protect job be turn their back on their net zero commitment and find that and the way in which this debate be be run incredibly dishonest if the debate be honest it would reflect the fact that the government have show their true face and be delay the climate action that be so necessary have hear repeatedly throughout the debate we be respond to demand of course there will be demand for as long as we provide unlimited supply and of course the oil and gas industry itself will want to drill for every last drop of oil for as long as it can but it be for responsible government to make responsible decision and to look the danger that confront we in the face the tobacco industry say that there be demand for smoking material and the government have understand their responsibility to stop that demand because smoking be dangerous but they fail to see or understand the danger of climate change we need government who will guide the economy into the net zero future because we need to secure prosperous future in the long term for all people rather than concentrate on short term election issue that may divide member after such long period of consensus on the need to reach net zero while the government claim that new licence will improve energy security the reality be very different between now and new licence be expect to provide an average of only four day of gas per annum all that the bill do be send symbolic signal it do not even meet the requirement that the government have set themselves secure energy for the future of this country that be why think the bill be so dangerous as say on second reading it be introduce for political reason not because the government be genuinely intent on any outcome except electoral gain that be why we should oppose the bill and make it very clear to our citizen that it do nothing for energy security nothing to get we to net zero and nothing to curb energy bill all member of the house in their right mind should oppose this bill call sammy wilson please be cognisant of the fact that the debate will finish at pm and mr foord would like to get in too may first say that we fully support the bill and the objective that have be set as have be say time and again during the debate we will require oil and gas for decade and it may as well be british oil and gas because that mean job in britain tax revenue and reduce our import if we be to continue to use oil there be very good reason why we should give licence for its production find some of the argument make today very strange passionate speech have be make against this bill on the basis that let paraphrase the hon member for southampton test dr whitehead it do not do anything that be not already be do he go far and say that even though that be the case civil servant must have hold their nose when write the bill if it do not do anything that be not already be do why on earth be there such passionate opposition to it interruption member ask from sedentary position about the climate emergency apparently one of the argument against the bill be that it will provide only another three day worth of oil and gas we be hardly go to push up world temperature if another three day worth of oil and gas be drill out of the north sea but we will ensure year of job for people currently work in the gas industry guarantee year of finance for much need public service in this country and guarantee that we do not have to import from other country another argument use against the bill be that it be confected and contrived piece of legislation design simply to be part of the culture war and to drive wedge indeed the hon member for angus dave doogan say it be specious and deal with problem that do not exist the easy way of ensure that the bill do not become confected piece of legislation or drive an artificial wedge be for those who think that it be only window dressing to make it quite clear that they would continue to allow licence to be issue then it would not be confect we would know that either there be real difference or there be no difference be not sure where the labour party stand on this issue but if like the hon member for angus it can not give commitment that there would be licence grant under labour control administration the bill be not confect or specious it be real and people have to make judgment will the bill ensure that our economy and worker can benefit from the oil we have if so this legislation be necessary give the stance that have be adopt by the labour party my great worry in all this be that although the government be try to inject some confidence into the debate it do not give any long term confidence because we will have an election this year and investor will not know whether the argument we have hear today will lead to licence not be grant in the future my second concern which have be allude to by the hon member for brighton pavilion caroline lucas be that because we have establish legally bind target for net zero in legislation the benefit that might come from this bill will not be realise because they will get stick in the court have say this to the minster before and say it again legally bind target leave the government open to legal challenge on every piece of sensible legislation that they try to bring through this house whether it be to alleviate the burden place on people by their heating bill by change the policy on heat pump or to reduce the impact on travel cost by not have mandatory target for electric vehicle could go through whole list of policy this be something that we will have to revisit we give the bill our support tonight we think it be sensible and that it give confidence it also show that the government recognise the reality people will use oil and gas for many decade into the future and we have to ensure that we benefit from the fact that demand be there most people in this country accept that we need energy security that we must move away from fossil fuel to more sustainable energy source and that we must seek to reduce our carbon emission to meet the challenge pose by climate change they see the effect of climate change every day recently in my corner of devon the community of feniton and cullompton show what it be like to experience flash flooding it have cause terrible damage to constituent property and destroy some of their most treasured possession flooding will only get bad and more frequent as the uk continue to suffer the effect of climate change we in the uk have show leadership in this area we should be set an example to the rest of the world on the need to reduce our greenhouse gas emission but also crucially on the economic benefit that the uk can enjoy as result the government claim that by mandate the north sea transition authority to run regular bid for new oil extraction licence they will protect the uk energy security but that simply do not add up because of the oil be export so there will be no material difference to people energy bill and we will still be reliant on import liquefy natural gas we see that in the second invasion of ukraine in it cause huge spike in oil and gas price and leave consumer face spiral energy bill they would not have be nearly so badly affect by that if we have continue to invest in onshore wind in the way we be do in or if we have continue to insulate building in the way we be in the coalition year it be not uk produce oil that would have mitigate those price rise but uk base renewable energy and demand avoidance encourage by more progressive government than this one for example octopus energy note that billion could have be save by consumer if onshore wind have continue to be develop at rate but the conservatives be leave to govern alone and that prospect vanish the uk energy research centre say of this bill fixation on new licensing be distraction it offer comfort in the possibility of conserve oil and gas production rather than grasp the challenge of rapid transition to put it bluntly this be the approach of government who be too scared to embrace the future and make the fundamental change that we need to build well future for our child many on the conservative benches have highlight the challenge of phase out oil and gas as we transition to renewable energy but there be not only challenge there be also opportunity to support new home grow clean energy that will power our home and create swathe of well pay job we can not cling to the past because we be too scared of the future there be an analogy here from over century ago when great britain first embrace oil winston churchill be first lord of the admiralty in liberal government he take office in key point in the anglo german naval race there be big decision on his desk when he take on the role how should great britain power its ship until that point coal have be the royal navy dominant source of fuel it be produce at home in britain and the saying carry coal to newcastle remind we that there be an abundance of coal in britain but that do not make churchill determine to exploit the abundant reserve of that fuel which be power the world large navy of the day churchill sign an order for the royal navy to be power by the innovative energy source of the century which happen to be oil oil be more efficient and allow ship to travel fast far with less fuel it also allow for the innovative design of new ship by this government logic churchill should have put that cutting edge energy source on the back burner and stick to coal the argument make in favour of coal then be similar to those be deploy in favour of the bill today churchill believe in look to the future and seize the opportunity that arise so he take the fateful decision that all new ship in the surface fleet would switch to the more innovative more energy efficient fuel source as result the royal navy continue to dominate the sea and hamper germany international trade and later its war effort today china be work on zero emission shipping the california china climate institute at berkeley be look at century innovation that will power the lead economy of this century if china tune into bbc parliament and see we in our century surrounding it would think it quaint that we be debate which century energy source we should cling to churchill decision in put britain at the forefront of innovation and design allow britain and british talent to reshape the character of the century do conservative members disagree with mr churchill be they daunt by the prospect of seize the opportunity present by new source of energy include renewable energy to power the uk in the century why be they seek to take these short term short sighted decision that fly in the face of our climate commitment this conservative government already offer subsidy to the oil industry and they be already indifferent to the price of renewable energy be tie to the price of gas it be time for rethink it be time to focus on improve the national grid boost home grow green energy and invest in the technology of tomorrow question put that the bill be now read the

let quote proverb train up child in the way he should go even when he be old he will not depart from it although perhaps slightly sexist that be inscribe on the wall of captain shaw church of england primary school in the home village of bootle where live in the lake district it be where my four daughter all go to school where be school governor where welcome my right hon friend the member for maidenhead mrs may in when she be prime minister and where for one year only teach bikeability course as very small school we struggle to find an instructor back in the day determine that our child should not miss out on the essential life skill provide by bikeability volunteer there be many terrifying thing that we all do in life some might say that speak from these benches or from the dispatch box fit into that category but let tell you mr deputy speaker that when your school have just child and you have responsibility for the entirety of year and take they out on the really be quite terrifying of course the child be brilliant they learn all about the brake hone their skill and master the basic of road safety awareness and verify by an independent inspector every child pass the test at the end of the session that provide with heighten appreciation of the bikeability instructor in this country conversely more joyous occasion that can just about recall be find my own freedom late developer be about six year old when start to ride my raleigh comanche affix with stabiliser which now know be more of an impediment balance bike be so much well for little one to learn to ride as observe on ministerial visit to the netherlands with active travel england where see so many child as young as month as young as the minister little boy kitto learn to ride their balance bike in huge municipal hall the slightly old child would practise on street scene get to grip with the highway code the more advanced child would put to shame with their bmx skill complete with their mastery of narrow bridge speedy corner agility and fast reaction all the while they gain confidence and skill that last lifetime and support healthy lifestyle back to though aged six would enthusiastically and patiently wait for jonti the boy next door to return from college or possibly work he be about year old would spot he come home pop round knock on the door and ask mrs parr be jonti available to come and help learn to ride my bike that poor man be so sorry but be delighted to feel the freedom of rid my own bike be sure that many other in this house have feel that freedom too however only one in four child have bike nowadays later in my speech will address that and encourage the minister to support teach my girl to ride their bike be huge privilege it be an equally amazing feeling to see they on their way on two wheel the fact that one in four child be lucky enough to have bike of course mean that three in four do not have access to one that have not prevent bikeability from support school by adopt the loan of fleet bike indeed all eligible local authority that apply be successful in get fleet bike but if child and their parent do not have bike at home that be clearly barrier not just to motivate they to undertake bikeability course but to their ability to ride bike as normal everyday thing to do thank to the brilliant rich and sue martin at cyclewise of school in cumbria receive level and level course or at least level course well exceed the active travel england target of however not all local authority be do so well would welcome it if the minister take lead on that perhaps by write to the poorly perform local authority to encourage they to embrace the benefit of more active travel thank my hon friend for introduce this adjournment debate she be fabulous minister who very much promote walking and cycling and be sure that the current minister will do equally as well like my hon friend love my bicycle be pleased that antisocial behaviour order do not exist when be kid because what do on my bmx would certainly have get quite few and continue to cycle do she agree that one challenge be that local authority do not take consistent approach to encourage cycling whether through investment in infrastructure planning and design or support scheme such as bikeability my hon friend make an incredibly valid point we need to encourage all local authority to embrace the bikeability training that be available to they as she will know from the incredible work that she do to encourage we all she provide huge motivation for my join the early morning running club and for so many people in this house to get bit fitter and be really grateful for that talk of brilliant people it be brilliant that we have appoint chris boardman mbe as the national commissioner for walk and cycling tremendous force for good not just for sport but even more importantly for active travel as an everyday way of life hope he will not mind quote he he have say that gear change could be one of the great health intervention that government have ever make as the minister in the department for transport responsible for the future of transport include walk and cycling be especially proud to create active travel england and appoint danny williams as its chief executive that organisation have go from strength to strength under the current minister steering headquarter in york it be realise wheely great project right across the country one of my most memorable visit as minister be to eaglesfield paddle church of england primary school in my constituency observe the child who be in year and undertake their bikeability training with cyclewise after that training those child be so enthusiastic they have really enjoy the session so ask they who rid their bike to school unfortunately not single child put their hand up so ask they another question who would like to ride their bike to school everybody put their hand up the problem be rather nasty junction very close to their school encourage the minister to prioritise scheme that will make route from home to school safe or perhaps ask local authority to prioritise those scheme because it be crucial that child be able to form healthy habit at an early age do my hon friend agree that local authority often fall into the trap of do the easy bit paint white line on the road but not tackle those nasty junction which be the real disincentive that prevent people particularly young people from take up more cycle opportunity my right hon friend be absolutely right we need to tackle those junction and make those improvement it be not always about segregated or designate route often it be but certainly in our rural area where there be less traffic tackle those quite dangerous junction make parent more likely to encourage their child to cycle to school and form those really important healthy habit at an early age be loth to intervene on my hon friend speech because it be quite fascinating she have talk about the path that each of we take into cycling and through life in my own constituency we have be very fortunate that the government have invest million of level up money in the môr mynydd coastal to mountain active travel route crucially one of the benefit of that route will be enable pedestrian cyclist and wheeler to avoid the nasty black cat roundabout when get from glan conwy to conwy that mean that school pupil and student in glan conwy will be able to get to aberconwy school without have to navigate that roundabout which be exactly what my hon friend be talk about my question though be about rurality in rural area those busy road be very difficult to get past or get around so do my hon friend agree that along with bikeability and the ambassador the provision of designate active travel route be key part of get more people on to their bike yes again there be lot of agreement in the house tonight and enable those route to school and tackle those junction be primarily what active travel england will be look at have route that comply with local transport note be really important but where that be not possible we should not let the perfect be the enemy of the good we should enable as many child as be physically possible to get on to their bike or walk to school to form early healthy habit so that they grow into healthy adult be grateful to the hon member for give way be particularly pleased that she have focus on young people in her debate which be very impressive but of course some of the infrastructure for active travel be also need by old people on january this year sadly an air ambulance evacuate constituent of mine it be report that there have be collision with van on the do the hon member agree that sound cycling infrastructure be need not only for young people but for old people of course that be need for all age welcome the hon member intervention my point be that when resource be stretch and priority need to be make we should prioritise those early habit because those child will grow into adult it be an absolutely cry shame that in this country an average of about limb be amputate every day as result of diabete think it be national disgrace that we have the third high population live with obesity in europe while we be very good in cumbria at teach bikeability training we be sadly woefully inadequate when it come to child get out and rid their bike with unsurprisingly the health inequality that follow those statistic be national statistic but they be even bad in cumbria the conversation at the moment be very much about cycling but think we need to remember walk as well in trimdon one of my village we have road we be talk about road but this be road that go straight through the village at pace the village be one side and the play area be the other side and little stepping stone to get across have be propose many time if we could get such thing put in place it would build the habit of walking which build the habit of enjoyment in move around be that part of the agenda my hon friend be try to get to yes my hon friend be absolutely right have be focus on cycling so far but will come on to walk will entertain the house with my walking adventure all the way from saint bees in my constituency right over to robin hood bay which be some mile the infrastructure for walk and cycling be vitally important we be have debate about active travel which be very important debate to have but think an even more pressing issue and ask the minister to have discussion about this with his counterpart in the department for environment food and rural affairs be the grow mountain of ultra process food we now consume in this country it be perhaps to of our diet which drive profit away from the local farmer because this stuff be not really food it be feedstuff feed into mechanised process and fiddle with for huge commercial gain at great cost to our life quality and our life chance so rather than the local farmer benefit from food produce sustainably big pharma profit from the pill and potion prescribe to patch the problem thank god for social prescribing which think be fantastic intervention by the government be also delighted to work with people such as andrew denton jim burt and william bird who be just few of the genius have have the pleasure of work with recently in try to create more naturally healthy britain as part of the routes root campaign the ask of the department for transport include change the funding model so that of the road budget be dedicate to support active travel create safe walking and cycling route include well lighting and surfacing and repair pothole which be menace to all road user and adopt everywhere but outside school where it really matter this would have multiple benefit such as improve air quality around school which be usually in the centre of community and make available more of the road space and pavement space that be so important for walk importantly it will develop in young child healthy and active habit that will last they lifetime about quarter of child in this country be live with obesity when they start school at about four or five however the real tragedy be that third of child be leave primary school live with obesity those figure be alarming but in cumbria again unfortunately it be even bad the vast majority of those child will grow into adult who suffer further health issue as result of their formative year might be ask this transport minister to overstep his mark but it would be helpful if he perhaps write to ofsted because think it would be incredibly powerful if during ofsted visit the inspector ask school how many of the child be walk or cycle to school think that would encourage school to work with parent to develop safe route with thing such as side road zebra crossing and other way in which we can improve the route from home to school that would mean that child get to school and be more able to concentrate and perhaps that they get in the daily mile in one day from get to and leave school it would also ensure they have form the early habit of live more healthily that will last they lifetime be listen to my hon friend contribution with great interest because spend most of my time scroll through social medium look at cumbria and trail running or walk and cycling there and find it astonish that many people who live there do not access her constituency which have the desire to visit every day as she know why be there disconnect between those of we who do not live in cumbria and who want to go there to participate in these activity and the local community itself my hon friend raise very good point about rurality which be also raise by my hon friend the member for aberconwy robin millar people in rural area be more dependent on car we have less public transport so our road be busy and there be perhaps more road with mph speed limit be delighted with the highway code change can really tell the difference be out on my bike at the weekend and could really tell the difference those motorist who know about the change and know they need to give cyclist more space make feel so much safe it be very disconcerting when motorist pass cyclist quite closely that be one issue as be the distance that people need to travel but if be honest do not know the answer to the very valid question that my hon friend the member for chatham and aylesford tracey crouch ask do not know why more people do not feel able to make use of mile of rugged coastline and of the mountain the fell and the countryside that be so accessible in the lake district the most important thing we can do be enable the little child and even the pregnant mum and focus the effort that be why will be seek conversation with my hon friend the member for wantage david johnston the minister responsible for baby as have say many time it be important that we support the formation of lifetime healthy habit at an early age so that they last into adulthood want we to crack the issue of the far too cheap and easily available ultra process food and to stick with the really great gear change programme in case the minister do not get that the first time want we to ensure that active travel england be resource and support as it have be into the future and bikeability have the ability to teach all child those essential skill and want we to value the work of cycling uk sustrans british cycling and the conservative environment network there be so many brilliant organisation who be do so much good to roll out well network well education and more encouragement there be huge benefit to the economy as well from have healthy population reduce air pollution and less congestion that mean few sick day more work day and long life expectancy it mean more start up more scale up and more export by brilliant british business make fantastic state of the art bike like ribble which be the make of my own brilliant gravel bike and the company that be make technical clothing equipment cargo bike and trike of all kind there be so many brilliant british brand have the joy today of speak with the founder of frog bikes its product be great example of tackle problem rid young child of the need for stabiliser and enable they to harness balance bike instead it be great company which be grow by the year the commitment in the environment act that everyone should live within minute of blue or green space be fantastic one wholeheartedly welcome the formation of national trail within the national landscape portfolio in the department for environment food and rural affairs know full well that the minister work very collaboratively and ask he to meet with ministers from other departments on this subject we can achieve sum great than its part by work together clearly there be key role for the department for transport the department for environment food and rural affairs and the department of health and social care if the minister be willing to convene his counterpart that might be incredibly effective not least because he be an incredibly effective minister understand that there be already an inter ministerial group focus on physical activity which be good but focus on how we can achieve naturally healthy britain across transport the environment home and community level up health and the prevention agenda education and lifelong learning of healthy habit the sport strategy and support visitor economy to embrace the great outdoor would be truly transformational on tourism in my constituency we host part of the sustrans sea to sea cycle route which go from whitehaven to sunderland we also have wainwright coast to coast which be soon to be national trail from st bees to robin hood bay we conquer the latter last year all mile carry everything on our back across the lake district the yorkshire dale and the north york moors spend money as we go later this year again with my husband keith an avid lifelong cyclist we will be cycle the atlantic coast between porto and lisbon along part of eurovelo that be just flavour of the tourism benefit of walk and cycling our target in government be for half of all short journey in town and city to be walk or cycle by and for of five to year old to walk to school by in urban area we be nearly there but much improvement be need in rural area where only of school journey be walk and hardly any be cycle while distance of mile or two may be too long to walk in the modern world it be perfectly possible to warm up on bike may also give huge shout out to the technology advancement of cycle as well because hill be no problem she say live in cumbria home of the high mountain in england with an electric bike one can carry cargo or the kid when be in the netherlands on ministerial visit stand in awe in the car park in utrecht think which be one of the city we visit there be an aisle of bike adorn with carrier of all kind for child on the front on the back on the crossbar with tow hook and with trailer there be all manner of way of carry one child be so impressed and we could learn so much from the netherlands if he have not be already recommend that the minister undertake visit danny williams come with when go and recommend the minister take he once again because it be an inspirational visit it be part of why be speak with such enthusiasm today let we look at why more child be not cycle or perhaps why more parent be not encouraging or allow their child to cycle to school sadly in cumbria we have rate above the national average of child be kill or seriously injure so parent reluctance be justify while great safety improvement have be make they have be predominately benefit the car occupant rather than the more vulnerable pedestrian or cyclist we also have the fact that most road injury be happen during school commute time then we have the real barrier of affordability that be not just the bike and helmet but have somewhere to conveniently safely and securely store the bike have access to the right bike be even more expensive storage at home en route such as at train station and at destination such as school college work essential service shop and recreational place be require while bike remain cheap form of transport than private car bike in the uk be increasingly state of the art and be often highly prized they be costly feat of engineering so security be key factor it be brilliant to witness the resurgence of manufacturer make bike from the frog mention early which be make in wales to my own great choice of gravel bike the ribble from lancashire there be many more along with equivalent clothing from restrap in yorkshire to endura in scotland it be fantastic that we have the sustrans national network but sustrans find that of household with child have no child bike sustrans route be mostly traffic free route from seascale to whitehaven and on to workington the brilliant route which be more fondly know as the viking way be project that be involve with when work as regeneration officer at copeland borough council thank to the then cumbria county council sellafield and sustrans the village of seascale and gosforth be now connect by superb segregate designate route which be well use by people walk and cycle alike and by child and adult sustran report that just of adult feel that their area be safe for cycling even bad only feel that their area be safe for child to ride their bike that be why seven out of adult say they will never cycle with safety cite as the main reason our gear change strategy which as say be one of the great health intervention really be the way forward we should stick with the programme be pleased that we have strengthen the highway code and thank everybody involve with promote that also thank cycling uk for its great work as it say to in cumbria only of young people meet the world health organisation recommend amount of daily exercise but just of parent feel confident to teach their child to cycle on the road so the work of active travel england be vital create route that be local transport note compliant wherever possible and create an atmosphere and environment that be more conducive to walk and cycling we have come so far in create active travel england but there be real barrier in affordability and of course storage and local authority need to prioritise those healthy habit think that have pretty much sum up the opportunity if we get this right the barrier currently face the progress we be already make and the benefit of work together my overriding ask of the minister be that he join with other government departments the department of health which have the most to gain the department for education which can make possible the formation of early habit and the department for environment food and rural affairs which can think about how we pay farmer for access to their land in recognise that the sport strategy should embrace the great outdoors as well as the visitor economy benefit from walk and cycling very much look forward to his response what an honour and privilege it be to respond to my hon friend the member for copeland trudy harrison who be former minister for active travel and good friend of mine be delighted to campaign to get she into the house think visit copeland on separate occasion during very long wet and wintry by election where she have be transformational influence her legacy be massive not least because she be an outstanding minister for active travel thank my hon friend for visit northumberland when she come to see the benefit of the tynedale superhighway madam deputy speaker must be careful not to talk for the next hour and half about the amazing cycling and walking project that exist in northumberland and to take my hon friend the member for chatham and aylesford tracey crouch to task on why she particularly favour cumbria over what be clearly well county in northumberland however the long and the short must surely be that my hon friend the member for copeland have do massive amount to drive forward active travel and she should be extraordinarily proud of that as madam deputy speaker can not say this herself it be only right to note that ridelondon now go through her constituency which be an excellent part of the country to cycle in my hon friend have do very good radio link to what be go to talk about as the minister for active travel be delighted to say that have do ridelondon on several occasion have do the haydon hundred in my constituency the most interesting of all be the dunwich dynamo which be undoubtedly the most iconic cycling race of all time it be an attempt by more than people to leave hackney pub on the short night of the year and cycle totally unsupported from hackney all the way to dunwich in mile through the night the instruction be literally an envelope without shadow of doubt it be the most fearsome and amazing cycle trip to be part of ridelondon be massive boost to the local economy and extol various local virtue my hon friend the member for copeland ask to go to holland on cycle trip with danny williams the amazing chief executive and endorse her assessment of he must confess that about year ago long before come to this place do the trip from zandvoort on the coast to amsterdam on bike and have cycle extensively in holland we in this house should be excited because although we might say our infrastructure be not quite there we want to do more cycling and walking and we want thing to be well we want active travel to be more impressive and for the opportunity to be well we only have to look back at the situation in holland only or year ago to see the degree to which its infrastructure have transform the nation and how its populus get about that be totally tangible we be some year behind it in that change but we should strive to emulate that objective my hon friend speak glowingly about the coast to coast the quality of which endorse have do it trump she mile with the mile of the pennine way the first part of which be delighted to do with my good friend the hon member for sheffield central paul blomfield who sadly be also stand down when we be raise money for brain tumour have both suffer from they the transformation of the visitor economy and the tourism boost from cycling and walking be game change there be no doubt whatsoever about that we should be fully behind that that be why invite my hon friend the member for copeland to northumberland to get behind the tynedale superhighway and why this government have give million for the hexham to corbridge cycle route the work on which be ongoing the lcwip that she talk so glowingly about be clearly the way ahead the minister talk about lcwips at the last adjournment debate of on transport infrastructure in cullompton remember he say that the lcwips for cullompton would be consult on which be true that consultation conclude early this month can his department work with devon county council to ensure that the walking and cycling infrastructure around cullompton extend all the way to tiverton willand and uffculme will await the information put forward by the local authority but it be unquestionably the case that we be try to take forward the lcwip and to ensure the good usage enhancement and improvement of local infrastructure await what the local authority have propose on the point my hon friend the member for copeland make about school surely we can all get behind the mph zone around they it be unquestionable that where local authority can prioritise lcwips around school they should do so if the message have not go out be happy to make that point have be ask to do an awful lot of writing to an awful lot of people and let address those point first and foremost all cycling and walking have massive benefit and impact on health my hon friend identify that if we want healthy britain more people need to be cycle and walk the evidence be overwhelming that regular physical activity of any shape or form reduce the risk of type diabete by up to and cardiovascular disease by up to my hon friend be right that there be sadly far too many obese child in our school and far too many people who be not take advantage of the great outdoors much to the consternation of my hon friend the member for chatham and aylesford we have to change that we have to try to change those perception and get this country out of the torpor that it descend into slightly during covid the minister be make an excellent point on the value of the great outdoors and be active know that this be not his department responsibility but do he agree that approximately of that ill health be relate to diet and that ultra process food have part to play in the state of the nation health as government minister be not allow to endorse particular book or approach that would be genuinely wrong bit like the bbc we think that all organisation institution and author have merit and everything like that however have be give as present ultra processed people chris van tulleken book on the science behind food that be not food have to say that utterly endorse the point my hon friend be make we have genuine problem in this country we be allow the production of food that be neither support our farmer nor necessarily good for our population this be not my department responsibility so could not possibly comment on the efficacy of evidence or on change that should be make however there be grow body of evidence that say that government really have to look at what we be do about ultra process food and how to put out well message that be difficult and pretend it be not be naive however utterly endorse the message that we need to eat more healthily if at all possible and take out of the game some of those ultra process food and their impact seem to be no brainer to more particularly it can not be good thing for this country that we be allow our population to eat food that will inevitably give they diabete and allow they to put on weight without in most case people realise that that be what be go to happen that just can not be right in my humble opinion and we should do something about it there be few thing that can do about it my hon friend the member for copeland challenge on number of point the first relate to an inter ministerial group that be part of as anyone who have be minister will know there be some inter ministerial group that be really important and worthy and some that be interesting to say the very least the national physical activity taskforce which be run by the sport minister my right hon friend the member for pudsey stuart andrew be meet on march at pm by chance my hon friend the member for copeland might want to send copy of her speech and an itemise agenda to the sport minister and invite he to treat that as the agenda for the meeting at pm on march at the department for culture media and sport that be merely suggestion that she could in theory contemplate as for bring together all the departments to address national physical activity think it be entirely the right thing to do it be wide than just say we want people to do sport we want they to get physically active of course that be right and individual member of parliament can make real difference on this there be no doubt about that they can meet with sport england recently meet both the chief executive and my local representative and drive forward the sporting infrastructure that we all want to see they can get local representative in their constituency should put on record my thank to the amazing rob aubrook whom my hon friend meet when as the minister with responsibility for cycling she come to northumberland who have drive forward more cycling infrastructure and other local infrastructure project just as my hon friend make sure the infrastructure be improve in her local area when she be just humble campaigner from bootle that surely be what we should all aspire to there be more we can do and many colleague put forward proposal agree with much of what my right hon friend the member for scarborough and whitby sir robert goodwill say answer the point from the hon member for tiverton and honiton richard foord my hon friend the member for aberconwy robin millar make point about his amazing coast to mountain route of which be exceptionally jealous and which be keen to try it obviously come third in the batting order of place to visit after cumbria and northumberland my hon friend the member for sedgefield paul howell rightly make the point that small piece of infrastructure in this case crossing enable people to access all the benefit that only one part of the village may otherwise have urge he to seek the extra local transport funding in durham that will flow from the prime minister decision on it will release infrastructure funding for certain transport project will take that up with he separately this be good opportunity to put on record my thank to my hon friend the member for chatham and aylesford for her service in this house because sadly she have decide to step down she be an outstanding sport minister we troll each other in very polite way on the extent of our saturday morning cycling or racing activity both of we have suffer cancer and have make remarkable recovery she be good example of never let the past define you and always look onwards and forwards we will miss she desperately she raise key point which be what more can we get local authority to do bluntly lot more the first point be surely this every mp will see new housing development come into existence say housing development will always have section agreement on local infrastructure and support too often however only after its development will there be thought about cycling infrastructure accessibility accessible transport bus and so on be genuinely try to change that because what we presently have be unacceptable it be just not good government to allow situation in which local authority do not grasp that there be so much more they could do we be try to retrofit old infrastructure my hon friend the member for copeland talk about york be lucky enough to go to active travel and meet danny and all the amazing team everywhere go with active travel always get on bike so we cycle around the medieval and roman town of york with all the difficulty there be there in ensure cycling infrastructure on the very narrow street that harry potter be delighted to use but for modern housing we surely must get it right when it come to modern housing section should provide for all the necessary cycling infrastructure the good part of people be move to barrow for the aukus project my hon friend the member for barrow and furness simon fell be do great work on that and we be try to ensure that where we do big housing the infrastructure be part of the development that be the first and key point of education for local authority secondly we have set up an amazing scheme call bikeability it be fundamentally success story as my hon friend the member for copeland rightly outline because it encourage more and more child to cycle on an ongoing basis get training and so on the honest truth be that some local authority be very good at that cumbria be great example and some local authority be shocker be strongly urge by official not to name and shame they but will certainly write to every single local authority and extol those that be do well and ask why that be not of they when there be this amazing free government scheme to encourage our population to get healthy get fitter get outdoors and learn how brilliant it be to be on bicycle give my hon friend an undertaking that will definitely do that my hon friend rightly raise the issue of school it be true that be not an education minister some would say that that be very good thing but will write to ofsted as she invite to to establish the extent to which we can drive forward an assessment take comfort from the daily mile project that originate in scotland and have percolate southward it be massive success story every single headteacher at the school that do the daily mile will genuinely say to those who visit they that it transform the way that the kid be educate it transform their attention their fitness and their engagement and do they world of good in host of social and other way natural extension of what school be do would be for there to be an assessment of or at the very least inquiry into how school be try to improve rate of walk and cycling both at school and in the journey to school we have walk to school week which be part of programme organise by the department for education but the blunt truth be that it be not very successful far too few kid walk to school and we must try to do more about that my hon friend invite to comment on social prescribing on her watch that start with million budget which have be invest in local authority pilot over three year one of they be of course in cumbria the other range from suffolk to bath and from gateshead to plymouth the pilot be expect to engage ten of thousand of people in walk wheeling and cycling and we will assess their impact in at the end of the three year project however can tell she that if have anything whatsoever to do with it we will continue that project which have my hearty endorsement and support come to our approach to rural area and speak as the member represent the large constituency in the country rory stewart and use to have dispute over whose be large tell he that size do not matter but that hexham be large the long and short of it be that rurality in general be very difficult and try to establish rural cycling infrastructure be very difficult off road be often well can extol without shadow of doubt the sandstone way which run from hexham to berwick in northumberland and the work that we be do in kielder forest however it be hard to secure taxpayer funding for more rural route because the treasury operate on bang for your buck green book basis and so try to get more ongoing fund for urban beneficiary let end by say bit more about the key issue of funding ten or year ago million million or less be spend on cycling and walking look at the budget of up to million over the last four or five year and the ongoing million investment in active travel and see that we have come long way do we have furth to go of course we do but the direction of travel and in debate about cycling and walking the direction of travel be surely important be utterly clear we be invest more than any previous government our projection be that over the period up to billion will be invest across government in active travel include investment from the city region sustainable transport settlement and the levelling up fund there will also be far fund opportunity through network north in future year it be important to note that whatever the original active travel budget may have be the money whether through the city region sustainable transport settlement or the levelling up fund addition and any further local transport funding that may or may not result in the next few month can be use to support walk and in particular cycling scheme and we would encourage mayors where appropriate to pursue those opportunity in september last year we announce million of revenue funding for support active travel to school include through walk to school the big bike revival modeshift stars and obviously bikeability have have bikeability meeting with emily cherry the brilliant chief executive of bikeability trust who be very well known to my hon friend endorse the support for that initiative and we think that more can be do but place with million of support be not to be sneer at we have reach of year child in of primary school would love to do more and we be try to make it happen may congratulate the department bikeability and the wonderful emily cherry on recognise the difference that it can make to child with special educational need and disability to learn to ride bike or trike that be right for they huge improvement have be make in create more accessible bikeability my hon friend be right bikeability be transformational we need to do it big and well and more widely but it also require change in the great british public first and foremost it require mum and dad headteacher and local authority to say we want to get behind this think we can do that and the direction of travel be good she be right to praise emily cherry danny williams and all the active travel team meet the vast majority of they when go to york they be do god work in transform hundred of project up and down the country have not mention mr boardman probably because owe he beer which be always worry but it be great to have the opportunity to work with one hero grow up watch chris boardman in various race include when he famously lead the tour de france and come off his bike that be one of the tragedy of my sporting tv career what be happen with active travel be genuinely transformational and we continue to support it believe that the record of this government be good but we can do more it have be an honour and privilege to respond to my hon friend and her very important debate tonight question put and agree to house adjourn
