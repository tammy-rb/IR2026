authority area be one of the few member who can claim to represent more pig than people agriculture fishing and tourism be the foundation of our local economy if can make our beautiful corner of yorkshire well place to live and work before depart this place will hope have do some good return to the topic of today debate privatisation of the railway be necessary because british rail be not work either for rail user or the british taxpayer however the process of privatise rail operator have not be perfect in part because franchise operate monopoly in that respect they be no different from the nationalise service that they replace however where genuine competition exist rail privatisation have be success on the east coast main line the government subsidise franchise london north eastern railway compete with open access operator hull train grand central and lumo that have lead to cheap price for user high satisfaction and great punctuality and inter city service have be extend to new town and city across yorkshire and the north east one of those operator hull train now run two direct service day between beverley and london and would love to see they extend to bridlington and driffield just up the line in my constituency however the legislation put those efficient non subsidise open access operator under threat instead of learn the lesson of those success story and expand they across the network the government be slide back to nostalgic vision of the even though public service be in fact inefficient and expensive for rail user and the public purse the legislation failure to provide specific guarantee to open access operator will mean that there be no incentive for they to invest in new rolling stock or expand their service we need more open access not less minister claim that there be continued role for open access operator where they add value and capacity to the network but they will soon be at the mercy of an entirely nationalise infrastructure and provider do ministers not realise that reborn british rail will work for passenger only if its inter city service face stiff open access competition across the network the east coast main line be mature and successful test case and it should be expand otherwise what incentive will there be for new british rail to deliver cheap and well service none suspect the legislation be as rush as it be ideological the only loser will be rail user and the taxpayer express my gratitude to you ms cummins for the chance to address the house for the first time congratulate all hon member

will try to remember as work across the house to create that well future it be pleasure to follow the maiden speech of the hon member for dunfermline and dollar graeme downie be especially interested in his recollection of the fall of the berlin wall in which be also one of my early political memory although be obviously on the other side of the house as result be interested in his reference to monte cassino which might make sense later on in my speech be incredibly grateful to the people of south west devon who put their trust in on july elect to serve they here in parliament start out in this place just few short week ago it be almost quarter of century to the day since first set foot in parliament forgive the cliché but if someone have tell the year old who be spend week work experience with the mp for south west devon sir gary streeter that one day would follow in his actual footstep would not have believe they everybody have meet since enter this place who know my predecessor tell that have big shoe to fill for some that might seem daunt after all he be size and be mere size however know sir gary as do in fact have know he since we first meet at kylie minogue concert in where we both enjoy her rendition of the loco be honour to follow in his footstep and the legacy he have leave after year as member of parliament sir gary legacy be one of kindness integrity and deep commitment to the people of south west devon know that there be member on both side of the house past and present who appreciate his wisdom over the year it be something that he will tell you come from his deep christian faith be grateful that still have access to that wisdom give that he be now one of my constituent and that also share his faith unsurprisingly although sir gary achieve huge amount for our constituent there be issue affect south west devon today long term battle that he fight and that remain in need of victory one such issue relate to our great western railway line through devon today debate therefore provide the perfect opportunity to commit myself to the fight for well railway service to the far reach of devon and the south west follow the devastating flood at dawlish in the previous government do much to safeguard the line through devon the sight of railway track suspend in mid air with nothing between it and the sea be not easily forget will therefore be campaign cross party alongside colleague to see the new government commit to complete the remedial work at dawlish they must also ensure that forthcoming work at old oak common in london do not hamper the progress make on our journey time between london and the south west the main line through devon do not just take holidaymaker to our beautiful county it be vital for those who live and work there too the west side of plymouth be serve effectively by several small station but to the east in my constituency there be very few option for train travel between plymouth and totnes some minute away indeed the current level of service make mockery of the exist park and ride by train that be advertise as people drive down the will therefore continue to fight for crosscountry train not just great western railway service to call at ivybridge station as the population of that town and of nearby sherford grow have adequate access to mainline train service close than plymouth totnes or in some case tiverton parkway be essential to see the full economic benefit of the plymouth and south devon freeport with its key site at langage and sherford we must see the delivery of metro railway link plymouth with tavistock and ivybridge include stop in plympton that would also enhance connectivity for the dartmoor village which be now welcome part of south west devon follow the recent parliamentary boundary change the previous government plan to reopen the line between plymouth and tavistock be critical to deliver that metro service therefore call on the new government to push forward with that proposal and enable we to get the metro scheme off the ground can only hope that the new government be as commit to support those much need improvement in south west devon as they be to the new legislation that we be hastily debate today bill that seem to indicate ideological time travel back to the nationalise railway system of the past and mistaken belief that state run institution be the answer to all our woe our railway system need to drive forward into the middle of the century not creep backwards to the in the case of south west devon that mean the difference between reach our full potential and miss the mark would waste the opportunity to extol the virtue of south west devon far if leave thing there yes transport be big issue locally whether that be about the need for bus route between plymstock and plympton cycle path in the south hams that do not require mountaineering experience to navigate or improve junction on and off the at lee mill but hope will be allow just few moment to introduce hon member more fully to south west devon south west devon have to be one of the most unique constituency in the country challenge hon member to name another constituency anywhere with our combination of urban and rural moorland and coastal community it combine the city suburb of plymouth the ancient stannary town of plympton and plymstock with its rich maritime history with the rural south hams and dartmoor national park we have the thriving town of ivybridge the inland and coastal village and farm of the south hams the historic country estate of flete and maristow the village on the edge of the tamar valley and rugge dartmoor farm and village south west devon be home to the new town of sherford the soon to expand community

in south west devon be long term challenge yet have chair the plymouth violence against woman and girl commission and see the cross party determination to deliver on it in this place believe that we will see the societal change that we fight for in plymouth which make up significant proportion of my constituency and be my home city see its member of parliament nancy astor become the first female to take seat in the house of commons since then female mp have represent at least part of plymouth for all but year the long gap in female mps be from to be delighted to have bring an end to the drought pick up the baton of plymouth six former female mps and also become the first woman in south west devon nancy astor herself say in her maiden speech just over year ago hon member should not be frightened of what plymouth send out into the world after all suppose when drake and raleigh want to set out on their venturesome career some cautious person say do not do it it have never be try before but on the whole the world be all the well for those venturesome and courageous west country people and would like to say that be quite certain that the woman of the whole world will not forget that it be the fight man of devon who dare to send the first woman to represent woman in the mother of parliaments official report february vol fortunately be venture out from plymouth in the well

our special part of devon thank you madam chair it be real honour and privilege to be able to make my maiden speech today as the house debate the role of our railway before continue must give credit to all those who have give their maiden speech today it be quite daunting prospect to follow they all must comment on few of the amazing journey that have bring people here think of my hon friend the member for sheffield central abtisam mohamed and the hon member for lagan valley sorcha eastwood it be quite inspiring to hear their story must also comment on the speech of the hon member for south west devon rebecca smith as we be mutual friend of sir gary streeter it must have be quite sight to see he do the loco motion all those year ago it be of special importance to to talk in the debate today on the role of our railway the east coast main line go right through my constituency in fact think about half of it do because we be the third large constituency in england with station in morpeth alnmouth and berwick today we be debate the government plan over time to put the railway back into public ownership or as some might say into public service that be really what want to address today the idea and ideal of public service all of we be here to serve the public but we can only serve here because of the people who have go before we the people who support we and of course the people who vote for we so first my thank must go to the people of north northumberland include those who vote labour for the first time indeed whether they vote for or not will serve they to the good of my ability my thank also go to my family first and foremost my wife daughter and son who be my bedrock and whose patience with be frankly astonishing but also to the generation that have go before when think about public service think of my grandparent world war two generation we have already hear about monte cassino couple of time well my grandfather fight at monte cassino el alamein and elsewhere and it would have be beyond his wild dream that his grandson would one day be stand here speak of those who have go before in public service must recognise the great work of my predecessor as member of parliament for what be now north northumberland first those two political pea in pod the right hon former member for berwick upon tweed anne marie trevelyan and my hon friend the former member for wansbeck now the member for blyth and ashington ian lavery as former miner and engineer my hon friend will have great interest in the success of the railway and he have also serve his constituent with great distinction and tenacity for many year now anne marie trevelyan public service include many significant role in government include secretary of state for transport and would like to thank she for her graciousness in the handover of the constituency casework must also mention lord beith although he retire from this place in he be still hold in very high regard in northumberland for his nearly year of service if can earn just small portion of the respect that he garner will consider myself fortunate so now pick up the baton and confess that one of the first thing check with name as distinctive as my own be whether be the only david smith mp elect on july imagine my surprise and disappointment then when on the follow day receive congratulatory email from labour member of parliament call david smith thankfully that particular david smith mp be member of the australian parliament be for now at least the only david smith in this place it be convention for member to try and mention every settlement in their constituency when give their maiden speech have mention that mine be the third large in england so that may be challenge it be also traditional for member of this place to make compete claim about how theirs be the most beautiful constituency in the land so be pleased to be able to put that debate to bed surely it be certainty that the land of bamburgh and warkworth castle of druridge bay and holy island of rothbury wooler and the cheviot hill and of the historic county town of berwick alnwick and morpeth be the most beautiful in england the number of member who have holiday in my constituency seem to confirm my conclusion be sure that those who have travel on the east coast main line through my constituency along our magnificent coastline will do so again north northumberland be not only beautiful but have produce and give home to some of the most notable public servant in british history who can look past the role that northumberland play in the establishment of early british christianity the northumbrian saint especially cuthbert and aidan be renowned for their faith wisdom compassion and miracle even if today at least accord to my daughter the most famous north northumberland resident with magical power be certain mr harry potter emily wilding davison the suffragette from morpeth be another north northumbrian who fight for what be right emily famously hide herself in broom cupboard here in parliament on the night of the census so that she could record her address as the house of commons to confound those who would deny woman the right to vote be delighted to follow in her footstep and those of william beveridge the mp for berwick upon tweed who author the eponymous beveridge report which serve as the basis for that great innovation the welfare state introduce by the labour government in what would so many of we do without it north northumberland be also home to vibrant and hard work community that serve in their own way whether it be those in the fishery of amble and seahouses the farmer work the land across the constituency from alwinton to norham to keep we feed or the serviceman and woman at raf boulmer who protect the uk airspace the people of north northumberland rightly take great pride in the work of their hand in the county that they call home and in the contribution that they make to the common good nowhere be that more true than in the grand town of berwick upon tweed with its historic wall and majestic bridge one of which the royal border bridge serve the east coast main line my particular favourite though be the union chain bridge for all that it represent for the union between scotland and england we truly have cross border life in north northumberland today we have choice to build either wall or bridge across that border and choose to be bridge builder the truth be that when it come to transport infrastructure and even public service we have choice will we use it for private benefit or for the common good for the common good must be paramount we be of equal value by virtue of our humanity but not all of we have the same opportunity the same start in life or the same challenge to overcome many community in my constituency feel left behind and many feel out of sight and out of mind see the humanity in each other be proactive choice at time over the summer some people in our country choose to ignore the humanity of other with terrible consequence one of the most famous piece of literature in our country history national treasure come from my constituency the lindisfarne gospel how good it would be if they could return home to holy island one day perhaps on the east coast main line as beautiful as their calligraphy be to their primary value come in the wisdom they contain and the story they tell as set out on the task of be member of parliament my thought turn to the wisdom of another part of the good book proverb chapter say speak up for those who can not speak for themselves for the right of all who be destitute speak up and judge fairly defend the right of the poor and needy those be wise word for all with heart for public service especially those of we who call ourselves parliamentarian as for they will be the axiom by which expect my public service to be judge however long remain in this place as lifelong trade unionist who have spend the last year championing bring public service back from the private sector this debate be understandably close to my heart congratulate all the other new member who have make their maiden speech today they have show passion and reason for be here very much appreciate the comment make by my hon friend the member for north northumberland david smith for reason that may become apparent it be great honour to be the first member of parliament for the new constituency of cumbernauld and kirkintilloch my thank to the people of the community that make up the constituency for place their trust in pay tribute to my immediate predecessor stuart mcdonald who be mp for cumbernauld kilsyth and kirkintilloch east for the last nine year it be appropriate that be make my maiden speech as the ballot for private member bills take place in the lobby because the progression into law of his private member bill protect the right of parent of premature baby show that we can all make difference when we work together in the house as stuart mcdonald say in his maiden speech the former member for glasgow south be also call stewart mcdonald and there continue to be significant confusion many member may not be aware well my hon friend the member for west dunbartonshire douglas mcallister will know that there be far complicate factor locally in that east dunbartonshire council kirkintilloch east and north and twechar ward be very ably represent by councillor stewart macdonald thank all of they for the commitment that they have show to their community wish to thank further predecessor rosemary mckenna she serve initially as member for cumbernauld and kilsyth then as member for cumbernauld kilsyth and kirkintilloch east from to when be young woman activist in the scottish labour party rosemary be one of the big influence on that eventually bring to this place she be one of the people who sit down and say maybe just think about stand the new constituency of cumbernauld and kirkintilloch run from the boundary of glasgow in millerston to the boundary with falkirk at castlecary and be bisect by the motorway it be serve by croy station on the main glasgow to edinburgh express railway line with stepps greenfaulds and cumbernauld be on the local line from glasgow rail service be vital in constituency where people travel to work cumbernauld be designate new town in but it have very rich history it include cumbernauld village and its weaver and condorrat and the rich farmland between the campsie hill to the north and the luggie water to the south there have be settlement there since before roman time the northern boundary of roman britain the antonine wall run through the constituency the bar hill fort garrison by people from across ancient europe and the middle east establish to protect the wall be still accessible from twechar evidence of the mining history of the constituency remain strong there be the kilsyth victoria cottage hospital one of the place in the constituency where first go to work the remnant of the miner row which be now farm outhouse and the vast swathe of new housing build on former colliery land in cardowan chryston kilsyth and twechar it would take far braver woman than to make comment about football in the week lead up to or follow an old firm game cumbernauld most famous outing on film be in the bill forsyth classic gregory girl for those who be not familiar with the film it centre around school football team who experience significant improvement in form when one of the girl dorothy turn up for the trial and subsequently play up front as striker this film be firm murray family favourite our house be burgle when be quite young and the young member of the murray family be probably more upset that the gregory girl video be in the recorder that have be steal so it be poetic that one of scotland big woman team rangers women play all their home match in broadwood in cumbernauld be sure that can pass on the good wish of probably most in this house for when the team face arsenal woman team in the semi final of the first qualifying round of the champion league tomorrow as have say one of the big selling point of the constituency be its connectivity to scotland central belt city if there be to be that connectivity we need proper integrated public transport system base on public need rather than on the most profitable route no matter which part of the constituency be in what people want to talk to about most be public transport whether it be an amend railway timetable that mean that there be no service after be on sunday or bus service that get cancel because there be no cover to allow the driver to take break during the summer holiday the youth group at twechar healthy living and enterprise centre plan day trip to millport use the bus service it involve multiple bus and ferry but it require phone around to get lift back to the village for the last leg of the journey as the twechar bus stop run at pm like most of we have spend more time than be healthy consider the basis of my politic and value one benefit of make my speech later on be that have be able to listen to the maiden speech of so many other member when the hon member for dumfries and galloway john cooper make his maiden speech he speak about galloway dairy farm which be important to because immediately think of my grandmother she grow up on one of those farm the old daughter of the dairyman she be bright she pass she plus and be entitle to place at the grammar school but in the dairyman daughter do not go to grammar school certainly not if they be the eld and they have six young sibling she never forget that and among her child grandchild and great grandchild there be an expectation that we would take all the educational chance open to we and fight for they when they be not obvious we be expect to stick in at school go to university and when we have get our qualification embrace life of service be proud to come from family of teacher doctor civil servant health worker school staff and social care staff be also proud of the fact that my parent be here today we be support in challenge thing that be not fair and stand up for ourselves it be probably no surprise that end up trade unionist in the health service fight for public service and never shut up for the whole of my work life have work in partnership and try to build alliance between worker and between community many of the community of cumbernauld and kirkintilloch be at point of transition it be in spirit of partnership and alliance that will work to strengthen the bond that bind our people together will work in this place and in cumbernauld and kirkintilloch to confront the challenge that we face around those point of transition and to ensure that what unite we guide we this afternoon we have hear from across the house all the point that unite we let we focus not on difference but on area of agreement because we cross path far more often than we cross sword wish to start by thank my hon friend the member for cumbernauld and kirkintilloch katrina murray on her witty and passionate speech her commitment to public service and her drive to improve the life of her constituent shine through would also like to compliment all those who have give their maiden speech today the standard have be
