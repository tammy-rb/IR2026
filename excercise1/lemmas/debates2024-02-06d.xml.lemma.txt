oral answers to questions treasury the chancellor of the exchequer be ask tax system fairness what recent step he have take to ensure fairness in the application of the tax system regard fairness we have progressive tax system where the top of income tax payer pay nearly half of all income tax while the top pay more than in addition the national insurance reform announce at the autumn statement cut taxis for million people that package also strengthen the fiscal position by help taxpayer to get their taxis right while bear down on the small minority who seek to avoid pay their fair share the minister talk about tax cut but in april most household in this country will receive increase in their council tax that be not because local council have mismanage their finance but because after year of austerity the local government finance system be essentially break and rely on regressive and unfair council tax why in the autumn statement do the chancellor freeze the budget of the department for levelling up housing and communities for the whole of the next parliament lead the office for budget responsibility to forecast furth billion rise in council tax do that not show that the chancellor have no regard at all for council and the service they provide or be he simply defer problem that his government have create for the next government to sort out be afraid that be ridiculous characterisation we on this side of the house care include about our vibrant important local council that be precisely why they just receive an additional million and future spending will be matter for future fiscal event be strong believer in fairness in taxation would my hon friend care to advise the house about who would bear the heavy burden of taxation should his majesty government choose to adopt the billion spending commitment that the labour party announce on the radio this morning my hon friend make an important point of course we never know from day to day exactly what labour policy be and understand there be even difference among its front benchers at the moment but we hear firm commitment without any promise at all about where the money would come from we therefore know where it would come from it would come out of taxpayer pocket or further borrowing which be defer taxation everybody will pay for it call the shadow minister the labour party have set out clear proposal to close tax loophole on non dom private school and private equity to give much need boost to our public service will the treasury minister confirm whether the government have assess or plan to assess the merit of such policy be pleased to hear the hon gentleman enthusiasm for close down tax loophole and go after the abuser it beg the question why labour do not vote in favour of the finance bill last night which include measure along those line that be short answer but the answer to the wrong question perhaps the minister can have second go while he be think about the answer point out that the comptroller and auditor general have highlight that the government be waste up to billion year on mismanage procurement and governance of major project do the minister agree that the conservative chancellor and his predecessor have have to raise taxis so much partly because they be waste so many billion of taxpayer money each and every year the reason we have have to raise taxis be billion of support during the pandemic which do not hear the opposition oppose and an additional billion to help people during the cost of living crisis which do not hear the opposition oppose we therefore have to increase taxis out of necessity but we reduce they out of choice which be exactly what we be do labour increase taxis out of necessity and then continue to increase they out of choice economic growth in scotland tax policy if he will make an assessment of the impact of his department tax policy on economic growth in scotland during this parliament the government remain committed to increase economic growth in scotland and right across the uk as part of growth measure in the autumn statement the government introduce tax policy that be project to stimulate economic growth in scotland and across the country that include make full expensing permanent and the large ever cut to employee and self employ national insurance contribution which mean more people work the ey independent treasury economic model club forecast publish yesterday find that the uk growth forecast of this year be only slightly outperform by the even more disappointing growth in scotland give this parliament have hike taxis time and the scottish national party now think that those on modest income in scotland should pay even more tax do the minister agree that the people of scotland be simply pay the price for two government with no economic credibility no do not agree the hon member should be aware that the oecd suggest that in the come year we will be grow fast than france italy and germany of course the government have strong track record against our oecd friend over the last year and scotland benefit from this economic growth as in scotland business rate be devolve in wales with business rate relief set to fall from to business in wales will pay almost twice as much as in england do my hon friend agree that the welsh labour government should be support local business such as the kinmel arms in moelfre and not increase the number of senedd members by staggering my hon friend put it well of course we have see the considerable protection and support give in retail hospitality and leisure business rate relief in england that have not be extend to the same extent in wales and scotland fail to extend it as well she make an important point we go back to scotland call the snp spokesperson contrary to what the minister say oecd forecast show that the uk will have the low growth in the and the high inflation in the minister like to pretend that there be no real cost of living crisis but there be one and it be bite hard how long will ministers and their labour counterpart continue to peddle the fantasy that brexit be somehow good for the scottish people be afraid that the thing that would most impoverish the people of scotland be separation from the uk after year of snp rule long than the conservatives in england gdp per head in scotland be low productivity be fall employment be low and inactivity be high that be not exactly proud record the minister talk about gdp the office for budget responsibility forecast that gdp in the uk will be low in the long term due to brexit meanwhile independent ireland in the eu be boom with giant fiscal surplus give that the tories labour and the lib dems be all now champion of brexit be it not the case that the only way for scotland to rejoin the eu be through become an independent country the hon gentleman know that the imf have forecast we great growth than france italy and germany over the next few year if he be so enthusiastic about support growth include help business across the united kingdom perhaps scottish national party member could have join we in the voting lobby last night instead of vote against for example full expensing and investment in research and development they vote against that how on earth be that in the interest of their constituent business investment fiscal measures what fiscal step his department be take to help increase the level of business investment mr speaker may add my comment to yours yesterday about his majesty the king wish he and his family well as well as salute his courage in be so open about his condition at the autumn statement last year announce an ambitious growth package which will boost business investment by about billion year we be make full expensing permanent which the cbi welcome as game changer that will fire up the british economy also welcome those measure business rate be among the big issue for small business in meon valley so welcome the chancellor billion package of support in the autumn statement however follow covid there be number of empty office where landlord be still have to pay business rate do the chancellor have any measure to support those who be struggle with lack of income to pay business rate my hon friend be absolutely right to highlight the pressure cause by business rate that be why in the autumn statement we introduce the discount for retail hospitality and leisure all would say be that the reason we be able to introduce those large cut in business rate be that we do not embark on spending spree of billion year which be labour policy on mondays wednesdays and fridays but not apparently on tuesdays thursdays and saturdays will try to be nice to the chancellor but he seem to be live in parallel universe if he come to huddersfield and talk to my business and manufacturer he would find they at the low ebb that can ever remember it be time that the stimulus be there to make people invest and create job get on with it chancellor if that be be nice be relieved that have not see the other type of question that the hon member ask agree that manufacturing be central to our economic fortune which be why it be good news that last year we overtake france to become the eighth large manufacturer in the world but we have go even far in the autumn statement we announce billion manufacturing strategy to give further support to make our manufacturer the good in the world yesterday we have the pleasure of discuss the very many benefit from the autumn statement include research and development grant and simplification of the tax code however wonder whether the chancellor might go little far and see whether cut vat for the tourism and hospitality sector perhaps by over five year would be advisable to help the economy across the united kingdom my hon friend be an assiduous supporter of the many pub restaurant and shop in devon and commend he for that support we will of course keep all those measure under review ahead of the budget hair salon be vital mainstay of our high street but many employer be worried about the sustainability of their business huge issue be their tax bill with vat significant concern make further business investment very difficult cut vat to would make an important difference to local business high street and apprentice training will the chancellor look at do that to support all our local economy will always look at anything that help business to grow and expand set up and run my own business for year can gently say to the hon lady that it be slightly incongruous to argue for low taxis when the snp have give scotland the high taxis in the united kingdom loan charge bankruptcy if he will make an assessment of the potential impact of the loan charge on level of bankruptcy have hear the concern express by hon member on the impact of the loan charge and have push his majesty revenue and customs for firm assurance on the safeguard that it have in place no one will be force by hmrc to sell their main home or access their pension fund early to pay their loan charge debt nor have hmrc petitioned for bankruptcy which would be only last resort and be in nobody interest there be substantial support in place to help people in debt include agree time to pay arrangement with they be grateful to my hon friend for that answer and his engagement with the loan charge and taxpayer fairness all party parliamentary group include meeting this evening with its officer in an internal document that surface as part of the morse review hmrc admit to around bankruptcy from the loan charge can the minister tell the house why that figure have never be give publicly by hmrc and what the figure be today again thank my hon friend for champion this area and his great concern for the human story behind the difficult circumstance result from some of these scheme as have say be constantly seek reassurance from hmrc on this matter and my understanding be that where bankruptcy have occur it have often be because of requirement outside of the loan charge not from hmrc indeed some people have declare bankruptcy of their own volition however if my hon friend have evidence to the contrary would like to know about it the original treasury impact statement for the loan charge state that it would have no material impact on family formation stability or breakdown yet there have be countless divorce family break up mental health breakdown and bankruptcy and at least suicide that impact statement be grossly wrong but also surely negligent we now need full investigation include how and why parliament be so mislead over the dangerous and unfair loan charge hear the house concern about this issue on which we have debate not so long ago of course the suicide the hon gentleman mention concern we and independent review have take place however want to provide the house and anybody listen with reassurance that the good thing to do if people have concern be to engage with hmrc because very generous and long term plan can be put in place to help people to repay as say there be fear out there there be bit of scaremongere that home be be take over or people be have to give up pension that be not the case engagement with hmrc to establish reasonable time to pay would therefore be reassure for many of the people who fear much bad consequence my appeal be to engage with hmrc the government approach to the loan charge have become nightmare for ordinary people across the country who be the victim of mis selling and face financial ruin the torment and devastating reality be the clear possible proof that the government need to think again those face the loan charge ordeal can not bear to hear yet again that the morse review be the final word on this matter will the minister finally agree today to commission new truly independent review we have an independent review in under lord morse the government accept of its recommendation the review have take place but as have say repeatedly be challenge hmrc and listen to colleague if action need to be take will take it but do not believe that there be case for another review because we have already have one and the government have already take action homeowner with mortgage support what step he be take to help support homeowner with mortgage as the house know the path to lower interest rate be through low inflation which be why the government be fully commit to support the bank of england to get inflation back down to its target if mortgage borrower fall into financial difficulty our mortgage charter which cover about of the market include new flexibility to help customer manage their repayment on top of the financial conduct authority rule on how lender must treat borrower give that lot of mortgage payer be suffer because of the rapid hike in interest rate will the government continue to talk to the bank of england and mortgage lender to see what can be do to bring interest rate down that would help most people completely agree on the absolute need to drive mortgage rate down which be why we be support the bank of england independent remit to bring interest rate down we be also ensure that we do not do thing to make inflation bad such as add billion to government borrowing which would increase inflation the rate for two year fix mortgage remain more than double the level of december more than borrower be set to see their monthly payment rise by or even month government ministers be have to resign because of increase mortgage payment how do the chancellor expect people in scotland to cope with increase mortgage rate if his ministers can not would say two thing in response to the hon lady first the good thing we can do be to help people with the cost of living not increase their taxis as the snp in scotland propose and to will not get bore of say this secondly we maintain our support for the bank of england drive inflation down we have more than halve it we will continue to do that and interest rate will come right down economic growth forecast and what recent assessment he have make of the implication for his policy of economic growth forecast for and we announce growth measure in the autumn statement take together with the measure in the spring budget the independent office for budget responsibility say that they will have the big impact on output that it have ever measure in fiscal event increase gdp by by the uk economy be set for slow growth than previously think the international monetary fund predict that next year we will have the second bad growth in the in scotland the snp have increase taxis which we have hear about already and scot now face six band stagnation there be even bad and business and household in my constituency need reassurance will the chancellor tell we what he will do to give confidence to people up and down the country that we will soon see economic growth may gently correct the hon lady on the imf it say that over the next four year uk growth will be high than in germany france italy and japan agree about snp tax rise but point out that the liberal democrats have some tax rise of their own they want to increase capital gain tax which would be incredibly damaging for scotland financial service industry which employ thousand of people have the chancellor have the opportunity to look at the new conservatives budget proposal budget for family it have six point plan with two point to help unlock growth particularly for the many small family run business in place such as stoke on trent north kidsgrove and talke those plan to increase the vat registration threshold to and to abolish the reform would surely help we unlock the growth of our great nation have be talk with my hon friend about these issue recently in fact we be discuss increase the vat threshold only last night such be the interesting evening have in this job we will look seriously and carefully at any measure that help small business they be the lifeblood of the country cost of live what recent assessment he have make of the impact of increase in the cost of live on living standard what step his department be take to support household with the cost of living the government stand by household with one of europe large support package worth on average per uk household but we all know that the key to reduce cost of living pressure be to bring down inflation which we have more than halve deliver on the prime minister promise family in luton and bedfordshire and indeed the rest of the country be bad off because of year of economic chaos and incompetence under the conservatives do the minister concede that even if the government inflation target be meet family will still be pay month more for their household bill than they be just month ago fourteen year of the conservatives have halve unemployment and increase employment by million crucially poverty be down we have million few people in poverty now than in include child and pensioner that be legacy to be proud of the joseph rowntree foundation report on poverty in the uk in reiterate that consistently the demographic with the high poverty rate be child although of the child in my constituency live in poverty the scottish government be do what they can with their limited power via the scottish child payment will the chancellor and his team use their power to make concerted and determined effort to tackle the scourge of poverty which be so damaging to our child reiterate we have few child in poverty now than in in addition the national insurance contribution cut that we have introduce have be show to cut child poverty dramatically crucially the lead indicator of whether child be in poverty be whether their parent be in work and that be what we have deliver over this yes it be it absolutely be get more people into work will help to solve child poverty the british public be still struggle with the conservative cost of living crisis and the government be now force up council tax last week for the first time in my life conservative mp speak for when he say there almost no point chop off tax bill nationally if you add on to it with council tax labour members agree with the hon member for mansfield ben bradley do the chief secretary agree with her hon friend and colleague council tax be matter for council but we put in place limit which do not believe exist under the previous labour government more than that the most difficult thing for council and consumer more broadly be the billion worth of tax rise that labour be plan in government banker bonus removal of cap if he will make an assessment of the potential impact of remove the cap on banker bonus on the financial sector remove the banker bonus cap be decision make by the independent prudential regulation authority which have long say that the cap be completely ineffective it do not limit pay or make bank safe the cap on banker bonus might have be great newspaper headline but it do little to tackle the city excess financial institution quickly change remuneration package and structure so that risk taker still receive substantial pay off sometimes even take they through offshore mechanism do the chancellor agree that what we need be enhance regulation to mitigate excessive risk take in the square mile that could require beyond merely cap bonus move toward an alignment of interest focus on the form of bonus payment share allocation and defer amount and robust clawback mechanism for those who have behave maliciously in order to deter misconduct in the square mile more effectively suspect that when the hon gentleman table his question he be not expect that the big supporter of abolish the banker bonus cap be not the chancellor but the shadow chancellor hear what he say and indeed those be some of the reason we abolish it because it be not work if labour be go to change its mind on that policy may ask just to take totally random example when will it change its mind about the plan billion of additional borrowing non dom status abolition whether he have make recent assessment of the potential merit of abolish non domicile tax status the government want the uk to have fair but internationally competitive tax system design to bring in talented individual and investment that contribute to the growth of the economy non dom play an important role in fund our public service through their tax contribution they pay tax on their uk source income and gain in the same way as everyone else the minister talk of fairness but the fact be that during the cost of live crisis nearly million more struggling pensioner will start pay income tax because of the freeze in personal allowance rate while the government protect some of the rich member of society through non domicile status scrap that status could bring the treasury an extra billion year why do the government not do the right thing and bring in that extra money to protect pensioner and the low pay non dom contribute about billion in taxis in and have contribute to investment to the tune of billion since the hon gentleman will be well aware that scrap their status would not be risk free in world in which people can be quite mobile and could damage the uk competitiveness as for the need for other support that be exactly why we have be reduce national insurance rate for example mortgage interest rates impact on disposable income what recent assessment he have make of the potential impact of change in mortgage interest rate during this parliament on household disposable income mortgage interest rate have fall by more than basis point from their peak in the summer none the less the government have prioritise support for household that be vulnerable to cost of living pressure we have introduce one of europe large support package and it be partly thank to those measure that real income have prove more resilient than be anticipate in the third quarter of real household disposable income per person be just low than in versus the office for budget responsibility autumn statement forecast that it would be almost low thank the minister for his answer but since his party disastrous mini budget fiasco under the previous prime minister food price have soar extreme damage have be do to the economy and mortgage have skyrocket every month people be have to remortgage the average monthly rate have rise by and million people will have to remortgage this year overall after year of conservative government people be more than less well off than they be on trend be it not time that the chancellor and his ministerial team look again at the possibility of additional support for those who be face mortgage and other financial distress the chancellor be frown but it be time that he take further action to support people in distress this government have introduce one of europe large support package worth more than billion during to that be an average of per household the point about mortgage rate be that they go up everywhere across the world to high level than our in many jurisdiction such as the united states have already mention the work that we have do on the mortgage charter help hundred of thousand of people to manage their mortgage but the critical thing that we need to do be bring inflation down she need to talk to her shadow chancellor and the shadow treasury team about their plan which would make inflation high order be not sure that she be good word to use to other member infected blood compensation fund whether he have have recent discussion with cabinet colleague on funding for uk wide infected blood compensation scheme whether he have have discussion with cabinet colleague on the potential cost to the exchequer of compensation for people infect and affect by contaminate blood and blood product this be an appalling tragedy and my thought remain with all those affect we understand the strength of feeling and the need for action the government have accept the moral case for compensation and have acknowledge that justice need to be deliver for victim as such the government intend to respond in full to sir brian langstaff recommendation for wide compensation follow the publication of the inquiry final report in may this year the minister answer that question have bring forth another question the chancellor be previously secretary of state in the department of health and three of his former colleague all give commitment to address the issue now that the chancellor be in position to do something about that how long be it go to take as this government day be number the difficulty have be whether this will be in place before we have an election will they ensure that the commitment be there know that the hon gentleman have lifelong friend who have suffer from this terrible tragedy and can reassure he that we be determined to do right by the victim and those who have tragically lose their love one the victim of the infected blood scandal deserve justice and recognition on his question on timing government of all colour have fail to sort this out but be pleased that the interim payment at least have be pay as have say the government be commit to the moral case for compensation and we be expect the final report very soon we will move as quickly as possible afterwards we have have sir brian langstaff recommendation since april mrs dorricott the wife of the chancellor constituent mike tell the inquiry that the chancellor when he be health secretary tell mr dorricott do worry about this we sort it he be now the chancellor with his hand on the purse string so will he now through his colleague the chief secretary to the treasury confirm that the government have identify the contingency to pay the compensation to the people hit by the infected blood scandal can confirm that we be work with the cabinet office and the department of health and social care to ensure that we can respond as quickly as possible once the inquiry report small businesses support what fiscal step his department be take to support small business what fiscal step his department be take to support small business small business be the engine that drive our economy and we support they to thrive use lever right across government our small business rate relief mean that one third of business property in england already pay no business rate we provide tax relief benefit small and medium sized enterprise such as the annual investment allowance and employment allowance and we support investment in sme through british business bank programme and variety of other support measure what consideration have be give to reduce employer national insurance contribution to help small business to sustain employment follow the record increase in the national living wage from april particularly in the tourism and hospitality industry my hon friend and have speak about these policy area on number of occasion in term of support small business the employment allowance enable business with employer national insurance contribution bill of or less to claim up to off those bill that be increase in april from to so the small of business have already be take out of pay employer national insurance contribution and many of those be in the hospitality and leisure sector we always keep policy under review and know that my hon friend will always be lobby on this issue become an entrepreneur in this country have become increasingly purgatorial over the past year do the minister agree that what small businessman want be not more handout and allowance from the government but low simple and flat taxis and less regulation not more they want the government to get off their back and shove off that be very interestingly put by my right hon friend completely agree with his instinct though and those instinct be completely share on the conservative benches when we be able to reduce tax and release the entrepreneurial spirit independence and innovation that exist right across the uk the country thrive and all of we thrive in the former chancellor set public sector net investment target of of gdp but that be abandon after the debacle and today we have the second low business investment among advanced economy partly because of that failure on public sector net investment can the minister offer we any reassurance on the future trajectory of public sector net investment of course labour leave we in pretty terrible financial circumstance back in instead its figure be up billion in real term at the start of the next parliament an increase of in real term or annually the big ever publish small business be the backbone of our economy but they have constant problem with late payment which increase by last year and that be drive many of they into insolvency give that the government be major contractor what be they do through project bank account to reduce the impact of late payment the hon lady make an important point and know there be agreement on this issue across the chamber we make statement last year along those line put particular pressure on the public sector be sure there will be continue pressure on the private sector too financial services growth support what step his department be take to support growth in the financial service sector the government be take ambitious step to grow the uk world lead financial service sector with widespread industry support to take one example reform to solvency ii will help to spur vibrant innovative and internationally competitive insurance sector the reform will unlock billion worth of productive investment to grow the economy in every constituency over the next year thank my hon friend for his answer but clearly to grow the financial service industry investor must have confidence that their money be safe have write to he about the woodford equity scandal of which there be many thousand of victim across the country the financial conduct authority refuse to intervene so will he now intervene and take action to ensure that the investor get at least large part of their money back thank my hon friend for his question for write to and for stand up for the right of his constituent it be important the house know that over of investor vote to accept the scheme of arrangement it be now up to the court to decide whether to approve it and therefore will not comment on it any far be happy to be in constant dialogue with he on this matter as on many other as the minister know the northern ireland assembly sit for the first time today to make change for northern ireland we would very much like to be part of the financial service sector so what can he and the government do to support the northern ireland assembly in relation to the financial service sector and to ensure that we in northern ireland can be part of this great country of the united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland always well together strongly echo the hon gentleman sentiment be very happy to engage with he and his colleague from northern ireland to see what more can do in the treasury to work with he and indeed the northern ireland executive particularly to encourage our financial service institution to invest more in northern ireland be very happy to discuss way in which we can do that regional economic inequalities fiscal steps what recent fiscal step he have take to help tackle regional economic inequality this government be commit to support all part of the united kingdom in october we announce the billion long term plan for town which give town up to million of endowment style funding we be deliver an ambitious programme of investment zone and devolution deal we ae continue to support local growth through the uk share prosperity fund and we be invest billion to improve local transport connection in our region outside london by their own measure the government be fail on almost half of their levelling up mission in the east of england meanwhile the cambridge sub region which be net contributor to the exchequer have vital transport project on hold or await finance when will the treasury stop stall growth and give power back to the region which know well what need to be do in their area this government be commit to level up by boost growth raise living standard and spread opportunity throughout the country in several different way the hon gentleman talk about give more power to local area and he will know that the cambridgeshire and peterborough combined authority be get million devolution deal he will also know that cambridge receive some million as part of the share prosperity fund to spend on local project reject his assertion the people of cambridge be benefit from this government the way to reduce regional inequality be to ensure that growth happen everywhere across the country one way to do that be to support small and medium sized enterprise and community enterprise which be particularly locate in under serve region commend the government for the recovery loan scheme which have be lifeline to many small business and community enterprise can the minister tell we whether that scheme be likely to be renew hundred of million of pound of private investment be wait on the government to make decision my hon friend have long history as great champion for community organisation will write to he on his specific question national living wage what recent progress he have make on raise the level of the national living wage the government be commit to end low pay from april the national living wage will increase by to that represent an increase of more than to the annual earning of full time national living wage worker and it be expect to benefit about million worker congratulate the government on increase the national living wage because that will make huge difference however after speak to not only those in the public sector at the like of my local leicestershire county council and hinckley and bosworth borough council but small business in the private sector know that there be trade off because they have to foot that wage bill what step can the government take to make sure that those business and the public sector have the money to pass on to those who be earn so well thank my hon friend for his question and will take the two part of it in turn the government continue to support business with the high cost through generous package of support at the autumn statement we show our commitment to support small business by extend the retail hospitality and leisure relief and by freeze the small business multipli which will protect more than million property from the multipli increase yesterday we announce wide range package of support worth million for local council include million of new funding for social care understand that concern be express some year ago about how significant increase in the minimum wage may well have knock on effect particularly on the hospitality sector give that that do not come about with previous living wage increase will the chief secretary commit her government to ensure that future increase will be monitor closely to enable and assist small business to increase wage level systematically and sustainably over the long term can commit to the hon gentleman that we be absolutely monitor the effect but as say good package of support be in place for business topical questions if he will make statement on his departmental responsibility would like to update the house on couple of datum release publish since our last oral question total greenfield foreign direct investment since have not just be high than that of france germany and italy but in the past two year have overtake that of china to be the second high in the world yesterday labour force survey say that unemployment fall to quarterly average of mean that unemployment have halve and conservative government have oversee the creation of more than job every day since can the treasury find fund for an increase pay offer for junior doctor completely agree that we must safeguard the public finance and have regard to affordability but if ever group deserve pay rise it be junior doctor and we need to get the dispute settle as my right hon friend know as health secretary campaign for extra money for the nhs to make sure that we could pay nhs staff fairly but do believe that junior doctor have have very fair offer one that be high than be recommend by the independent pay review body and be about double the rate of this year predict inflation know that the health secretary be willing to talk about anything else that could help make their working condition well call the shadow chancellor last week at prime minister question when ask about the tory mortgage penalty the prime minister boast that someone come off fix rate mortgage will be able to save hundred of pound official report january vol but the small print be that they have to add many year to their mortgage three million people have be come off fix rate mortgage deal this year and last so do the chancellor agree with the prime minister that british homeowner have never have it so good the way we be help family with mortgage be not just through the mortgage charter which be lifeline to many family but by bring down inflation we have be have few pop about labour confusion about its billion policy but the real reason we be against it be that go on borrowing splurge push up inflation push up interest rate and make mortgage more expensive it be under conservative government that interest rate inflation and mortgage cost have go up the government need to take responsibility because after year this out of touch government be make it hard for ordinary people to get on if the chancellor decide to campaign in next week by election what will he say to the people in wellingborough who be remortgage and pay more on their mortgage every month and to the people in kingswood pay more month because of the conservative mortgage penalty what will say to they be that responsible difficult decision the vast majority of which the shadow chancellor oppose have see the inflation rate more than halve and interest rate likely to have peak last year we build more house in one year than in any single year under the previous labour government we be do everything we can to help bring down mortgage rate but billion borrowing spree will make they bad not well in the government quite rightly set up the fund to compensate victim of the equitable life scandal notwithstanding the fact that the government do not give they enough money we know that the fund will not be fully spend on the people be compensate will my right hon friend ensure the fund be use for the benefit of the people who suffer in the scandal rather than be return to the treasury thank my hon friend for his question and will write to he with the specific of the answer many of my constituent whose life have be destroy by the loan charge scandal feel the central injustice be that the government be focus on pursue the victim rather than the company responsible they be dismay to read recent allegation that individual link to such company have donate hundred of thousand of pound to the conservative party will the chancellor confirm why exactly the government be ignore the provider and operator of the scheme how many have be prosecute specifically for their involvement in disguised remuneration and not for other misdemeanour eighty five per cent of the fund recover from the loan charge so far about billion in total have come from the employer therefore those who be run those scheme so the hon lady be mischaracterise where we have go so far there have be one criminal conviction so far other be in place repeat what say to the opposition spokesman the hon member for ealing north james murray early if they be that concerned about ensure we go after the wrongdoer they would have vote with we last night in the finance report february vol correction at the meeting this evening will the financial secretary review the injustice that prevent loan charge victim who have engage with his majesty revenue and customs but who can not agree with their assessment have any access to tribunal know my right hon friend have be campaign on the issue respect and appreciate the information he have provide and his contribution to the debate assure he that be in listen mode and look forward to the meeting this evening because want to ensure that hold hmrc to account to make sure everyone involve be treat fairly and respectfully last week the international monetary fund join many other in urge the chancellor to prioritise public spending and investment above tax cut rather than seek to appease his back benchers with tax cut in the next budget will he finally deliver the level of public investment this country be cry out for include in nationwide energy efficiency programme that would shield household from volatile gas price get their fuel bill down for the long term

government commit to develop new approach to consumer protection in energy market in order to consider the good option include social tariff that commitment have be repeat multiple time since include by the prime minister in april the department for energy security and net zero reiterate that pledge by promise to consult on social energy tariff in the summer of however despite multiple commitment and to the frustration of many consultation never materialise and as we be now in february there be significant risk that no new protection will be in place this year all the while low income and disabled household have struggle to heat their home over the festive period and the cold snap in january and winter be not over yet be introduce this bill in an attempt to fight for protection for the most vulnerable in society by their continue inaction on this matter the government continue to disregard the real and immediate concern of many people the great need for social energy tariff be well demonstrate by the wide and varied support for its implementation disability group debt advice group politician from across the political spectrum consumer group local authority housing provider ofgem and even energy company be in favour of one such be the united front on this vital issue that it be even more surprising that the uk government have fail even to hold the consultation that they promise they have continue to bury their head in the sand despite the fact that national energy action energy action scotland age uk scope citizens advice moneysavingexpert and other organisation as well as mps write to the prime minister in september call for the promise consultation on social energy tariff now we be into and the situation be catastrophic for low income household thank the many organisation that have provide briefing on this topic both for my debate in november last and once again today you may ask what social energy tariff be mr speaker admittedly many different organisation and group have slight variation in their approach to such tariff but in its most basic form which be universally agree upon it be system of target support through reduction in energy bill for vulnerable low income and disabled household in response to incredibly high energy bill as one in three household will spend more on energy bill this winter than they do last winter figure that be close to half for the poor household the need for social energy tariff can not be stress enough citizens advice research show that energy bill be high than in while other research suggest that high energy bill will become the new normal for the rest of the decade that highlight the desperate need for more meaningful long term support when hold debate on this topic in november be hearten by the cross party support and atmosphere in westminster hall as member from across the political spectrum present united front on this matter each raise the need for long term target support for the most vulnerable household be then immediately dishearten by the lack of meaningful response from the under secretary of state for energy security and net zero the hon member for derby north amanda solloway and now over two month on from that debate and month on from the government initial call for consultation we be no far along government members highlight that energy bill have fall from last year but that do not paint picture of the reality for many even though we be tell that the energy market have stabilise bill remain sky high and winter be project to be much bad due to the huge level of energy debt accrue last year ofgem and citizens advice research show that energy debt be at the high level ever and ofgem chief executive officer jonathan brearley have say that we think there be case for examine with urgency the feasibility of social tariff in the absence of an energy bill support scheme this winter many people have have to once again choose between heating and eat some condition require the constant charging of essential lifesaving equipment such as oxygen concentrator or feeding pump it be dreadful that in the uk in some household have be force to self disconnect but that be simply not possible for many disabled household as they would not survive coalition of charity age uk scope fair by design mencap the motor neurone disease association and sense warn that the cost of living crisis be still add huge pressure to household finance with million face the dilemma of how they be go to pay their energy bill around one in eight household in the uk that be of household or million be experience fuel poverty this winter marie curie share with the thought of rhian who be terminally ill people with terminal illness feel the cold so much more than the healthy and need to heat their home people with terminal illness still have mortgage or rent and bill to pay there be no specific benefit offer to help terminally ill people so they have to carry on work with debilitate symptom live with incurable terminal cancer my monthly heating bill be currently more expensive than my mortgage social energy tariff be the good way forward that tariff must be in addition to the warm home discount and the default tariff price cap it must be target at the needy and go beyond the benefit system as national energy action have estimate that approximately two third of fuel poor household do not receive any social security payment all eligible consumer should be auto enrol use supplier exist datum datum share by the department for work and pensions and the tariff must reduce cost for consumer to pre crisis level we all know that social tariff will cost money so it be essential that those cost be meet in progressive manner if not the tariff risk create significant cliff edge with those who narrowly miss out be much bad off national energy action citizens advice and centrica all say that an energy social tariff should be fund by general taxation to ensure the great level of fairness if that can not be do low income household on the fringe of support must be exempt from pay towards the social tariff the government have say that the new round of oil and gas licensing would raise money to reduce bill social tariff would have numerous economic benefit it would also offset cost as illness bring on by have cold and damp home cost the nhs between million and billion year far increase spending power could boost local economy with more money spend on our high street million of the most vulnerable household and organisation span all of civil society be shout from the rafter for the implementation of social energy tariff and the government can not and must not continue to bury their head in the sand society should be measure by how it treat its most vulnerable and this government through inaction be continue to fail the most vulnerable household right across the country there be excess winter death last year in the uk that be down to people live in cold and damp house and that be why we need this bill million of people can not wait any long and that be why be ask for support for this motion question put and agree to order that marion fellows peter aldous john mcdonnell cat smith owen thompson kirsten oswald alison thewliss patricia gibson dave doogan david linden alyn smith and drew hendry present the bill marion fellows accordingly present the bill bill read the first time to be read second time on friday march and to be print bill opposition day allotted day knife and sword ban before we begin the debate on ban knife and sword from uk street remind hon member that under the term of the house resolution on sub judice matter they should not refer to any individual case that be currently before the court call the shadow minister pm beg to move that this house condemn the government for oversee per cent increase in knife crime since recognise the devastating impact that knife crime have on victim their family and the wide community acknowledge that the government recently announce measure to ban zombie knife and machete believe nonetheless that this legislation do not go nearly far enough mean that number of dangerous type of knife and sword will remain legal and available on uk street therefore call on the government to address the shortcoming of the ban by extend it to cover ninja sword and consult on further extension and far call for the government to establish an end to end review of online knife sale and introduce criminal liability for senior management of website which indirectly sell illegal knife online ronan kanda be he go to get playstation controller from his friend and be yard away from home when he be murder he be murder by two teenager who use ninja sword they have obtain that sword by buy it online use someone else id to collect it they stab he in case of mistaken identity this be heartbreaking tragic story of young life lose with family trap in the most extraordinary grief and we be here today because it be time that parliament act to tackle knife crime head on seventy seven per cent that be how much knife crime have rise since accord to the late figure release by the office for national statistics and the home office in recent week that equate to staggering violent and sexual offence commit involve knife or sharp instrument in the past year there be huge human cost to this with life lose in the year up to march the last complete datum available to we and roughly four in murder involve knife or sharp instrument for those carry knife almost half of case lead to no further action with current rule allow those carry knife to escape further sanction by write an apology letter be grateful to the hon gentleman for give way because he be describe situation that be virtually identical to the one we face in scotland plus year ago the initiative take by the then strathclyde police force and the scottish government since have be very different approach to tackle it that of treat it as public health and social problem with violence reduction unit there be nothing in the hon gentleman motion that would disagree with but it be like play whack mole with the different sort of knife available do not he agree that this issue require much more fundamental and radical approach be grateful to the right hon gentleman for his intervention and that will be part of my case so be sure will be able to meet that test it feel like most day we wake up to another tragic story of death and family tear apart the most basic search online tell we it be all over the country bristol feltham warrington haverhill my own community of nottingham be rock last summer when my constituent ian coates and university of nottingham student barnaby webber and grace kumar be kill with knife and stand with their family in their attempt establish the fact and failing in this dreadful case thing be get bad not well and that mean more young life lose more child draw into crime and more exploit by criminal we know this have huge impact on our society hundred of family cripple by grief for murder love one life chance of young people squander potential leave unfulfilled and the criminal get away with it and go on to cause further misery knife crime destroy life devastate family and create fear in our community that be why this debate matter we must invest in our young people so that they be support to make the right decision in life and we must come down hard on those involve in knife crime real support real consequence under the conservative government and conservative police and crime commissioner cleveland have the high crime rate in the uk and only this weekend we see another serious stab mile down the road from in norton village we hear the government try to talk the talk but the bottom line have to be that they be not take the necessary action be sure my hon friend will agree share my hon friend view he talk of case in his community and we be wake up seemingly so many day in every week with another case in another area in village town and city the public be rightly look for action from we and that be what will be set out in my explanation of this motion be glad the shadow minister talk about we understand that this be an opposition day debate and the government will be criticise but be it not the case that what the public on the left and the right and the apolitical be look for be cross party consensus where it can be find in this place to deal with what be very important issue and that party politic should be set aside for great cross party working do he also agree that stop and search have part to play on machete and zombie knife ban they be not the only solution although it be good place to start but the most radical step be to work together we have be clear throughout that when the government bring forward proposal design to take this issue on we will give they our support that be true of the forthcoming legislation on zombie knife although we have concern about the scope but there have to be action and where there be not action it be our role to point that out think the right hon gentleman will find that in the tone and spirit of my contribution we serve no one if we do not do that but of course we will build consensus wherever we can and hope the whole house can get behind our motion today it would be key mission of future labour government to make the street safe and halve knife crime within year recently my right hon friend the member for normanton pontefract and castleford yvette cooper and the leader of the opposition unveil our plan to deliver this with crackdown on knife crime today and radical youth prevention programme and this motion start to build that out we be clear no more loophole no more caveat no more false promise we need total crackdown on the availability of serious weapon on britain street be grateful to the hon gentleman for his comment on this often heartbreake topic my constituent julie daughter poppy devey waterhouse be kill in her home with knife already in her kitchen currently offender convict of murder who use weapon already available at the crime scene have start sentence year low than those who bring weapon with they domestic violence murderer can bank on leniency do the hon member agree that woman kill by knife already in the home need to see equal justice the hon member raise an important point that need parliamentary scrutiny we have an anxiety as hon friend have mention many time that crime happen in domestic space be in some way deem less significant and that can be reflect in sentencing this bear our parliamentary scrutiny to turn to the motion we want to see restriction on the sale of the most serious weapon those with no functional purpose since the government have release different press release about zombie knife but action have be slow to follow we be pleased that two week ago we see the statutory instrument aim at take some of the knife and machete off the street and as have say we will support the government in that venture but hope to hear from the minister an explanation of why that be ban not for now or few week time but for september eight month away this be an immediate problem that need more urgency where be that urgency and leadership he can be assure of our support so let get on with it we also believe as set out in the motion that we should go far we would broaden the ban to include wide range of weapon and to toughen exist rule on serration and length that would mean finally ban blade such as ninja sword the weapon that kill ronan kanda his incredible family be campaign for this ably support by their member for parliament my right hon friend the member for wolverhampton south east mr mcfadden and they be right any ban on offensive weapon that would not have take off the street the blade that kill their son be insufficient there be also an unintended consequence of leave out ninja sword those who sell these weapon be indifferent to their customer and their customer intention if colleague think be overstate my case they should just put into search engine zombie knife or ninja sword and look at how they be market if knife and machete be prohibit these firm will just move on to push ninja sword at customer this be hole in the government plan and it must be plug we can go far still here many ban knife continue to be sell where young people can buy they and have they deliver to their home within few day we would introduce and believe the government should introduce criminal sanction on the tech executive who allow knife sale on their online marketplace not just ofcom sanction as the government have opt for but proper criminal sanction to send very serious message to these leader that if their platform be be use and they be not actively make sure they be not be use for the sale of dangerous weapon there be go to be very serious consequence not one that can be price in as the cost of do business to add to that we must ensure we have the right tool in law to deal with the digital age to drive this work forward our motion call for rapid review of online knife sale from the point of purchase through to delivery in particular look at strengthen id and age check conduct by royal mail and border force for uk bind parcel currently all too often serious weapon can be purchase online with loose id and age check with little oversight and with no background check every time oversight be loosen and check be not carry out properly these weapon potentially fall into the wrong hand and be use to kill we must ensure we have the most robust system possible to prevent this to those who carry these weapon we need to send the unmistakable message that the law will come down hard on they not apology letter not weak warning but proper and serious intervention my hon friend be make great speech will he support two parent in my constituency leanne and mandy whose child be kill by knife crime they be call for much strong sentence and great deterrence for knife crime do he agree with and their family be go to set out few of they shortly but would be very interested in meet leanne and mandy if my hon friend could help facilitate that to hear what more they might want to see our commitment be for every offender to be refer to youth offend team and have mandatory bespoke action plan to prevent reoffende as part of that we need tough new guidance so that serious penalty be always consider where appropriate such as curfew tagging and behavioural contract too many of these be be overlook and insufficient sanction such as letter of apology be use in their stead that be wrong we need strong guidance from the centre on this but speak to the point make by the right hon member for orkney and shetland mr carmichael all of this on its own will not resolve and remove the issue of knife crime in our community we must invest in young people because prevention be well than cure we need total approach not an either or but both that be particularly germane to this debate because we know that those who seek to profit from the sale of dangerous weapon shapeshift and adapt around legislation that be one of the challenge so we must tackle demand and tackle issue that mean that young people think they need to carry harmful weapon build on the success of sure start the last truly transformative prevention programme for young child we would create the young futures programme to help prevent violent crime it would be target programme in every area to identify the young people most at risk of be draw into violent crime and of buy these product that we be seek to restrict we would build around they package of support that respond to the challenge they face as well as provide support to young people welcome the million of exist funding to divert and support young people through preventive work do my hon friend agree that it be crucial to provide positive role model through mentor to every young person in the country have work on that with the charity uprising which have chair for many year do he also agree that we should look at institution such as the royal london hospital and its trauma unit which have work on the frontline deal with the result of knife crime whether in hospital or out with paramedic we can draw on great deal of knowledge to tackle this epidemic be grateful to my hon friend for that intervention because she have do incredible work that be admire by and the shadow home secretary lot of what be about to talk about be base on that experience because that work have be very good the young futures programme will bring together service locally to well co ordinate the delivery of preventive evidence base intervention around young person that help to tackle mental health issue substance abuse issue and issue that people might get into with their friend and family we will then bring that together in national network that share evidence deliver support for teenager at risk of be draw into crime across boundary and where appropriate could deliver universal youth provision then crucially this speak to the point just make by my hon friend the member for bethnal green and bow rushanara ali we would build out from that with youth worker in accident and emergency unit and in custody centre and with mentor in pupil referral unit to target young people who be start to be draw to violence those be change moment particularly in healthcare and custody setting we know it might be the moment when an individual who be slide into serious violence whether as perpetrator or victim may need that intervention it might be the moment where we can get that change in behaviour that will in many case save their life that be why it be so crucial that we have this degree of investment into young people because otherwise such measure will not work the hon member make good point as the right hon member for orkney and shetland mr carmichael point out lot of this work have be go on in scotland have the hon member meet medics against violence whose navigator project do exactly what he be talk about within hospital setting it intervene through people with live experience to try to get young people into that frame of mind where they might want to exit that lifestyle and that violence they have get themselves into there be clearly much that we can learn from the scottish approach have not have the opportunity to meet medics against violence but on the hon member recommendation will seek to do that we strongly support the idea of support and mentor in and custody setting the evidence show that would be highly effective we need to end the exploitation of child and young people by criminal gang and that include county line we need new criminal offence of child exploitation and new serious organise crime strategy to go after those coward who make million off the back of exploit young people to bring the change to deliver that we need new proper cross government coalition to end knife crime bring together those who have key role in tackle it and in keep young people safe whether they be ministers community leader faith leader the family of victim sporting body tech company or young people themselves everybody should be bring into this fight that be the sort of government that we would seek to lead if give the opportunity the hon member be make passionate speech about bring various people from across government and community together to tackle knife crime when the shadow home secretary and the leader of the opposition hold summit in east london last year on knife crime the mayor of london who be the police and crime commissioner be nowhere to be see can the hon member ask the shadow home secretary why have to say be little sadden by that intervention this be deeply serious issue about which the public expect to hear answer do not think the public would consider the policing of the diary of the mayor the hon gentleman or anybody else to be part of substantive solution write my note for his intervention ahead of time because know that day before mayoral election the tories be much more interested in try to fight that election than tackle the problem if he really believe that be the approach do not but it be for he to use his time as he choose let we put that to the people of london on the point about work together perhaps outside this house rather than inside it may say completely agree with the hon gentleman yes agree with his majesty opposition on work together more cohesively with local authority public body health service and in particular around pupil referral unit and exclusion there be so many disparity throughout the country and it make sense to bring everybody together to look at good practice that be hugely important intervention from the right hon gentleman have real anxiety about pupil referral unit exclusion and internal exclusion it be problem prior to the pandemic but what we be see with school absence only compound that there be risk of there be generation of young people who be vulnerable to these type of behaviour unless we take the field and fight for their heart and mind the right hon gentleman and be in the same position on that will draw my remark to close because lot of colleague have lot to say the motion before we in the name of the leader of the opposition be tightly draft and call for three of the most pressing change that we believe be need to kick start this process the ban on ninja sword with consultation on further extension to the propose ban on zombie knife an end to end review of online knife sale and criminal liability for senior executive of those website who do not adequately prevent they from sell knife we believe those be reasonable change that the whole house can get behind and hope the government will take they seriously they should support this motion today the minister for crime policing and fire and have be work on the criminal justice bill committee for many week and we will be table change to enact those measure and the government should accept they if they take up our idea before the bill next stage we will support they but we will not ignore the large scale damage that knife crime be do across the country the public be rightly look to we for leadership and action and we stand ready to give they that be grateful to the opposition for give the opportunity to respond on behalf of the government and to speak about our record on fight crime include our work to get weapon off the street and stop they fall into the wrong hand which be have real impact as my right hon friend the member for the wrekin mark pritchard say we should remember what this debate be all about he be absolutely right that it be not about party politic point scoring cheap jibe or sound bite because the truth be that serious violence and knife crime leave the same trail of misery and devastation in their wake regardless of the constituency we represent the tragic reality be that many of we in fact far too many on both side of this house will have have the humbling experience of sit with the love one of victim of crime whose life have be cut short in the most tragic way there be little one can say in those circumstance that will ease the pain of lose son daughter brother or sister it be incumbent upon we all by us mean the government and the police but also each and every one of we here who contribute to public life to strain every sinew to stop other suffer as they have have also be in the situation in the past month of have to write to the mother of year old young man who be stab to death at strawberry hill station in my constituency last month understandably parent teenager and other young people be raise concern with about how we can tackle this huge increase in london alone as the minister for crime policing and fire will know we have see an increase of almost fifth in knife crime since if we be to ban all these weapon we need good intelligence lead community policing but in london since we have see our police community support officer cut by third what assurance can the minister give my constituent that we will see an uplift in police officer include in place such as richmond upon thames which be often deprioritise because they be see as safe area no area be immune from knife crime agree with the hon lady last point give the representative in the chamber think lot will be say in the debate and rightly so in relation to crime and knife crime in london include by she it be right to say that every time somebody pick up knife or another dangerous weapon there be the potential for bloodshed and every time somebody arm themselves whether for protection or with violent intent they risk ruin not only other life but their own life that have be bring home time and again in the most devastating fashion in recent day week and month my thought and prayer be with the family and friend mourn such devastating loss it be any parent bad nightmare that the victim be so often young people with their whole life ahead of they make it all the more unbearable in our shock and our grief we must remain steadfast in our conviction that we can get knife and other dangerous weapon off our street and that we can prevent young people from get draw into violent crime in the first place in the spirit of the intervention that my right hon friend the member for the wrekin mark pritchard make on the shadow minister would like to reflect on debate before the recess lead by my right hon friend the member for aldridge brownhills wendy morton during that debate in which there be cross party support my right hon friend mention the knife angel in aldridge brownhills in the borough of walsall she also mention campaign by the brindley family and the brindley foundation that be set up to bring about positive social action as result of tragedy my hon friend the member for old bexley and sidcup mr french make powerful intervention during that debate it be right to look at the number and the late datum the late datum on hospital admission of follow an assault with sharp object show reduction since december that be good indicator the most reliable indicator for serious youth violence my right hon friend the policing minister will in due course mention the crime survey which show that violent crime have reduce by since it be also right to say that nationally homicide have fall but it be obvious that datum on chart provide no comfort for victim family and that any incident of serious violence or knife crime be one too many that be why the government be continually look at what more we can do to protect our citizen especially child and young people and drive those number down far the police be on the frontline in this effort force up and down the country be aware that this be an issue of significant public concern and they be firmly committed to tackle it it be right that as dorset member of parliament mention our police and crime commissioner david sidwick and pay tribute to he the work he be do and the crime plan that he have put together for dorset thank to our recruitment drive which have deliver the promise extra officer we have significantly bolster the police across england and wales with every additional officer the ability of force to crack down on weapon carrying and violence be strengthen that include through the natural deterrence that flow from an increase police presence there be the add benefit of reassurance to all our community who be clear that they want to see more officer on the beat of course it be about not just how many police officer there be but what force do with the resource and power give to they the government have consistently and publicly back the police to take the tough possible stance when it come to address serious violence knife crime and weapon carry that include support the use of stop and search which be crucial tool since the police have remove knife and dangerous weapon through stop and search surrender programme and other target action on that specific subject every knife seize through stop and search be potential life save in the year stop and search result in about arrest and remove over weapon and firearm from our street the significance of stop and search should not be downplay because every knife or weapon seize be potential life save on criminal sanction the motion table by the opposition they will have to forgive be too generic too sweeping and perhaps too adversarial on criminal liability for the senior management of website that indirectly sell illegal knife online however what be the government current thinking unless perhaps the minister do not want to tell vis vis the criminal justice bill on which know he be work closely with the shadow minister the criminal justice bill be pass through parliament have have its committee stage do not want to steal the thunder of the policing minister who will wind up the debate on behalf of the government but encourage my right hon friend to be here for that in the round we have some of the tough knife crime law in the world for example it be illegal to carry any fix bladed knife in public without good reason with such an offence carry maximum sentence of four year in prison the offensive weapons act strengthen the law on the sale and delivery of knife to on tough sentence know that the government be bring in very tough sentence for knife crime do my hon and learn friend agree that it be not just about tough sentence knife crime be due to number of factor include socioeconomic factor gang activity the county line drug trade which affect we in hastings and rye and social medium influence do he agree that build trust between community and law enforcement be as important as effective community police and tough sentence and that as part of that building of trust raise awareness about knife crime and educate young people about the risk can deter they from carry weapon thank my hon friend for that intervention will turn directly to violence reduction unit which will help to address some of those point the fact be where gap or loophole be identify we have show time and again that we will do what be necessary and we will always put the law abide majority first my right hon friend the member for the wrekin mention the criminal justice bill which be the late illustration of our unwavering commitment to that mission it will give the police more power to seize dangerous weapon create new offence of possession of bladed weapon with an intent to harm and increase sentence for those who import manufacture or sell dangerous weapon to under as my hon friend the member for hastings and rye sally ann hart mention as well as tough enforcement an emphasis must be place on prevention it go without say that the good thing we can do to make all our community safe be to stop these crime from happen in the first place may mention and develop my point on violence reduction unit which bring together community and local partner to tackle the underlying cause of violence in the first place she will be interested to hear that violence reduction unit identify young people in danger of follow the wrong path bring together key partner from local authority the police health community and beyond to well understand the local driver of violence and provide intensive support through mentor programme and the like know that she and other hon member across the house hope will support the work go on there in addition we have support the police in their implementation of the grip hotspot patrol programme take together these initiative have prevent more than hospital admission for any violent injury since funding begin in this show the real world impact that our approach be have as we strive relentlessly to break the deadly cycle of violence that rob young people of future and destroy family the minister be make powerful speech do he agree that the good thing we can do be to put police station on our high street such as in maltby dinnington and swallownest in rother valley be sure he be aware that the labour police and crime commissioner have underspent his budget this year to the tune of million money that could have be use to reopen police station and get they go do the minister back my campaign to use that underspent money to get police station on our high street my hon friend be powerful advocate for his community know he will continue to champion this important issue and continue his campaign look forward to his further contribution and be grateful to he for raise that point it be right that through the concerted effort of the government police and partner we have show that this threat can be address but we will not stop there thank the minister for respond to this immensely important debate but may press he on the specific issue in the motion will the government launch new consultation on include ninja sword in the ban on online knife sale if he agree to that today we would make significant step forward the right hon lady will know from my response that refer to previously that the police have tell we the great risk be the criminal use of zombie style knife and machete that be action that be already be take but we will of course keep the matter under review we will not stop there we will continue to think of the victim and their family and reaffirm our commitment to get weapon and knife off our street we can and must stop knife crime and make our community safe that be what this government will work tirelessly to achieve rise to speak conscious of the tragic death of two teenage boy stab in my constituency last week and the very live police inquiry be conduct my thought be with the family and friend of those boy in particular during this debate be conscious that we have have many debate on this subject and that there be many member present whose community have also be hit by similar tragedy but lamentably those debate have not stem the rise in knife crime as we see in my own community last weekend over the past few month regular meeting with the police be already be hold in knowle west set up by some amazing woman in the community fortuitously meeting be hold on the monday after the event which be able to attend where people come together to express their grief and sorrow there be strong message at the meeting the people there be very clear that they could see that event have be lead to tragic outcome and they want to know where have the resource from their community go where be all the police on their street what have happen to their local healthcare and mental health service to support young people what have happen to their youth service what have happen to the council funding for service that make those street and community fit for live in such as street cleaning and make our community so vibrant despite the high falutin statistic throw around in this place those people know that their community have lose out people in knowle west and the rest of south bristol like those across the country have see those service disappear because of political decision make in this place since be unashamedly political about that point because those decision have consequence in our community pay tribute to avon and somerset police for the preventive work they be do with those community before these tragic incident and for the way they have work since and to bristol city council and organisation such as youth moves and bristol city football club robins foundation which have be do amazing work for long time but particularly in the past couple of week despite that and despite work with the voluntary and community sector across bristol they can not fill that gap the very clear message from that meeting and indeed from our city be that we be totally united in get these crime and these criminal off our street however we need much more than the basic these community deserve the resource to help young people to thrive and we owe it to the family of the boy who lose their life to do everything we can to ensure that it do not happen again my constituent be look for answer on how we can prevent crime but as my hon friend the member for nottingham north alex norris say we also need to give they action we have to redouble our effort to bring government support back into these community to enable our local authority school and the police force to take the preventive measure we need to tackle knife crime it be vital that there be tough consequence for those carry lethal weapon and there must be sanction but we also need early intervention to stop young people be draw into crime as my hon friend say the coward who bring young people into crime must also face strong sanction work with the community as the police be do in south bristol be vital to help to intervene on early criminal behaviour however we also desperately need government support for youth service and mental health support in school to ensure that young people be safe pay tribute to all the school work so hard across south bristol to ensure that young people be safe and encourage to go back into school and back out to live their life young people need to be listen to and crucially have that stake in our society that be why bring together local partnership of school neighbourhood policing and community group be so important to prevent crime and tackle the crisis among young people the community represent across south bristol need to know that we in westminster understand the urgency and the devastating effect that knife crime be have hope the government will do more to address the shortcoming of the current proposal by extend the ban to cover ninja sword and introduce criminal liability for the senior executive of the website that be still sell those weapon online we need properly resource cross government effort to tackle crime with tough consequence for the perpetrator support for the victim and renew focus on prevention couple of week ago be sit in meeting of an all party parliamentary group in parliament when receive call from my year old son school it be unusual to get such call so take it his head of year inform that he have be mug by several youth wear balaclavas and carry knife you can imagine my feeling of utter shock and concern for my son mr speaker it suddenly dawn on that be not alone there be so many mum who receive that call sometimes that call be tragic and those mum never get to see their son again or their daughter although it be quite often our son who be involve be relieve to say that it be case of mistaken identity and my son have not be mug he have witness the mug far up the street however it reiterate the fact that nobody be immune from knife crime it be not socioeconomic issue that affect only certain demographic but can hit any family as we have see in too many situation in this country over the year it can be the kid of middle class professional or kid from estate it do not matter knife crime will affect every child who be out there that be why we all have to work together to ensure that our child be safe when they go out be one of those mum who can not relax when my child be out until hear that key in the door know be not alone in that this be not modern phenomenon that be happen only now it have happen for decade and we must get grip of it eleven year ago year old boy be slaughter in pimlico in my constituency hani be attack by group of young people and murder five young man be sentence to year at his majesty pleasure it dawn on that because hani lose his life his mother pauline will never hear his key in the door the life of the young people involve in that murder have also end as have the life of their family we must do more to ensure that child do not spend the rest of their life in prison of course we do not want more victim but those involve in such heinous crime often be victim themselves because they be involve in county line or drug crime we must deal with that unfortunately my constituency be hotspot for the met it have the high number of knife or sharp instrument offence record in any borough of the metropolitan police force in the last month knife offence be record in westminster alone an increase of more than on the previous year the office for national statistics show that for the year end march sussex record offence per people below the national average of per we have see reduction in knife crime for that period in contrast for the met police the highest funded force in the country ons figure show increase in knife crime in london that have knock on effect on all the surround county do my hon friend agree that the labour mayor of london sadiq khan should take leaf out of the book of sussex conservative police and crime commissioner katy bourne and get grip of serious knife crime order if the hon lady want to speak will put she on the list of speaker but her intervention be far too long and other want to speak she have be here since the beginning of the debate so will certainly put she on the list if she wish agree with my hon friend as the large city in the country with more than million people london will always have high statistic but it be be let down londoner have constantly be let down for eight year because of the current mayor failure to get grip of knife crime too many family across london have be affect by knife crime and have lose their beloved child there be knife offence in december alone that will not stop unless we get grip of it it have to be holistic approach it be not just about strict sentence they have part to play in the criminal justice system but we must get to the nub of why young people carry knife in the first place have always believe that someone who carry knife be more likely to use one be so concerned that today too many young people feel that they have to carry knife for their own protection we must persuade our young people that there be an alternative we have hear about different approach from several member we should learn from what be happen in scotland which have lot to offer we need public health and community approach when be cabinet member for public protection at westminster council in be shocked to find that westminster borough that people think of as affluent with area such as mayfair belgravia and the west end be no in the met serious youth violence table in we be even high than hackney remember go to see the then deputy mayor for policing now my right hon friend the member for north west hampshire kit malthouse who tell that if do not get on top of the problem immediately it would only get bad and it would never change immediately work with my brilliant officer at westminster city council and the police to establish the first ever integrate gang unit set up scheme call your choice because want to send message to young people that they have choice they could be involve in gang and knife crime but that would end either in the morgue or in prison there be alternative way where young people could work with we be clear that we have to understand why young people be involve also send message to the parent often parent do not know what their young people be get involve in when they be out and they do not know how to handle the problem offer help hand to parent be delighted to say that we go straight back down those table within year to where we be usually around out of there need to be full approach where all the agency work together the integrate gang unit include the police probation special need school and social worker interestingly we discover that lot of young people on the periphery of knife crime have speech and language issue they could not properly communicate and they have not really progress since primary school they have have nightmare move into secondary school and they have be lose in the system we grab those young man and be delighted that we improve the situation we have to work together it should not be political issue but community issue where we all work together as our young people deserve we have hear about violence reduction unit we have one in london run by very impressive woman lib peck whom have know for long time she be not get the backing and seriousness from the mayor of london sadiq khan in he hold knife crime summit just before the local election the then home secretary attend as do the metropolitan police commissioner and the deputy mayor for police the mayor chair it he do not speak he be not hold to account will never forget that he never allow himself to be hold to account on the situation he have get to be hold to account we talk about accountability but it work both way agree with everyone who have say that the result be not political as it affect all political stripe but we have get here because of political decision making the hon member talk about child not be able to speak or read or write that be the political decision of year of this government erode our education system we talk about not enough resource for the police that be decision to erode community policing will the hon member take some responsibility for year of this have to gently push back we have come up from in the pisa table under the previous labour government to for read under the conservative government which be an impressive result be sure that the policing minister will mention later that this government provide the current mayor of london with funding for extra police officer but he fail to recruit those officer and the money go back into the pot to be give to other police force which be sure have take advantage of it this be not political issue take responsibility for the period in which be leader of westminster city council when we cut youth service and see direct link to problem on the street put my hand up to that and we put million back into the pot it be right that we make sure that young people have choice and the ability to do thing after school and college and that we give they the good start in life we be talk today about knife and sword ban and the legislation that would be require find it quite incredible that manufacturer do not take the responsibility they should take and that they can use loophole in legislation they get away now with produce zombie knife without write on because zombie knife with writing on be ban can not understand why anyone would want to manufacture zombie knife there be only one use for they and that be not use we want to see suggest that minister produce more flexible legislation that talk about blade rather than focus on specific product we need to widen the legislation to cover many exist and future product it be also important that we look at other corporate such as record label that willingly put out drill music which often celebrate gang culture there must be direct link to young people feel that to carry knife and to be willing to use it be culturally the right thing to do welcome this debate it be important that we work together across the party to send clear message to all young people that carry knife be not solution every young person in this country in whatever town city or village they live whatever their background deserve to be safe be pleased that the opposition secure this debate today it be an important debate and an emotional one for many of we certainly for serious violence include knife crime be critical issue in city town and village across the country it be important to acknowledge that it be not just london problem it affect many constituency across the whole country knife crime alone have rise by since and the impact be feel widely not just the devastating and all too often fatal impact feel by immediate family and friend but the trauma and distress feel by the wide community in batley and spen unfortunately we have feel at first hand the traumatic and life change impact of knife crime since my election have work with two extremely brave local family whose life have be tear apart by truly dreadful incident involve horrific attack with knife robert wilson from birstall be stab to death in january outside the factory where he work just do his job the attack be carry out by two youth wield samurai sword in what the judge call frenzied and senseless assault robert wife elaine be remarkable woman who have show incredible strength and selflessness follow this heinous attack she be determined to raise awareness of the horror that knife crime inflict on family and community despite her unimaginable personal pain she speak to young people in school about her experience to help they to understand the potentially life change consequence of carry knife in june just few month after robert be kill bradley gledhill local year old be attack and stab to death in batley by six young man five of whom be teenager this despicable attack on bradley and on two of his friend who be seriously injure shake the community it be unprovoked rob young man of his future and show the very bad of humanity have meet his incredibly strong mum kelly hubbard and his sister bryony do not have the word to describe the trauma and devastation work upon bradley family like elaine however they have channel their trauma with incredible resilience and strength to campaign to tackle knife crime by establish the bin the blades campaign on social medium and work with local school speak to student to convey at an early age the seriousness of this issue and the consequence of carry dangerous weapon recently work with elaine kelly and bryony on soon to be release short film commission by the bbest group of school across batley and birstall specifically about the horror and impact of knife crime in which also reflect on my personal experience of the murder of my sister jo cox in it be an extremely emotional experience for all of we but we all feel that we have duty to spread the message about the real horror and personal impact that knife crime can have this important work be have an impact and can not praise these brave individual and the school involve in the project highly enough for what they be do no other family should have to go through what these family the other family we have hear about today and my own family have go through sadly there be no single simple solution to eliminate knife crime and remove dangerous weapon from our street family and community need national leadership if we be to tackle this most serious of issue and be always happy to work across party but the national leadership have be lack in recent year that be why be pleased that labour have five point plan that will deal with knife crime in holistic multi agency way of course we need tough consequence for carry knife and of course we need more officer on our street but we also need early intervention in school include youth hub we need youth worker embed in unit pupil referral unit and custody centre and the establishment of mental health and mentor programme we must also finally crack down on the availability of these hideous weapon and take action where sadly the conservatives have fail to do so we should also go after the gang and tackle the exploitation of young people who be draw into criminality all of this should be co ordinate across government in home office health and education approach that address the root cause of the issue not just the symptom an approach that will break the chain of criminality prevent young people from get into these group and gang and if they be draw in provide help and mentor by offer tailored and support route out like colleague across the house visit school in my constituency most week as well as local community group sport club and business applaud the work they do across batley and spen to build strong community but also hear about the fear many of they feel about antisocial behaviour and violence include knife crime in our community and their worry about young people be draw into dangerous behaviour or simply end up in the wrong place at the wrong time only tough approach but one that be target and multi agency will succeed it be hard work and it will take time resource determination and co ordination it be not gimmick the labour plan demonstrate how seriously we take this issue with our mission lead approach which have be sorely miss in recent year only labour have detailed plan to make our town and village safe to restore safety to our community and to get these dangerous weapon off our street we owe it to robert and bradley to their family and to all the other family we will hear about today to put that plan into action be pleased to endorse the labour plan today on behalf of the whole house let say to the hon lady that we all appreciate the courage it take for she to speak on this subject we as house and as friend and acquaintance will never forget the sacrifice make by her sister jo cox while she be carry out her duty as member of parliament would like to place on the record my thank to the hon member for batley and spen kim leadbeater for her courage in speak about her personal experience we have hear lot about how this should not be political debate but be afraid that the choice make have be very political london highlight what labour can do in my word but those of the labour leader in rare moment of consistency for once agree with he just look at the regional crime datum and at the datum specifically for our capital city london the only pc londoner be likely to come across be political correctness the two area where knife crime have rise the most london and the west midland both have labour police and crime commissioner in charge if those two area be take out of the national figure they show that across the country knife crime actually fall last year prove yet again that the shadow front benchers need to get their own house in order before preach to other tough on crime tough on the cause of word that we have hear labour politician after labour politician parrot for the last year but when they be in power those word from the pound shop blairite could not have be far from reality for all the playground politic of this place we must remember that these failure have real life consequence for both the victim of crime and our community when be grow up in bexley one of london suburb life be always relatively safe with bexley consistently rank in london top five safe borough issue such as knife crime and gang crime be view as distant inner city issue which many family include my own think they have leave behind when they choose well life for their child in conservative run bexley fast forward to today and while conservative run bexley be still one of the safe borough in london with crime rate approximately third low than that of the rest of london fear about knife and gang crime on our doorstep be very real several serious incident have tragically take place in my constituency in recent month and my thought remain with all those family and those across london who have lose love one the late crime rate datum highlight the fact that violent crime have be on consistently upward trend since sadiq khan become mayor and tragically bexley be not immune from labour shameful record in london over the past eight year which have see more than people kill life after life have be destroy by the scourge of knife crime in london with londoner let down time and again by politician in this place who be not brave enough to openly back effective police measure such as stop and search which take an average of dangerous weapon off the street each month the labour spokesman could not even bring himself to mention stop and search today let we not forget that it be this labour mayor of london who openly pledge to do all in my power to far cut the use of stop and search will the hon gentleman give way now look at the state of london after eight year of sadiq khan politically correct policing just look at the datum in london we have see increase in knife crime since labour take office accord to the met official datum the number of stop and search carry out in be low than it have be in the previous month and at the same time knife crime offence rise by will the hon gentleman give way before anyone accuse of stoke culture war which as we all know be the left new buzzword to try to shut down critical debate about their woke idea let also point out that the official data show that white people be the most search ethnic group in this period more over two year period that be why make no apology for my support for frontline officer use the like of stop and search to help take dangerous knife off the street and why back this government to close the legal loophole on zombie knife and to roll out scan and search technology as quickly as possible as politician we should all be show real leadership in this place and do the same will the hon gentleman give way the public have rightly have enough of empty gesture politic and warm word from politician when yet another life be unnecessarily take they want action they want their political leader to get grip on crime and make all our community safe again in london the need to get grip on crime and get back to basic policing could not be clear not only be the metropolitan police in special measure but their leadership now face confidence crisis from the perspective of both the public and many serve frontline police officer morale in the met have arguably never be low it be little wonder when decent hard work frontline officer feel that time and again they do not have the backing of the mayor and their leader to do the dangerous job of be police officer in london whether that mean use stop and search to take dangerous knife off the street or specially train firearm officer still have the confidence to pull the trigger in those split second life or death moment when they guard we in place like this be genuinely sad to say that be not surprised to learn that the met be the only force in the country that have fail to hit its recruitment target despite million of pound in support be provide directly by the government that be yet another failure on the part of the labour mayor and police and crime commissioner and one that have cost london more than police extra police officer could be walk the beat actually attend burglary or help to stop what feel like never end rise in knife crime seriously what chance do ordinary londoners have when criminal gang roam the street of london target their next victim with the only question normally be whether watch car or phone have be steal this time and whether the police will even bother to investigate the crime true to form and this be what labour member be try to do here today the labour mayor of london continue to deflect all of these failure on to the government rather than take any accountability as the police and crime commissioner for london in fact understand that the office for statistics regulation recently have to correct sadiq khan misinformation on knife crime state that it have significantly increase across his tenure and not decline as he have claim quick to plead poverty at every opportunity the mayor always manage to find money for his mate or money to waste on his late pet project rather than more funding for frontline policing all that be pay for of course from the wallet of londoners include staggering increase in the mayor share of council tax and his continued hammering of motorist across london and look how he spend taxpayer hard earn money with million for his union mate despite record number of strike will the hon gentleman give way he have spend million on additional staffing cost include rise in mayor office cost and rise in press office spending and let we not forget the million for met officer to learn what colour their personality be now do not know what colour my personality be but what do know from my experience of life be that when you see red ahead you should follow the warn sign and stop when it come to crime and transport the great british public should look very closely at the sorry state of our capital city to see the big bright red warning sign highlight what to expect if another left wing human right london lawyer be ever in charge of our united kingdom as the leader of the opposition have say himself london highlight what labour can do in power with taxis up with london now officially the slow city in the world in which to drive that is if your car have not already be steal and with more than people tragically kill under this labour mayor labour run united kingdom be scary prospect indeed wish could say that it be an honour to follow the hon member for old bexley and sidcup mr french but would not like to mislead the house in any way in what way no mean that not the hon gentleman might mislead the house by say that enjoy his extraordinary rant let gently say that if he want to audition to become the conservatives fail candidate in the mayoral election that be about to be hold there be well place to do it than here especially if he be too frit to take an intervention from the other side would again gently say that that suggest that he be not capable of listen to anyone or engage in debate he be very comfortable with his own voice last july in west ham park rahaan ahmed amin be kill by knife wound to his heart rahaan be allegedly stab with foot long ninja style sword he be year old and his death be absolutely devastating for his family and for our community those who have who have be charge or arrest in connection with rahaan death be the same age or even young what happen to rahaan be simply appalling and it come after so many other case of young life destroy family devastate and community break by fear and distrust and struggle to heal that fear and that harm continue just last week we have three separate stabbing in newham last monday year old boy be stab on bus last tuesday one of our local teaching staff be stab in woodgrange road last thursday evening another man be also stab in forest gate it be testament to our police and to our nhs that no one die for many year this place have debate and pass law on zombie knife and machete but these law clearly have not do the job my constituent want to know from the minister why he feel that the drip feed of small amendment to the law around knife have not work why be there loophole why have the government not ban so call ninja sword like the one that allegedly kill rahaan and why be our exist law so poorly enforce especially online understand most of the conservative members have allude to this that knife crime be complex none of we think that all access to knife can be prevent and we all understand that there be many different cause that prompt child or young person to pick up knife so surely what we need be comprehensive action to tackle both the availability of knife and the root cause of knife crime one cause of many young people death in newham have be involvement with the gang who groom and exploit young people ruin life for profit hon member may remember that have be bang on about this agenda for about seven year now but do not think we have actually get grip on the criminal network that cause this massive harm in october publish report on child criminal exploitation talk to expert across the police the school social service and charity and one of our main recommendation be for the government to focus on disrupt those who control the organise criminal who groom our child be obviously delighted that my right hon friend the member for normanton pontefract and castleford yvette cooper the shadow home secretary have pledge new criminal offence of child criminal exploitation and new strategy to go after the gang who be profit from the exploitation of our child absolutely agree with the hon member on this point and hope that the government will do something similar but do she agree that this be also about demand too many middle class professional probably do not realise that behind their taking of cocaine or whatever be young people be expose to crime absolutely agree with the hon lady some people who buy cocaine and other drug think that it be some kind of victimless crime but it be not we be see the impact of those crime in the death the grooming and the destruction of so many young life be truly disappointed that the government have not make progress on statutory definition of child criminal exploitation or on make it dedicated offence the need for such change have be raise repeatedly over the year include by the children commissioner and the education committee so would be really grateful if the minister could offer an update will the government support and push through the private member bill for new offence put forward by the hon member for mole valley sir paul beresford or will they match labour commitment and create new offence of child criminal exploitation in government time we must all acknowledge that some of this be about wide social problem such as poverty and the lack of access to opportunity these problem be get much bad due to the cost of living crisis because poverty create vulnerability to groom and destroy young person trust in their future in closing want to mention the terrible rise in unmet need for mental health treatment particularly for young people the truth be that our mental health service simply can not cope with the level of need and this be yet another devastating symptom of year of tory failure where service have be trash by lack of desperately need resource we clearly need join up approach so would be grateful to know whether the minister be work across department to identify the resource and the reform that we desperately need we need government who will support early intervention across the board in school and and through community organisation and youth work but the record of this conservative government be one of trashing prevention and dither about get deadly weapon off our street so it be quite clear what my constituent need they need labour government madam deputy speaker thank you for call to speak in this incredibly timely debate no one in this house today want knife on our street my constituent do not want knife on the street of uxbridge and south ruislip and certainly do not want knife on the street in the community that have be elect to serve one more day when just single knife remain on our street be day too long and that be why the government work to try and achieve this be welcome knife have be take off our street in the last four year but there be of course more to be do there always be but believe that this provide an impetus for how we can navigate this issue other change in the law include allow court to hand down long custodial sentence and the seizure of weapon in suspect home will go long way as will so call hotspot policing and stop and search these change can not come soon enough as know those on the front bench recognise especially for my constituent and for law abide citizen across the capital early in the debate hear reference to the knife angel would like to pay tribute to andy thompson of st margaret church in uxbridge and other faith leader across my constituency who have arrange for the knife angel to visit my constituency which will benefit youth engagement on many of the point that have be talk about in the house today however it bear note that public safety and policing in london fall within the remit of the mayor as the capital police and crime commissioner this be the same mayor of london who suddenly turn on uxbridge police station in the run up to the by election the same mayor of london who have see instance of knife crime grow over since he take office in the same mayor of london under whom the annual knife crime figure have swell to just under in the most recent total the same mayor of london who be in charge of police in our city and who now see an average of knife crime offence day and the same mayor of london who will not talk about those figure my right hon friend the home secretary note in recent letter to the mayor that if the figure for london be discount the national trend would show reduction on last year that be small but it be sign of progress in london however with nearly instance of knife crime the office for national statistics suggest that we can see increase enough be enough london can no long be ignore by the current mayor who be also the police and crime commissioner crime figure for london since have deteriorate against national trend and our capital city deserve well in the past decade the tories have cut police officer across the uk and knife crime have go up by this government response have be completely inadequate the serious violence strategy be more than five year out of date the serious violence taskforce have be disband and everyone know from their own community that too little be be do to divert young people away from violence and crime people in erdington kingstanding and castle vale have be leave to face the consequence of tory knife crime failure and the postcode in my constituency have the high rate of knife crime in the west midland with people stab last year yet we have just single weapon surrender bin if we be serious about end the blight of knife crime in our community we need the government to be serious about funding in the west midland we have lose officer and have have million slash from our budget since the last labour government that be feel most harshly in area that be already struggle of the leave behind neighbourhood in the uk two be in my constituency which be the fifth most deprived in the country with the increase in county line and gang young people do not feel safe walking to and from school it be as simple as that even when my constituent contact the police the massive funding failure and long waiting time in the criminal justice system mean they very rarely see any justice constituent tell that she have raise the issue of gang in her block follow recent stabbing she tell that when her neighbour be threaten with knife by group of young people and she report it to police community support officer she be advise that the good thing she could do would be to make friend with the gang one of the most worrying aspect of knife crime be the large amount of youth violence across the uk when stabbing be report in area like erdington it be too often child be stab by another child this mean that prevention be key and departments must work together to prevent knife crime before it happen last march ask the secretary of state for education how many school in my constituency use metal detector to screen pupil and how many weapon have be recover as result the department could not tell because it do not record this datum it be unbelievable that the department for education do not know how many school across the country use metal detector or even how successful they be if we be miss this important preventive information what else be we miss it just be not good enough it be not right that people in erdington and across the uk have to fear violent crime when walk to the shop or when their child walk to school the primary objective of any government must be to keep people safe which be why it be so concern that in total the prime minister have announce ban on zombie knife time since the government first attempt ban in there have be increase in murder involve knife or sharp instrument something clearly be not work labour be committed to halve knife crime across the uk in the next decade thereby prevent the further serious crime youth offend and tragic loss of life that come with it we would implement guarantee sanction and serious intervention for young people find carry knife we would refer every offender to youth offend team and we would introduce mandatory bespoke action plan to prevent reoffende labour would completely crack down on the availability of knife on britain street include where further law be require on online knife sale it be clearly time for an election because community in my constituency and young people across the uk deserve well one of the thing most enjoy about this job be when people come to see in the palace of westminster and get to show they where work because whatever they think of hon member this building and this democracy be theirs and want to show they this wonderful place and why it matter few month ago take people from high heritage charity in my constituency around the house of commons show they the history of the building and afterwards we sit down on bench in westminster hall and have conversation the hon member for batley and spen kim leadbeater who be not currently in her place be next to talk to school from her constituency she do far well job of extoll the virtue of her role as member of parliament than do listen to her speech and then speak to the people from high heritage one of they be joyce whose son peterborough lad know as alfred have be stab and murder only month early while he be at university in northampton what joyce say to that group of people who come to parliament will never leave she say let not shy away from this conversation about knife crime because our child and young people need to know the devastating effect that carry knife can have ask she what she think the government need to do to make the message clear to young people that carry knife be unacceptable and to get knife off the street she say quite honestly it would be tough zero tolerance approach because only tough love be go to stop young people carry knife that really hit home because this be mother who have lose son this be mother who be determined that something good come from perhaps the most appalling thing parent could imagine it will always remain with remember another conversation in cathedral square where joyce be speak to number of people about her terrible experience man call andrew bowley have also tell about his experience he be stab five time in peterborough in he live and have dedicate good proportion of his life to talk about his experience and why knife crime be so appalling it be still happen and it be still happen in peterborough although it be good news that we have see arrest the fact that they come after such devastating incident be obviously not good five peterborough teen who carry out brutal knife attack in city park have be lock up they have be jail for maximum of year between they with some of they get year be pleased they receive such tough sentence but not only have they ruin the life of the people they attack who will suffer the consequence for many year they have also ruin their own life they be also go to be in prison for an extremely long time obviously that be good in the sense that potentially very violent people be off the street and the public be safe but it be tragic to see five more life ruin what else do want to talk about in this speech want to reflect more on that zero tolerance tough approach but let we park that for moment and come back to it first want to pay some tribute at the end of last year peterborough police have knife amnesty which result in blade knife and offensive weapon be take off the street they can no long be use in the way we would not want they to be use and that be good hear the statistic early of knife have be take off the street thank to amnesty obviously that be good thing our criminal justice bill be go through parliament and it will create new offence and ensure that we do what we can to tackle knife crime let give my opinion and believe that of joyce the maximum sentence for carry knife be four year and many repeat offender be go to prison on regular basis but want to see the zero tolerance tough approach that joyce advocate as there be no excuse for carry knife in public know that lot of young people unfortunately get themselves draw into difficult circumstance but the message need to go out loud and clear from this place if you be carry an offensive weapon knife bladed weapon such as we be hear about today like zombie knife you will go to prison you will receive custodial sentence only that zero tolerance tough approach will get that message through to people the message need to get through to family and parent that if they allow their child to get involve in knife crime those child will ruin their life and go to prison prison be probably the least bad option for they as they could end up dead no one want to see that happen no one become politician or come into this place because they do not want to see solution to an issue such as knife crime cross party approach should be take on this let say gently to some opposition members whom respect and like enormously know that many of they care deeply about the constituency and community they represent that as soon as we start bring party politic into this people such as joyce and the young people speak to include those at high heritage switch off see opposition members point and know that it just not member on one side of the house who be guilty of this but once we start talk about plan with the word labour insert in front of they and say only this be ever go to resolve any of the problem because it be write by some bright spark at labour hq people turn off that be not what this debate should be all about it should be about what we see in our constituency and what we can do to solve it it should be about what we can do as member of parliament whether we have the word conservative labour or liberal next to our name and as people root in our community elect by our local people to listen to our local people and to stamp out knife crime in our constituency can stand here and talk about the need for zero tolerance approach and what think need to happen which be that anyone catch carry knife should go to prison but deep in our community we can do what do and what be sure many hon member have do which be listen to people such as joyce and the high heritage charity the people affect by knife crime and be their advocate know that many member of parliament on both side of the house do that but it be just shame that we have not articulate that more clearly in this debate on january two people be convict of the murder of kalabe legesse year old young man who be stab on december in peckham rye park in the neighbouring constituency to mine while be rob of his mobile phone kalabe be my constituent he be graduate the old son in his family and very much love by everyone who know he kalabe be kill by single stab wound to the heart with large hunting knife which be later find at the home of one of his attacker on monday september stand at the police line on the angell town estate in my constituency follow the murder of year old ronaldo scott with huge knife in broad daylight on october stand at the police line on coldharbour lane follow the murder of another young man whom can not name because of legal proceeding again he have be murder with huge knife just last monday another stabbing take place this time it be of year old and it happen on the kingswood estate thankfully he survive his injury each time such horrific event take place family have its heart rip out and the wide community be devastate and traumatise young people be leave terrified to leave their home and parent be leave feel fearful each moment that their child be out of their sight knife crime extinguishe live but it also snuff out hope aspiration and any sense of well future knife crime be not inevitable it be not normal part of life that we should accept just happen in some place it be not acceptable it be not unsolvable it have be allow to spiral under this government because of the political choice they have make the political choice to make local authority bear the brunt of austerity with the resource that fund youth work early help and support for family sure start centre play equipment and community centre strip away year after year for more than decade the political choice to take billion out of the budget for the metropolitan police service decimate neighbourhood policing the bedrock of good police community relation and damage the trust and confidence of community in policing and the political choice to do literally nothing about the growth in the use of the most dangerous bladed weapon zombie knife machete and ninja sword despite promise to do so since the government have repeatedly say that they would do so when parliamentary time allow as if they be not the same government who have control over the allocation of parliamentary time and can choose to prioritise whatever issue they like this government have choose not to prioritise take the most dangerous weapon off our street the clinical director of king college hospital emergency department have describe these weapon to as weapon of war capable of inflict horrific injury break bone slice through internal organ and often leave victim with no chance of survival and leave those who do survive with life change consequence the ban the government have now announce be partial and have significant loophole the appalling loss we have see in my constituency have lead to some exceptional work to tackle serious violence want to pay particular tribute to ecosystem coldharbour which be fund by the mayor of london violence reduction unit myends programme ecosystem bring together number of trust local organisation that work with young people and family for the past three year they have be deliver range of positive activity for young people to help they pursue their ambition trauma support for people affect by serious violence and grant funding for range of small community organisation to be able to deliver target intervention that include an extraordinary group of woman who go by the name of circle of life ignite all of whom have lose child to knife crime they be campaign in memory of the child they have lose to install bleed stop kit to provide the emergency intervention that be need when stabbing happen have no word to express the courage of woman who be turn their own tragedy into hope so that other victim do not have to do ecosystem be show how serious violence can be tackle at community level and that be the approach that the next labour government will implement across the country young futures partnership will bring community organisation together with local council the police youth justice service and other to provide targeted support to young people at risk of serious violence we will ensure that mental health support be available for young people in every community in the country we will close the loophole in the partial piecemeal ban on large knife that the government have announce we will act where the conservatives have fail want to give the last word to young constituent name joshua eyakware who write the following poem about the work of ecosystem see in the ecosystem we show the young people that there well way give they the tool to succeed and make well place just give they the space to grow to learn and to feel free and show they peace and happiness be what they can achieve so let celebrate our young people because they our future our next leader and hero so let make they feel super to give they well life let give they love and our time and one day the darkness will fade because we teach they how to shine that work in our community be have an impact and be genuinely transformative but those in my community who work to tackle serious violence and those across the country who do the same need more leadership and support from central government that be the leadership that labour government will provide we need general election so that it can be deliver this government be let our young people and community down when it come to tackle the devastating impact of knife crime under the tories knife crime have go up by more than since and sadly we have see the tragic consequence in town such as luton rise to speak in support of labour motion press the government to strengthen their legislation and ban not only zombie style knife and machete but ninja sword and other dangerous knife which would remain legal under their current plan but if we be to reduce the needless loss of young life we must do more than legislate and enforce our way through of course we must ensure that carry knife and knife crime have significant consequence but we also need support in place to stop our young people feel that they need to carry knife and be draw into knife crime support labour knife crime plan to guarantee sanction and serious intervention for young people find carry knife and to provide tough new guidance so that serious penalty such as curfew and tagging be use where appropriate will focus on labour young futures early intervention programme target programme in every area to identify young people most at risk of knife crime plan that will bring together service at local level to well co ordinate the delivery of preventative measure national network of youth hub to deliver join up support for young people plan for youth mental health with support in every school and open access hub in every community with action to tackle mental health waiting list too and programme that will see youth worker in unit custody centre and our community with mentor in pupil referral unit to well target and support young people at risk the young futures programme will work alongside new serious organise crime strategy to go after the gang that be make million from the exploitation of child and young people in our community in luton sadly we have see too many young people and child kill by other young people and child life have be lose and change forever for all involve especially the family who be leave behind have listen to family whose child have be kill and to our luton community who do not want to see yet another young life lose in our town it be heartbreaking because so much loss could have be prevent but for the political decision of this conservative government that have destroy the youth service that carry out vital preventative work diminish the visible presence and intelligence of neighbourhood police that help our community feel safe and fail to deal with the criminal gang that exploit and draw our young people into knife crime despite this sorry picture of year of conservative government strip back our public service and make huge cut to council in the name of austerity we have some hope through excellent partnership work at local level such as the luton youth partnership and the multi agency support hub work which be systemic approach develop over number of year and lead by dave collins at luton council pay tribute to the work that he and so many other involve in that collaborative approach carry out collaborative approach be at the heart of labour young futures programme with cross government initiative to oversee it bring together all the relevant departments to set objective oversee delivery and assess outcome importantly labour will work with local council to establish new young futures partnership they will build on exist success such as in luton by co ordinating and well integrate exist service for teenager and young people in their area by involve council youth service include youth offending service social service and community safety officer and by use the police mental health service school and voluntary and community organisation to map the provision of service establish datum and system to identify child and young people at risk of exploitation and crime and to establish appropriate referral and intervention emphasise the importance of the excellent work do by our voluntary and community organisation in luton many of which have have to pick up the piece after conservative cut to our local council and health service they be work together to support our young people and community be they from our local youth group such as the scout and guide mentorship by group such as unleashing potential as well as grassroots community activist such as the excellent wingman mentors which recently meet with my hon friend the member for luton north sarah owen that group tell we about its campaign to get more bleed kit in community location recognise that if we be not able to fully prevent stabbing we can try to ensure that life be save by the early use of bleed kit by local people on the scene before paramedic arrive to close we know that knife crime destroy life devastate family and create fear and trauma in our community our young people deserve well labour government will give young people their future back but we need general election to do so madam deputy speaker just want it to stop just do want it to be happen here where there be little kid play in the park that be how one coventry teen describe how he feel grow up in the shadow of knife crime and he be far from alone in the national medium knife crime be often talk about as if it be just london thing but in truth it touch young people across the country one in six child between the age of and report be victim of violence last year and around half say that violence or the fear of violence affect their day to day life thing be particularly bad in the west midland accord to datum from last year the region have the high rate of knife crime anywhere in the country with offence per people that be five time high than north yorkshire which rank bottom nationally knife crime be up shocking since while this house be unanimous in recognise the problem too often politician look for quick fix or put appear tough above provide real answer what be strike about knife crime be that we know what drive it and what reduce it and that be not easy daily mail headline grab answer it be not matter of lock up more kid for long while ignore the driver of the real problem as the actor idris elba have warn pay tribute to he for his work campaign on the issue since custodial sentence for young people be associate with high level of reoffende proposal such as mandatory prison sentence for first time knife possession be likely to draw young people far into criminality while fail to tackle the cause of why young people carry knife in the first place part of the answer be close loophole in the ban on the sale of dangerous weapon but that be not the whole story as those familiar with the issue know too well britain have clear example of how to tackle knife crime two decade ago glasgow be know as one of the murder capital of europe with one of the high rate of homicide in the global north rather than simple law and order response public health approach be take that seek to diagnose and prevent violence rather than just react after the event that involve increase support for young people at risk of get sweep up in violence after year the number of hospital admission from knife attack have fall by again that might not make daily mail headline but the evidence be there if young people at risk be offer talking therapy extracurricular activity such as sport programme or enrol in mentor programme they be less likely to get catch up in knife crime hear what the hon lady say about provide service and alternative for young people but do she also believe in serious deterrent and in enforcement do she agree that if person be catch carry knife or other offensive weapon custodial sentence be the most appropriate punishment thank the hon member for his question as mention in my speech we in this chamber be often quick to resort to law and order and custodial sentence but that be not the whole response because it do not fix the problem as will mention there be an issue around poverty and deprivation we be not give young people hope and we be not give they opportunity but people do not want to talk about that because it involve long term strategy and investment what we have see over the past year be the complete opposite of that we have see youth centre close down and school stretch beyond measure when it come to cop with the pressure that young people experience so yes it be not the only response and it be not what we should always fall back on in coventry we have see significant fall in youth crime after an approach similar to that see in glasgow be adopt launch in may the community initiative to reduce violence programme have seek to identify young people at risk and offer they tailor support to help develop positive route away from violence from assist with housing health and debt to access to education after six month the programme have be credit with help to cut knife crime in the city by almost half of course there be more work to be do just last weekend two young people be stab in separate incident in the city my thought go out to they and their family the evidence clearly show that provide support for young people at risk rather than just abandon they be how we address this issue at deep level although we must roll out these violence reduction approach across the country be pleased that labour young future programme look set to do that we know that knife crime have deep structural cause as well there be wealth of evidence show that these social ill be correlate with deprivation and inequality with country that have high level of inequality and poverty be more likely to have high rate of violent crime that be not surprising when young people be abandon when their job opportunity disappear and when their future look bleak it be little wonder that they be angry and feel hopeless the answer to kid be scared of knife crime in coventry be not to lock up more young people for long the answer be not just to ban more dangerous weapon however need that be the fundamental answer be through offer young people route away from these problem by give they the support that they need to get on and give they hope in their future and that be what the next labour government must do it be an honour to follow my hon friend the member for coventry south zarah sultana and to be the last back bench contributor to this debate which on the whole with one exception have be thoughtful insightful heartfelt and really sensitive rise to speak today on behalf of my constituent in luton north who know care great deal about knife crime when say care mean that they be worried and scar about knife crime there be no doubt that knife crime have become national crisis increase by since it be scourge on our society and it have tragic and often fatal consequence knife crime not only take life but devastate family destroy future and ambition and have detrimental ripple effect on all our community unfortunately we know the impact of this all too well in luton as my hon friend the member for luton south rachel hopkins have already highlight in september alone in just one month there be five stabbing in our town one of which tragically lead to my constituent year old ashraf habimana lose his life two love parent lose their son ashraf teacher and friend lose his bright and energetic personality and our community have lose another young person under appallingly violent and importantly avoidable circumstance his family and friend now have to grieve the loss of ashraf and wait hopefully to see justice serve but the last trauma of this event will remain with they and our community forever two year ago another year old boy humza hussain be stab to death outside school what another tragic loss what another waste of life what another future steal our young people be most at risk when it come to knife crime in the year end september there be more than record offence involve knife or sharp instrument in england and wales with young man and boy most likely to be both the perpetrator and victim of this crime recently have the honour of meeting staff from bedfordshire brilliant violence and exploitation reduction unit with my hon friend the member for luton south to find out more about their just drop it knife campaign at its heart be the voice and experience of mum roseann who tragically lose her young son azaan aj kaleem in too often nothing be do when there be sign that young person be get into trouble be groom by gang or fall into danger online to the important part of today debate be about the child exploitation side of it the side of it on which this government have lag behind do not care whether it have labour or conservative on the front of it parent family and community just want it do to the people who prey on innocent young life regardless of their intention whether it be crime sexual exploitation or drug be all the same and we should treat they exactly like that when teenager say that they do not feel safe or that they be struggle themselves with trauma or abuse no one listen and no help be provide that be what we be up against the just drop it strategy aim to tackle these issue provide accessible opportunity for young people to help they achieve their potential ensure that they feel supported and safe and help they to realise that there be an alternative to life of knife crime and violence all of these young boy and man leave family mourn the loss of life and the loss of future that should have be bright and importantly safe the brilliant organisation box save live work with hundred of young people in luton it be set up and be now run by the inspirational jp who often highlight the work that rightly go on tackle violence against woman and girl and ask what about violence against boy and man could not agree with he more far too many young boy be expose to violence and fear from very young age what be the minister do to tackle that if the government be take any action why be it not work if these death be as result of physical illness kill our young people team of doctor and researcher would be work day and night to find cure but we already know the cure we know the lesson that need to be learn the cure be all the thing that have be strip from our community over the past year decent community police youth centre decent school sure start centre decent housing mental health support and tackle poverty as my hon friend the member for luton south say shockingly there be more food bank than police station the result of knife crime have no political stripe but how we have get here do these be all political choice that lead to the perfect storm of knife crime that we see in our society today when we hold community meeting after young ashraf death hundred of people come and they say here we be again sadly they be right sadly until all the thing that we know work be put in place we will be here yet again when the minister stand at the dispatch box ask he please not to give we more warm word that lead to cold comfort for those family as know that it be only matter of time before we be console yet another mother in luton family be lose their child child be lose their friend and whole part of the country be lose their future that situation should shame government of any colour so ask the minister again please not to get up at that dispatch box and tell we that all be rosy because it be not be grateful for the fact that all the while this tory government fail our community we have people in luton such as haleema ali who be fundraise for critical bleed kit in our town and the wingman mentors not for profit organisation that work with vulnerable young people who be on the cusp of get involve with crime carry knife and serious violence it have launch campaign to install critical bleed kit in strategic location across our town the kit contain essential supply to control severe bleeding effectively and can be use in the event of an emergency incident whether road traffic incident dog attack or knife crime would be grateful to hear whether the minister will be support that campaign the organisation founder si and michelle believe that those kit be just as vital and lifesaving as defibrillator they be also deliver training for people to familiarise themselves with bleed kit and their practical use to give those who may be on the scene as zero responder the necessary skill possibly to save life pay tribute to the vital work that wingman mentors and other be do but they should not have to rely on donation and funding from local business to make the installation of bleed kit reality yes we have hear that knife crime be cross party problem and that we have to work across organisation and across party and be happy to do so however the government in their response to this issue have be wholly inadequate the serious violence strategy be more than five year out of date the serious violence taskforce be disband and everyone know from their own community that too little be be do to support young people to move away from violence and crime why be it that we have to continue with this farce of police funding in which bedfordshire police be classify as rural police force we have luton dunstable and bedford all within that area will the minister please dare to comment on that and say when the farce of rural funding for bedfordshire police will end much more need to be do and we need proper plan with meaningful funding behind it to make these change be therefore proud to support labour commitment to tackle this issue at its source establish new young futures programme to stop young people be draw into crime implement total crackdown on the availability of knife on our street and impose tough sentence for perpetrator knife crime and violence have no place in our society we all have responsibility to tackle the problem within our community but tackle knife crime no long just mean learn lesson it mean act on they so that we be not stand here again speak of our constituent of love one tragically lose to knife crime and of those leave behind who be traumatise and change forever start by express my thank to hon member across the house for their powerful contribution this afternoon they include my hon friend the members for bristol south karin smyth for batley and spen kim leadbeater for west ham ms brown and for birmingham erdington mrs hamilton the hon member for peterborough paul bristow my hon friend the members for dulwich and west norwood helen hayes for luton south rachel hopkins for coventry south zarah sultana and for luton north sarah owen the hon member for cities of london and westminster nickie aiken and for uxbridge and south ruislip steve tuckwell and the rest they all speak powerfully about the tragedy that knife crime cause for victim and family knife attack have become far too deadly and frequent especially for young people as we have hear in this debate they ruin life family and community and speak for the whole house when say they must be stop zombie style weapon and ninja sword must be ban but they be currently far too accessible quick google search not only bring up heartbreaking story of the weapon be use but show where people can easily buy they they be readily available on marketplace for under that can not go on we should not have to be in the chamber today talk about ban zombie knife if the government ban in have work and have go far enough more life could have be save we must act now and introduce criminal sanction for online marketplace thank my hon friend the member for batley and spen and other hon member for mention the alarmingly high level of knife crime across our country remind the hon member for old bexley and sidcup mr french that knife crime be up since across the country not just in one city yet less than half of knife possession offence lead to formal sanction last year that be law and order in tory britain in it be young man who be most likely to be both the offender and the victim of knife crime young man who have their whole life ahead of they include the year old boy who be stab with zombie knife in my enfield north constituency only two week ago kalabe and ronaldo in dulwich and west norwood alfred in peterborough robert and bradley in batley and spen ashraf in luton north rahaan in west ham people in birmingham erdington and hundred of young people whose name we do not know today each loss shock family and community but too little be be do to divert young people away from violence and crime our young people deserve well they be not be deal fair hand that be not just the case in enfield or in birmingham it be happen up and down the country and it demand instant action those weapon have no place in the hand of anybody on our street never mind child in park and playground what have the government be wait for celebrity to step in so that they have to act that be what it feel like for many across the country we have have press release from the government regard zombie and zombie style knife since as we have hear yet full ban be still not in place what be the government wait for as eloquently put by my hon friend the member for west ham the drip feed of small amendment to the law have not work for many it feel as though there be no end in sight be relieved that new ban be come but we would not be here today if the first press release have actually mean something if the government ban in have go far enough and actually work and the tories have deliver on their promise to keep our community safe sadly this be tired hopeless government unable to deliver for family across our country let we be clear this ban need to go far it need to cover ninja sword and other dangerous sword however the minister for crime policing and fire say that if there be other thing refer to weapon or blade that need to be bring into scope the government can do that much more quickly my question be this why wait if they can ban those weapon now why wait for the criminal to shift to other weapon of choice there be no reason we should let criminal win at the expense of grieve family as we have hear in the debate the consequence of not close those loophole be devastating that be why we be call for the government ban to go far now with each day that pass young people in particular be at risk of have their future take away from they and we can prevent that stress that ninja sword should not be accessible at click of button ronan kanda be murder with inch ninja sword the weapon be order online use someone else identification and collect without any identification how can it be so easy to commit crime of that kind think members across the house can agree that there be very few legitimate reason to own and carry inch sword on the street of this country and that be exactly why we be debate this motion it have become far too easy to own and to use those weapon on our street with far too few consequence for do so that be the culture that have be allow to thrive across britain under this government and it must stop labour will close the loophole allow marketplace to escape liability for dangerous knife sale online may ask the hon lady the same question ask the hon member for coventry south zarah sultana do she agree that someone catch in possession of knife or bladed weapon such as she describe should go to prison currently as have say in more than of case where young people be catch with bladed weapon nothing be be do and they have be allow to go off the hon gentleman should question ministers about will continue as touch on early too little be be do to give young people the good start in life too often when teenager say they do not feel safe or that they be struggle with trauma abuse or mental health issue no one listen and no help be provide support what my hon friend the member for bristol south say so eloquently about how community service have just disappear the government have hollow out our youth service mental health service and police team among other in fact over the past year there have be no serious cross government effort to stop young people be draw into crime who pay the price young people victim their family and community all over the country include in my enfield north constituency they can not wait any long we need early intervention to stop young people be draw into crime on our street in the first place that be what labour will do through our young futures programme we will invest in young people and bring together national network of youth hub in our community with join up multi agency target work we will put youth worker in unit and mental health worker in school to ensure that they be on hand to help our young people when it matter most give they the good possible start in life that will support our aim of halve serious violence include knife crime and youth violence within decade we will step in where the government have fail community across the country be behind labour plan so why be the government we have do it in government before and we can do it again the crisis in knife crime need to be deal with urgently and can not be ignore any long the government need to get grip and put an end to the suffering if their ban have be successful we would not be debate the issue today we need the ban on zombie style knife to go much far we need to introduce criminal sanction for website that indirectly sell illegal weapon online and in the long term we need to support our young people to prevent they from be drag into crime in the first place think the whole house agree that our young people deserve well we must give they the good possible start in life and keep they safe that be why urge all member from across the house to do the right thing and vote for labour motion to get the weapon off our street be grateful to have the opportunity to talk about this important topic thank member on both side who have contribute thoughtfully to this afternoon debate which be of huge importance to our constituent up and down the country too many family have be touch by the tragedy of knife crime and the unspeakable agony of lose love one in fact by coincidence it be arrange before this debate be schedule meet yesterday with few family from across london who have lose son brother and in one case daughter to knife crime that group of family include the immediate family and cousin of elianne andam year old girl from croydon the borough that represent in parliament who be tragically murder on wednesday september last year her alleged assailant be now in custody remember attend elianne funeral in croydon few week later the outpouring of grief from the whole community particularly from her parent michael and dorcas and her little brother kobi move everybody who attend on that saturday morning couple of month ago think more than people be in attendance nothing illustrate more powerfully how important this topic be than see those family member and that whole community unite in grief at the loss of elianne of course like the andam family too many family up and down the country in london and elsewhere have suffer tragedy in that way it be up to all of we in public life whether here in parliament in city government police and crime commissioner in local council and so on to do everything we possibly can to deal with this issue it be in that spirit that many member have approach the debate we have hear quite lot about figure everyone know that we need to do more but any informed debate have to start with proper understanding of what the figure be number of opposition members have quote the figure of knife crime be up since that be police record crime figure number of other figure be available the office for national statistics say police record crime do not tend to be good indicator of general trend in crime for high volume offence not my word but those of the ons let explain why police record crime depend on the propensity of the public to report it and on how good job the police do at record it when it be report will the minister give way will just make the point about statistic and then will give way over the last few year largely drive by his majesty inspectorate of constabulary and fire rescue services and its crime datum integrity initiative the police have get lot well at always record offence on what be the more reliable measure the ons say the crime survey of england and wales remain the good estimate of long term trend in crime against the population for offence include in that survey the crime survey which be accord to the office for national statistics the good estimate of long term trend show reduction of in violent crime be talk specifically about violent crime not all crime since march the figure stand at million in the year end march in the year end september the most recent period for which data be available it have go down by about million offence or by to offence however there be other measure rise will give way to the shadow home secretary and then to the hon member for luton north sarah owen the ons state police record crime provide well measure than the crime survey for england and wales of high harm but less common type of violence such as those involve knife or sharp instrument knife enable crime do the minister agree do he acknowledge that knife crime have go up since and that it be deep deep tragedy for our country would agree that for low volume crime police record crime do provide an accurate measure of course the principal example of that be homicide which be relevant here have the homicide figure for the shadow home secretary since she ask about police record crime for low volume serious offence in the year end march the last year that she be in government there be homicide in the month end september the most recent period for which data be available those homicide figure have decline from when she be in government to in the most recent period each of those homicide be tragedy and one homicide too many but the number have go down in that period even though the population have grow significantly rise do promise to give way to the hon member for luton north so will do so thank the minister for be generous with his time on police record crime the figure be surely the bare minimum give that the level of under reporting particularly among young people be extremely high do he agree that the government claim that knife crime have somehow go down will sit like bucket of cold sick with community such as mine which know that the scourge of knife crime be rife under the tory government no one be suggest that knife crime be not problem that need deal with be just give the hon lady and the house the fact use the most accurate measure of high volume crime accord to the office for national statistics such crime have come down since with homicide down as well let take another measure of serious crime hospital admission follow stabbing injury quite frankly if anyone will the minister give way if may will finish this point and then move on as have more to talk about beyond the statistic if someone be stab they will go to hospital so one of the measure we look at in the home office be the number of hospital admission with an injury cause by bladed article that be to say knife since those hospital admission have go down by do not mention those figure out of complacency or to score some political point mention those figure which be endorse by the ons to make sure that the house have an accurate and sober assessment will the minister give way do want to move on have say all that want to talk about prevention the law and enforcement let start with prevention rise order it be obvious that the minister be not take an intervention at this point have give way several time on the point about figure and have explain in detail where the figure come from on point of order madam deputy speaker want to give the minister the opportunity to make sure he be not provide inaccurate information to the house he have imply that the ons believe that the crime survey rather than the police record crime no this be about factual information from the ons order front benchers must not speak during point of order there be factual point about what the ons believe be the most accurate measure to use for knife crime have quote at the minister the ons word about the police record crime statistic be the most accurate measure for knife crime and the minister have try to deny that that be the case want to give he the opportunity to give accurate information to the house and to be clear that the police record statistic which show that knife crime have go up over the past eight year be the one that the ons recommend that be not point of order it be very kind of everyone to tell how to do what be in the process of do the right hon lady know that what she have just say be point of debate not point of order for the chair if she be ask to answer point of order my answer to she be that it be not point of order and it be not for to adjudicate from the chair how any statistic should be interpret the right hon lady know that the minister be not take an intervention from she he have the floor it be up to he and she should not use point of order to make point of debate however she have now do so and be sure the minister will answer madam deputy speaker thank you for deal with that point of debate disguise as point of order will reiterate what have say and quote again what the office for national statistics say police record crime do not tend to be good indicator of general trend in crime for high volume crime it have also say that the crime survey of england and wales remain the good estimate of long term trend in crime against the household accord to the crime survey violent crime be down by since when we look at one of those low volume crime for which the ons say that police record crime be more appropriate obviously accept what the ons say homicide have go down from to which be buttress by the reduction in hospital admission since interruption will now move on to address the question of prevention before the minister move on the back benchers be be really quite well behave thank you both set of front benchers be shout at each other across the table while the minister be on his foot now stop it have have bad madam deputy speaker but thank you for your assistance as always it be gratefully receive member on both side of the house have rightly raise the issue of prevention of course we want to prevent young people from get on to path that lead to commit act of violence we want to intervene early take someone who may be as young as and put they on path where they do not become or year old perpetrator as member can imagine that be topic of discussion at the meeting have yesterday which be attend by the london violence reduction unit in the current year we be fund violence reduction unit in the police force area most affected to the tune of million that fund intervention such as mentor scheme apprenticeship work experience and even cognitive behavioural therapy there be really good evidence base for the fact that that intervention can steer young person who be at risk of head down the wrong path in well direction we be also work with the youth endowment fund and have invest million in it it be spend that money partly on directly commission intervention that help young people at risk of get into gang or into life of violence but it also do research into what work well it have very good evidence base for what intervention be really effective it have top three there be also some intervention that on common sense basis we would think will be effective but the evidence base say be actually not effective we be try to work with vrus to make sure that the work they fund be more oriented towards those effective intervention be also strike at yesterday meeting by the impact that grassroots organisation can have those organisation be often run by people who have experience themselves either they have be victim of knife crime or one of their family member have tragically be kill or seriously injure work with those grassroots organisation can have very positive impact and would like to do more to encourage it member it may have be an opposition member make point about identify youngster who be at risk of get on to the wrong track and intervene at an individual level that be something plan to do more on with local authority be aware of case in which year old be involve in what we might call low level criminality but then go on to commit more serious offence that be an example of where we need to identify individual and work with local authority child service and other include mental health service if necessary to intervene and make sure an at risk year old do not become year old perpetrator drug treatment be an associated issue too much violence be associate with drug either acquisitive crime to fund drug habit or violence associate with drug supply we be invest million over three year in increase drug treatment capacity which have to be the right thing to do especially for opioid which be associate with the bad offend behaviour finally on prevention completely endorse what be say by the hon member for luton north bleed kit be vital and want to work with local authority and local police force to make sure more be available include tourniquet which can reduce the number of people who suffer either very serious injury or fatality if there be tragic incident some of those thing be already under way other be area in which we can do more will now turn to the law which we have discuss quite lot this afternoon in relation to sentencing about which my hon friend the member for peterborough paul bristow rightly make some point carry any knife regardless of whether it be ban even kitchen knife in public place without good reason be criminal offence and currently carry sentence of up to four year and it be right that it do through the police crime sentencing and courts act we have recently tighten up the legislation to say that if person get catch carry knife second time there be strong presumption which will apply in all but exceptional circumstance that six month minimum jail sentence will be impose those power be in place we be also legislate through the criminal justice bill which will have its report stage in the house in few week time to ensure that where someone supply knife to an which as we have discuss be very serious matter they will receive high sentence of two year we be also create new offence that will be consider more serious that of possess knife in public place with intent to cause injury sometimes people have advertise their intent on social medium and when they have do so that should be treat more seriously early in the debate ask the minister colleague my hon and learn friend the member for mid dorset and north poole michael tomlinson question which he suggest the minister might answer do not want to corner he but what be the current direction of travel on the thinking in relation to the criminal sanction propose in the opposition motion criminal liability for senior management of website which indirectly sell illegal knife online thank my right hon friend for his very good question and will come on to that matter now we want to tighten up the sale of knife online the principal vehicle for that be not so much the criminal justice bill although we be increase the criminal sanction for supply knife to an to up to two year in prison as the online safety act which be give royal assent in october and will be commence in stage as ofcom draft its code of practice the online safety act put duty on social medium firm include critically online marketplace to proactively prevent priority criminal offence from happen for time be the bill minister for the online safety bill as it then be and think be correct in recall that the priority criminal offence be set out in schedule to that act however be speak from memory so if the shadow home secretary want to make point of order and correct she be very welcome to do so think it be schedule but she be unusually quiet one of those priority offence be concern with the supply of knife so social medium firm and online marketplace will have duty to proactively take step to prevent the sale of two type of knife that be illegal and to prevent the sale of knife in general to to answer the question about criminal liability members will know or should know that the online safety act include provision that create personal criminal liability for executive of large social medium firm in number of circumstance in fact for precisely the reason my right hon friend mention and that the opposition probably have in mind when they draft today motion those measure be strengthen as the online safety bill pass through the house the online safety act as it be now be the mechanism through which those point include personal criminal liability be be address by the way the measure in the criminal justice bill include give the police the power to seize lawfully hold knife that be legal such as kitchen knife if the police reasonably suspect that they be go to be use for criminal purpose if drug dealer have of these knife which might technically be legal but have they at their home address the police can seize those lawful knife where there be suspicion that they be go be use for criminal purpose that be in the criminal justice bill we be also act via statutory instrument lay week or two ago which have be refer to to ban even more zombie style knife and machete we set out in that statutory instrument the characteristic that those knife must have over inch in length for example or certain feature concern serration and sharp edge the reason why that will not take effect until september be that we need to allow people who currently hold knife that will become illegal the chance to surrender they that scheme will run over the summer and the ban will take effect in september pay particular tribute to my hon friend the member for southend west anna firth who have be campaign on this topic for some time she convene knife crime summit last year with number of police and crime commissioner include essex excellent police and crime commissioner roger hirst their campaigning hers and roger hirst lead to this measure come forward hope it be clear from those comment that the law have be tighten already and be in the process of be tighten even far the hon member for west ham ms brown ask good question about child be coerce or manipulate into commit offence and she ask in particular about private member bill table by my hon friend the member for mole valley sir paul beresford this be something that we have study carefully and take advice on as she would expect it be already an offence in relation to both child and adult to encourage control or cause they to undertake criminal activity section to of the serious crime act do what she be rightly ask for and there be also provision in the modern slavery act think they be in section but be again speak from memory those provision in the serious crime act be very wide range in fact more wide range than those in the modern slavery act and they apply to child and to adult and would like to see the police use those power great deal more say very gently to the right hon gentleman and be genuinely grateful to he for listen to what ask for and for respond that the expert in the field believe those provision do not do what they need to would he allow to write to he and have discussion so that we can take this matter forward yes be very willing to work with the hon lady and to look at detailed representation have be advise that those section be quite broad ranging have read they myself and on the face of it and read they as member of parliament would read any bit of legislation they do strike as very wide range in their scope however be of course happy to listen to particular representation and to discuss they if those section of the serious crime act and the modern slavery act contain lacunae would be willing to discuss that be look forward to hear from the hon lady on that topic and work with she if there be gap to be fill we have talk about prevention and about the law need to be strong enough and we must come on to enforcement because we must protect our fellow citizen from criminal activity knife crime in particular clearly it be important to make sure that the police have the relevant resource an opposition member refer to police number and in march last year we achieve headcount of police officer more than at any time in history in fact it be about more than under the last labour government would like those police officer to do couple of thing would like they to be patrol in hotspot where crime be particular problem we have be do hotspot patrolling in force area in what be call project grip and that have deliver very significant reduction in violent crime we also trialle hotspot patrolling in force area include essex staffordshire and lancashire for antisocial behavioural last year and those deliver reduction in antisocial behaviour of up to because that be work from april this year just couple of month time we be put new funding of million behind it over and above the record police settlement by the way that settlement will see an extra million go to police and crime commissioner with that million to fund hotspot patrolling in every single police force area in the country target against antisocial behaviour and serious violence because we know it work be sure member will be lobby their police and crime commissioner to make sure that those hotspot patrol take place in area of concern to they know for example that one of the part of essex where those hotspot patrol have take place be southend and it have be effective at reduce antisocial behaviour there stop and search be another important part of this equation it would seem that the mayor of london and some opposition members do not like it and understand their concern but we need to use stop and search confidently and proactively do lawfully and respectfully of course because it have take knife off the street in the last four year every month in london alone knife be take off the street by stop and search we need to use it confidently and proactively and not pull back from use it because it will save life when we talk to the family of victim who sadly often come from ethnic minority community they say if only my son murderer have be stop and search on the way to the murder that be the kind of thing we hear people say if anyone be concerned about disproportionality it be topic want to look at myself the rate at which knife or drug be successfully find on people who be stop and search be about the same regardless of ethnicity whether someone be white black asian or any ethnicity the find rate be about the same at approximately or if there be disproportionality or unfair behaviour by the police we would find difference but we do not so urge all chief constable and pcc to use stop and search confidently and proactively my hon friend the member for old bexley and sidcup mr french mention scan technology technology be be develop it be not ready for deployment yet but it be be develop and we be put funding into it this year to scan people walk down the street for example semi covertly it be not knife arch but be much small scan device and it can scan people to see whether they have knife somewhere on their person that be obviously much less intrusive than stop and search do not lead to some of the tension stop and search can lead to and it be obviously much quick to do be hopeful that if we can deploy that scan technology it will make it near impossible to carry knife in high traffic place such as high street in london we be invest in that technology there be also an opportunity to catch more perpetrator use facial recognition include live facial recognition which we discuss in the bill committee at some length do do this again the shadow minister be worried that be go to spend the next minute describe it be not go to do that but will say that in the last week there have be further deployment of live facial recognition in croydon and it have catch want people over the past few week people have be catch who be want for knife offence rape and other very serious offence who would not otherwise have be catch so live facial recognition can help we there as well strong approach to enforcement be critical too we hear some political point from the opposition members have try to deliver these concluding remark in spirit that be not too political but few member say they think the solution to this problem be general election would politely and gently say that the large police force in the country be london and it have labour police and crime commissioner labour members have say the way london be run be model for future labour government but of the police force oversee labour and sadiq khan stewardship of london be pretty much the bad in the last year knife crime in london have go up while in the rest of the country it have go down it be the only police force to have miss its police uplift recruitment target in fact it could have have an extra police officer for which there be government money available but it do not recruit they if that be model for future labour government heaven help we all in the meantime where there be measure we need to take to go far we will be very open to have constructive discussion such as those have agree to have with the hon member for west ham because know all of we be unite in our desire to fight the scourge of knife crime those of we who have attend the funeral of victim as do with elianne andam family few week ago and indeed all of we be under moral obligation as well as public duty obligation to do everything we can and leave no stone unturned in fight that scourge and will work with member on both side of the house to make sure we do exactly that question put and agree to resolve that this house condemn the government for oversee per cent increase in knife crime since recognise the devastating impact that knife crime have on victim their family and the wide community acknowledge that the government recently announce measure to ban zombie knife and machete believe nonetheless that this legislation do not go nearly far enough mean that number of dangerous type of knife and sword will remain legal and available on uk street therefore call on the government to address the shortcoming of the ban by extend it to cover ninja sword and consult on further extension and far call for the government to establish an end to end review of online knife sale and introduce criminal liability for senior management of website which indirectly sell illegal knife online ministerial severance reform pm beg to move that this house call on the government to immediately introduce legislation to amend the ministerial and other pensions and salaries act to ensure that depart ministers who have not attain the age of receive an amount equal to one quarter of their earning over the

the conclusion of any proceeding to which this order apply standing order exempt business shall apply in respect of any such debate in this order designate member mean the rt hon member for islington south and finsbury and any other member act on behalf of the rt hon member for islington south and finsbury today we seek the permission of the house to make time for legislation in the week ahead to reform the system for ministerial severance payment those payment be first introduce exactly year ago for ministers in the house of lords with rule that be almost identical to the one that now apply to this house as well departing ministers be to receive quarter of their annual salary equivalent to three month of pay provide that they be under the age of that they have be in post for at least two year and that they do not return to the job within three week have inform the right hon member for great yarmouth sir brandon lewis that will be refer to he personally in this debate he be the only minister of the in question who have claim two severance payment in total almost the second payment be worth three month pay after just seven week in the job as justice secretary do my right hon friend agree that at the height of cost of living crisis it be nothing short of disgrace that the right hon gentleman feel entitled to claim so much money from the taxpayer when deliver so little in return my hon friend be spot on for those on the government benches mutter about claim it do not really matter whether the money be claim or if it be give to someone and not give back the point be that the money be still pocket by the right hon member for great yarmouth and no one be expect the rule to be use in that way that be the point of this debate the payment be extend to other ministers in base on recommendation by the then top salaries review board which command broad cross party support the only change from the previous rule be to remove the two year qualifying limit but it be worth note that in every debate that precede the legislation mps remain clear that these payment be intend for the benefit of long serve ministers who be have to make what geoffrey howe call an abrupt and significant financial adjustment on relinquish ministerial report january vol will the right hon lady accept that when our party come to power in we cut ministerial pay and we have keep it freeze ever since in the unlikely event of her side get into power would she commit to maintain that freeze if the hon lady have moment to look at the motion before we today and to consider it in the spirit of fairness and how public money should be spend hope that she would agree that the current system have be abuse over the past few year by her colleague in the chamber and outside it that be simply not the sort of thing that the public want they would be appal if they know what be go on with the severance payment we be talk about today will the right hon lady give way will make bit more progress and then will give way we be talk about severance payment today government members may wish to speak about red herring and other issue but let we talk about the abuse of the severance payment system that we have see over the past few year because we should take clear eyed look at it we be not seek to scrap those payment nor should we as geoffrey howe say they be introduce so that ministers who have give long and dedicated service to their country could adjust to the loss of that salary do not think anyone on the opposition benches have any quarrel with that over the year that those payment have exist there have never be any previous occasion where it have be open to question that the rule by which those payment be make be wrong then however we come to it be year of chaos in our politic unprecedented in modern time sadly it be year in which the current severance scheme have its flaw suddenly expose and its loophole shamelessly exploit before address what go wrong with the system in that financial year will do something that find personally unusual which be to praise some member of conservative cabinets it will be hard for and feel my ancestor start to shift uneasily in their graf but want to give credit where credit be due and that credit go to small collection of secretaries of state who for want of well phrase do the right thing when it come to severance entitlement during that year of chaos praise the current secretary of state for environment food and rural affairs the right hon member for north east cambridgeshire steve barclay who be sack as health secretary in september but reinstate by the current prime minister seven week later what do he do with his severance payment he return it in full when he regain his old job so he deserve praise for that praise the current secretary of state for science innovation and technology the right hon member for chippenham michelle donelan who resign after two day as education secretary in july but turn down the plus severance payment for which those two day have make she eligible and she deserve praise for that even want to praise the right hon member for south staffordshire sir gavin williamson the former chief whip the former defence secretary and the former education secretary he claim his plus severance in when he be sack for leak top secret information he claim his plus severance again in when he be sack for all his various school fiasco however he finally turn down his severance payment in after two week in the cabinet office because he recognise that it would be inappropriate to accept it while under investigation for bullying so let we praise he for that if for nothing else what those example show be that it be entirely possible for individual to choose to waive their severance payment or return they when they feel that accept they would not be right perhaps those individual even reflect that at the height of the cost of live crisis which have be greatly exacerbate by the action of their government it would seem inappropriate to accept thousand of pound from the taxpayer as reward for the contribution they have make to the chaos perhaps they realise how much like smack in the face that would feel to their constituent either way those individual do do the right thing however the hard fact be number bear this out that for every one case in the last financial year where tory minister decide that accept that severance payment would be inappropriate in the circumstance in at least six or seven other case the opposite be unfortunately true that be why we find ourselves here try to fix system of ministerial severance that have be bring into disrepute by dozen of its most recent beneficiary my right hon friend have mention many secretaries of state we also have short live prime minister who be entitle to some payment for the rest of her life should we not also look at whether it be appropriate for people who leave in disgrace to end up with lifelong pay cheque my hon friend make an important point that be an important argument that will need to be consider the right hon lady be argue that certain lax culture have grow up under successive conservative governments that benefit few but taint we all and think it go beyond severance pay my right hon friend the member for dwyfor meirionnydd liz saville roberts propose private member bill the elected representatives prohibition of deception bill which would have make it an offence for ministers to knowingly and wilfully lie to the public be there any chance that an incoming labour government might adopt that if we be give the great honour of serve the public as the next government our ministers will not deceive the public we will be straightforward and we will do our utmost to serve they to the good of our ability we will be government to be proud of we just need to have an opportunity for the purpose of explain our motion will go through each of the five category where flaw in the rule be expose in and give one example for each of how someone benefit mr deputy speaker have inform each of they that be go to be raise their case before the right hon lady move on will she give way will know this be an opposition day debate where the government will get bash that be part of the convention and tradition of this house however on an important constitutional point think the hon member for brighton kemptown lloyd russell moyle allude to the former prime minister my right hon friend the member for south west norfolk elizabeth truss do the right hon lady think that ex labour prime ministers and ex conservative prime ministers thankfully do not think we will ever have lib dem one we can agree on that should have no private office arrangement support by the state those people have be at the high level as first lord of the treasury have have access to top secret and classified material and will probably be under constant threat for the rest of their life be she honestly say that labour government would no long support former prime ministers of whatever political party be say that this be an important issue that need to be consider suggest that perhaps together the right hon gentleman and my hon friend the member for brighton kemptown lloyd russell moyle put in for debate so that we can air these matter properly today want to talk about ministerial severance payment rise will give way to the hon gentleman and then hope that will not need to give way to he again be grateful to the right hon lady for give way be not the fact we be get interesting idea come from labour members an example of how the motion before the house be so ill think out those idea be not in the motion do she not agree that this be not the way to create legislation be proud to say that my party be full of good idea but unfortunately we be unable to put they all into one motion let we have little discipline today by concentrate on the motion at hand and the important issue we be raise we believe that five particular problem be highlight by the chaos in will go through each of they give an example and explain why the change we want to put forward will solve those problem and why we would therefore ask the house as whole to seriously consider our proposal to ensure that we can pass legislation to change the situation because it do need to be fix first let we look at what call the short stayer problem more than two dozen individual occupy front bench role for just nine week at the fag end of the johnson government or just seven week during the bedlam of the truss experiment all of whom walk away with three month of severance pay let we look at the hon member for stoke on trent north jonathan gullis as an example never shrink violet when it come to call out other he serve just full day as minister in the department for education earn less than in wage yet when he return to the back benches he receive almost double that in severance three month severance for day work perhaps the minister for common sense will tell we whether that make sense to she secondly we have the problem of the short live promotion individual who find themselves elevate from junior ministerial role to more senior position and whose severance be therefore calculate not base on the salary they have earn for most of the year but base on the much high salary they have earn for only few week let we think of the example of the right hon member for middlesbrough south and east cleveland sir simon clarke who spend year as chief secretary to the treasury earn salary of almost but then spend seven week as levelling up secretary on salary of more than double that amount as result of those seven week alone the right hon gentleman receive severance pay of almost again look forward to the minister for common sense explain where the sense be in that thirdly we have what might call the quick returner more than dozen ministers who claim their three month severance pay after quit the johnson government or be sack by his successor but who end up return to the front bench matter of week later while still enjoy the benefit of their severance payment take the minister for veterans affairs the right hon member for plymouth moor view johnny mercer who not only accept three month in severance after only two month as veterans minister but tell plymouth live point blank that he have not accept severance payment and then have the sheer chutzpah to return to exactly the same job seven week later without repay single penny once again hope that the expert on these matter will tell we whether that sound like common sense fourthly there be much small category have decide it be good not to give they name at all we also see severance payment award in to two individual peter bone and chris pincher who leave their front bench job while under investigation at the time for act of gross misconduct the rule be silent on this issue and we can only assume that it be think that any individual force to quit in those circumstance would have the basic decency not to accept handout from the taxpayer however be afraid what the pincher and bone case have show we be that we can not rely on the decency of individual like that finally perhaps most incredibly five severance payment in the last financial year be make entirely by mistake because the government forget to apply the age limit that say no one over the age of can receive one which be how peter bone and nadine dorries receive their payment before the current incumbent of the cabinet office tell themselves that they have bring order to all this chaos it be worth note that the large of those mistaken payment which be make to minister in the lords be make not during the chaos of the summer and autumn of but in what one might call the cold light of day in january the propose change to the severance rule set out in labour motion would address each of the five issue that have set out do my right hon friend agree that have any of our constituent be face to face with the department for work and pensions in similar situation to that which she describe the result might have be different any of our constituent struggle to get to the end of the week on their wage packet and who see the amount of money be hand out essentially as payment for failure would be astonish that it be allow that be why we be try to change the rule today the right hon lady in her meaningless and bitter speech be miss the essential point that ought to be at the heart of her argument when people be struggle it be gall that someone who already earn salary of year for be member of parliament and more on top of that for their ministerial duty be give another payment when for whatever reason the prime minister do not like they or perhaps they have not do particularly good job they get severance package be the truth of the matter not that labour should be call for no severance package for any minister when they lose their job if our motion do not go far enough for the hon gentleman let propose that he vote with we tonight anyway because at least we be head in the right direction if his colleague vote simply to keep the status quo he will have great deal of difficulty explain to his constituent how give his view he have allow it to continue let move on we want to make change to deal with the five issue to deal with short stayer and short term promotion ministers would be pay quarter of their actual earning over the previous month not quarter of their final salary to deal with the quick returner our reform would require individual who return to the front bench while still enjoy the benefit of their severance payment to repay the corresponding amount to deal with those who do not deserve any payment we demand that ministers who quit while under investigation for gross misconduct or breach the ministerial code have their severance payment withhold unless or until their name be clear if all those rule have be in place in the hon member for stoke on trent north would have receive in severance not almost the short live levelling up secretary the right hon member for middlesbrough south and east cleveland would have receive just over not almost the right hon member for plymouth moor view would have receive not almost and the former members for tamworth and for wellingborough would have receive exactly what they deserve nothing at all in total if the proposal in our motion have be in place in and the age limit rule have be properly enforce the total severance bill that year would have be cut by more than save for the taxpayer of almost if our rule have be in place of the ministers who claim severance pay in that year would have see their payment reduce by an average of just over that be why our motion be so important but government members may reasonably ask why it be so urgent why be it necessary to reform the rule in this way why do labour need to take control of the order paper very simply if they think what happen in the last financial year be one off aberration that could not happen again they have not be pay attention do they not know about the plotting of their own colleague and the plan for yet another palace coup against the current incumbent of downing street yet again in the come month we could see mass resignation from the front bench to put pressure on weak and fail prime minister yet again we could see reform adjacent radical put in his place eager to engage in experiment with the british economy yet again we could see it all go horribly wrong lead to heaven know what in the aftermath frankly if that be how the conservatives want to spend their time between now and the general election part of just want to say well get on with it then but big part of say that they should not be allow to gamble again with the future of the british people and they should certainly not be allow to profit again from the result of their own failure indeed it would be shameful indictment of our political system if we be to allow yet another round of excessive and undeserved ministerial severance payment to be make between now and the next election when we have the opportunity today to stop that happen appeal to the conservative members mention at the outset of my speech and the handful of other like they who decide to send back their severance payment in who choose to accept small amount or who decide to repay part of what they have receive in the circumstance in which they find themselves and hope in the circumstance they see their constituent face they make personal choice to do the right thing hope that at the end of this debate they will make another personal choice and again decide to do the right thing they have the opportunity today to restore the rule on severance payment to the purpose for which they be originally intend and to fix the system that sadly their colleague have break if they do not take this opportunity the conclusion we will have to draw perhaps the right conclusion after all be that the only way to get the change we need in this country will be to elect labour government and put on the benches opposite mps and ministers who believe in serve their community not just in help themselves it have be interesting to hear the labour party yes the labour party make the case for the term and condition of worker to be change unilaterally in one day and without consultation or proper review be sure that labour union paymaster will be fascinate to hear the case make by the right hon member for islington south and finsbury emily thornberry today start by make it clear that the motion before the house depart from the fundamental principle that it be the government of the day that be the party that win the election vote in by the public who be able to determine the business of the house that be something the house itself have long recognise in standing order no by set aside standing order no the motion would enable the opposition to bring in bill and race it through parliament by proceed through all its substantive commons stage in one day the truth be that if the right hon lady be so keen to decide the business of the day in the house she should not have support her neighbour the right hon member for islington north jeremy corbyn to become the prime minister give that she do support he she clearly be not all that keen on be in charge of parliamentary business although it be sometimes necessary for parliament to legislate at pace in exceptional circumstance and in response to emergency this be not policy matter that warrant set aside the procedure of the house to do so would inhibit proper parliamentary scrutiny we have just have an opposition day debate on knife crime which have go through the roof in sadiq khan london do it not say everything about the priority of the labour party that it propose emergency legislation in respect of this debate and not that one perhaps the third minute of her speech will be when the minister start to talk about the topic which be ministerial severance pay the minister for common sense have personal experience of this in and and may soon do so again in the meantime can she tell we how she decide which of the payment for which she be eligible to accept and which to turn down do she think that decision on what to accept should remain at the discretion of the individual even in case where the individual be guilty of gross misconduct the hon member have raise point about redundancy payment and that be fundamentally what we be talk about severance pay be redundancy payment in that ministers can be turf out of office without any notice of termination and without any proper consultation they have be give what would otherwise be call redundancy payment entirely agree that people have accept those redundancy payment just as labour ministers do when the prime minister change from blair to brown and just as labour ministers do when labour go out of office in will the minister give way will carry on for little while long want to talk about what the opposition be do today which be as say at the outset seize the business of the day and try to make this case for emergency legislation which it be not so many emergency confront the country and the world and it be strike that of all those emergency it could be the middle east it could be ukraine it could be illegal migration the opposition deem this to be the most important we know why that be it be because they have no plan to deal with any of those big issue of the day they do not know what to say they do not have clue and they change their mind flip flippity flop all the time so they have be reduce to talk about this issue give the importance that the right hon member for islington south and finsbury attache to the issue want to seize the business of the day want to push through emergency legislation can she confirm that this will be the first piece of legislation that any new labour government would introduce no because we be go to win the vote today common sense will prevail and we will know that this have to be sort out now there be no need to wait for labour government you guy can help we to pass this legislation so it be not go to happen today but in fact the opposition be not go to do it if they come into power which hopefully they will not that be how much of an emergency it be however there be some good news here the right hon lady be put herself at the vanguard of cut waste which must be first for the labour party will she take this opportunity to apologise for the private finance initiative scheme that her party inflict on the country and on much of its public service will she take this opportunity to apologise for the hundred of billion of pound worth of waste will give way to she if she would like to make an apology for those huge amount of pfi waste could we perhaps talk about the billion waste on personal protective equipment really think that the minister ought to consider talk about ministerial severance reform but that is of course matter for she so the right hon lady could not apologise she could not or do not want to stop the waste of hundred of billion of pound will say this the government accept that the current legislation be now third of century old and that this may be an appropriate time to review it and consider change but this be not the right time or place to take action proper consideration must be give to new legislation as member will know severance pay be govern by legislation the statutory provision for ministerial severance pay be contain in the ministerial and other pensions and salaries act it have therefore be in place for successive administration and have be pay to member of all three party who have make ministerial office during this period under the act ministers who leave office be entitle to payment equivalent to quarter of the annual salary that they be be pay in respect of the ministerial office that they be leave to be eligible for payment they must be under certain and must not be reappointe to ministerial office within three week of leave their previous office note and thank the right hon lady for draw it to my attention that in small number of severance payment be make incorrectly to depart ministers want to make it clear that the cabinet office guidance to departments be that they should seek to recover any mispayment in line with his majesty treasury guidance manage public money while the incorrect payment be cause by an administrative error and the former ministers concerned be at no personal fault whatsoever it be important that the government seek to recover that money be sure be not the only one who recall the catastrophic overpayment of tax credit when labour be last in office and the fact that many family get into huge difficulty because of that it be such shame that the right hon lady be not so exercised about that when they be in office will the minister give way no because we be talk about waste we be talk about appropriate measure take place and this faux emergency legislation that the right hon lady want to bring in turn to ministerial severance pay more generally it be important to note that this be the long stand policy that successive government from both side of the house have retain the reason they have retain it that the principle of pay severance remain sound the prime minister in his constitutional role as principal adviser to the sovereign can recommend the appointment and removal of ministers at any time this flexibility necessary as it be within our political system mean that have reasonable severance pay policy to reflect the uncertain nature of ministerial office have have wide support from across the house since its introduction member will be aware that similar arrangement be in place for member of parliament who also hold the status of officeholder in certain circumstance member of parliament who lose seat at general election be eligible to receive loss of office payment the eligibility for the loss of office payment be determine by the independent parliamentary standards authority which be responsible for set and regulate mp salary pension business cost and expense severance payment recognise the unpredictable nature of ministerial office the fact that minister can lose their office with no notice when the government or prime minister change will inevitably lead to substantial increase in the money pay out in that financial year million from sedentary position get million quote at remember although maybe the right hon lady do not that it be over million in when labour lose office and that be quite long time ago it be for these reason that the government do not currently intend to reform severance pay for depart ministers although be happy to review it as mention early the current system respect the essential constitutional principle that minister serve at the discretion of the prime minister and that it be right to provide some protection associate with the loss of ministerial office the principle have apply as say to all government since the act be pass in and we need to be careful not to change policy on the basis of exception that will occasionally occur under government of all form if the minister be go to review the system can she guarantee that it will be review and implement before the next general election be sad to say no can not because we have say that it be essential that there be due process on the floor of this house not like the opposition who want to whisk it through in day we be completely transparent about the payment of severance and all such payment be publish in departmental annual report in the interest of objective debate could the minister please confirm why ministers above the age of from any of the major party be less deserving than those who be under my hon friend make good point and think that that would be look at under the review as well should we review this but the law that be set out at that time stipulate that age that be something else that agree would need to be look at want to be clear that severance pay can not be look at as stand alone issue it be part of an overall picture that govern payment make to ministers more broadly the government have consistently demonstrate restraint and always seek to minimise the cost of government at the same time as modernise ministerial office to bring it into the century this be most clearly demonstrate in the government policy on ministerial pay ministerial salary today be low than they be when this government take office in which in real term constitute significant pay cut my noble friend lord cameron introduce cut to ministerial pay when he come into office in since then prime ministers have ask ministers to waive the increase in their statutory pay entitlement year on year for example ministerial salary be roughly half that be half of what they would have be have lord cameron not introduce the salary reduction when he become prime minister in april ministers of state earn which be in today money yet minister of state today receive appreciate that the right hon member for islington south and finsbury do not want to reply to the question from my hon friend the member for southend west anna firth but will she confirm today that her party would continue with the ongoing cut in ministerial pay that be not what the motion be about so be afraid that can not help the minister be she aware that million be spend on severance payment to all the special adviser who lose their job in the same year that be well dodged again by the right hon lady she will not confirm that labour would keep tight fiscal grip on ministerial pay obviously one of the key thing about today motion be waste and expenditure we will see what happen as always money run away with the labour party this government pass the transformative ministerial and other maternity allowances act which for the first time enable ministers to take pay maternity leave and be replace in their department several members have now benefit from this legislation when in office and be sure it will continue to be of immense value the government be commit to return to parliament in due course to set out proposal on extend the act conclude by reaffirm the government commitment to recover the money pay in error to small number of former ministers reassure the house that departmental process have be strengthen to ensure that this error do not happen again for the reason have set out the government do not think there should be wholesale legislative reform on this matter during this parliament we believe that government commit to the principle of integrity in public life be the most effective way to control the cost of government to the taxpayer in that spirit we will continue to demonstrate restraint in how we be pay and we will continue to modernise ministerial office to meet the expectation that the public rightly have of we the right hon member for islington south and finsbury could not say whether her party would maintain our cut to ministerial salary could not apologise for the last labour government waste money on pfi scheme and could not say whether this bill because it be such important emergency legislation would be the first piece of legislation introduce by labour government so we can safely conclude that the labour party do not care about taxpayer money thank the labour party for table this motion which highlight the difference between this place and reality nearly million in severance pay be hand out during last year political chaos some ministers receive severance pay despite be in office for only day in day period an asylum seeker would receive if they be be house in hotel that be enough to pay for first bus day ticket for nine day provide that they buy nothing else in contrast the former chancellor would be able to pay for first bus day ticket which be full bus of day ticket for every one of those day and that be just from his severance pay in clear and stark contrast scottish government ministers have have pay freeze for the consecutive year scottish government minister be currently entitle to that include their msp salary by the way but under the voluntary pay freeze they receive the level of cabinet secretary in scotland have an entitlement of but receive the voluntary reduction be take from net pay and be return to the scottish government to be make available for public spending number of conservative members mention the freeze in ministerial pay here accord to the library briefing ministerial pay in the house of commons have be freeze at level but ministerial pay in the house of lords have be freeze only at level if the government be go to appoint secretary of state in the house of lords they will cost we more than they do in the house of commons cabinet secretaries in scotland and scottish government ministers be each handing back more money to public fund annually than the former chancellor receive in his severance pay the tories be absolutely clear that people can live on universal credit despite all evidence to the contrary yet the day chancellor accept severance payment worth nearly four year of uc for single person the uk government seem absolutely determined to highlight at every opportunity how out of touch they be they have refuse to zero rate vat on mortgage yet for day work the right hon member for spelthorne kwasi kwarteng accept payment that could cover month or five and half year of the typical owner occupi mortgage increase accord to the bank of england it be deeply ironic that all homeowner be have to pay for his mistake while he be be reward for they as people be push into ever increase poverty have to make devastating choice between heating and eating the right hon member for spelthorne could fund food parcel from his severance pay alone and he be far from the only one tory and brexit chaos have not just cause rampant inflation and increase the cost of mortgage mean that people be have to choose between heating and eating it have mean government reshuffle every five minute with an institute for government worker comment not say there be be lot of ministerial turnover since but you could now play an side football match between ministers for the cabinet office and secretaries of state for digital culture media and sport in that time the ministerial trough be institutional and it be indicative of the rot ingrain in westminster the public rightfully deserve and expect value for money yet with record level of turnover on the government benches result in so many people eligible for severance payment this be ludicrous waste of public money during this cost of living crisis in the eight year since the brexit vote there have be housing ministers nine education secretaries eight home secretaries seven foreign secretaries seven chancellor seven health secretaries seven environment food and rural affairs secretaries and five prime ministers how be it possible that former culture secretary nadine dorries be accidentally pay in severance payment the right hon member for south west norfolk elizabeth truss serve pitiful day as prime minister crash the uk economy with her fantasy think tank economic and make the electorate who do not vote for she pay for her mistake well together say in that no vote would bring well safe fast change for scotland yet all we have see in westminster be constant chaos with it mire in the ceaseless rot of corruption and cronyism defy anyone to tell folk out there that their life be well now than they be before the independence referendum in westminster be institutionally design to promote the entrenchment and passing of power between select few hand while enrich the participant minister be grant extremely broad power with lack of oversight by parliament we see that once again yesterday during the finance bill where they unilaterally change the ways and means resolution after the line by line scrutiny debate we see these thing on regular basis the call from the brexiteers be take back power they have take back power but to the executive not to parliament parliament be be stymie at every opportunity by this uk government when ministers inevitably fail or be push out due to westminster political power game they take ministerial severance payment after they be finally evict from their seat by constituent they can receive cushy money for nothing job and reward for the rest of their life while ministers in westminster abuse their position to give contract and public money to their friend and financial backer these be not failing unique to the tory party but rather institutional design feature of the westminster system which have inherit hundred of year of aristocratic baggage and be entirely unfit as system for govern modern country labour have promise to reform westminster from within for over year promise to abolish the house of lords reduce prerogative ministerial power and now low ministerial severance pay that promise be not worth the hansard it be write in every time the labour party be elect on promise to reform westminster it instead integrate into the system and dig in to use it for its own end stack the lords rather than abolish it or make extensive use of the prerogative power rather than minimise they when labour take power again have no doubt it will that long tradition of entrenchment the leader of the opposition continue his flip flopping and if he become prime minister he will doubtless lose or sack minister when that happen they will make just as much use of the ministerial severance pay as their tory cousin the only solution be radical overhaul of westminster and of the entrenchment and the current position only vote for the snp and independence will finally lead to the reform necessary for scotland and the rest of the uk to move forward and become modern century democracy that work for all the people not just overpay politician if anyone have any doubt that the opposition be not fit to govern this country that doubt must have be dispel this afternoon there be many thing they could have choose to debate it be child mental health week there be all sort of incredibly important thing go on today about safer internet day it be the start of national apprenticeship week it be world cancer day two day ago we could have debate the economy or the middle east as parliamentary private secretary go to brilliant debate about the homes for ukraine scheme today but no they have use their second opposition day debate to talk about party politic that be all this debate be about and it be an appalling waste of taxpayer money that we be debate this subject today the opposition know jolly well as the right hon member for islington south and finsbury emily thornberry say that ministerial severance pay be establish in legislation pass by parliament in and have be use by successive administration over decade it be statutory entitlement implement by government of all stripe payment be make and accept by outgo labour ministers throughout the blair and brown year as well as by liberal democrat ministers in the coalition government my hon friend refer to the initial legislation in but that be follow up as she be no doubt aware by the scotland act which be bring in by labour and repeat the same approach for scotland do she agree that it be the height of hypocrisy from the opposition to claim outrage now when they bring in similar legislation themselves completely agree with my hon friend brilliant point which bring naturally to my next point the last labour government have the opportunity to amend the legislation in any one of the year they be in office instead they choose to do absolutely nothing even more outrageously follow labour defeat in the election when the right hon member for birmingham hodge hill liam byrne leave that infamous note say dear chief secretary sorry afraid to tell you there be no money leave it do not say that it say be afraid to tell you there be no money leave that be not what he say that be an exact quote there be no money leave do not mind say it again because that be the mess that labour leave we with the point here be that have say that there be no money leave what do outgoing labour ministers do they pocket million in that year in severance pay in today money that would be million truly shocking that be irresponsible then and their action be hypocritical today in stark contrast when we enter office what be our approach when we see the mess that labour have leave we in we cut our ministerial salary and have keep they freeze ever since my hon friend make an excellent point about labour but we have hear from the scottish national party that somehow it be well north of the border do she agree that that be surprising give that the scottish daily express say snp spin doctor receive more than in golden goodbye in as humza yousaf rung tiny change what do that say about the snp totally agree with my hon friend that be absolutely appalling we also know that sham snp msp derek mackay who have leave office claim in expense include as understand it severance pay the snp approach be incredibly hypocritical while we be sort out labour mess cut our own pay and keep it frozen every single labour leadership candidate in refuse to hand back their taxpayer fund severance pay include the right hon member for doncaster north edward miliband and the mayor of greater manchester both of whom be entitle to and they still hold elect office today when we question those severance payment give the mess that labour have leave we in labour party spokesman respond by say that it be pathetic attempt to create smokescreen around serious economic yes would be grateful if those on the labour front bench team can confirm to the house today that this motion be pathetic and hypocritical attempt to create smokescreen around their total lack of plan for britain there be no plan for the economy no plan to tackle welfare and no plan to deal with immigration in fact we know that labour would take we right back to square one as usual while the opposition be snip from the sideline and make these cheap political point we be actually get on with the job of serious government in the past year the conservative party have be focus on deliver for the people of britain let remind labour members what that delivery look like well state school than ever before more student secure top grade in math physics and chemistry will the hon lady give way be not far from finished so will carry on there be more student from state school at our good university school performance be skyrocket up the pisa table and we now have the good reader in the western world we also have record employment million more people in job than there be in that be over job every day will the hon lady give way no will not be about to finish my remark we have national living wage welfare system that be simple fair and well target more hour of free childcare include oversee the large single expansion of childcare in english history and the fast decarbonisation of any major economy lead the way in renewable which will be key to our future could go on and on this be record of which we be extremely proud we have stick to our plan we have halve inflation we have cut taxis for million work people worth start last week for an average worker and of course we continue to support the most vulnerable in society keep the triple lock and double the personal allowance will conclude by say that any review of the long stand ministerial arrangement for severance pay should be do properly with due process it should not be do in this desperate and political fashion the conservatives be deliver for the people of britain labour would just take we straight back to square one think the good that can be say for the previous speaker the hon member for southend west anna firth be that she spend six minute and second speak about anything but the motion and then the last second on severance pay be sure other than that she be delightful member of the house but on this occasion be afraid she do not really get there in support the motion today want to highlight trio of payment that be make during the chaotic period in the autumn of which capture the essence of why the rule on ministerial severance be bring into disrepute during that period and how reform can fix the problem it be impossible to make those point without speak about individual case as my right hon friend the member for islington south and finsbury emily thornberry say from the front bench and have inform two member that will be discuss the payment give to they as example of what happen if we cast our mind back to september colleague will remember that in the early day of the premiership of the right hon member for south west norfolk elizabeth truss there be some turmoil in her whip operation mind you the early day be swiftly follow by the middle day and the final day be not very far behind and it be fair to say there be turmoil all the way through anyway in those early day three assistant whips be sack and three more put in their place the appointment be make three day before the mini budget and they last just day until the right hon member leave downing street the three assistant whips spend almost their entire time in office prop up doom regime while it continue to do huge damage to the country damage for which my constituent be still pay the price in the shape of crippling mortgage payment in those circumstance we might have think that those who be appoint by the right hon member for south west norfolk would have walk away from their brief time in office feel some measure of contrition perhaps even shame at the role they have play in that disastrous administration and want only to apologise to their constituent for what they have do instead unbelievably each of the three assistant whip walk away with three month of severance pay handout from the taxpayer after just day work they receive two and half time more in severance pay than they be pay in salary during those day at the same time number of departmental ministers receive in severance pay compare with for their salary in five and bit week as ministers all that happen at time when people all round the country be struggle to put food on the table to fill up their car and to pay their bill in the face of cost of living crisis that those ministers time in office have just make substantially bad average growth in the uk have be compare with the when labour be in office between and that low growth have mean billion less in gdp billion less in tax revenue for public service and infrastructure and year less on average per household for each of those year across the uk those be the figure the price of failure of year of conservative government when the right hon member for south west norfolk crash the economy through her reckless unfunded mini budget it just turbocharge the damage do my constituent and all our constituent be still live with the consequence of what the then chancellor the right hon member for spelthorne kwasi kwarteng dismissively refer to as turbulence in the form of high food price and mortgage payment the premium for economic failure which be create when the right hon member for south west norfolk and for spelthorne crash the economy be still price into market today and private investment in the uk be still at record low the scale of severance payment as reward for be part of that disastrous mismanagement of the economy be nothing short of disgraceful however it do serve one purpose at least it make the case for reform indisputable it be shame that the minister choose not to engage with the substantive point about the severance payment system have be show not to be fit for purpose as result of what happen in under labour proposal the three assistant whip would have receive not quarter of their annual salary but quarter of their actual earning reduce their severance payment from to which be almost tenth of what they originally receive and much fair and more sensible amount the hon member for southport damien moore be at pain to point out in his recent comment to the liverpool echo that the payment he receive be an automatic entitlement in other word he be just follow the rule as they stand the that he receive compare with the that would have be due have the legislation refer to on the order paper be in place really say it all the hon member for south ribble katherine fletcher make similar defence to the lancashire post to which she say that severance payment be govern by act of parliament our proposal would have see her severance payment down from to which be much more proportionate to her time serve be more than happy with what both members say in public but hope that they accept that in no other job would the severance payment from which they benefit be allow that be among the question that the minister do not address in what other job be full severance pay available from day one in that way or in the event of gross misconduct those be the reason why the measure propose by my right hon friend the member for islington south and finsbury be so important the good news be that conservative members include the beneficiary of excessive payment have the opportunity to make amend today the hon gentleman be make an interesting point and want to ask he to explore it little more the immediate availability of redundancy payment if can call it that would not be affect by the motion so be he suggest that the motion be not fit for purpose either it sound to like the hon gentleman be defend the status quo while we be try to make the system proportionate and fair he and his colleague will have chance to do something about this unfair system which have be show to be completely out of order by what happen in those who take advantage of the rule can do something about it by vote with we tonight rule to use the word of the hon member for southport can be change and act of parliament to use the word of the hon member for south ribble can be replace this evening all the member who benefit from severance payment when the right hon member for south west norfolk resign can do something about the excessive nature of those payment they can take advantage of the opportunity that we be offer and take the logical step of vote to change the rule by support labour proposal for fair and more proportionate severance payment system for ministers begin by make disclosure to the house which be of course in the public domain and have be for some time have receive severance pay in the past want to make that clear from the outset also want to make it clear from the outset that in my respectful view some of the ad hominem attack on name member of parliament that we have hear damage the institution of politic rather than work in partisan way those individual do not do anything wrong they be part of system that allocate funding to they so there should be no legal or moral opprobrium attach to they in their absence whether they have be notify or not it be fine to say that the system ought to change but surely it be not fair to criticise people for be subject to system that have not be change as say have receive severance pay but serve in government role of one sort or another for over year if one include non ministerial position in term of ministerial position serve as deputy leader of the house of commons minister for the arts minister for transport solicitor general attorney general for the first time under one prime minister paymaster general minister for the cabinet office and attorney general for the second time under second prime minister in fact serve under four prime ministers in one role or another and in cabinet on three occasion should not receive severance pay the hon member for sefton central bill esterson ask where else this would happen in the outside world well where else in the outside world would we have situation where there be no redundancy arrangement no notice period no contract between the party and no consultation and the employee if they be employee could be remove without cause be not criticise those thing that be the way government work minister take on those role know that that be the position so they should not criticise it that be the way the cookie crumble and those who do not like it should not take the position however there be no point in compare chalk and cheese the system operate in different way from the outside world we have constitutional situation in which the prime minister whether he or she be labour or conservative have to have the right of hire and fire his or her ministerial team that be an essential prerequisite of the role and the way it must work the only way it can work be by give the prime minister that primus inter par role where he or she have that function agree with the right hon and learn member minister should get severance pay as do when be minister that be absolutely right but the motion do not suggest that they should not he be former deputy leader of the house do he think it be right that deputy leader of the house who serve for day should receive three month severance pay that be the question that we be debate today not the general principle agree that there should be appropriate severance pay and think other labour members do too for exactly the reason he have give when one have system in law whether it be create year ago year ago or year ago it must apply to all if the system fall out of favour it can be review but the example that the hon member have criticise be of someone who serve in role and be entitle to take severance payment as he himself allude to people in the last labour government receive these payment in fact they receive payment that be statistically more generous than have be the case under this government some million in real term in today price as have already be say none of the four labour leadership candidate in return their severance pay think they be under some pressure to do so at the time but decline when minister have no contract no notice period and no consultation or redundancy arrangement and can be remove without cause it be right that that be differentiate from what happen elsewhere because there be an increase risk the right hon and learn member make an interesting point but if working condition be so poor may suggest that he join trade union how do the hon member know that be not already member of trade union actually be not but he do not know that let we talk about trade union because this motion be rather alien to the concept of what understand trade union organisation work to do indeed think they would be appal by the motion by the way as lawyer have always consider that trade union organisation be very robust in defend their own member and their legal right they be very robust and they throw the kitchen sink at it with the good quality lawyer and the good quality legal advice if they think the case be appropriate that be how they represent their member and think they would be appal by this motion because they would say that it be contrary to the ethos of how trade union work if we look at trade union we see that they use to support labour they still do in the and when parliament do not pay salary to mps it be because of trade union that early labour members of parliament and before that liberal mps could afford to be here at all in those day prior to if be not mistaken members of parliament be not pay at all when they start to be pay in they be pay year at time when the average salary in this country be year labour argue that it be right and proper that those salary should be start because then everyone could afford to become member of parliament however what we have to remember and encourage those on the labour front bench to remember it be that that argument be inconsistent with today argument because what they would be argue for be that only wealthy people would consider become ministers labour ministers be earn double what minister have earn under the conservative government since because my noble friend lord cameron freeze ministerial salary they have stay freeze since the parliament which have have major impact it be also worth note that labour select committee chairmen and chairwomen and senior labour mps on the panel of chairs have take salary increase during the course of these parliaments would suggest that be also inconsistent with the thrust of the argument of those on the labour front bench because if they think it be too much for one they should say it be too much for all think there be some significant inconsistency and we must bear in mind that we have to serve the public in the good way we can which mean encourage people to come to this place to serve and to do their duty think that ministers of the crown and in fact member of parliament from across the political divide do come here with view to do that and that be why disagree with the motion when see the amount be talk about in this debate could not help but think about an organisation call haringey giving which do brilliant work in my constituency it be set up and manage by resident and it allow various group to make application to it in the five year that haringey giving have be operate it proudly boast that it have be able to support local grassroots organisation and help thousand of people in the community through the provision of of funding that be of funding painstakingly raise and distribute over five year and it be still not as much as the amount that this government be able to spend on severance payment in the single year of when have be knock on door in recent time have do rather lot of that in really interesting part of the country one thing that people have feed back to be that they do not like chop and change the motion be not as the right hon and learn member for northampton north sir michael ellis suggest critique of salary for do political work such as be an mp in general it be criticise the chop and change of the various government since at christmas haringey giving hold its annual fundraising drive with local resident and business all play their part and it manage to raise that be about the average amount receive by the cabinet ministers who claim severance payment in in fact the right hon member for great yarmouth sir brandon lewis who have be mention many time today could have keep one of his severance payment and donate the other to haringey giving if he be listen to the debate he still have chance to do that that would have be double the total it raise in december say that because it highlight the difference with the real world and the life of so many of our constituent when we talk about these severance payment it be vital to remember exactly what be happen in the country as whole which we see at our advice surgery sometimes family come to the advice surgery and child have no tooth they have stub for tooth because there have be no dental appointment have hear from family who have have pair of shoe that one child wear to the sixth form one day and then they be available at the weekend for another child to wear to do part time job this be the sort of child poverty we be talk about the headline month inflation rate start the year at and end it at and peak at in october the month in which ministers claim severance payment food price rise especially fast with ordinary family face increase in the cost of their weekly shop from march to march these amount of money really matter because they buy thing like food and shoe and they should not be go into the pocket of ministers who have fail and who have be through the revolve door and become ministers again the average pump price for petrol and diesel hit an all time high with petrol rise to per litre in the last week of june and diesel hit almost per litre in the first week of july the same week that minister claim severance payment after join the coup against boris johnson of course there be also mortgage payment the bank of england base rate start the year in april at and end the year in march at with the big spike take place in the wake of the kamikaze budget million of household see their mortgage rate soar and million more have feel the pain since their fix rate deal have come to an end that pain have be make all the bad thank to the direct action of the government so there we have it year when family across the country be struggle more than ever in the face of the cost of live crisis struggle to put food on the table struggle to fill up their car struggle to pay their mortgage and keep roof over their head face impossible choice and have to make incredible sacrifice that be without even mention the record peacetime tax burden that the government have also impose on the country during that period what be tory members do while all this be go on they be fight with each other and scrabble around for promotion pay rise severance payment and resignation honour like they be prize in game show during that disastrous year for the country their only priority be look after their own back and fill their own boot hope that this evening they will think about their constituent struggle to make end meet and all the charity in our constituency who work for every penny they raise they should think about people at the haringey giving scheme scraping and strive to raise few thousand pound they should show bit of contrition and vote to let these reform proceed it have be an absolutely fascinating debate and be grateful to the right hon member for islington south and finsbury emily thornberry for propose this motion because it have give we an opportunity to explore what responsible government really be will tell the house what it be not it be not about create one paragraph legislation to get soundbite on this evening news one need only listen to the debate that we have have to see how the current drafting of the motion be totally inappropriate it make only one recommendation it state that retire ministers should receive an amount equal to one quarter of their earning over the previous month as minister minus any period cover by previous severance entitlement where that be low than an amount equal to one quarter of the annual salary pay to that minister before their departure but that apply only to those under the age of however in this relatively empty chamber we have hear several suggestion as to why that be inappropriate whether it do not go far enough or it be miss important addition this be serious issue and an area that could do with review my right hon friend the member for tatton esther mcvey suggest from the front bench that the government be open to review it but this be absolutely not the right way to do it as this debate have demonstrate and we need only look at the contribution from the hon member for brighton kemptown lloyd russell moyle he fairly raise the issue of the prime ministerial pension or severance payment which continue beyond the moment of retirement it be not just one off payment but continue for the rest of his or her life as understand it that be perfectly proper area for review although it be not mention in this motion the hon member for sefton central bill esterson make the very good point intervene on he at the time that the entitlement come from day one be that reasonable my hon friend the member for bracknell james sunderland recognise that there be contradiction those under the age of be entitle to these severance payment but time have move on we work much later and the retirement age be rise to and then to there be an article in the times just yesterday suggest that in future year it might rise to yet the legislation have this arbitrary figure of why that be perfectly reasonable area to explore as part of wide review of piece of legislation that be perhaps come towards the end of its natural life and need to be review this motion however be not the way to do it labour members cobble together this draft last night when they be think what good wheeze that we can have to create soundbite or bit of line in our social medium content this evening say conservative vote against that be not legislation and in my submission it be particularly inappropriate to use the exceptional mechanism of disapplye standing order no to achieve it there be many benefit to brexit but one of the cost be the adoption of this mechanism to interrupt the working of parliament by disapplye standing order no if that disapplication be acceptable in any situation it be in exceptional and urgent situation not to get soundbite for the evening news be not stand before the house say that this motion and this legislation will fix every single issue that people can possibly think of in relation to the payment of members of parliament in every circumstance but it will at least deal with the situation whereby someone can work as minister for two month get three month severance pay and then seven week later go back to exactly the same job and essentially be pay twice that be what this legislation be here to stop surely the hon gentleman can support that as say at the start of my speech there be element where there be genuine cause for review but if we follow the right hon lady train of thought we would have thousand upon thousand of one paragraph act clog up the legislation we need to do well than that with responsible government which be what we on the government benches try to focus on we review appropriately we use advice from civil servant and then we propose legislation beyond the poverty of labour motion drafting there be the wide issue of ministerial pay and value for money as my hon friend the member for southend west anna firth point out in her good speech when the conservatives come to power in as part of the coalition it be not case of just accept what have go before the government under the leadership of david cameron cut ministerial salary by more importantly every single year since then throughout the coalition period and the conservative government period ministerial salary have be freeze let we look at value for money and the difference we get between labour administration and conservative one see the labour whip the hon member for merthyr tydfil and rhymney gerald jones be in his place in under labour he would have benefit from salary of hon member he do get anything under the conservatives that equivalent position if he be in government receive salary of for parliamentary under secretary of state labour members pay themselves in addition to their parliamentary salary under the conservatives that have be reduce in modern term to at minister of state level under the conservative they be pay under labour they pay themselves the equivalent of they would have have no trouble with their mortgage payment cabinet ministers under the conservatives be pay an additional labour think it appropriate to pay theirs we have hear how the right hon member for birmingham hodge hill liam byrne say there be no money leave and now be begin to understand where it all go we come to the position of prime minister this prime minister be pay an additional labour prime ministers think it appropriate to pay themselves in today money on top when we add the pensions increase pension scheme for keir starmer qc regulations the right hon and learn member for holborn and st pancras keir starmer have his own special pension arrangement from his work as director of public prosecutions disapplye any lifetime allowance for he not for anyone else to for be prime minister plus his mp salary of it be no wonder he vote labour he can afford to be socialist the question for labour be will it commit today to continue the freeze on ministerial salary the right hon member for islington south and finsbury be ask that by my hon friend the member for southend west and she be unable to answer it give she the opportunity again to answer it and she refuse if she do not know the answer perhaps she can write to do know the answer be do this debate why can she not commit to that my hon friend be make brilliant speech interruption he absolutely be would he like to comment on labour members conversion on the road to damascus with their sudden desire to tackle something they have long year to do not only do they not do it but they go on to add to the system be grateful for that intervention it be mention early once if not twice that in the labour party leadership candidate be invite to return their severance payment have refuse to do so the suggestion that they should be describe on behalf of the labour party as pathetic this motion be half baked we have see over the course of couple of hour number of interesting suggestion that could apply to potential legislation in this event it be clearly an improper use of the disapplication of standing order no look at the labour benches if it such an emergency why be those benches so bare even labour members of parliament do not think that this be urgent have no hesitation in vote against this motion and invite everyone else to do the same it be pleasure to follow the hon member for broadland jerome mayhew in this debate which have to take issue with the minister on this be important it be an opportunity for which thank the labour party do not mean it be an opportunity to throw criticism at ministers who be sack all of they think it be in one year it be not an opportunity to do that because as the right hon member for islington south and finsbury emily thornberry point out lot of they do actually hand back the money they be give nor be it an opportunity to throw brickbat at the labour party and say you do do this while you be in government and you think this about ministerial salary above all else this debate be an opportunity to say to the constituent out there who come to we every week who be struggle to pay their mortgage and rent who have be make redundant and do not have another job with another salary that they can fall back on when they get redundancy payment that we appreciate what be happen this be terrible period for the country it be chaotic it cost fortune we be look at prevent it from ever happen again that be what today should be about put ourselves in the place of those constituent and think what they might be think watch this debate right now have to say be acutely aware that my constituent be probably watch and say to themselves what quite few people have say to over the year be sure this have be say to many other member present too which be that too many of we be only in it to line our own pocket we have sit here today and debate redundancy for ministers and complain about ministerial salary in country face cost of living crisis where people can not pay their energy bill be sorry if it sound like be take schoolmarmish attitude to this matter but be slightly embarrassed that any of we could think that this subject be not worth review the hon lady make some powerful point hope make similar point clear in my speech but give her view on the cost of living crisis do she agree that the freeze on ministerial salary should be maintain into the future be actually more concerned with redundancy payment which this debate be about the level of ministerial salary be something that should be debate on its own and should be the subject of regular review what pain be that have constituent who when they be make redundant and get the statutory minimum have nothing to fall back on when minister be sack for incompetence they still have the salary for the job they be actually send here to do which be to serve as member of parliament they have the privilege of serve as member of parliament they then get pay more for the extra privilege of be minister think lot of the public watch this debate today will be ask they get salary for be minister they get redundancy payment for be minister we need to think about this very seriously we need to think about what our constituent will be think do not want to throw brickbat at individual but will just take one example very briefly when the right hon member for south west norfolk elizabeth truss resign as prime minister her golden goodbye be more than the minimum salary in this country it would have go long way for lot of family we should be think about what those family think about that not what we think about or whether the labour party or the conservative party be wrong or the snp frankly we should not take any lecture on financial probity from that party we should be think about what our constituent think for many it would have feel like kick in the tooth they could not pay their mortgage and they be struggle to pay for their child they see this be not my judgment but theirs dozen of conservative mps rake in thousand of pound in severance pay completely down to the chaos that the government cause during cost of living crisis to our constituent it would have feel like taxpayer money be pay for the revolving door of ministers in their view and mine the conservatives trash the economy but our constituent be pay for it that be why these payout have to stop completely respect the member who have pay they back we should recognise that that be the right thing to do they should be stop because as have be say several time today the legislation be introduce in it could have take no account of the sort of situation that we would see in because it be beyond anyone imagination that such situation would have arise we do not take account of it when it happen today we have an opportunity to rectify that we have an opportunity to say that there be unique set of circumstance that the legislation do not foresee we can have review and we can look at it but we need to recognise that when million of family in this country be at their low point they look at the television and see ministers who have work for few day and be sack for incompetence or fall out with the boss get thousand of pound more when they get nothing the liberal democrats have proposal there should be major overhaul of ministerial severance pay mp who have resign for break the ministerial code in particular should not be able to claim severance pay minister should have to serve in post for reasonable period of time and payout can not be claim if they be reappointe to the government within year none of that be unreasonable more than anything else it would give we the opportunity to go out there and look our constituent in the face and say no we be not in it to line our own pocket we will not take anything that we do deserve and we will not take for grant the privilege of be here and expect more than you think we deserve if damage the economy and people living standard as well as degrade our health service council and other public service be not enough this government have also enrich themselves and cost the taxpayer close to million as result of their sheer incompetence and infighting we have find out that minister some of whom be in post for only matter of week face serious accusation or be ineligible through age have receive handsome sum of taxpayer money the question on my lip and no doubt the lip of many of our constituent be why be ministers give such special treatment just one day in post as cabinet minister entitle an individual to as severance payment for one day in the job for minister of state it be one day as parliamentary under secretary of state get they these be vast sum of taxpayer money available only to select few and they come with absolutely no caveat for performance conduct or length of service we do not disagree with the principle of loss of office payment to ministers like all worker they should be entitle to some form of payment in the event of suddenly lose their job and income through no fault of their own however suspect many of my constituent will not have much sympathy for that give that those in such position will still have their mp salary to fall back on and we know that some member have other source of income those salary be well in excess of what most of our constituent earn be minister be not easy be sure but that should not distract from the fundamental issue that the treatment give to those in governmental position be completely different from that give to the wide public even the member of the public work in the very same departments that those minister serve one person who can not fall back on their mp salary be peter bone who be the deputy leader of the house for day and receive redundancy payment even though he be over of he be no long the mp for wellingborough but should we not be tell whether he have pay the money back not least because there be to be by election in that constituency in few day time thank my hon friend for make that very good point be sure peter bone former constituent many of whom will have have call from the department for work and pensions when benefit overpayment be make and they have to pay they back will expect he to have do exactly the same as they have to do it be clearly matter of public interest do my hon friend agree that people who have to make bet on anything may be bit out of touch with how most people live their life in this day and age yes anyone who can afford to wager that sort of sum on anything never mind matter as important as national public policy do not experience the life most of our constituent live in the financial year four minister leave office after face allegation of misconduct or for breach the ministerial code two receive the full severance payment one select reduce payout and another turn it down altogether but regardless of the circumstance of their dismissal they be entitle to those payment as right all those force out of their position while face allegation of misconduct or fall below expect standard be entitle to payment total ten of thousand of pound that only half of they take the money be immaterial what be at issue be the principle that those individual have an entitlement that no one outside government have access to in any other workplace an employee against whom gross misconduct allegation be uphold would surely expect to be dismiss immediately without pay likewise if they have be find to have act in way that be below the standard expect of they they would be liable to dismissal with no automatic right to compensation in the real world the only protection offer to an employee who have be dismiss for reason other than gross misconduct be statutory notice period which that employee still have to work unlike ministers who do not have to work notice period and the notice period be just one week until an employee have two year service in stark contrast minister have from day one minute one an automatic entitlement on dismissal to quarter of their salary without even have to work any notice period those be day one right that most people can only dream of have the evidence be clear when we look at the eyewatering sum ministers have gobble up in some case qualify for they after only matter of week service our analysis find that total of ministers be in post for less than three month before take their ministerial severance payment to put it another way they be able to cash in on their party chaos and receive more money in severance pay than they earn do the job in the first place will say that again because find it absolutely staggering ministers get pay more for leave the job than they be pay for do it that sum up what shamble the last few year have be the story do not end there though there be now nine former ministers who spend grand total of just day as minister in their whole career all within that disastrous day lettuce premiership which we be still feel the effect of when they be effectively sack by the current prime minister they be all allow to pocket not far off three time the amount they earn actually do the job government who hit the pocket of million of britons with their unfunded tax cut also hit the public purse with these giveaway in the real world thank to this government lack of regard for worker right an employee have to be in job for two year before they get any kind of compensation that be an outrageously long period in addition for ordinary people after two full year of continuous service the redundancy payment be modest compare with what ministers can expect depend on the age of the individual between eight and year of continuous service be require to entitle they to week redundancy pay which be the equivalent of what ministers be entitle to no matter how long they have serve it be gall that ministers who have serve for matter of week be able to claim level of payment that it would take those rely on statutory protection up to year to accrue and let we not forget that if this be someone only wage the commitment make on the back of it be likely to be substantial which mean that the sense of jeopardy if thing go wrong be palpable and the consequence of failure be real the deal offer to ministers who be effectively make redundant have none of those string attach think it abundantly clear that the generosity of the act have be test beyond break point over the course of the past two year can not believe that when the major government introduce the act they ever think we would have such rapid turnover of ministers it be hardly basis for good government but as we know many convention have be test to the limit in recent year at the time of its introduction the condition in the rule that outgoing ministers can only receive the payment if they do not return to the government within three week be probably see as an extremely unlikely scenario after all ministerial appointment be not mean to be carousel but we now know that ministers decide to take and keep their severance payment despite find themselves return to government role within three month of their initial departure and some return even more quickly than that it just show how much the tories love fire and rehire although in the real world the worker do not become thousand of pound well off as result perhaps ministers think that everyone get thousand of pound for no reason when fire and rehire happen to ordinary people that think be the only possible explanation of why they allow that outrageous practice to continue this money merry go round be self evidently against the spirit of the loss of office system and the original act the severance payment be design to help an individual to make the financial transition after be in the government not to be effectively bonus for ministers who be temporarily out of the fray those who draw up the rule simply could not have foresee the level of chaos to which the government have subject we it be hard to escape the feeling that there be profound injustice in the system and the way in which it be exploit in nearly million of public money be hand out in the form of severance payment during that year figure which have the reform that we be propose today be in place would have be reduce by to just over return to the question what make minister so special be couple of week of be minister equivalent to the eight or even year service that our constituent would have to give to receive the same level of payment think we can all agree that that should not be the case this be not just about level down ministers payment it be about improve worker right and our new deal for work people will transform working condition for everyone in the country want to make point which think be important about the lack of transparency surround these payment my hon friend the member for cardiff west kevin brennan have already mention the payment to the former member of parliament for wellingborough accept that this have be the case for many year but we only find out what payment have be make by particular department when it publish its annual report for the precede financial year which department be not require to do until january in the subsequent financial year anyone who have recently file self assessment tax return will note that the annual report work on exactly the same timetable by january people must report on what their financial situation be at the end of march in the previous year although suspect that department do not experience the frustration experience by my constituent who wait for hour on end to speak to someone at the end of the hmrc helpline the reason it be only today that we be debate the final severance bill of be that we only learn about the final group of payment last week when the department of health and social care publish its report add another to the total however this also mean that we be eight week away from the end of the financial year and we do not yet know whether single severance payment have be claim by any of the ministers who leave their job in that year we know that several cabinet ministers have have to resign in disgrace or have be sack but we do not know whether their bad behaviour be reward in the same way as other ministers action what we do know be that the last reshuffle in november create theoretical severance entitlement of although we do not know how much of that be claim or by whom and here be the crucial point as thing stand we be not entitle under law to be tell any of the answer to those question until january which be of course beyond the final date by which general election must be hold in other word number of former ministers will be stand for re election but taxpayer will not have the right to know what severance payment they receive over the previous year if we can not even have transparency we ought to at least have some reform the frequency of reshuffle over the past few year have take the idea of government instability to new level level that frankly make mockery of we all and when that absurdity not only have no negative consequence for those in charge but see they reward for their misdemeanour it be little wonder that so many member of the public look at this place and think it be inhabit by people who be totally out of touch with reality minister lose their job have none of the risk attach to it that many of our constituent face every day include the uncertainty of not know whether they will be give enough hour next week to put food on the table because they be on zero hour contract the risk that because they be in bogus self employment they have no comeback if they have dispute with the company and the fact that they have to be in job for two year before they get any protection against unfair dismissal precariousness risk and uncertainty be the define characteristic of work for too many but the define characteristic of ministers job be reward and this reward come whatever the length of service and whatever the reason for their departure that be why so many of my constituent feel that there be one rule for the elite and another for everyone else we know that in most workplace if you break the rule you be out with no compensation here if you break the rule you might be out but you might be back again few week later but either way you still win because you can expect handsome payoff no matter the reason for your departure we have government who be literally reward bad behaviour it be no wonder so many people look at this place and think politician have no understanding of how the real world work it be about time we refresh the way we do politic and put the service of the public ahead of the service of ourselves be pleased to add to the important point that have already make by my right hon and hon friend and thoroughly ignore by conservative members want to look specifically at the propose reform relate to how the severance payment should be calculate for outgoing ministers when the rule be introduce be confident that the expectation be that any individual claim three month of severance pay would almost certainly have serve decent length of time in that post in fact to be sure of that look back at the second reading debate of the ministerial and other pensions and salaries bill year ago this week be strike by the word of joe ashton the legendary labour mp who be unhappy at the idea that minister could receive three month severance after have have possibly only two year in ministerial job official report january vol only two year in ministerial job can you imagine if joe have know that year on members in the whips office would be claim three month severance after just day in the job it be daft it be wrong and it be betrayal of the people who send we to this place can you imagine if we have tell joe that cabinet ministers would be claim almost each after just nine week as secretary of state have no doubt that if the mp who agree those rule in have know how they would be abuse three decade later they would have design the rule differently and be confident that those rule would have look something like the proposal before we today first this reform would say to minister if you have serve only few week on the front bench your severance will be calculate at quarter of few week salary not quarter of full year salary that be clear sensible and fair secondly when minister have serve most of the year at junior level but have be elevate to the cabinet for few week this reform would say that their severance should be calculate as quarter of their actual earning over the past year not quarter of just their final annual salary again that be clear sensible and fair critic of these change might argue that what happen in be one off and do not warrant wholesale change in the rule they might say that joe ashton do not envisage ministers claim three month severance after less than three month work but he also do not envision there be three different prime ministers in the space of week abnormal circumstance produce abnormal result accept that but once loophole in the rule be reveal the loophole ought to be close and when that loophole be as grossly abuse as we have see in the last financial year we have an absolute duty to act on it we owe that to the british taxpayer and we owe it to our predecessor in this house to joe ashton and all those who could never have contemplate that the law they pass in would be use or even abuse in this way as the hon member for edinburgh west christine jardine make clear minister do not lose their day job when they be sack or decide to resign they still have their year salary as member of parliament and surely that be enough be fully behind this motion but feel it could have go little far on the related issue of the public duty cost allowance pay to former prime ministers after their departure from office my hon friend the member for brighton kemptown lloyd russell moyle raise this early but for those unfamiliar with the allowance hope nobody in the chamber be but the vast majority of taxpayer in my constituency and around the country will be the current rule stipulate that when prime minister leave their post they be entitle not just to one off severance payment of almost but to payment of every single year for the rest of their life to assist they in their future work the right hon member for the wrekin mark pritchard challenge my right hon friend the member for islington south and finsbury emily thornberry on whether she would remove from former prime ministers the money for their security no opposition member would do so but the house will be interested to know that the government website have something to say about this these cost can include manage an office handle correspondence as former prime minister and support with visit and similar activity the allowance be not pay to support private or parliamentary duty nor be it use for security purpose agree with we would therefore not be problem for the right hon member for the wrekin as with the severance payment we be debate today it do not matter how long someone have serve as prime minister and it do not matter the circumstance under which they depart the law say that once they have hold that position the public duty cost allowance be theirs for life which have of course leave we in the frankly ridiculous position where the former member for uxbridge and south ruislip be able to claim the allowance despite bring disgrace to his office and shame on this house and where the right hon member for south west norfolk elizabeth truss who have inform will receive year from the taxpayer towards her public duty cost after spend just seven week in the job that be year every year of her life for each day she spend in office the expression she make famous in relation to the high level of fruit and cheese import be very apt that be disgrace the right hon lady be relatively young and wish she long life but she could end up take million from the taxpayer over the next three four or five decade yes that be disgrace there be no public scrutiny of this allowance unlike for our office cost allowance which can be claim in addition to this huge sum of money to my mind both former prime ministers have bring the public duty cost allowance into disrepute just as surely as some of their colleague have bring severance payment into disrepute think there be strong case for reform both system rather than just the latter it be my birthday today and can think of no high honour on this day than be call to speak in the house of commons consider it an enormous honour to serve as the member of parliament for the good and amazing people of putney southfields roehampton and wandsworth town be speak about ministers who must have think all their birthday have come at once in the summer of chaos when they be hand additional sum that be excessive and undeserved we be throw light on the ministerial severance pay scandal today this debate importance have be question by conservative members but say it absolutely be important indeed it go to the heart of our democracy when we stand here in the house of commons even on our birthday and when we go out into our constituency to ask what issue we should take back to vote on in this house it be all base on the trust and confidence of our constituent issue such as the additional excessive and undeserved ministerial severance pay bring this house into disrepute and question the confidence that our constituent have the late poll of trust by ipsos show that only of voter trust politician to tell the truth that be the low level since ipsos start ask that question in and it be down from pretty low bar of in in june last year research by the institute for public policy research show that just of the public have full trust in the current political system those be sober statistic and it do not have to be this way the long this government cle on to office the more out of touch they be and the more people feel that it be one rule for they and another for the rest of we the complete tory chaos of the summer of have have long term effect on our economy with crippling mortgage bill for my constituent it also result in summer of huge payoff for ministers who waltz in and out of office have do very little because they do not have the time and ability to do much they pick up not only extra pay for that time in office but then the severance pay let give real world example now have be campaign for long time for my constituent on the cladding crisis all through that summer that issue be in effect put on hold because there be only temporary ministers in place they know they would not be in power for very long so they could not make any decision whole summer be lose on an issue of huge importance to my constituent so we be not just deal with an abstract issue about pay and condition because that summer of chaos have have real world consequence thank my right hon friend the shadow attorney general for uncover the extent of this and the fact that in alone the total bill for ministers severance pay be an unacceptable many have their job for just few week in the die day of boris johnson time or during the doom day premiership of the right hon member for south west norfolk elizabeth truss inform she would be mention she they receive three month severance pay but one return to the cabinet after six week another after two month another after three and half month and another after four month one return to exactly the same job nine week after leave but they still receive the full week severance pay this labour motion would stop that and reduce the amount of severance pay for serial cabinet returnee the amount should not be three month pay regardless of time serve some ministers serve for just seven week and receive the full three month pay fifty seven ministers serve for less than the three month some have return the money and as other member have say that be to be commend however many have not do so and we do not know the extent of how many have return it because as have be point out we will not receive the departmental account for long time five ministers also receive total of almost despite be ineligible because they be over whether or not be should have any bearing on someone receive severance pay be an issue for another day but the fact that this be deliver incompetently as well as wrongly be an issue would like to make the comparison with lord rooker who serve for year in this house as the member for perry barr and have serve with equal distinction in the other place for more than year since he be hugely dedicated parliamentarian and public servant he give and half year continuous service as minister from may to october before he finally step down at the age of despite that length of service he receive no severance payment because those be the rule yet under the current rule someone can be minister for two day and still receive three month severance pay the rule be not intend to apply to the circumstance we see in the last two year and they need to be reform as the minister say in her opening remark while we would welcome such reform we do not believe the government be willing to undertake they which be why we have bring forward the motion for far too long conversative ministers have be pay off for jump aboard sink ship that be nothing short of complete waste of taxpayer hard earn money and they have bring system put in place in into disrepute labour be call for urgent action because we can not afford another million pound bill if the late conversative prime minister can not keep his party together all this come at time when the country have be go through the bad cost of live crisis in generation the draining of resource be simply disgraceful run community centre before become an mp so think about the amount we spend on different project and the good those project bring to our community compare to the money that have be waste there be feeling on the doorstep that we be all on the take the policy on ministerial severance pay add to that feeling my hon friend be make powerful speech as always what hit home for be the fact that the payment of some make to the right hon member for great yarmouth sir brandon lewis be almost identical to the mean average salary of uk citizen yet that be just bonus payoff do my hon friend agree that be an outrage agree as would all our constituent it do not seem right that in many case those large sum of money have be pay out for such short term of service that be not what the system be design to do so the system must be reform it be high time that the system expose by the conservative summer of chaos that result in nearly million pay out to conveyor belt of tory ministers be review to ensure the public get good value for money from their government ministers labour be make sensible and reasonable proposal today which should be support by all member of the house labour will change the rule so that fail minister who have be in post for only matter of week be no long entitle to quarter of their final top annual salary instead they will receive quarter of their actual earning as minister over the previous month minus any period cover by previous severance entitlement if they return to ministerial position after three week but within period equivalent to the number of day of salary they be pay in severance they must return the correspond amount of their severance payment at the moment that be up to the good will of minister who out of the goodness of their heart return the money the system should not be leave like that it should be clearcut labour will also ensure that any minister who have have to leave their job while they be be investigate for misconduct have their severance suspend and then cancel altogether if the allegation be uphold we should not have to put forward this legislation the reform should be obvious and should have be introduce as soon as the system be bring into disrepute by former member it should not be up to the opposition to call out the government on the failure of the system labour will go much far if we have the honour of become the next government we will introduce an integrity and ethic commission to clean up our politic because trust in our politic have plummet to an all time low in recent year it be up to we in the labour party to clean up politic to restore trust and to show that it be not one rule for they and another for we we be put the government on notice if they will not clean up our politic labour will do not know whether be alone in find the contribution from those on the government benches rather prickly and defensive listen to the opening speech of the right hon member for tatton esther mcvey the minister for common sense or rather the minister for nonsense today and not only do it not touch on the motion at all theme follow by almost every conservative member who speak but it be simply very poor maybe she want to show her disdain for the motion by instruct her office to draft something of that quality but think that be unfair because what the shadow attorney general and other have do in prepare for the debate be actually quite lot of detailed work about member of the government over relatively short period the motion do not propose punitive remedy the motion would simply remove the abuse from the system it be not against the principle of severance rather confusingly the shadow attorney general have be criticise for that by conservative members and it address specific anomaly it address first of all mistake to be fair to the government they accept that where mistake have be make the money pay in error should be refund think that we can all agree on that the motion also address what have be describe as the bone pincher anomaly which be where there have be clear misconduct think it would be quite difficult for conservative members to defend that behaviour the shadow attorney general have also identify excessive amount of pay which be either where the minister have serve for short period of time or where their salary have go up dramatically and their severance pay be base on the end salary which be substantially high than what it be finally the motion address where minister have be sack or have resign and have receive their three month money and then be reappointe to the same or very similar job within those three month in that case they should not get double bubble as it be this be perhaps the easy area to understand and can not see any objection to any of that it be very close to be unjust enrichment in all case and the remedy for that be restitution it be to provide redress in the event that one party have receive benefit from another in circumstance where it would be unjust for the recipient to retain that benefit the donor here be the taxpayer and the recipient with very little excuse be ministers there have not be as the right hon and learn member for northampton north sir michael ellis say ad hominem attack yes of course we have to identify individual ministers in that way but it be the collective system that be be criticise some may say that be an exceptional year let we see what happen this year shall we we might be in for another exceptional year but even if that be an exceptional year and the sum of million which be very large sum of money be not repeat there be principle at stake here could run through all case but could not be bother to email all the office in order to do that be already email the office of the right hon member for chelsea and fulham greg hands anyway because he spend most of his time canvass in my constituency now at least the part that be transfer to he and spend lot of my time canvass in his think that would also say that be go to mention he in this debate it be nothing personal it never be between neighbour in that way none the less his be pretty clear case he back the wrong horse when the right hon member for south west norfolk elizabeth truss be elect prime minister so he lose his job he get his three month severance which be and day later when the right hon member for south west norfolk be already run out of friend she reappointe he to her government under the system that the shadow attorney general have outline the right hon member for chelsea and fulham would have receive severance payment of some less than he receive some may say that perhaps he deserve it be not so sure because what that mean be that whereas for the first month when he be out of office he be be pay through severance for the next two month he be be pay both his severance and his salary he be quite literally get double the money for that period of time the right hon gentleman have not respond to to say that he have pay that all to the local labour party or some other deserve charitable body in the not charity in law but body with many charitable aspect to its operation perhaps he have do that hope that all will take that course of action and be sure the attorney general will be write to they all individually to invite they to make those payment back because that be no way to deal with public money be not go to go on about the right hon gentleman because think he will be deal with by his electorate in due course and in fairly short order and the excellent labour candidate for chelsea and fulham ben coleman many of my hon friend have be down to support he will be refreshing change as the new mp see the right hon member for charnwood edward argar sit on the front bench he be resident of that constituency and be clearly consider what option he may take when he be call upon to vote will conclude on this point because it be serious one we should not play fast and loose with public money in that way we should not misuse public resource and when even if we could say it be through no fault of our own we be unjustly enrich in that way we should make reparation that be all that our motion be call for and think it be difficult on that basis for conservative members to oppose it we will see when we vote in few moment time whether that be the case we have hear lot of red herring about other payment that may be make to ministers or mps however as many hon member have say if we think of our own constituent and the hard time they be go through it do make we look out of touch if we say well it only only in some ve do good job and work hard so have my constituent and they be not reward in that way if hon member could focus on that for few moment when we come to vote on the motion do not think they will find it difficult to vote with labour thank you very much mr deputy speaker for the opportunity to wind up this debate my right hon friend the member for islington south and finsbury emily thornberry and other opposition members have lay out very clearly why we need reform and why rule that never envision the churn and chaos that we have see over the past month need to be tighten up we have hear from numerous opposition members and one or two government members as well the snp spokesperson the hon member for aberdeen north kirsty blackman emphasise just how out of touch this government be remind we of the stark choice that many of our constituent have to make between heating and eat my hon friend the member for sefton central bill esterson describe the case of the three assistant whips get two and half time more in severance pay than they do in salary take away some each whereas under our reform they would only be entitle to he also make the point very clearly that under the leadership of labour government we have growth whereas sadly under this government we have see only which have huge knock on effect for all our constituent my hon friend the member for hornsey and wood green catherine west also make reference to the hardship face by her constituent who be be hammer by record peacetime tax burden and call for some contrition from tory ministers my hon friend the member for ellesmere port and neston justin madders point out the anomaly that under the current system for just one day in the post of secretary of state an mp can receive some in severance pay that be why reform be really need he contrast that with his expert knowledge of what ordinary people can expect in term of statutory redundancy pay and the horrible shadow of zero hour contract where people often worry whether they will have enough hour to make end meet my hon friend the member for stockton north alex cunningham point out that mp such as joe ashton be even question back in whether full week severance should be payable for just two year he would certainly be astounded about mp take ministerial severance pay after just few week my hon friend the member for putney fleur anderson point out how nothing get do in the summer of about matter of immense importance to her constituent such as cladding as she remind we labour have full plan if in government for proper ethic and integrity commission to clean up politic my hon friend the member for hammersmith andy slaughter make strong case for reform illustrate it with the case of the right hon member for chelsea and fulham greg hands the hon member for edinburgh west christine jardine remind we that there be genuinely valid case for proper reform of ministerial severance pay especially with the rapid turnover in ministerial post as constituent be pay for the way in which the tories have trash the economy now as former teacher and examiner must say to those conservative members who speak that not adhere to the title of the question be usually reward with nought out of might perhaps give the hon member for southend west anna firth one out of and the right hon and learn member for northampton north sir michael ellis and the hon member for broadland jerome mayhew maybe two or three as for the minister without portfolio the right hon member for tatton esther mcvey think that my hon friend the member for hammersmith have make it clear what we think about that particular speech hope that in his closing remark the parliamentary secretary at the cabinet office the hon member for brentwood and ongar alex burghart my opposite number will address the content of our reform and not just deliver tirade against the labour party will the hon lady give way very briefly would be very interested to know what score she would give to each of the four labour leadership candidate who do not give back single penny of their severance pay after lose the general election and after leave this country with no money whatsoever in it might surprise the hon lady but be go to stick to the topic of this debate which be severance pay like my right hon friend the member for islington south and finsbury pay tribute to the hon member for macclesfield david rutley and for hexham guy opperman and to the right hon member for north east cambridgeshire steve barclay who understand give back some ministerial severance pay upon take up new ministerial post but it be great pity that no other members recognise how totally inappropriate it be to take week severance pay for post that they have hold for much short time than that or to keep the full week pay when they be reappointe in short time than that today they have the opportunity to vote to reform the system that their party have bring into disrepute those in government have duty to get value for money and to respect the hard earn taxpayer money with which they be entrust let we not forget the financial turmoil cause by the then prime minister the right hon member for south west norfolk elizabeth truss when she and her team push through the budget in september ignore expert advice and leave people with hundred of extra pound to pay on their mortgage and not just for couple of month but for year to come from this conservative government we have have not just high mortgage but high rent rampant inflation real cost of living crisis cause people up and down the country to struggle to make end meet and of course hollow out public service that be scarcely able to meet demand when the ministerial severance payment scheme be set up back in no one would have imagine the absolute pantomime that we have see over the past couple of year with nearly ministers leave office and take with they some nearly million of taxpayer hard earn money in ministerial severance pay back in the expectation would have be that ministers would be in post for number of year and that those leave under the age of would receive quarter of their final annual week pay as severance pay however let we fast forward to the summer of when mps be hastily appoint to fill gap after the frenzied mass resignation from the johnson government supporter of the right hon member for south west norfolk be bring in to serve during her time at no and supporter of the current prime minister who resign from the ministerial job to put pressure on his predecessor return only few week later when he become prime minister we be not say that the rule be break except in the case of the handful of who be not entitle to severance pay under the exist rule the rest of those tory ministers be legally entitle to three month of severance pay at their final salary level no matter how long they have be in post no matter how they come to lose their post and in most case no matter how quickly they return to the front bench afterwards those be the glare loophole that labour propose reform seek to close the hon lady have refer to value for the taxpayer and the contribution of the hard work people who send we here would she support the ongoing freeze on ministerial salary be labour to come into power as have say be go to speak to the topic on the order paper and be not go to be distract by any other topic if labour propose reform have be in place in that would have save the taxpayer some of those payout or some during the tory turmoil of the past couple of year some ministers have receive more in severance pay than in actual pay for example ministers who only serve for matter of week perhaps only eight or nine week have be entitle to walk away with week severance pay that be clearly totally absurd and unacceptable labour be propose pro rata system whereby those ministers who serve for less than full year should only receive in severance pay quarter of what they have actually earn in other word if minister have be in post for eight month they would be entitle to two month severance pay if they have be in post for eight week they would be entitle to two week severance pay likewise we propose to strengthen the rule concern ministers who be reappointe under the exist rule ministerial severance pay be only withhold if the depart minister take up another post within three week of quitting which cover normal reshuffle situation however with the revolving door we have see some ministers have return after more than three week but less than week and yet keep their full severance pay which be in accordance with the current rule that be another loophole that our proposal seek to close individual who return to the front bench while still benefit from severance pay would have that pay claw back for example if minister be entitle to eight week severance pay but take up another ministerial post after five week they should clearly forgo the remain three week severance pay as they would of course be receive their new ministerial salary thirdly we propose that individual who leave their job while under investigation for gross misconduct or breach of the ministerial code would not receive any severance pay unless and until they be clear of those allegation by the relevant authority we would therefore not be in the situation where the disgrace former member for tamworth who should never have be appoint in the first place have be able to walk away with full ministerial severance pay likewise under the current rule the shameful behaviour of the former member for wellingborough be no bar to his take severance pay however as he be over he should never have have that payout in the first place in fact nearly have be wrongly pay out to former ministers who be over at the time they leave their post one would hope that the handful of individual involve would pay back that severance pay immediately as believe the former member for mid bedfordshire nadine dorries have promise to do perhaps in his closing remark the minister could update we on whether ms dorries have indeed repay that money and also on what progress have be make in claw back the severance payment that be wrongly make to other ministers over the age of make no mistake ordinary citizen owe money to hmrc or the department for work and pensions would certainly be expect to repay it in timely fashion furthermore ask the minister to address the content of each of our proposal and say whether or not this government will support they and if not why not appeal to conservative member to do the decent thing and support labour reform and to support bring forward the necessary legislation in the next fortnight as set out in our motion on the order paper if they do not support our reform we will have to conclude that they be more interested in line their own pocket than protect taxpayer money commend the motion to the house would like to begin by wish the hon member for putney fleur anderson very happy birthday we be delighted to be spend it with she in these condition we can only imagine the scene the absolute scene in labour hq that precede this debate the heir to bevan attlee wilson and mandelson wrestle with the great issue of the day and wonder what they would bring to the mother of all parliaments for this opposition day debate would it be the war in ukraine the future of nato conflict in the middle east the situation in the red sea children mental health week the failure of the nhs in labour run wales the collapse of labour lead birmingham national apprenticeship week the mayor of london failure to control crime deepfake and the future of democracy the strength of uk manufacturing or the halving of inflation no the eureka moment when it come be reform of the ministerial and other pensions and salaries act yay they have wait year for this moment and now they be go to strike we can imagine the panic give way to relief as they set about hand out their line to eager back benchers this motion have give the country something it do not have before that rarest of beast that most elusive of fowl the red squirrel or red footed booby of politic labour policy to be fair it be not utter chod the truth be that the legislation from have be on the book for very long time third of century and it be due for review and when that time come it will be right to consider number of thing it will be right to consider the length of service and severance pay it will be right to consider those who swiftly re enter work after period out of it and it will be right to consider the status of those who be under investigation when they lose their job say consider very specifically because as you mr deputy speaker and the whole house will know that be how we legislate in this place we consult we debate and we consider when this subject be next consider there will be other issue that labour do not have time to put in its motion as it be scrabble together at the last minute my hon friend the member for north east bedfordshire richard fuller ask whether there should be severance pay at all and that would need to be debate my hon friend the member for bracknell james sunderland ask whether the law on and severance pay be right and that need to be consider number of hon member question the status of former prime ministers and that should be consider there will be other issue many other issue and as say when the time come to do this the government will consult consider and allow proper time for debate not the less than two hour that the labour motion would give for committee stage of this legislation it be an absolutely ridiculous way of go about try to pass legislation amateur it be as my right hon friend say from sedentary position amateur this government be not go to legislate on this issue before the general election not because the issue be not important but because there be other thing that be more important it be because we understand priority and we understand our constituent priority which be point very well make by the minister without portfolio my right hon friend the member for tatton esther mcvey we will be legislate to support renter and leaseholder to back free press with our medium bill and to strengthen law and order with our sentencing bill the criminal justice bill and the victims and prisoners bill we will be strengthen animal welfare strengthen our economy with the digital markets competition and consumers bill and the data protection and digital information bill and give great power to our national security force with the investigatory powers amendment bill we be do all these thing and more because they be our priority and they be our voter priority we look forward to the next conservative government after the next general election have chance to consider these and many other issue but it will be do properly not in panicked opposition day debate by desperate opposition scrabble for something to say as my hon friend the member for southend west anna firth say this be smokescreen for lack of policy it be political game and this government will not support it question

to recognise the state of palestine alongside the state of israel support for civilian flee gaza motion make and question propose that this house do now morrissey be pleased to have the opportunity to speak briefly on the plight of innocent civilian in gaza although it break my heart that the debate be necessary about million people be trap in gaza right now almost all of they be multiple internal refugee who have be force to flee their home elsewhere in gaza and again several time as place that be promise would be safe soon become anything but do not want to go into the argument about the legality or illegality morality or immorality of what be happen there and what have happen previously in israel those debate have to continue but want to use this opportunity to ask what step the uk government be take to save the life of people who be in mortal danger to no one surprise will suggest that they be not do nearly enough we have already see more than death in gaza mostly woman and child the vast majority be completely innocent civilian who have never wish any harm on anyone there be real and imminent danger that that horrific death toll will increase exponentially if as still seem likely the united nations relief and works agency be force to stop or significantly scale down its lifesave work in gaza people be already die not just because of military action but because essential supply of food water and medicine be not get through in sufficient quantity my hon friend be make powerful start to his speech he mention the innocent civilian who be be subject to horrendous condition my constituent dr salim ghayyda have family member live day by day try to avoid death the horrendous circumstance and everything else that people have to put up with there be it not about time that the uk government put in scheme even for relative of uk citizen to get they safe harbour away from the atrocity that they face every day absolutely agree with my hon friend many of our constituent have hardly sleep for month because they never know when they be go to get the phone call tell they of the death of relative or in some case the death of five or relative at the same time it be an unimaginable worry for people to be live with commend the hon member for bring forward this debate on subject we all have in our mind do he agree that the most vulnerable people under attack in gaza need clear path to safety will he join in urge the neighbouring nation also to step up their effort to welcome refugee with open arm do he far agree that our government should be ensure that we do all we can to make sure that aid get to the people who clearly need it the most do not disagree with anything the hon gentleman say although would point out that some of the neighbouring country be host between million and million refugee from syria that be why this be global problem the whole world have to take action be grateful to the hon gentleman for secure this debate constituent of mine be palestinian international student at university in york his family remain in gaza and he be desperate for his child to join he yet the government have not open up an opportunity or scheme to bring his family to he do the hon gentleman agree that the humanitarian thing for this government to do be to open up visa opportunity for family to be reunite absolutely think the message emerge be that this situation be affect significant number of people in the united kingdom large number of our constituent have close family member who be in mortal danger we can not stand by and then wonder afterward why some do not survive life have be lose because aid have not always get through in time and certainly not in sufficient quantity if unrwa have to scale down significantly or even stop its activity the situation will death day be bad enough it could get unimaginably bad it be no exaggeration to say that if we do not start to act soon we could see more civilian death in gaza than there be in rwanda in gaza could become the new rwanda regardless of what terminology people choose to use to describe the action of the various war faction in and around palestine regardless of the terminology use to describe what be be do to innocent civilian and regardless of who we choose to point the finger of blame at it be not tenable to suggest that we can stand back and let today figure of ten of thousand of preventable death grow into hundred of thousand or even more part of the response have to be to get people out of harm way as quickly and in as large number as possible what be ask the government to do as first step be something that know for fact other country have already do so let we not pretend that it be something the government can not do first where civilian in gaza have close family member in the united kingdom the uk government should at the very least be negotiate safe passage for they to get out of gaza secondly the government should be guarantee their right to come to the united kingdom and join their family not necessarily permanently that be not what palestinians want but as short term emergency measure to keep they safe until their homeland the land they want to return to be once more safe and fit for human habitation appreciate that be not palatable to some government members but the alternative be far less palatable have refer to my constituent dr lubna hadoura several time in this chamber she come here as student like the constituent the hon member for york central rachael maskell mention but she like scotland so much that she stay she have give over year her entire adult lifetime of service to our nhs as consultant surgeon most of it in fife she have probably save the life of many of my constituent she have about close relative live under bombardment in gaza range from her elderly mum to two baby too wee even to walk dr hadoura love live in fife most of her family have no intention of come to live permanently in fife or indeed anywhere else in the united kingdom they want to live their life in palestine that be home for they but most important of all they want to live and living be become almost physically impossible in gaza make particular appeal give dr hadoura outstanding contribution to her adopt country we owe she and think that even get her mum out to safety constitute only fraction of that debt most of the member who be present have already make similar appeal on behalf of their constituent family but this be only my personal view do not think that we should be stop at people with family in the uk do not think that we should knowingly leave anyone to die but sadly hold out little hope of the government willingness to go as far as that this evening want to add my voice to that of my hon friend because as he know his constituent have sister who be my constituent and who have also give many year service to the nhs that family be in position to financially support any relative who might come from gaza to the uk temporarily agree with my hon friend that as well as consider family like those of our constituent we should have wide humanitarian visa in the last few month there have be nearly twice as many civilian death in gaza as in ukraine what difference do my hon friend think there be between the position of the gazans and that of the ukrainians that be prevent the british government from issue humanitarian visa can only speculate on what the government thinking might be see no difference whatsoever and refuse to accept any distinction between any two human being who be in mortal danger we do not expect firefighter to check bank account or passport before decide who be to be take out of burn building we do not expect ambulance crew to check who someone be before decide in which order to treat casualty after road accident although some people do we certainly do not expect to see the hero who man and woman lifeboat stop to check people identity before decide whether to pull they out of the sea in the same way we should not be make distinction between those who should be allow to live in the united kingdom and those who should be leave to die in gaza or anywhere else but sadly as have say do not think we will see that amount of movement from the government today or at any time so far they have refuse even to meet to listen to the moral humanitarian and imperative case for let dr hadoura elderly mum survive let the rest of her family survive and let as many of those million people as possible survive the most recent reply that receive from the foreign commonwealth and development office be very sympathetic very apologetic and utterly utterly dismissive it would be easy to look at that letter and think that it have be write by someone who genuinely could not care less about the plight of palestinians right now do not think that that be correct description of anyone in the foreign office but that be the impression that the letter give my constituent thank the hon member for initiate this important debate too have encounter issue involve several constituent surprisingly there do not seem to be that many think that three have write to so do not think there be huge number that the government should be concern about however these be family member who be contribute to the uk economy my constituent rami alfaqani and alaa safi have lose member of their family and another family member need urgent medical intervention that be why we should do the humanitarian and right thing for those people the hon member be right to talk of do the humanitarian and right thing would suggest that the situation in gaza have become so critically desperate that the humanitarian response be the only one that can be morally tenable for any of we say that the letter from the foreign office be dismissive and be sorry to have to say that it be also less than honest in letter that be one and half page long the writer talk eight time about what the foreign office could and could not do let say again to the minister that be not ask the uk government to do anything that they can not do be not ask they to do anything except what know other country include some of our close international ally have already do for the family of their citizen to get they out of gaza for the foreign office it be not question of we can not do anything more but question of we choose not to do anything more and think that that be an untenable position for anyone to adopt at this time my hon friend be make some excellent point and share his frustration have also write to the foreign secretary on this issue on behalf of my constituent sama whose family have be evacuate six time recent israel defence forces bombardment destroy the family home which take they year to build do my hon friend agree that there need to be some route for family in that situation at the moment sama have no answer from this government and there be no way of get her family to safety agree with my hon friend comment one thing that be cause immeasurable upset to my constituent dr hadoura and to many other palestinians in the united kingdom be that they be in contact with palestinian family in other country and see they get their love one out of palestine they know that the uk government say that they can not do anything about it but they see other country government be able to do something those government might have reason for not want to publicise it or for it to be too widely know but they be willing to go beyond the legal minimum to get people out and reunite with their family the last letter get from the foreign office minister finish by say recognise this will be disappointing news disappointing disappointing but want to relay it as soon as possible so that your constituent can take informed decision about his family next step incidentally it be clear in my letter that dr hadoura be she not he that make convince that this be cut and paste job from another letter and that they have not even bother to tailor it to the individual constituent and relay it to as soon as possible mean send letter two month after have contact the minister by contrast on friday last week within the space of about two hour my office have two email and two phone call from the foreign office want to know what today debate be about what do that tell we about its priority that it be more urgent to sort out which minister would respond to the debate than to agree to meet member of parliament to try and find way of stop people die unnecessarily but it be the bit after that in the letter that find callous beyond belief it have be send so that my constituent dr hadoura could take informed decision about her family next step precisely what decision be available to dr hadoura to her family and to the million other what on earth be they suppose to decide about there be no option there be no survival plan for those family in gaza because it be become impossible for anyone to survive there an early government response suggest that they should all apply for visa to travel to the united kingdom what really great idea it be impossible for they to apply for visa in gaza where be they go to apply to who still have consulate operate in gaza if they try to travel somewhere else in gaza to get visa there be very high risk that they will be shoot if by some miracle they manage to reach the egyptian border remember the only border they have be with israel and egypt the border guard will say have you get visa to travel somewhere else no get back to gaza then and the whole thing go round in circle they can not get visa without get out of gaza and they can not get out of gaza without visa the government fully understand that and they be not prepared to issue visa from here which as have be mention they have do for people flee from other part of the world dr hadoura family only chance and the only chance for any of those million people be to be take out of gaza under the protection of another government as some have be they need government who will negotiate safe passage for they out of gaza they need government who will give they refuge until it be safe for they to go back home where they want to live out their life they need government who will care not only with their word but with their action they need government who can look at this human catastrophe with the eye and heart of human being within the next minute or so we will know whether that description can be apply to this government be grateful to the hon member for glenrothes peter grant for secure this debate and for his thoughtful contribution the minister of state at the foreign commonwealth and development office my right hon friend the member for sutton coldfield mr mitchell could not be here as he be attend to other duty but be pleased to respond to the debate on his behalf will try to cover the point that have be raise will ensure that the hon member for glenrothes receive timely and accurate reply pursuant to the specific case he raise and will work with official to make sure those response be in good order all members will agree that the situation in gaza be desperate innocent palestinians be suffer terribly amid the substantial and grow humanitarian crisis the death toll have now top with more than report injure mostly woman and child few than half of gaza hospital be even partially functional and they lack the staff equipment and resource they need meanwhile large number of people be live in overcrowded shelter without the most basic amenity and be suffer unthinkable trauma from the near constant bombardment more than million people have flee their home with nearly half of gaza population pack into the southern region of rafah the hon gentleman ask what the united kingdom be do in response to the situation and he indicate that his view be that we be not do enough of course there be several aspect to the response and will address they in turn he ask about those seek to flee gaza to answer his question very directly at this time we be not consider bespoke route for palestinians affect by the conflict moreover the issue of resettle palestinian refugee be of course complicate by the right of return which we must carefully consider that issue be at the heart of the middle east peace process for many of those flee gaza permanent resettlement to third country be not the right solution indeed it may be the bad option for those whose dear hope be to live out their day in recognise state of palestine the house will know that we be generous nation half million people flee danger have be offer place in this country via safe and legal route since but bespoke route be not the right solution for the current situation my hon friend the member for glenrothes peter grant be very clear that he be look for temporary visa because as the minister say palestinians will of course want to return when and if it be safe to do so do the minister not think that the united kingdom have particular responsibility give the history of our involvement in the region and the balfour declaration we all have responsibility all develop nation have responsibility to ensure that the urgent humanitarian disaster in gaza be make less severe by our intervention that be what we be do right now it be clear that we need measure to increase the provision of humanitarian aid to help those in desperate need the government be therefore focused on these effort alongside our effort to achieve sustainable ceasefire that be how we will help those suffering in gaza the minister talk about sustainable ceasefire but at what point will this government actually call for ceasefire will come to that we have call for humanitarian pause and sustainable ceasefire will remark on what that mean presently but colleague should be aware that we have treble our aid to the occupied palestinian territories since october commit million this financial year this support crucial partner such as the british red cross the un and the egyptian red crescent society to help civilian with food fuel water healthcare and shelter the minister say there be aid provision but it be simply not get through attend briefing by actionaid among other this morning and hear that dignity pack for woman be stick in warehouse and not get over the border meanwhile woman be have to menstruate into bit of tent do he think that be acceptable no we be not satisfied that enough aid be get through and we be work very energetically on our diplomatic effort to increase the flow of aid we need to see water fuel and electricity restore we want to see the erez crossing open to allow direct aid to north gaza we want to see ashdod port open we want to see unencumbered access to aid come from jordan we want the kerem shalom cross open seven day week rather than just five we want to extend the opening hour and capacity of the nitzana screening facility and the kerem shalom checkpoint so that great volume of aid can pass via truck we want to ensure that the united nations have the people vehicle and equipment necessary part of get that increase flow of aid be about humanitarian pause and we be expend huge amount of diplomatic effort on push for that the minister for the middle east be travel in the region pursuant to that this week and the foreign secretary will be do the same in the come week let return to the point in question my constituent be here under the british council scholarship scheme he have two tiny child and his wife in gaza he could not afford to bring they over here on visa as he be student study at the british council request he want to be reunite with his little child who have see many of their friend and family kill why will the government not reach out to that family and allow they safe passage so that they can be reunite safe and legal route do exist and if there be the hon lady question describe elegantly the limit of the government executive capacity of course safe and legal route do exist but the way we can have positive impact to set the condition for people such as those she mention be for we to push for humanitarian pause and ceasefire it be irresponsible to talk in hypothetical otherwise the way the situation will be improve be for we to achieve humanitarian pause for we to make rhetorical statement that do not pertain to reality would be simply irresponsible should point out to the house will the minister give way no as must make some progress during his visit to al arish in egypt the foreign secretary meet representative from the egyptian red crescent society who be co ordinate the relief effort at the rafah crossing we hear how the uk contribution of shelter blanket and other vital equipment have be provide much need relief to the people of gaza but of course we also hear about the many constraint on the humanitarian operation that we face that be why our judgment be that israel must take step work with partner include the un and egypt to significantly increase the flow of aid that include allow prolonged humanitarian pause open more route into gaza and restore water fuel and electricity the foreign secretary be directly engage with israeli leader on that and have announce work alongside qatar to get more aid into gaza with our joint consignment contain tonne of tent be fly in last thursday when he meet prime minister netanyahu at the end of january he reiterate the need for israel to open more crossing point for nitzana and kerem shalom to be open for long and for israel to support the un to distribute aid effectively across the whole of gaza we be also continue our work with egypt on step to increase humanitarian access via the rafah crossing may take the minister back to his comment about safe and legal route nobody can cross from gaza to egypt unless they have document that prove they have be give the right to enter third country and nobody in gaza have any way of get such document could he just describe exactly where the safe and legal route be and how gazans be suppose to get there the only way that anyone will be able to come to safety be if there be humanitarian pause and sustainable ceasefire so minister make statement about how many people we may or may not take would be rhetorically impressive but practically meaningless we be therefore focused on the purposeful work and serious diplomacy of push for humanitarian pause and then sustainable ceasefire the government want to see an end to the fighting as soon as possible the foreign secretary have work tirelessly across the middle east to push for humanitarian pause and sustainable ceasefire two week ago he travel to israel the occupied palestinian territories qatar and turkey and last week he visit oman saudi arabia and lebanon face to face talk with leader such as benjamin netanyahu mahmoud abbas and mohammed bin salman be invaluable in set out uk view and understand the position of country who can help end this conflict motion lapse standing order no motion make and question propose that this house do now morrissey as the foreign secretary have set out we want to see an immediate pause in the fighting to allow vital aid into gaza and to give space for deal that would get the hostage out we be also work to turn what would be fragile truce into sustainable permanent ceasefire without return to more fighting that mean give israel the reassurance that it need to end its campaign this mean the hamas leader must leave gaza and the attack against israel must end all israeli hostage must be release and new palestinian government form that can deliver for all its citizen accompany by an international support package it also mean give the people of gaza and the west bank the political perspective of palestinian state and new future turn to reconstruction effort while the long term future of palestinian state be important for last peace there be the immediate task of rebuild gaza we should be in no doubt that reconstruction will be daunting task it will take giant international effort because of the scale of destruction and it be beyond the mean of any one country so wide coalition of western country arab and muslim state as well as israel and the palestinians will be need gaza will need as many people as possible to join the effort build this support be another of the foreign secretary diplomatic objective we will continue to push for humanitarian pause and sustainable ceasefire want to return the minister to the subject of this evening debate and the desperate situation that my constituent child find themselves in they can not come to the uk unless the uk government give they the right to come here the uk government be not give they that right so when will the minister allow those child together with their mother to be reunite with their father here in the uk we be seek to improve the humanitarian situation include that of the individual the hon lady refer to by ensure that there be de escalation pause in the fighting and sustainable ceasefire that be the way we will attend to the desperate situation that affect more than those two individual she mention that be our serious purpose our commitment be beyond doubt both in resource and diplomatic effort that be the purposeful and sincere effort of the foreign secretary and the entire department our immediate focus be on get more aid in and secure an immediate pause in the fighting that be how those affect will have their life improve we must do all we can to generate momentum to build permanent peace and rebuild gaza question put and agree to house adjourn
