right that this house should have an opportunity to debate and vote on these matter as it do on monday night will leave it at that oral answers to questions transport the secretary of state be ask reliability of rail services what step he be take to help improve the reliability of rail service for passenger what step he be take to help improve the reliability of rail service for passenger performance vary across the network and be dependent on both reliable infrastructure and strong operator performance where we have both as on greater anglia passenger enjoy great performance and be clear that this be standard for all operator to achieve work with their network rail route counterpart regularly meet network rail and train operator to encourage great collaboration on day to day performance include convene rail industry summit in march with fare up and cancellation at record high rail passenger be cry out for change in my patch reddish south and denton station be serve by just one train week would like train service that meet our need but the minister seem to have put rail reform on the back burner be that because he can not deliver or he think labour will the hon member be completely wrong the pre legislative scrutiny of the draft rail reform bill be be do right now by the transport committee think be the final witness to appear before the committee next week so that it can hope report in july contrast that with the passenger in chief approach of meddle with the railway and indeed of resource lead timetable to fit the exist staff and think it be quite clear that it be the conservatives who want to improve the rail system summer have arrive and ten of thousand of visitor will be head to chester and north wales and cross border connectivity be essential remind the minister of his government cast iron commitment make in october to electrify the north wales main line when will the north wales main line actually receive an allocation of real money so it can start work on the electrification of the line the hon member be absolutely correct that the prime minister network north commitment mean over billion of former money be be put into other project chiefly in the north and the midland the electrification of the north wales main line be one of those and it be something be determined we will deliver we be take step in allocate project time and resource so that we can advance such project but bear in mind that the spend be for up to so it will not all come at once call the chair of the transport committee be it the case that train operate company stand ready to invest significantly to improve passenger journey but disincentive be the break clause in current contract ahead of wide reform that the transport committee be scrutinise at the moment may urge the minister to review those break clause arrangement and incentivise that investment now this be the folly of labour nationalisation plan because the good perform operator in term of punctuality be greater anglia and that one have the option that be come up the labour party if it make it into government would take away the contract from the operator that have the good performance show that it be all about dogma and not about good common sense firmly believe that where operator can deliver more for passenger and indeed for their workforce by have more certainty there be certainly case to be make for look at those contract term and give they long my hon friend know that after decade of closure kenilworth station have be reopen by conservative government and conservative county council however the reliability indeed the variety of service through that station would be significantly improve by double track the line between leamington and coventry be grateful to the secretary of state for the time he have already give on this issue but will my hon friend do all he can to bring about that improvement which will benefit not just my constituent but also provide connectivity option that the northern leg of high speed no long will my right hon and learn friend have be champion of that project and as he mention he meet the secretary of state to discuss it be make provision for the project to occur should funding be available and the new local transport fund make fund available for those part where would previously have be deliver there be now great opportunity for my right hon and learn friend transport authority to fund the project that he have champion for so long call the shadow minister in the five year since the government first admit that reform of our railway be need passenger service have go from bad to bad with train now cancel every second the bad statistic on record with the transport secretary openly admit that any reform this side of an election be unlikely do the minister understand why passenger have give up on this government do anything to improve their rail experience do not agree with that assertion post privatisation nationalisation would reverse this passenger number have double and billion have be invest in the railway by this government since we look at performance which of course we want to get well but in march for example of train be run to time with of cancellation the two big cancellation failure during march be one trespass and one suicide and the trespass alone cause cancellation yes there be more we need to do but the opposition front bench team would have lot more credibility if they recognise performance indicator and what part we need to deliver rather than just chuck dogma about nationalisation which be tired fail old policy licence training whether his department provide grant for the provision of training for licence although we do not provide direct funding for driver to obtain licence the department make available more than million year through the bus service operator grant to community transport operator in england which be predominantly charity operating vehicle that require licence they receive for every claim reflect the increase cost face by the sector and support they to continue deliver inclusive and accessible transport across the country thank the minister for that answer in scotland as across the rest of the uk there have be shortage of minibus driver with brexit and the legacy of covid fuel crippling shortage of bus driver passenger carry vehicle driver can pursue career in various field include public transport tour and travel company school transportation and private charter service what more can the government do to incentivise such training the hon gentleman might not be aware of the recent consultation to reduce the age requirement for bus and hgv driver from to and encourage he to speak to the department for work and pensions we be work closely with the relevant ministers at dwp to have sector base work academy and skill boot camp to encourage great participation by driver rail passenger numbers if he will fund exploratory rail study on passenger number through the local transport fund the local transport fund be billion fund that have be allocate to local authority in the north and midland to fund wide range of transport measure the funding empower local leader to invest in the transport policy that matter most to people in their area and that could include rail study guidance will be publish shortly to support local leader in develop their plan but it will rightly be local decision may first congratulate my hon friend on the award of million to the east riding to improve transport whether that be pothole bus shelter or whatever else in beverley and holderness the minister be aware of my championing alongside labour colleague liberal democrat colleague and the council across the whole area of the reopening of the hull to york line through beverley be delighted to hear he confirm today that that funding can be use to explore and produce refined demand model for that railway will he confirm that my right hon friend be indeed great champion for this scheme which we have discuss many time be pleased to confirm that the local transport fund could be use to develop the new rail link between york and hull via beverley it be important to say that it will be for the local transport authority to decide and encourage he to continue to engage with it our upcoming guidance will set out more detail about the scope of the ltf and be sure he will continue with his mission to deliver transport connectivity north west what step he be take to improve transport connectivity for town and

round of the city region sustainable transport settlement furth billion be go to the non mayoral local authority to fund wide range of project guidance on how that should be spend will be forthcoming shortly my right hon friend know how important rail connectivity be to my constituent it will be far enhance by the reconnection of the burscough curve project that be also support by our hon friend the member for south ribble katherine fletcher who have her own campaign for station at midge hall give the importance of scheme that link area will he issue strong guidance for transport authority to have well link between each other rather than just within their own transport area as my hon friend know recently host roundtable bring together he his local authority lancashire county council local rail operator and other interested party to discuss how to far develop the business case for the burscough curve he will be aware that we have allocate that money to the local transport fund lancashire county council will get million over seven year start next year suggest he continue the conversation we have have to urge the council to look at develop that scheme we will be publish guidance encourage it to do that work with member of parliament in the very near future you can think of coppull station when will the secretary of state improve on the timetable at the time of gladstone be not entirely certain the rail minister my hon friend the member for bexhill and battle huw merriman set out clearly the improved performance that we have see this year we be clear that we be integrate track and train with our rail reform that be be scrutinise in the house and that will improve thing we have recently reorganise the department bring in alex hynes to link that together that be how we deliver improved performance we have set out those plan clearly legislation before this house be be scrutinise by the select committee of my hon friend the member for milton keynes south iain stewart we look forward to its report which understand we will get before the summer recess to take those plan forward we welcome the million in lancashire as you will in chorley mr speaker we have also be have discussion about what we want to see with that funding whether that be at the hare and hounds junction in clayton or just fix pothole across the constituency one of the important thing in hyndburn and haslingden be make sure that our train station be accessible for everybody we currently have few bid in include church oswaldtwistle and rishton will the secretary of state look favourably upon those bid be grateful to my hon friend for welcome the money that will go to her local authority we will make it clear in the guidance which hope will be welcome to you as well mr speaker that local authority should very much involve their member of parliament in discuss those priority hope that every member in the north and the midland where local authorise be get those fund will take advantage of that on my hon friend specific point about accessibility and our access for all programme as she know number of bid be make and they be currently be scrutinise hope that in the near future we will be able to set out which one will be fund urge she to wait for that announcement wish her good luck obviously can not prejudge that process but hope that she be successful will the secretary of state explain why train fare have rise almost twice as fast as wage since the hon lady will know that over the last two year the government have make significant intervention to keep rail fare rise no fast than the rise in people wage she also know that we have to balance the farebox against the taxpayer she will know that because of the pandemic the taxpayer have put in billion over couple of year to protect the rail industry passenger figure have not yet recover to their number beforehand that be why it be important that as soon as we can we get rail company on contract that incentivise they to drive up the number of passenger use the service which be how we will reduce the call on the taxpayer and enable fare to be keep competitive east west rail what recent progress he have make on the east west rail project for connection stage one of east west rail be pleased to attend an event in march to mark the completion of work on the final section of track connect bicester and bletchley with service expect to commence next year at the spring budget million be announce to accelerate work introduce service between oxford and bedford by the end of the decade follow the announcement of the preferred route alignment between bedford and cambridge last may statutory consultation be due to launch this summer the connection of east west rail from bedford to cambridge will cost the taxpayer an enormous amount of money the minister know that because he be at the transport committee sit right next to the permanent secretary when she say so although apparently that be okay because few landowner and developer will make shedload of money out of plan gain meanwhile the late chief executive officer of east west rail have scarper because he could not stand the heat in the kitchen as the minister say east west rail be progress with statutory consultation have completely fluff the first consultation by not contact the right people but hold it over the summer month while people be away all the time the project be be drive by the economic growth board in the treasury which meet secretly and tell people nothing what can the minister tell my constituent about this project thank my hon friend for his question laughter he be indeed in the same room as be when be with colleague this be an important aspect from the treasury and the department for levelling up as well as our permanent secretary to discuss the cross governmental co ordination that will be require to unlock all the economic benefit as he know we will not necessarily agree on this point believe that east west rail be critical in deliver workforce to cambridge which will allow cambridge to compete with the like of boston and city in south east asia so that those pioneer have workforce and we can keep cambridge and indeed oxford motor on that basis on that basis let we go to cambridge thank you mr speaker indeed some be more positive about the improved connectivity potential in and around cambridge but the minister will be aware that his colleague in the department for levelling up housing and communities recently establish the cambridge delivery group which be look to create additional home which will in turn create whole series of transport challenge will he tell the house what structure be in place to ensure proper dialogue between his department dluhc and east west rail the east west rail growth board which as my hon friend the member for north east bedfordshire richard fuller point out be be lead by the treasury will be critical to ensure that join up approach it be essential that we look at this project as an economic opportunity for the area have meet my hon friend constituent as we have both travel around and appreciate that there be an impact where there be housing but if we do not have workforce cambridge and that region will not be able to compete on the global stage and we will not see the pioneer scientific and bio health development that we see from cambridge that be why believe that this railway be critical bus manufacturing what step he be take to support bus manufacturing the uk boast strong and highly competitive bus manufacturing industry manufacturer have benefit significantly from government funding as we work with industry to decarbonise the bus fleet more than bus have be fund across the uk since february with uk bus manufacturer support many of they uk manufacturer have grow substantially in recent year as result of their success in securing order support by million of dedicated zebra zero emission bus regional area funding the reality be that the uk government could do much more at tuesday sitting of the transport committee mick whelan of aslef say that in germany they have german train and in italy they have italian train he say before they award government contract they look at their supply chain future apprenticeship and all the thing associate with those contract why do the uk continue to destroy its own industrial base by refuse to implement similar procurement policy for all transport manufacturer include bus there be too big reliance on chinese import as say uk bus manufacturer have do very well out of decarbonisation policy they be every competitive and have have the opportunity in this job to visit number of they if the hon gentleman believe that there be unfair competition from import he know that there be an independent statutory body the trade remedies authority whose responsibility it be to look at importer where there might be dump if he think there be any evidence of that by any manufacturer he should provide that evidence to the trade remedies authority so that it can conduct an investigation as appropriate call the shadow minister the uk have proud bus manufacturing history from london iconic original routemaster to alexander dennis next generation of hydrogen double decker use today in the liverpool city region as operator and local authority decarbonise their fleet uk manufacturer be ready to power that green revolution but our bus maker be at risk from cheap model import from overseas this week major uk operator be prepare to procure chinese build bus for ten of million of pound due to cost pressure and because this government have not set out full industrial strategy since will the secretary of state tell the house what he will do to back british bus manufacturer and secure their role in this green revolution the hon gentleman will know that it be not possible give our international commitment under the world trade organisation to specify that people have to buy british bus he will also know that british bus manufacturer be very competitive the government have make support available to business through our advanced propulsion centre and uk export finance as say to the hon member for kilmarnock and loudoun alan brown if the shadow minister think that there be any unfair competition with subsidise import the trade remedies authority have all the tool at its disposal to deal with that we back british bus we have fantastic manufacturer and have confidence in they in fair competition our bus manufacturer can take on the world wrightbus have have million of support from uk export finance to support its ambitious export it be shame that he do not have the same faith in british industry that we do call the scottish national party spokesperson deary mr speaker we have confidence in the bus manufacturer and it be pity that the government do not that be the problem unlike sulebs and scotzeb the scottish ultra low emission bus scheme and the scottish zero emission bus challenge fund the zebra scheme have be failure no spin from the dispatch box can deny that and our bus manufacturer be pay the price we must learn from this and we can start by encourage those purchase zero emission bus to place great emphasis on social value and wide environmental and economic impact when evaluate tender the government must take responsibility will the secretary of state consider conduct cross government review into prioritise domestic manufacturing within exist legal framework people be able to put social value into their tender my understanding be that local authority do that but they be not allow to have specific commitment to buy from certain provision the hon gentleman have to decide whether he have confidence in our fantastic company as he set out in fair competition some of the company that have be mention some of which have visit can win against competitor around the world if he think that there be unfair competition and that company be be subsidise he should give the evidence to the trade remedies authority which have the legal structure and the tool to do the job we ve have one question about bus and then second one come along local bus services what step he be take to support local bus service the government have provide over billion to support and improve bus service since march leicestershire county council receive over million in emergency recovery funding to help maintain service during and after covid and have recently be award up to million to deliver its bus service improvement plan as the house will know the word democracy come from the greek demo mean the people and krato mean power power to the people well the people in north west leicestershire who sign petition for the reinstatement of the number and bus service on their original route be not feel very empower despite very well run campaign there be no movement from arriva or leicestershire county council what can the minister do to help my constituent where commercial operator want to change service as understand happen in this community they have to work with the local authority to replace service where possible and limit disruption would point out to the hon gentleman that leicestershire county council have also receive over million from the rural mobility fund to trial demand responsive service and encourage he to meet it my constituent and be extremely concerned about arriva sudden proposal to close its depot in aylesbury with no warning that it be even be consider the company admit that it would mean end the vast majority of its service in our area cause huge problem for those who rely on its bus to get to school work and hospital have demand an urgent meeting with its senior management but what can the department do to help hold arriva to account and ensure aylesbury resident have the bus service they need and deserve be aware of this problem which have recently come to light would certainly encourage meeting between the local authority the bus company and my hon friend and will assist he in any way in that respect be aware that some local operator in the form of carousel buses and the oxford bus company be run some of the service but accept that there be an issue in aylesbury and will help he on an ongoing basis air safety if he will have discussion with airbus and boeing on air safety both and departmental official engage proactively with industry include boeing airbus and other manufacturer on aviation safety the civil aviation authority the independent safety regulator for the aviation sector also engage regularly across the industry should point out that we have some of the safe sky in the world the fatal accident rate of uk airline be among the low in europe and the world we have not have single fatal accident involve commercial passenger airplane for more than year be determined that that safety record will continue the minister might know that be the chair of manufacturing group for members of parliament airbus rolls royce and boeing be amazing manufacturer at the heart of our manufacture economy but do he agree that we must sort out the problem that seem to have occur in the manufacture of boeing max do he agree that the fast our regulator work with american regulator to sort this out the well for british job and british innovation absolutely agree with the hon member that they be amazing company with huge operation in the uk and enviable safety record not one of the boeing max operate globally operate in the uk or from the uk so there be no need to ground they the department for transport liaise closely with american authority the caa follow very closely the work of the us federal aviation administration to ensure that safety standard remain as high as possible helicopter search and rescue what recent discussion he have have with helicopter search and rescue operator on the adequacy of response time the right hon member will be aware that the maritime and coastguard agency be conduct an analysis of recent incident datum to examine whether the demand for the search and rescue helicopter service have change since the launch of the uk second generation search and rescue aviation procurement it be expect to be publish by the end of have have no recent discussion on this point as the review be ongoing thank the minister for his answer he seem to be aware of the situation but new threat to search and rescue response time be emerge namely the poor and deteriorate industrial relation between bristow management and its staff as we speak member of the british airline pilots association who work in sar cohort be on strike have be drive to it by management who be play negotiate hardball on salary and on term and condition will the minister call in the management and make it clear to they that as the customer the government expect they to treat their search and rescue staff with the respect and consideration that their skill and bravery deserve know how important search and rescue service be in the right hon gentleman constituency and he have be great champion for they good industrial relation be clearly vital to ensure that they operate effectively and be sure that the mca will keep that in mind during its review should add that just this morning agree to meet the management of bristow road resurface what fund his department be provide for road resurfacing what fund his department be provide for road resurfacing the government be firmly on the side of driver which be why we be use funding reallocate from the programme to improve the condition of the country local highway network our record funding increase of billion for local highway maintenance in england over the next decade will enable highway authority to resurface road and fix thousand of pothole across the country the secretary of state and his ministers be well aware of my campaign for the removal of the concrete surface of the it be now six year since receive letter from the then road minister tell that the work would be complete by the end of can the secretary of state tell when work will begin to remove that concrete surface and make the road much safe than it be at present can he give firm date my understanding be that the be part of the national highways concrete road programme and that there be plan to undertake additional treatment to reduce noise substantially early in the next road investment period which start next year my hon friend may wish to meet the road minister to discuss the matter in more detail and secure some specific information about the timing as my right hon friend know shropshire road network be the fifth long in all the english local authority area last autumn he make welcome announcement about significant increase in million to repair and improve road and he make another in february about the reallocation of million will he explain to and to other shropshire members what that will mean in practical term for the amount to be spend on road during the next parliament my right hon friend be correct shropshire county council will receive two pot of money minimum uplift of million from to for highway maintenance and furth million under the new local transport fund start next year and continue for seven year those figure represent significant increase on what the council would otherwise have receive we will provide more detail shortly about the guidance on how the money should be use and as have say in response to early question member of parliament will be involve in set those priority somerset be unfortunately home to ten of thousand of pothole persistent flooding make the problem bad but so do the lack of attention give to improve the resilience of our road do the secretary of state recognise the importance of future proof they with specific fund for local authority to spend on measure of that kind as oppose to pothole funding that serve only as temporary sticking plaster be pleased that the hon lady have ask that question because absolutely do part of our purpose in not only give local authority that significant funding increase but spread it over year so that they have certainty over long period be to enable they to move away from deal with pothole filling and to embark on proper road resurfacing programme that funding will pay for the resurfacing of more than mile of road thus deliver to the hon lady constituent the improvement that we all want to see resident in west fenham recently say to that car mechanic must be the main beneficiary of conservative transport policy give the steady flow of work for they cause by the terrible state of the road local authority survey say that the road be in their bad condition for year and aa call out be at five year high how can the secretary of state possibly say that he be on the side of driver when the road be in such terrible condition the hon lady have just demonstrate why our decision to allocate very significant and unprecedented increase in spending to improve local highway maintenance be exactly the right thing to do have notice that my local authority be busy resurface road across my constituency and the rest of gloucestershire the money we be provide will enable every local authority to do that over the come decade call the shadow minister at the last transport question the secretary of state suggest that driver know what they be get with conservative government well driver know one thing they be get from this government more pothole hundred time as many as there be crater on the moon in rac patrol attend more breakdown relate to poor road maintenance than in and aa call out be at five year high the road repair backlog have go up to an eye water billion which be far great than his allocation of money from scrap the northern leg of be it not abundantly clear to driver and to everyone else that it will take the election of labour government to fix britain road just as it will take the election of labour government to fix britain be delighted that the hon gentleman have ask that question because we have set out our plan very carefully there be billion of extra money to improve the quality of local road the labour party have not back that plan and have not commit single penny of money to local road so the choice be clear if people vote conservative they get billion spend on road if they vote labour they get none bi mode train what recent discussion he have have with network rail on the timeline for introduce bi mode train on the midland main line monthly meeting be hold with network rail and east midlands railway to discuss the introduction of the new bi mode train those meeting include notification of the late delivery timescale that hitachi have provide to the operator and an update on mobilisation plan and relate infrastructure upgrade the aim be for the new train to be phase into passenger service throughout welcome the phase introduction of the bi mode class aurora train on the midland main line through kettering next year can my hon friend the rail minister confirm that the new train will be fast quieter and more environmentally friendly than the current inter city fleet and that they will have more seat and luggage space and well mobile phone signal reception can confirm to my hon friend that these fantastic new train will be not only fast but quieter and more environmentally friendly as they will be able to take advantage of the increase extent of electrification that we be deliver on the midland main line they will have more seat per five car train and they be design for great comfort and more luggage space bear in mind that my hon friend be one of the hard work mps for his constituent he and they will be delighted that there will be enhance wi fi and mobile phone reception make his productivity even great gallows corner flyover what recent discussion he have have with transport for london on the refurbishment of gallows corner flyover be pleased to say that the gallows corner scheme be recently approve at outline business case stage with over million worth of backing from the department for transport my official be liaise with transport for london to progress the scheme to the next stage of the process and look forward to tfl submit the final business case for approval thank the minister for his announcement of the funding for makeover of gallows corner flyover but fear that we must do well this be major junction connect the eastern side of greater london with essex and it be where the and the join together my constituent in romford and those of the wide essex region will be disappoint that we be not get fundamental restructuring of the junction to address the safety and congestion issue that have highlight for decade will he speak to transport for london go back to the drawing board and come back with something well and more permanent that will put the safety of road user first will certainly go away and write to my hon friend on his specific point but reassure he that we be spend over million to improve that particular junction if my hon friend have concern about the scope of the work urge he to take they up with tfl because it be for tfl to develop the full business case it be then submit to the department for approval which we hope will happen later this year fire and rehire what step he be take with cabinet colleague to prevent the use of fire and rehire practice in the transport industry the government recently publish statutory code of practice on dismissal and re engagement the code will address the practice of fire and rehire aim to ensure that it be only ever use as last resort and that employee be properly consult and treat fairly the tuc have find that since about of all worker have have to reapply for their job and let we remember that in british airways try to sack staff through fire and rehire which be stop only through strike action the government take no action in go north west in manchester threaten the same and again industrial action stop it happen the government take no action in infamously ferries unlawfully sack staff before replace they with agency staff the government take no action implore the government to outlaw this practice rather than just bring in code of good practice they should be take action to protect british worker after the incident in which worker be indeed treat totally unacceptably we introduce whole range of measure set out in our nine point charter include the seafarers wages act which will come into force this summer we launch the seafarer charter to which have now commit which very much welcome the code of practice on dismissal and re engagement which will come in before the summer recess will give worker up to extra compensation if their employer do not abide by it call the shadow minister the uk minimum wage be an hour but last week here in parliament peter hebblethwaite the chief executive officer of admit that it pay seafarer an hour this have be an awful breach of trust what more will the minister do to stop company act like modern day pirate of the high sea when it come to fire and rehire as mention in my previous answer many of practice have indeed be totally unacceptable include on minimum wage issue that be why we introduce the seafarers wages act which will ensure that seafarer operate on regular service in uk water get the minimum wage we have also co ordinate with legislation in france to ensure minimum wage corridor for all service operate between the uk and france which will give worker the wage they deserve call the snp spokesperson it be two year since the reprehensible action of and peter hebblethwaite calamitous appearance in parliament come four year after willie walsh and álex cruz the then ceo of the international airlines group and ba shamefully threaten thousand of british airways worker with fire and rehire have refuse government covid assistance on tuesday ask the minister of state at the department for business and trade the hon member for thirsk and malton kevin hollinrake in this chamber to confirm whether the new fire and rehire code of practice would have prevent this threat from be make he could not do so so ask this minister the same question and if not why not and what be the point in addition to my early answer should point out that the case be be investigate by the insolvency service and await the outcome of that investigation the point of the code of practice be to ensure that fire and rehire be very much last resort if employer breach the code their employee can get up to great compensation the government have make sure that be the case topical questions if he will make statement on his departmental responsibility since the last transport question my department have be get on with our plan million for new zero emission bus world lead sustainable aviation fuel mandate cut red tape for small scale fishing business take step to future proof the billion classic car industry which support ten of thousand of skilled job and ensure that taxpayer can hold local council to account for how they spend their record funding boost for road resurfacing make possible by reallocate high speed funding all labour have be able to offer be an unfunded incoherent rail nationalisation plan put the union in charge cut service for passenger and contain anti car target take we back to square one give that tewkesbury be one of the fast grow area of the country do the secretary of state agree that we need to expand the and junction of the and not reduce its capacity or downgrade it in any way if any agency put plan to he to downgrade the or junction will he reject those plan be grateful to my hon friend and gloucestershire neighbour for raise that issue he rightly set out that his constituency be one of the fast growing he be doughty champion for his constituent and be sure that any agency thinking of downgrade any of his road network would not dare to do so for fear of the consequence of have to deal with he on the warpath call the shadow secretary of state car insurance cost have increase by since the secretary of state come into office if he be intent on end the war on motorist what have he do about it be grateful to the hon lady for advance notice of the question she write to this morning will say few thing first she will know that the insurance industry be the responsibility of the treasury but it be an important issue for driver so be happy to deal with it read her letter with great care and notice that it contain no plan and not single proposal to deal with the cost of insurance whereas this week the under secretary of state for transport my hon friend the member for hexham guy opperman chair roundtable with treasury ministers and the industry to look at these important issue which be also in evidence across europe secondly have read the letter carefully notice that the hon lady take pop at postcode pricing which be about pricing accord to risk it seem to that she be propose be sure she can not really mean this to put up insurance cost across the country to reflect the mayor of london failure to grip crime in inner london remember that we be now in topical question folk give that the secretary of state have advance notice of my question be afraid that his answer show how out of touch with reality he have become car insurance be not luxury but legal requirement and it be completely unaffordable for million of driver there have be increase in the average premium in two year instead of parrot conspiracy theory about minute city why do he not

for her answer will she outline what far step the government can take when the elderly the ill those who be ill equipped the disabled and civilian be take to the street in an attempt to stand against the paramilitary and to protect their hospital and vulnerable people who be without aid it be not question of if the city fall but when so how can we get medical aid and support to those hospital and vulnerable people at this very important time the hon member highlight one of the most difficult aspect of this issue the challenge of get relevant humanitarian access where it be need currently access into sudan remain highly constrained port sudan be the primary entry point for relief supply and onward distribution from there continue to prove challenging movement be limited but the investment have be make and of course through our relationship and all the diplomatic tool that we use we continue to work on find way to support those who be most vulnerable congratulate my hon

vital starlink satellite internet service in that war ravage country have the government have raise our concern about the devastation that that would cause to civilian and humanitarian aid agency we will absolutely be raise the challenge of have those communication line open there be real concern and will happily take this up with the deputy foreign secretary when he get back those of we who have constituent of sudanese origin can relate to the minister the distress and concern in that community there be particular concern about the fact that think this be now the estimate anything between and million refugee be go from darfur into chad could the minister explain what support we be provide for those who be in chad because at the moment it look as though the agency that be there be unable to cope the right hon gentleman raise very important point can update he that the deputy foreign secretary have recently be to the chad sudan border to see for himself exactly the flow that the right hon gentleman identifie he see the sheer horror and word not mine that these appalling act have create and he be very focused on ensure that we use our humanitarian aid to think about how we can provide

as understand it previous regional effort to agree on the deployment of keeping force in sudan be rebuff last year but find it incredibly hard to see how ever escalate atrocity and indeed catastrophe can be avoid without one be that even on the agenda now because otherwise it seem to we be talk here not so much about atrocity prevention as about atrocity monitor as say we have continue to raise this at recent meeting of the un security council and decision on how to move forward to provide protection for innocent people will be take with international partner with thousand of woman be kill in this war the catastrophic humanitarian crisis particularly impact woman and the fact that woman comprise over of the internally displace people in sudan what measure be the government take to

government proposal on issue of wide public concern such as cuckooing dangerous cycling ninja sword abortion and one punch manslaughter the bill come out of committee in january why have it take so

be light just remind she that in this short final session of this parliament we have already introduce more bills than labour last four session in office by considerable margin if business collapse it

out with to that briefing to deliver dose of reality may we have debate in government time on the careful use of word in politic the prime minister have refuse to apologise for his offensive outburst on monday when he quite deliberately associate the scottish government with hamas terrorist north korea and the iranian revolutionary guard corps the good folk of edinburgh north and leith have elect dangerous extremist who with the vast majority of mps from scotland who also want independence all along we think that we be democratically elect member of this house just like the leader of the house madam deputy speaker you might think that the conservatives of brexit britain would respect nation right to self determination as perfectly honourable political position be it just scotland that they do not respect we will always defend our nation good interest maybe that be what terrify the pm and the like of the scotland secretary who want to force ruinously expensive untried nuclear reactor on

minute community in that letter point to some of the rumour about minute city because that be something that constituent have raise with that consultation be still live on the council website it be on page of its planning and appraisal document so this be very much constituency base issue however find it very difficult to be accuse of be conspiracy theorist on the back of that especially as the vaccine minister whenever there be debate in this place on that subject the number of death threat and the amount of abuse that get be overwhelming at time realise that colleague sometimes have valid point to raise but there be backlash whenever those debate be hold more importantly be link to antisemitism when my family in london be actually jewish and have have very difficult time over the past few month be devastating kindly ask the shadow leader of the house to either withdraw those statement or just to reflect that while we all play politic in this space sometimes thing be very personal do the shadow leader of the house wish to make further point of order far to that point of order madam deputy speaker thank the hon member for lewes maria caulfield for her point of order can put on the record that do not say or imply that she be either conspiracy theorist or antisemitic do not believe that she be either of those thing be highlight the danger of sharing however inadvertently

everybody in the chamber would agree with that think we will leave it at that relationship sex and health education statutory guidance with your permission madam deputy speaker will make statement to the house set out the government proposal for update the statutory guidance on relationship sex and health education which my department have publish today for consultation thank my department staff for their hard work in get we to this point this government have plan to deliver bright future for britain one where family be support and give peace of mind that their child be safe and be be equip with the skill that they need to succeed good relationship sex and health education rshe as it be know play key role in that however follow disturb report from parent of pupil be teach inappropriate content in school and request from school that want more clarity about when to teach certain topic the prime minister and decide to bring forward the review of rshe we have listen to colleague from across government and the house gather evidence from stakeholder and consider advice from an independent panel of expert who generously give their time experience and knowledge to support the review last year put on record my personal thank to each individual panel member we need to make sure that the content of lesson be factual and appropriate and that child have the capacity to fully understand everything that they be be teach we need to make sure that our child be prepare for the world in which they live but not in way that take away the innocence of childhood in short we need to allow our child to be child that be fine line to tread and school need clarity on how to approach the issue overall this guidance be underpin by three core value first that parent have right to know what their child be be teach secondly that teacher be there to teach child fact not push the agenda of campaign group and thirdly that school should not teach about the contested issue of gender identity include that gender be spectrum there be five major policy change that would like to set out the first of which be the introduction of age limit for teach sensitive subject the purpose of the new age limit be to make sure child be not teach thing before they be ready to understand they inform by the advice of the independent panel and other the guidance place specific age limit on the teaching of certain subject in primary school child learn about the importance of boundary and privacy and that they have right over their own body but no year old should be teach about the detail of intimate sexual act sexual harassment or sexual violence in primary school sex education be not requirement and should only be introduce from year onwards its content should align with the national curriculum science teaching on conception and birth ensure that it be root in fact it should absolutely not be prepare primary age child for sexual activity the second flagship change be complete openness with parent parent be their child first teacher and they must know what they be be teach the guidance contain new section that make the need for transparency with parent crystal clear and clarify the scope within the law to share material the bottom line be that curriculum provider should not be seek to hide their material from parent that practice be completely unacceptable parent have fundamental right to know what their child be be teach about healthy relationship sex and development the third area be teach about gender reassignment many school have tell we that they need clear guidance to help they teach about this highly sensitive and complex issue in way that be factual and safe we be make it absolutely clear that the contest topic of gender identity should not be teach in school at any age school should not be provide classroom material that for example include the view that gender be spectrum while protect characteristic such as gender reassignment should be teach about that must be do on factual basis at an appropriate age and must not be base on contested ideology that reflect the cautious common sense approach that we have take in our guidance on child question their gender and also reflect the recommendation of the cass review there be also dedicated section on sexual harassment and sexual violence the growth of malign influencer online who pose risk to child and young people have be significant it be one of the key way in which the world have change for young people since the guidance be originally publish and indeed since all of we members be in school that new section cover some specific type of abusive behaviour that be not previously discuss such as stalk as well as advice for teacher about how to address dangerous misogynistic online influencer would now like to consider the sensitive but important issue of suicide prevention minister and have meet bereaved family expert and teacher to explore how suicide prevention could be teach as part of rshe and pay tribute to the incredible work of dads walking who have use the unimaginable tragedy in their life to campaign for important change the current rshe guidance already include content about teach pupil to look after their mental wellbeing and support themselves and their friend we have now make clear how that content on mental wellbeing relate to suicide prevention of course the topic of suicide itself need to be handle sensitively and skilfully and not before pupil be ready to understand it obviously child maturity vary but our engagement suggest that child typically develop the necessary understanding from when they be in year we have make sure that the update guidance acknowledge that it can be important to discuss this topic with pupil and have add advice to set out how school could address suicide prevention in their teaching finally the guidance also include the new topic of personal safety which cover additional content on understand the law on carry knife and knife crime and on the danger of fire road railway and water together be confident that this guidance will give teacher and headteacher clarity about what should and should not be teach it will provide parent with the peace of mind that their child be be teach in safe and factual manner and it will reassure everyone across society that pupil be be teach what they need to know at the right age and time in their life copy of the guidance have be deposit in the libraries of both houses commend this statement to the house call the shadow minister thank the secretary of state for advance sight of her statement labour approach start from the belief that education should prepare our child for the world in which they live and the future that they together will shape to achieve that and to give each and every child the opportunity and the future they deserve relationship sex and health education must be an integral part of every child education the content of such education must be both age appropriate and teach in respectful manner as well as tailor to the reality of child life the secretary of state have set out that the government intend to achieve this through the introduction of age limit on certain aspect of this curriculum today statement have be long in the making alongside school leader we have consistently push for clear guidance on these issue to be introduce so school leader and teacher can feel confident and support in what they be teach while we be pleased that the guidance have at last be publish there be deep concern about the lack of consultation with school leader in develop the guidance so far if the government be serious about ensure that rshe be teach in dignified and respectful manner and in way that schoolteacher and school leader feel they can confidently deliver they must ensure that the voice of school leader and teacher be hear want to ask the secretary of state to address couple of concern in particular the first concern arise from the reality that education be one of our strong lever for prevent child abuse it be crucial at time of rise level of sexual offence against child especially our young child that child be empower to recognise when something be not right the secretary of state will know that sometimes such issue arise urgently in class or wide school community outside the timeline that teacher may have in mind and perhaps even before the age limit she be propose so will she say something about the ability of teacher to respond to and reflect such concern in future in the context of age limit especially when they arise among young child the second concern be about the importance of child learn not just about their own relationship tomorrow but about their own and other people family today the opposition believe that what matter about family be not the shape they have but the love they give teach child about the fact of the world in which they grow up must include an understanding that there be people who be transgender that people can go through process to change their gender and that the law provide for that the secretary of state outline little of her thinking in her statement and on radio this morning but could she set it out in more detail for the house on some of the other issue raise by this guidance labour very much welcome the intention of the guidance to remove the barrier that some parent face when ask what be be teach to their child of course parent should know what their child be be teach while provider be already require to do this it be acknowledge that there have be issue with interpretation of copyright legislation and it be absolutely right that minister seek to clarify this issue we also welcome the fact that there will be additional content on suicide prevention in the secondary curriculum as well as on the risk of self harm and suicide content on social medium however it need to be back up with support in school to adequately address the challenge that far too many child and young people face with their mental health labour have fund plan to ensure that every young person will have access to specialist mental health professional at secondary school and plan for mental health hub in every community while we await the next labour government this government must urgently set out how they will get down the waiting list for child and adolescent mental health service and deliver support to the child and young people who need it most we also welcome the inclusion of content on sexual harassment and sexual violence yesterday join the leader of redbridge council and teacher to hear about the innovative step in programme that they be deliver in school to tackle sexist harassment and misogyny it be really inspiring to see the student so confidently address the issue with their peer and change attitude hope that as part of the review the government will look at some of the fantastic resource local authority have develop while wait for the government to act we will now need to look at the exact detail of the draft guidance as will school it be really important that stakeholder from across education be able to feed back their view on this and hope the government will reflect on they when finalise this guidance and listen to the voice of school parent and young people in do so would like to address the hon lady point think make note of all of they first on this be long in the making just want we all to be aware of the timeline this guidance be issue in and it be make statutory in ofsted conduct some work to see how it be bed in which give we some feedback and comment about how more clarity be need that be in the second half of obviously we have take leadership on this issue leadership on which think labour run wales could take leaf out of our book and work with broad range of organisation have mention the expert panel but we have work with other organisation as well of course this step be out for consultation so we do expect that everybody who have view parent teacher local authority and everybody will be able to fully engage with the consultation on the question about when an urgent issue come up or child want to ask question or deal with something specific that they have see or that have occur to they we of course expect that child can always ask question we build safe and trusting environment in school and there be difference between pupil ask teacher question or try to discuss something with teacher and teacher stand up in front of whole class and teaching on particular subject on the question about know about transgender that gender reassignment exist law provide for it it be protect characteristic and it be something adult can do when they be old and understand those fact we have of course make it clear that that be the case on mental health support team the labour party seem to have miss what we have be do on mental health in every school in our country we have give grant to train mental health support leader and most of that work have be do our school have be engage on that for long time and million pupil up from million pupil last year now have access to the mental health support team that we be roll out in all of our school that be rather different from the labour policy in that we do not have to completely raid any other sector such as support for special educational need and disability or private school to do that we be also do that for primary and secondary because we think that be very important the hon lady mention material and just want to update the house that oak material will be available in rshe in the autumn call the father of the house thank the secretary of state for put forward proposal that child need and that teacher parent and school leader have want it seem to that lot of people be now say of course what she do be right and year or two ago they be not say that would just say in pass that some people who have be provide sex education lesson and gender lesson in primary school boast that they have present to child and train over staff and think that kind of infiltration have to end can also say to the secretary of state that hope her permanent secretary and other be listen to their seen sex equality and equity network when they raise or try to raise the point with their departments that when department ask question about gender they should be ask question about sex thank the father of the house who as usual show true leadership in this area as in many other he be absolutely right that there be example of organisation with material on their website that we think be inappropriate because it be teach contest view as fact boast about how many school they have work with some organisation will not name they have be teach child about gender gender expression gender role and different kind of gender identity and they claim to have work with over school there be many example of that that be why we have to show leadership on this this be important we have show leadership in the area of gender questioning and we have be clear about biological sex and how to teach that in school in labour run wales believe they have remove all reference to man and woman in the curriculum and they recommend that sex be not just about male or female want to look into whether those report be true but would be happy to support the welsh cabinet secretary for education with that because it need to be take seriously people have very much change their view on this issue the children commissioner have find that exposure to pornography be affect child as young as eight be sure none of we would want that to be the case but we have to deal with the world as it be not as we might wish it to be how will the secretary of state support school to manage pupil reaction to what they be see online we know they be be expose to thing online that we wish they be not see if those issue can not be address in rshe part of leadership and show leadership be also deal with those thing we be not happy with we be not happy that young child be have access to porn which be why other measure be also be put in place through the department for science innovation and technology of course it be always possible that child get access to thing that they should not see and they might raise question as result of that usually parent be the first educator of their child parent would be the first people to get that question and they would certainly expect to help their child through those thing as say if child raise question with teacher the teacher will deal with that but that be different from teach and show anything that be sexually explicit in classroom we want to ensure that child be not expose to such thing in the first place because this be something that have change and we must show leadership to address that in answer to question on april the minister for schools my right hon friend member for east hampshire damian hinds strongly endorse the importance of section and of the education act which respectively ban the promotion of partisan political view and require the balanced presentation of oppose view when politically contentious subject be bring to the attention of pupil gender ideology be certainly politically contentious and be concern to be alert by mrs clare page the educational commentator and campaigner to the department political impartiality in school guidance which state legal duty on political impartiality do not supersede school other statutory requirement school should take reasonable and proportionate approach to ensure political impartiality alongside their other responsibility do not know how you would read that mr deputy speaker but read it as an attempt to undermine the firm guidance give in statute law that partisan political view must not be promote in school hope the secretary of state will look into that matter be grateful to my right hon friend for raise that point political impartiality be important and the guidance he read out be mean to cover some commonsense exception for example some people would argue against democracy and we do not want to give they platform some people would argue for racism and we do not want to give they platform and so on those be the sort of exception and contention and will ensure that we look at the guidance to see that it be clearly understand by everybody it be important to be clear this issue have develop and grow and our understanding of this area have grow over time that be what the guidance be mean to do it be not to undermine political impartiality or the rule of law in review the guidance do the secretary of state share my concern that not enough be be do on child safeguarding when it come to child sexual exploitation and in particular awareness raising so that child and parent understand the warning sign across many town play call somebody sister somebody daughter be roll out to secondary school age child and that lead to disclosure of concern by child about family member or other pupil at the school where they have see those pattern of groom potentially at play do the secretary of state accept that however we want the world to be of year child seven and eight year old have access to smartphone if we do not teach these thing in school they will find out information through other route and that will not be at all helpful for the safeguarding of child another approach be obviously look at access to smartphone at very young age on the point raise by the hon gentleman the most appropriate guidance be keep child safe in education which be substantial piece of guidance and use regularly by school it be also regularly review of course there be live discussion about our concern regard child have access to harmful content through mobile phone at young age we will continue to consider that and that be why take step to also ban the use of smartphone in school the poet john betjeman say childhood be measure out by sound and smell and sight before the dark hour of reason grow darkness fall when very young child be force to know too much too early and their innocence be steal in warmly welcome the government approach will the secretary of state look again at those third party organisation that be often invite into school sometimes witlessly sometimes carelessly for they steal child innocence often in the name of diversity and inclusion and in so doing promote promulgate and perpetuate every kind of horror not only will now be able to look at the material but so will parent and so will ofste when it review what be happen in school against the guidance we have issue transparency be important obviously we should ensure that material be appropriate and the guidance be there as well but believe that transparency will act as great guide to ensure the right material be in our school the secretary of state and grow up in the same part of the world few hundred yard away from each other albeit at different time in my time there be no way in which child could discuss these issue with their parent who do not feel that it be at all appropriate they be certainly never discuss in my school just as be sure that in the secretary of state later time they be not discuss the most can remember be be show second world war film by pe teacher about sexually transmit disease which frankly terrify be sure the secretary of state will agree that it be time that teacher get the guidance they need so that they can have sensible conversation with young people and for that matter parent as well do she agree that we need to have this conversation respectfully and create not divide line but common ground in that respect will she urge some of her government colleague to stop use the issue to create dividing line let reassure the right hon gentleman although we be couple of year apart in knowsley sex education do not change an awful lot we have two lesson one where girl and boy be apart and one where they be together where we be show film about childbirth think part of the class collapse at that point and couple faint and that be it time have move on lot even education in knowsley have move on lot be delighted that we now have some good school indeed of our school be now good or outstanding and that include knowsley which be sure the right hon gentleman and be delighted about it be important to show leadership on these issue but it be also important to do so respectfully that be something have always seek to do to answer and respond to problem and these concern have be raise by parent and by teacher request more clarity have try to respond to that with the gender questioning guidance and with the guidance under discussion it be important that we respectfully discuss these matter today be very good day from what have read and from what have hear the secretary of state say at the dispatch box this guidance be what we have be wait for thank the prime minister the secretary of state and the minister for schools my right hon friend the member for east hampshire damian hinds who be sit to her side for listen to and many other colleague some of those debate have be extremely heated but feel so passionately about this as do my hon friend the member for penistone and stocksbridge miriam cates and the hon member for canterbury rosie duffield it be very good day will be study the guidance over the weekend and hope we can have further meeting about it over the come week parent do not want their child be teach by stonewall and brook they do not want they teach an ideology not base in anything child need teach the fact by all account but they have to be fact of truth that be where we need to be age appropriateness be also extremely important and welcome that measure too child be child and they should be keep as child as long as possible it be precious time that we all wish we could go back to we do not want to be put our child into adulthood far too soon welcome this guidance have three issue that would like to raise quickly if that be okay there be literature within the school system that we need to ensure be remove there be an awful lot and one of the big problem we have have be the denial of that literature be in school it be in these school it be online it be in paper it be all over the place and it need to come out interruption very quickly we need to enforce this guidance once it be do because we have school that still do not want to enforce it finally still believe we need public inquiry into how we get to this point and how we put child on damaging health path we need to address that the guidance be very good news welcome it thank all member of the house who have discuss this matter respectfully as well as contribute to and develop our understanding of what be go on in school on what be there in school welcome my hon friend welcoming of this guidance material will now have to be show to parent no ifs no but and we have make that crystal clear the material will need to be in line with the guidance on enforcement ofsted will as part of what it usually do go round and look at school it will also look at the guidance and what be be teach against it so there be an enforcement process too it have not be easy to put this guidance together and thank all the member of the team and member of the house who have help we in that welcome the secretary of state statement today although fear it be bit overdue will she concede that this debacle originate at least in part from the world health organisation international technical guidance on sexuality education it be happen across the world not just in this country and that have lead to deeply damaging situation where unscientific gender ideology have be push to our child in our school will she explain to the house how many child she believe have be expose to this abuse what step will she take to correct the mistake that have already be make what assurance be there for parent that nothing like this can ever happen again and that it be be stop today take responsibility for england and welcome the hon gentleman welcoming of the guidance think we have show leadership we issue gender question guidance in december last year we have update the relationship sex and health education guidance within the united kingdom there have be different view on this and reiterate my offer to wales and scotland if they want to work with we because the evidence have be emerge on this can only show leadership in the area for which be responsible welcome this guidance it go far than think and it be unambiguous it be not about create dividing line be quite late to this debate until realise it be an actual issue come across evidence of some worrying practice that be go on and then become involved in the issue it be so important that the statutory guidance have tooth even after this unambiguous guidance if school repeatedly breach it what mechanism be in place to hold that school to account on transparency parent need to know what their child be be teach if there be example of school be evasive even after this guidance what power be in parent hand to ensure that they can find out the fact the guidance be very clear it be unusual to have guidance that be largely aim at school but that have some part for parent too we will put more communication for parent on the education hub so that they know what their right be as result of this guidance when take these position we can always think what do the counterfactual look like it would be ridiculous to suggest that parent should not see the material that their child be be teach from in school on enforcement as have mention the guidance will become part of the usual school enforcement ofsted will look at this guidance and at what be happen in school and use that as part of its inspection seven year ago before come to this house spend year teaching some of the time in the north west of england and some of it in wales know as modern foreign language teacher that relationship and sex education be something that have to deliver the majority of teacher who have to deliver rse be not train and that still concern see at first hand how lobby group have easily be able to permeate this area in england and wales while the guidance be welcome it be very late appreciate the comment that the secretary of state have make about the devolved nation that show why it be important that we take politic out of this debate we must present fact and we must work together will she share the expert panel finding with the new education minister in wales and have grow up conversation let we take the politic out of this because these be people life absolutely hope the hon lady will have see that that be just not my style try to see problem and fix they in reasonable and respectful way quality material be important the hon lady may have have that training but not every teacher will have the quality of material be vital and it be clear as we have hear from other that there have be some poor quality material and some material that be spout nonsense let we be honest that be why we will be produce our own material which the oak national academy will produce in the autumn would very much welcome meeting with the education minister in wales who as the hon lady say be new and may not yet have look at this matter in detail to remove reference to man and woman in the curriculum sound ridiculous and recommend teaching that sex be not just about male or female sound ridiculous some of those material may have make their way into the curriculum and would welcome the opportunity to work with any of the devolved nation to get those material out of our school that the statement have be so necessary today be measure of the fact that some member of the teaching profession have take leave of their sens in that light will the secretary of state consider to what extent the remedy be guidance or statutory requirement it be statutory guidance it will also be transparent as the material will now be available to parent it be not only statutory guidance but this area will be under the scrutiny of every parent in the school it be clear that we need to support our teacher and headteacher to ensure that they get this right the vast majority will be get it right but it be an area that not everybody be specifically train to teach so it be important that we provide the material and the guidance and make sure that ofste enforce it in more than young people be diagnose with sexually transmit infection every day early this year the women and equalities committee find compelling evidence that relationships and sex education in school be inadequate include in relation to contraception and sti the children commissioner have similarly attribute that shocking increase to the fact that we be not teach our kid what they need to hear will the secretary of state explain to the house how she think the new guidance which seem to suggest that stis will not be teach about before year age or will address those shocking rate the new guidance will be supplement with material that will be available from oak national academy which we will ensure address any of the concern raise look forward to work with the children commissioner and other to make sure of that welcome the focus on tackle misogyny online and the influencer who peddle it but worry that year will be little too late to stop that influence take hold want to ask the secretary of state about provide positive male role model for young boy which be really important part of this will she address that in the consultation yes indeed many member of this house be positive male role model there be many positive male role model and we want to ensure that we celebrate and support positive male role model not misogynistic online influencer we need to teach child about the danger of those people and ensure that their influence be counter by people who be real role model for child commend the secretary of state for her statement and the wisdom she have show the democratic unionist party welcome the guidance issue to let kid be kid and to prevent sexualise content from be teach to under nine indeed the government rationale be similar to that which give in the chamber when ask the secretary of state for northern ireland not to change the rse regime for northern ireland will the secretary of state speak to her cabinet colleague to ensure that the innocence of our child be protect in all region of the united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland and that parent who be genuinely seek to safeguard their child be afford respect in term of the classroom syllabus and have their right to reasonably hold view protect thank my hon friend for his comment of course what make this subject difficult be the need to tread that fine line carefully let kid be kid while make sure that they be equip in world that be increasingly more complex than the world that we grow up in we have seek very much to ensure that we get that balance right thank the secretary of state and opposition front benchers for their attendance backbench business women state pension age ombudsman report relevant document oral evidence take before the work and pensions committee on may on phso report on woman state pension age hc beg to move that this house note the finding of the parliamentary and health service ombudsman report on women state pension age and call on the government to deliver prompt compensation to woman bear in the who have their state pension age raise be delighted to have secure today debate on this very important issue the motion urge the uk government to deliver prompt compensation to woman bear in the who have their state pension age raise follow the report from the parliamentary and health service ombudsman on the department of work and pensions communication of change to the state pension age for woman extend my thank to the backbench business committee for grant the debate lament the fact that it will not be possible to press the motion to vote as teller from both side of the argument would be require for such vote to be hold although be disappointed that there will be no vote there be nothing at all to prevent the government from bring forward such vote in government time indeed the parliamentary and health service ombudsman have invite the house to express view by lay its report before parliament so that clearly need to happen will the hon lady address the prejudice touch on at the work and pensions committee last week namely that there have be an element of contributory negligence in that the change be not state secret it be advertise and cover in the newspaper and that some woman who be approach retirement or early retirement do not take proper notice will she knock that on the head if the right hon gentleman read the parliamentary and health service ombudsman report he will see that it make it very clear that action be not take to inform woman in the appropriate way that one would expect and indeed that the dwp be negligent in that regard my hon friend have start off powerfully as know she would know what huge advocate she be for the waspi woman woman against state pension inequality the right hon member for new forest west sir desmond swayne make helpful contribution do my hon friend agree that it be ludicrous for anyone to suggest that people in this case those woman should have find out about change to their pension arrangement by happen to read advertisement in the correct newspaper on the correct day surely none of we should be plan our life in that way my hon friend make an excellent point we know do we not that many impact woman find out at the last possible moment that their retirement age have be raise because they have not be give due notice to make plan in the way we would all expect the dwp have be find to be negligent will say more about that in moment the issue before we go to the heart of our sense of justice and fairness and the social contract that the government of the day have with their citizen whole generation of woman have their pension age raise without the notice that they be entitle to expect rob they not just of ten of thousand of pound in pension payment but of their retirement plan of financial peace of mind and of the contract they believe that they have with the society in which they work hard pay their due and fulfil their responsibility they think that they could enjoy some sort of retirement in later life after all they have earn it have they not the social contract be an agreement that we all think we should be able to rely on but when the government tear at the edge of that contract or rip it through as though it never exist what retirement can any of we or should any of we count on have meet range of woman in the women against state pension inequality campaign over number of year of particular note be the ayrshire waspi group and the cunninghame waspi group who represent waspi woman in my constituency of north ayrshire and arran and indeed waspi woman across ayrshire all woman in the waspi movement have distinguish themselves by their effective campaigning against the gross injustice that have be perpetrate against they in the face of extreme provocation by government who have be tone deaf to their plea for justice have be

story note the hugely helpful insight provide by writer dee wild kearney the author of not go away who join we in the gallery dee book which be available in all good bookshop outline the struggle of some of the woman involve in the campaign pay tribute to her work to disseminate this injustice to an even wide audience welcome all the waspi woman in the public gallery some of whom have travel considerable distance to be here today they be entitle to have their voice hear and their case answer when whole generation of woman find themselves victim to injustice on such grand and heartbreaking scale those mp who champion their cause feel the weight of their frustration the weight of their hardship and their profound sense of have be screw over in turn as mp we feel our own frustration when face with an intransigent government who refuse to listen and appear wilfully blind to the fact one of my constituent who have work with since be one of the ombudsman six test case in fact be unable to make speech today because be meet the ombudsman on behalf of my constituent at pm my hon friend be frustrate with the government lack of action so far but be she as disappoint and angry as be about the labour party refusal to back the waspi woman despite promise ten of billion in compensation at the last election order before the hon lady proceed note that member wish to participate in the debate understand that this be an important subject and have no desire whatsoever to curtail either the debate or the right of hon member to intervene appreciate only too well the urgency of get one point on the record but if those on the front bench or indeed any other hon member give way too many time not all will be call to speak it be important that every hon member who wish to speak can do so and therefore hope that we can resist the temptation to intervene whenever not necessary thank you mr deputy speaker and take on board your comment none of the uk government intransigence have distract from the dignity with which with the campaigner have conduct themselves over the long year that this swindle and it be swindle have be carry out my hon friend the member for paisley and renfrewshire north gavin newlands raise good point about our disappointment some would say disgust at the labour party current position but will respond to his concern in due course after year of marching lobbying letter and email writing attend surgery and tireless campaigning the parliamentary and health service ombudsman have finally report the report vindicate the waspi woman and highlight the dwp failure to communicate which negatively affect complainant sense of personal autonomy and control over their finance the report find the dwp do not adequately investigate and respond to complaint in damn condemnation it highlight that despite all of that the dwp will not take step to put thing right and that its refusal to do so be unacceptable it conclude parliament need now to act swiftly and make sure compensation scheme be establish we think this will provide woman with the quick route to remedy this be surely one of the grave injustice of our time alongside the contaminated blood scandal and the horizon scandal it be another example of citizen have thing do to they which by every measure be wrong and unjust commend my hon friend for secure today debate on behalf of the midlothian waspi woman thank she for all her work and all member who have contribute to make this debate happen do she agree that the fact that these injustice happen over and over again show how out of touch the government in this place have become one would be forgive for thinking of real disconnect between those we seek to serve and those who serve when that disconnect repeatedly happen and this systematic failure perpetrate such injustice it be very bad day for democracy the difference between this case and the contaminate blood and horizon scandal both be awful injustice be that the government at least appear to wish to take action on those scandal albeit very slowly they appear to wish to make move to address those injustice in this case of change the state pension age with little or no notice with the devastating consequence that it have bring the parliamentary and health service ombudsman have be move to say it be extremely rare that an organisation we investigate do not accept and act on our recommendation it add that it have no legal power to enforce compliance failure to comply with the ombudsman recommendation represent constitutional gap in protect the right of citizen who have be fail by public body and in ensure access to justice by lay this report the phso have ask parliament to intervene to agree mechanism for remedy and to hold the government to account for its delivery here we be we be hold the government to account while they and the incoming labour government enjoy cosy do nothing consensus sacrifice waspi woman on the bonfire of austerity that they have build together in deliberate and conscious way for the parliamentary and health service ombudsman to issue such statement be unprecedented but it illustrate how shocking it be that this government support by the loyal opposition loyal in way we could only imagine appear to be try to ignore obfuscate and gaslight their way out of this crisis and it be crisis for the woman impact neither labour nor the tories in government have even accept the principle of financial redress for waspi woman how do know that because when the secretary of state make statement shortly after the long await publication of this report he make no mention of redress or compensation but instead list how great it currently be to be pensioner in the united kingdom because of the sheer munificence of the uk government the shadow secretary of state response to that statement studiously avoid mention compensation as well instead deliver patronising yet supine eulogy on treat pensioner with dignity empty word do not pay bill and no one be fool by that nonsense perhaps we should not be too surprised since labour have track record of let woman down particularly working class woman after all the labour administration in glasgow city council spend million of taxpayer money fight equal pay claim by female council worker over year that show beyond any reasonable doubt just how far labour be prepared to go to fight equal pay an incredible waste of public money it take an snp administration in glasgow council to ensure that legal action be stop and the pay claim be settle that be priority of the incoming snp administration we know that labour have track record of deny justice to woman so we can not expect much from that quarter and anybody who do will be disappoint however the waspi woman have speak to feel particularly betray by labour mp and msp who have spend the last umpteen year pose for photograph smile broadly alongside waspi campaigner and pledge what turn out to be empty word of support only to abandon they at the very moment they be vindicate by the ombudsman the same debate be hold last week in the scottish parliament incredibly labour msp who be not just member of the scottish parliament but member of the scottish branch office abstain as order by their high command boss in london on motion that call for high compensation to properly reflect the financial harm suffer by waspi woman that motion sound pretty reasonable to it would to anybody the sum mention in the ombudsman report be simply too low think most people would agree with that they must be consider in the context that the uk government have save billion purely by raise the state pension age of these woman so it be time to get real the uk government could perhaps examine the private member bill bring forward by my hon friend the member for kilmarnock and loudoun alan brown and go from there instead all we have be silence from both the uk government and the labour opposition the leader of the opposition have himself benefit from special law pass in parliament the pensions increase pension scheme for keir starmer qc regulations it relate to when he be the director of public prosecutions in england and his personal pension be protect it be quite literally one law for he and another law for everybody else especially if you be waspi woman and even more so if you be working class woman it do not escape anyone notice that the leader of the opposition be now very silent on the injustice suffer by waspi woman and support less generous pension for everyone else what brass neck what shameful hypocrisy maybe he be just so cocksure of thumping labour majority at the next election that he think waspi woman be expendable who know meanwhile around waspi woman who have be impact have die since the start of the waspi campaign around have die since the publication of the ombudsman report why be there no urgency to address this injustice no wonder waspi woman impatience and sense of injustice be fast turn into outright fury who could blame they because of the evasion and mis direction use in previous debate wish to say to the minister that this be not debate about return the retirement age back to this be not debate about the triple lock and this be not debate about anything except the injustice suffer by woman bear in the who have be vindicate by the parliamentary and health service ombudsman thank the hon lady for give way think all of we in this chamber have speak to our waspi woman have barbara and lynn from hartlepool here today they inform early that every minute woman die that be grow as we speak thank the hon lady for that point all she do be emphasise how desperately urgent this matter be every minute waspi woman die so how many will die while we be have this debate another half dozen who know it may be more than that there be no more hiding place it be time for swift compensation to be deliver to these woman who have already endure far too much hardship and distress the redress that they be accord must reflect that suffering and there must be no barrier to access it for any of the woman affect no one can any long deny the rightness of their compelling case it be time to pay up it be time to deliver as the minister and the labour leadership must surely know by now these woman be not go away it be my hope that when the minister get to his foot he will have something meaningful to say to the house today and to all the waspi woman who have already wait too long for justice perhaps he can at least set out some kind of timeframe for when the government will bring forward redress proposal for those impact it be travesty to drag this injustice out one moment long hope the minister agree and do the right thing by this generation of woman or will these woman continue to suffer while his government pontificate hope not but say today to the minister and say today to the waspi woman who be listen both at home and in the public gallery that the snp unequivocally stand with you we will not abandon you as other have do it be privilege to speak in the debate when my constituent who have make complaint come to see we quite often get to stage at which recommend the ombudsman to they regularly say to they have faith ombudsman quite often find in favour of the complainant ombudsman be there for purpose we can not merely support the institution of the ombudsman when it make convenient finding for the government of the day we have to accept its decision if we be to have an ombudsman we all know that trust in politic politician and mps be at something of low point at the moment no matter what party we be in think that be very unfair because most people in this house of all party be decent people do their good for their constituent and work very hard so that reduction in trust really worry the response of the government and parliament to the ombudsman report be really important because it touch on the issue of trust in our institution which have be through very difficult time warmly welcome the thrust of my hon friend argument for the benefit of the record draw his attention and that of the house to paragraph of the report which state for most sample complainant we consider the primary injustice be that they be deny opportunity to make informed decision about some thing and to do some thing differently because of maladministration in dwp communication about state pension age that be material injustice be grateful to my right hon friend what he say be accurate he quote from the report it be in july that the ombudsman find maladministration in the report on march it say that that have lead to an injustice like my right hon friend will quote briefly from the ombudsman it say of the department for work and pensions that in it fail to take adequate account of the need for targeted and individually tailor information in dwp propose write directly to woman individually to let they know their state pension age have change but it then fail to act promptly we find that if dwp have make reasonable decision about next step in and then act promptly it would have begin write to affected woman by december my right hon friend and other members will have see that in the back of the report there be table show what should have happen when too have constituent who write to to say that they be very close to the age of at the time some have work all their work life since the age of or so they have make all their plan on the basis that they could get their pension at and they literally find out about the change from colleague in the workplace sometimes very shortly before they think they be due to retire will the hon gentleman give way will briefly but it will probably be the last intervention as take heed of what mr deputy speaker say thank the hon gentleman for give way the point he make ring true for the very first constituent who come to with problem when be elect seven year ago be waspi woman she be less than two year away from retirement when she learn by accident of the change seven year on she be no well off in lot of way she be much bad off lot of those who be not waspi woman now wonder if they know the truth about when they will get their pension do he agree that although this issue be fundamentally about the waspi woman it be about trust and woman have trust in this institution agree the issue of trust be really important one that this house should not take lightly in my south west bedfordshire constituency it be estimate that there be woman in this situation the cost of their compensation at level as recommend by the ombudsman would be million at the low level and at the upper level million if we extrapolate from that to the uk think the sum be billion at the low end and billion at the upper end we must be honest believe in honesty in politic these be large sum very large when we add the amount that we will have to pay the postmaster and postmistress for whom we be also all campaign and the sum for the victim of the infected blood scandal for whom most of we be also campaign and then there be other campaign such as the one relate to equitable life will the hon gentleman give way will because it be the hon lady but this must be the last intervention the hon gentleman talk about the way in which the bill for all these compensation scheme be mount do that not merely underline the importance of competent government of course it be good if government get these thing right but government be difficult and government of all party will make mistake because they be human however be make different point on honesty about the overall government finance when be teach economic long time ago be make aware of the notion of opportunity cost we can only spend the same pound once and if we be to spend billion on one thing we must be honest about the other thing on which we can not spend money thing that the waspi woman may very much want or the service we will have to cut or the taxis we will have to raise have try to find out from the library how the treasury reserve work and how we can account nationally for contingency fund to deal with issue such as this we just need bit of honesty here as parliament if we be to do the right thing by the waspi woman as believe we should want we to and we should do the same for those other group we need to consider fund in the treasury reserve that be dedicate to contingency although it might not be large enough to pay out on every cause in the way we would like perhaps the nation would not be able to afford that while absolutely back the justice of the cause of the waspi woman and while think we should honour what the ombudsman say or at least move towards do that we need to be honest about the nation finance and the other call on the exchequer let finish where begin will be brief heed mr deputy speaker injunction this come back to the question of trust we agree with the umpire not just when we be in favour of the umpire decision either we have an ombudsman or we do not and while the ombudsman finding may be uncomfortable or inconvenient it be less the finding and we should do the right thing thank the backbench business committee for give we the opportunity for this debate and thank the hon member for north ayrshire and arran patricia gibson for open it should make it clear at the outset that be the minister for pensions between december and july and again between may and may which be part of the period cover by the ombudsman report draw the house attention to the evidence that my committee the work and pensions committee take on may on the ombudsman report we be grateful to all who give evidence to we that morning and to the letter that send to the secretary of state for work and pensions yesterday on behalf of the committee set out our suggestion for way forward those document have be tag for this debate the ombudsman open an investigation of all this in six year ago after receive more than case it stop accept new one and select six sample case to investigate one or two of which have be refer to today the investigation be split into stage the first report publish in july find maladministration in the way in which the dwp have communicate the change to affected woman further report publish in march this year conclude that this have mean that some woman have lose opportunity to make informed decision about their finance which have diminish their sense of personal autonomy and financial control and cause unnecessary stress and anxiety and unnecessary confusion let say at the outset that the right hon gentleman be distinguished minister well respect across the house in his various government job be communication not the nub of this of course the decision itself be matter for debate on pension entitlement but there be the entirely separate issue of how the decision be communicate and the injustice lie in that failure to communicate when we change people circumstance with notice and they have time to deal with it cope with it make alternative arrangement that be one thing but when we do not give they adequate notice because of their age that be quite another disraeli think say justice be truth in action and that be the truth of the matter the right hon gentleman have echo number of the point that the ombudsman have draw to our attention but think we should be clear about the fact that great many people do know about this change the passage of the legislation be widely report at the time nearly year ago and vividly recall that in the first of my two stint as pensions minister spend fair chunk of most day sign reply to mps who have write on behalf of constituent who be unhappy about the impending change or be call on the then fairly new government to reverse it the reply that sign be robust and make it clear that the decision would not be reverse the decision be quite well know and the right hon member for new forest west sir desmond swayne make useful point in this regard think that citizen have responsibility to keep themselves inform by listen to the radio or read the paper of change in the law that will affect they however the ombudsman have establish and make clear in the report that the department find out at around the second time be pensions minister that only of woman have know about the forthcoming pension age change forty per cent be large number but the proportion who do not know about it be even large the department find that out as result of research do in but do nothing about it until that be the maladministration that the ombudsman have identify we do not know why nothing be do well certainly do not because the ombudsman have not tell we but it can not be credibly argue that this be not maladministration when department discover information and then do nothing there be clearly problem be grateful to my right hon friend for describe his experience in connection with this matter we have clear finding of maladministration but government acceptance of that do not automatically follow so we be have debate today about whether we accept the finding when give the timescale we ought surely to be think more about how we deal with issue relate to who be eligible and who be not agree and will come to that point when talk about the select committee discussion last week it be worth add that the problem cause by that maladministration be exacerbate by the decision in to increase the state pension age not to as provide by legislation in but to with very little notice give of that change the ombudsman say that have it report directly to the dwp it would have recommend that the department apologise for the maladministration and take step to put thing right as we all now know the ombudsman do not report directly to the department because of concern that no remedy would be forthcoming the interim ombudsman rebecca hilsenrath tell the committee last week that her office have be give repeatedly to understand that the department do not accept our finding perhaps when he wind up the debate the minister can tell we whether the department now recognise that there be maladministration in this case in lay its report before parliament in march the ombudsman ask we in the house to identify an appropriate mechanism for provide remedy it set out its thinking namely that the dwp should first acknowledge the maladministration and apologise secondly pay financial compensation to the six sample complainant at level of the severity of injustice scale and thirdly identify remedy for other who have suffer injustice because of the maladministration as we have hear the ombudsman estimate that this would involve sum of between billion and billion we need to find resolution to this issue and to find it quite quickly because it have drag on for very long time angela madden the chair of the waspi campaign tell the work and pensions committee last week that woman from the affected cohort die every minute which be powerful point to make want to ask the right hon member about resolution give the maladministration and the point make by the ombudsman the conclusion need to happen through political choice that political choice be between either the government sit there or government who might replace they at some point this year surely the waspi woman in my constituency of west dunbartonshire and those in everyone constituency need political agreement not obfuscation or an abdication responsibility but clear political choice agree the government have say that they will respond without undue delay and that they be consider the report in detail can the minister tell the house this afternoon whether the government will bring forward proposal for remedy as the work and pensions committee believe that they should before the summer recess we should set clear timetable we need scheme that be easy to administer the ombudsman say that in principle redress should reflect the impact on each individual but it recognise that the need to avoid delay and the large number involve may indicate the need for more standardised approach jane cowley the waspi campaign manager tell the work and pensions committee that give the need for action within week rather than year the scheme should be base on three principle speed simplicity and sensitivity the evidence that have be gather point to rule base approach to work out the compensation that should be pay have read the evidence give to the right hon member committee which be take in april this year if the government agree that they have to accept responsibility for this issue and to go forward with it how quickly could we start to see the highly justified compensation be pay to these woman would hope quite quickly and will explain why the payment involve would be adjust within range base on the ombudsman severity of injustice scale it would depend on two variable first the extent of the change to the individual state pension age how much it increase by and secondly the notice that the individual receive the less notice someone have of the change and the big the change to their state pension age the high the payment they would receive an arrangement like that would not be perfect but it would be quite quick and relatively inexpensive to administer compare with more bespoke system because it would involve apply know datum to formula to work out the amount that be due ask the minister whether he accept that in principle rule base system would be the good way forward beyond that it be suggest to the work and pensions committee that there should be some flexibility for individual to make the case after the standard payment have be calculate that they experience direct financial loss as result of the maladministration and that they should therefore be entitle to high level of compensation flexibility would be need because although the ombudsman do not see direct financial loss in the six sample complaint that it look at it do not exclude the possibility that there could be in other case for example angela madden the chair of the waspi campaign suggest to we that somebody whose divorce settlement be less than it would have be because it be base on the expectation that she would receive her state pension at the age of might well be entitle to large amount because of that particular development the right hon gentleman make very important point look at the experience of other compensation scheme the one that come to my mind be the icelandic trawlerman compensation scheme it be clear that the long we leave these thing and the long the passage of time the more difficult it get to resolve they do that not underline the need for speed here agree that we need to get on and resolve this issue after very long period the ombudsman suggest remedy base on level of its severity of injustice scale give the finding that individual have experience indirect financial loss we on the work and pensions committee do not seek to question that view and do not intend to do so this afternoon regardless of the level of remedy or the mean by which remedy be deliver it will need parliamentary time financial resource and the datum and technical system that be available only to the department for work and pensions even if back bencher bring forward private member bill as the hon member for kilmarnock and loudoun alan brown have do it can not become law without government support it will need money resolution that only the government can bring forward so it be not realistic to say that parliament can resolve this issue it must have the government full hearted involvement there will be different view on the finding of the ombudsman report however as the interim ombudsman tell the work and pensions committee last week she be appoint by parliament to carry out these investigation and be accountable to it through the public administration and constitutional affairs committee will read out what karl banister from the ombudsman staff tell the work and pensions committee last week he say we want everyone to comply with our recommendation but it be implicit in the scheme that because we do have enforcement power it may be sometimes that an organisation think it do want to then the partnership be that parliament as our supervisor will do something about that that go to the point make by the hon member for south west bedfordshire andrew selous early mr banister continue think what would damage the standing of the ombudsman be if parliament decline to do that it be important for all of we that we see this through we have ask the ombudsman to undertake this role and it have do the job that we ask it to do we now need to play our part in ensure that this matter be resolve time be not on our side and the government have be aware of this issue for while the right hon member be give an incredibly well inform speech on this matter have meet angela madden and various waspi woman in dudley and it be clearly highly complicated and difficult issue to resolve especially if it be necessary for the government to look at appropriate and proportionate remedy have first identify the woman who have come to harm do the right hon member agree that whatever solution be come to it be necessary to accelerate the work on this incredibly complicated issue at pace while the clock do not stop for anybody it certainly seem to accelerate for those of we of great age agree that we need to get move on that be why the government should commit to bring forward some proposal before the summer recess so that we all know where we be head the government have all the information they need it be difficult and costly matter but hope they will be able to bring forward proposal in time for the house summer recess it be great honour to follow the right hon member for east ham sir stephen timms who have encyclopaedic knowledge of this subject be grateful to he for his speech it be no surprise that want to speak in today debate as represent the old cohort of constituent in the entire country in north norfolk there be somewhere in the region of waspi woman who have be impact by this issue and not week go by without my receive correspondence from woman who have be affect terribly will come to the report finding in moment but will first reflect on the real impact of this scandal and on what have happen to the woman catch up in it the problem with this place be that we often forget about the real people and the real suffering we sometimes get very preoccupied with the political and financial problem in front of we and question why they happen in the first place but that be somewhat secondary because we must not forget about all the woman who have really be affect across the country thousand of woman in our constituency be affect the hon gentleman be make an important point about find resolution it have be over day since the ombudsman find the government guilty of maladministration we have hear the shocking figure that waspi woman die every minute which mean that over affected woman have pass away since the ombudsman finding be sure the hon gentleman will agree that we need to work together to ensure that the government get move on in bring forward compensation proposal before the summer recess because people be pass away and time be of the essence totally agree with the hon gentleman it be now about speed and will come to that point later in my speech waspi woman have already suffer for year and year and now this report have be publish we should learn from the other injustice we have see such as the post office scandal that speed be of the essence we need to come up with remedy as quickly as possible my hon friend be make very powerful speech about the impact on individual as well as the number do he agree that this be about fairness take into account the individual fact of each case leigh lady maggie briley retire four year before she turn to look after her parent with dementia not get her pension as she fully expect at mean that she have to sell her home and take up low pay job to make end meet and of course she could not look after her parent who suffer as well do my hon friend agree that this be about not just fast compensation but fair compensation base on the individual circumstance of each case that be not necessarily just for maggie but for the waspi woman in my constituency my hon friend be absolutely right this be about individual and every single individual who have be impact have different life story to tell it be very difficult for the government to come up with redress scheme that cover every eventuality because as my hon friend say individual circumstance affect everyone who have be impact all right some lady have cop they might have have saving earning or private pension and in some case they be lucky enough to have family who be able to help but an awful lot of woman have absolutely none of that huge number have suffer through absolutely no fault of their own as have be repeat many time many waspi woman have die in recent year we can not imagine just how difficult it must have be for some of these woman who have have so little to cope through the time delay they have suffer it be not their fault back home in north norfolk like my hon friend the member for southend west anna firth hear of dreadful case of woman who give up work to care for sick or die husband they be totally reliant on the pension they think be go to come but it do not and they be perhaps not able to go back to work or find employment it be not easy in those case the injustice have have profound impact on people life livelihood mental wellbeing and in many case financial standing which have be so damaging for so many woman be new mp not so new any more guess and we see so many injustice it be privilege to try to fix they whether it be infect blood the loan charge hillsborough or the post office which be particularly pertinent to we in this place should learn how we can try to sort out some of these injustice both ministers be excellent decent empathetic people have previously speak to they about this issue and know they care deeply about it as have already be say we should be honest about today debate the public purse do not have billion of pound of spare capacity at the moment and the people of this country who be watch be intelligent they can see that the financial scarring of the pandemic weigh very heavily on we in this debate we should be practical with our suggestion and the right hon member for east ham sir stephen timms propose set of in depth practical step many of the waspi campaign briefing and request be entirely sensible and it have real right to be hear there be no long any debate about the ombudsman report as far as be concerned it clearly find that there be maladministration between and and as we have hear time and again that delay lead to this problem we need to get over that point it have happen there be problem and there be no point deny it hear the odd cursory comment from constituent who say well they should have know about it it be advertise enough that be not fair the ombudsman report make that very clear these woman be fail in many case by the state the redress the compensation mechanism must be clear and fair as we hear there must be speed sensitivity and simplicity the waspi campaign brief be very sensible in say that the government should come forward with two pronged approach that deliver high level of compensation to those with the short notice of the long delay to receive their state pension why be that fair because those be the woman who be impact the most if they be impact the most they be the one who have suffer the most and they deserve that redress but that be not enough not to think about everybody else it be sensible to put together some eligibility criterion that enable all the other impact cohort to be able to make claim for compensation it be right that we come forward with that as quickly as possible one thing have learn in this place not to be too facetious be that thing do not happen very quickly but this be something that should be happen quickly when the public mood move as we see with the post office scandal we know that we can move quickly we have the report and the waspi woman have already suffer for an inordinate amount of time urge the government to come up with that remedy and to get on with it quickly too thank the backbench business committee for enable the debate to take place suppose that should congratulate the hon member for north ayrshire and arran patricia gibson on her opening speech and do but caution she that use it to promote division in the house of commons be not the way to advance the issue if she be serious about it and if she have listen to all the speech that have be make so far she will know that there be consensus in the house our effort need to be put into find way to move that forward will be brief the case for right this injustice be convincing although the parliamentary and health service ombudsman inquiry note that timely and accurate information be available about change to the number of qualifying year need for full state pension as result of the pensions act it do find maladministration in dwp communication about the pensions act in addition the report find that maladministration in dwp complaint handling cause complainant unnecessary stress and anxiety and mean an opportunity to lessen their distress be lose for some complainant it also cause unnecessary worry and confusion that be pretty clear about the extent of the maladministration in the context of this debate the ombudsman state give the scale of the impact of dwp maladministration and the urgent need for remedy we be take the rare but necessary step of ask parliament to intervene stress the use of the word urgent which will return to and on which several hon member have already comment will first say few word about the woman who have be affect by this wholly unfair and unacceptable matter we need to remind ourselves that the woman bear in the do everything require of they to ensure that reliable arrangement be in place when they reach pensionable age that be the crux of the matter strongly believe that we as member of this house have responsibility to accept our duty to remedy the situation to return to the ombudsman emphasis on the word urgent my fear be that we will not deal with the situation urgently let be clear do not believe that allow the clock to run down to the forthcoming general election be an acceptable option my fear be confirm yesterday at prime minister question when in response to my hon friend the member for salford and eccles rebecca long bailey the prime minister say follow the ombudsman multi year investigation it be imperative that we take the time to review the finding thoroughly official report may vol the problem with that be the fact be already well know and it certainly do not reflect the ombudsman conclusion about the urgency of the issue will make suggestion that urge both front bench spokespeople to adopt believe that we could do the right thing in this parliament if the government and opposition party hold talk convene and chair by mr speaker with view to put bill before the house as speedily as possible be mindful and supportive of the suggestion of my right hon friend the member for east ham sir stephen timms that we could do something seriously before the summer recess as other hon member mention every generation experience injustice in my time in the house they have include the thalidomide victim hillsborough primodo contaminate blood and most recently the horizon scandal for they be all debt of honour that we have duty to redeem suspect that majority of member of the house would agree so please let we have the opportunity to do so rise order after the next speaker will impose time limit of minute which as they say be not target but maximum if hon member adhere to it we will have time for the front bench spokespeople and we will have the ability to accommodate every hon member who seek to speak call peter aldous congratulate the hon member for north ayrshire and arran patricia gibson on secure the debate and the backbench business committee on grant it the purpose of the debate be to consider the parliamentary and health service ombudsman report of march and how good to implement its recommendation in brief the following issue arise from the report first the phso find that in the department for work and pensions fail to take adequate account of the need for targeted and individually tailor information to be share with woman affect by the change to the state pension age that amount to maladministration and result in the six complainant whose case be consider not be able to do thing differently or make informed mitigate decision the phso conclude that they should be compensate for that secondly the phso take the highly unusual step of lay its report before parliament due to its concern that the dwp would fail to provide remedy although the phso have put forward suggestion as to what the compensation should be it have ask parliament to intervene to agree mechanism for remedy and to hold the government to account thirdly the phso point out that it be extremely rare for an organisation that it investigate not to accept and act on its recommendation it make the observation that failure to comply with its recommendation represent constitutional gap in protect the right of citizen who have be fail by public body and in ensure access to justice my interest in the injustice arise from the fact that for approximately eight year as regular as clockwork constituent have be highlight to the enormous challenge and hardship that they have face and endure for the past four year have have the privilege of co chair the all party parliamentary group on state pension inequality for woman with first the hon member for denton and reddish andrew gwynne and more recently the hon member for salford and eccles rebecca long bailey take the opportunity to thank our predecessor the hon member for swansea east carolyn harris and my hon friend the member for east worthing and shoreham tim loughton it be important to thank the phso for its work and the duty that it have carry out it have receive criticism for the time that it have take and for the narrow remit of consider six case that some be concerned do not fully reflect the injustice that bear woman as whole have have to endure however it would have be very easy for the phso to have decide that this be not case for it to investigate instead it have not shy away from the past the investigation have take long time because it be complicated and there be need to get it right the phso have provide we with snapshot it be up to we parliament government and the dwp to extrapolate and put right problem that may well extend much more widely to do that the phso have provide some guideline that we need to follow parliament should take immediate step to find resolution for those who do not have time on their side each case should be consider on its own merit finite resource be not an excuse for fail to provide fair remedy if parliament choose to do nothing that will undermine the ombudsman the department for work and pensions should respect what parliament recommend there must be commitment from government to take on board the phso finding and to work collegiately with parliament in find and then implement fair and just remedy wide issue that need to be consider perhaps in the first instance by the right hon member for east ham and his committee be the breakdown in communication and implementation of policy in the dwp go back over year accept that the department remit be large challenging and complicated but the phso highlight repeat failure in the department communication of state pension reform we must not let cause become more important that effect as my hon friend describe it be right that we look at why and how this happen but what really matter be what happen because what the waspi woman need be action quickly if we be to spend great deal of time look at the genesis of the issue be not sure that quick action would be deliver so endorse what the right hon member for east ham say about establish criterion that can be effect with reasonable speed thank my right hon friend for that point which he make quite well be divert slightly from the main cause and theme but think he and be on the same page as say be concern about repeat failure in the department communication only last saturday constituent highlight to how the introduction of the new state pension penalise those woman bear in and the end frozen pensions campaign point out that of frozen pensioner do not know of the policy existence prior to move abroad on that point will my hon friend give way very briefly because this be side issue the report acknowledge that the dwp be now modernise its system so that people be inform but do he agree that move to modernised system might pose risk specifically to pensioner who be digitally exclude that something similar could happen again in future my hon friend make good point it be side point to the main point but nevertheless the phso have pinpoint that issue these be debate for another day suspect the right hon member for east ham and his committee need to look at these issue in more detail but the phso have shine spotlight on wide problem the aim of the appg that co chair with the hon member for salford and eccles be threefold first to represent those woman who have be treat unjustly by the short notice change to the state pension age of whom have die accord to waspi since the start of the campaign secondly to develop and promote policy solution to support bear woman and their family who do not have access to their pension and be face mental and physical health consequence and thirdly to feed the view and experience of bear woman into future policy decision relate to state pension and welfare over the year the appg have have regular evidence gather session with various representative group and we have consider policy and initiative to good help and assist they in january the appg make its own submission to the phso about the level of compensation that should be provide give special thank to the hon member for denton and reddish for the work that he and his office do put that together base on the evidence present to we from across the uk we reach what for we be the logical conclusion that level of the phso compensation scale should apply subsequently we refine that recommendation by propose that compensation should be provide in bell curve with those who receive least notice of the long postponement receive the most compensation and those who receive long notice of short increase receive less sum may take the opportunity to thank my hon friend for his key role in the appg put on the record the dignified and well inform view of local waspi co ordinator in my part of the world shelagh simmons and sal robinson we hear an intervention suggest each case should be judge on its individual circumstance can see the merit in that but it would have devastating effect on the speed with which we would come to conclusion what balance do my hon friend think should be strike on those two factor my sense be that there be need to strike balance as the phso say way forward be begin to emerge from the work of the appg and the select committee and will elaborate on that since the phso publish its report on march the appg have seek to play its role as part of parliament in find fair and just mechanism as quickly as possible as the phso ask parliament to do the hon member for salford and eccles and write to the secretary of state for work and pensions and we have subsequently meet the minister my hon friend the member for blackpool north and cleveleys paul maynard who be now back in his place thank he for the hearing he give we last tuesday the hon member for salford and eccles and appear before the work and pensions committee likewise be grateful to the right hon member for east ham and his colleague for the fair and full reception they provide we be hold our own evidence session with the various representative group the first three session take place on monday and there be more to follow this be complicated matter while the appg be yet to reach settled and final recommendation about the form compensation mechanism should take it be fair to say that idea be fast evolve and be point in direction will the hon gentleman advise the house as well as waspi woman in west dunbartonshire and across the uk on whether one of those recommendation will be for ministerial apology on behalf of the department for where we be now phso suggest an apology from the dwp should be encapsulate in what it come up with as way forward the dwp own guideline include an apology as well will focus on the form of compensation redress which be emerge in little more detail while the phso have suggest that compensation should be pay at level on their scale there be disquiet among those affect that that be too low and that level should apply in line with the appg recommendation the phso comment that flat rate be easy to implement but not perfect and that there may well be need for balance act as my right hon friend the member for new forest east sir julian lewis suggest in his intervention the phso also suggest that the national audit office may be able to provide guidance on how to structure compensation scheme the waspi group have emphasise as we have hear the need for speed simplicity and sensitivity and it recommend that the dwp should bring forward proposal for financial redress scheme to parliament before the summer recess it also propose that high payment should be target at those most impact the work and pensions committee be to be commend for get out its recommendation in less than day after its evidence session it also ask the government to bring forward proposal for the summer recess it too propose that payment should be base on the extent of change to an individual state pension age and the notice of change that they receive it add that there should be some flexibility for individual to be able to make the case for high level of compensation base on experience direct financial loss clear parameter as to the form that the compensation should take sense be rapidly evolve parliament in the past two month since the phso publish its report in its various different guise be play its role to the full would suggest that now be the time for the government to step up to the plate mechanism should be put in place before the summer recess acknowledge that the matter be complicated and that there be need for contemplation and reflection but we should have in mind that the most notable achievement of this government be that under enormous pressure in very short timescale they put in place furlough scheme that save hundred of thousand of job and get we through covid there be no reason why the government can not move with such speed and alacrity again would add that failure to comply with the phso recommendation would be almost completely unprecedented over the year that the ombudsman have exist and would drive coach and horse through what be an integral part of our parliamentary system of democratic check and balance in conclusion support this motion pay tribute to my hon friend the member for north ayrshire and arran patricia gibson for her blistering and brilliant opening speech she speak for many of our constituent and for those member who can not be here today we must remember as other member have say that waspi woman be not just some distant transient group but real people with real life and that this injustice have have real impact they be mother grandmother great grandmother sister aunt carer and daughter many have pass away in the time that we have be try to secure they justice find it remarkable that the ombudsman have such little faith in the government that it be turn to parliament to try to find resolution and remedy and we owe it to those waspi woman to do so we have take an oath of office to our constituent all of we to find resolution and solution sadly it have become the business of this government to kick the can down the road whatever the issue be whether it be the horizon scandal primodo or contaminate blood it seem to have become an ingrained and institutional habit to kick the can down the road and make those who have suffer at the hand of government to wait even long conservative member make the point about the cost of redress and remedy and of course we must recognise that but in do so we must also recognise the money that have already be spend by the civil service and the money and the time that have be spend by our constituency staff and all of we suspect that the amount of money and time that have be spend on this report be almost equal to the money that need to be pay to bring redress to the waspi woman while we be look at what remedy we can find and what money can be seek perhaps we should be look at proceed of crime money perhaps we should be look at the russian oligarch who need to have their asset seize or have have their asset seize proper sanction against those who launder money and the dirty money that flow through the financial institution of the uk have sit on bill committees in this house and see the government take lacklustre action the money be there it be about political will as my hon friend the member for north ayrshire and arran say have have many representation from the waspi woman in my livingston constituency and today want to give they voice shirley sharp be bear in october she take early retirement from the scottish government in december when she be before decide to leave she contact the pension service and receive her forecast she say know when leave my job would receive my pension on when be year month old after leave another month be add to my pension age which could make provision for to add insult to injury my husband be month old than and he receive his pension month before do if it be about equality why be penalise month more than man have be in receipt of my state pension since be still very angry about how this whole thing have be be be handle another constituent who do not want to be name take early retirement from the civil service and look after elderly relative for four year until month before her birthday at that point her sister ask she whether she be plan on get part time job she say that she be exhausted and that she could manage financially as long as she get her pension in month time she could not believe it when she be tell that her pension at age would be she think that her leg be be pull she phone the dwp which confirm what she have be tell but she have never have any communication about this from the dwp another constituent anne seenan miss out on have have her state pension delay by two year she say never receive any communication from the dwp another constituent dianne risbridger say unfortunately be one of the woman affect by chronic life limit illness which add to the distress as well as be bear mere three week after the cut off date for appeal so double whammy in my case another constituent jill parton be watch this debate she be an incredible woman who know well she say unfortunately be one of the ten of thousand of woman bear in the who have be badly affect by the rapid rise in state pension age for woman work part time while be train to become teacher and start full time work in august when be always expect that would receive my state pension at age marry in and continue work full time jill take six month off to have her two child she separate from her husband before her son be bear she find out that she would not receive her state pension at during staff meeting she remind today that her divorce settlement like those of many of her constituent be predicate on when she would get her state pension unfortunately she also live with diagnosis of fuchs corneal dystrophy the unpredictability of the condition and the impact of teaching under bright light mean that she could not teach she say find it very difficult to understand the government position on this while they be make ten of thousand of woman work until they have even more young people who can get job for the mental health of all concern would it not be more economical to allow the woman to retire and the young jobless to have their job mental health worry affect many people jill be deeply concerned about the impact that the issue have have not just on she but on many other the bottom line be that we be talk about social contract between our constituent and the government many of these woman have already suffer great discrimination throughout their life and have not be able to pay their full stamp as it be call back in the day they have no idea this be go to happen it be not good enough for some to say that the communication be adequate put out press release be not proper communication the government need to get grip on this issue and understand the profound impact that it have have on other constituent of mine susan rankin chaw atkinson elizabeth donnelly linda howieson meg wilson marion wight margaret diamond anne waugh and gloria fairgrieve want to read their name out because they be real people with real life and this be have real impact on they if there be one decent thing that the government could do before they be boot out of office it would be to give the waspi woman the justice that they deserve rise to speak on behalf of the woman across stockton south affect by this issue woman come across every day in all corner of my constituency and from all walk of life my mother be waspi woman she find out while chat to her sister know my mother that will have be an interesting conversation have have many conversation with constituent about the issue and the impact that it have have on their life none of they dispute the need to equalise the pension age for man and woman and they all understand the challenge of communicate that change to the public but they want justice and fair treatment from the system that they have spend their life pay into after year of debate under government of both colour we have arrive at the point at which an independent ombudsman have tell we that the waspi woman be wrong maladministration occur and there should be compensation for those woman affect the system that they pay into all their life be mean to provide they with comfort in retirement they base their life plan around it and now the parliamentary and health service ombudsman report confirm that the change be make without adequate notice that have huge impact on those affect and their family these woman lose the chance to make informed decision in prepare for retirement have hear story of woman who work all their life and deserve to retire with dignity but who have instead be force to rely on help from their husband or even their child those most affect be often those already vulnerable widow and those live alone those with health issue and those already face financial hardship be glad that we now have the ombudsman report but this issue have go on for way too long these woman have wait long time for justice and as we have hear for some it be now far too late pay tribute to all the waspi woman in my constituency and far afield who have campaign tirelessly for year and exhaust every avenue to right this wrong urge the government to consider the report as quickly as possible and ensure that the waspi woman get the fair and fast compensation that they deserve thank the hon member for waveney peter aldous for his comment which associate myself with and for his hard work over the year on the all party parliamentary group also thank the hon member for north ayrshire and arran patricia gibson and the backbench business committee for secure this important debate we all know how we get here for people watch at home many woman bear in the retire at in the belief that they would receive their full state pension only to realise that the government have increase the retirement age by five year and not tell they many have hand in their notice at work and in many case those woman be force to exist on meagre welfare benefit that leave they live hand to mouth existence many be leave destitute some even lose their home many experienced depression and some be even suicidal that be scandal and clear injustice give my warm thank to all the woman against state pension inequality campaign group on behalf of myself the hon member for waveney and all member of the all party group also thank the woman in my constituency of salford and eccles who be bear in the in particular lady call judith robertson and the woman of the waspi campaign who have set up stall in our local supermarket and lobby and other mp on this important issue we all recognise the determination and strength of these brave woman their relentless campaigning against this profound injustice be the reason why we be here today the issue be not whether these woman face injustice the ombudsman report make it clear that they do that the dwp be guilty of maladministration that these woman be entitle to compensation urgently from the government and that parliament must urgently identify mechanism for ensure that will briefly make few comment about the ombudsman report for clarity first it be important to stress that the ombudsman have look at only one aspect of injustice maladministration by the dwp that is whether they adequately notify the woman affect by the change to their pension age the ombudsman remit be not to look at the wide discriminatory impact of the policy that have be leave unaddresse sadly the uk pension system systematically favour man in this age group they often receive high state pension and even high private pension many of these woman affect spend significant period out of the workforce care for their child and family member that be couple with gender pay gap that be far more acute during their time in the workforce than it be today so they be already at disadvantage in term of their ability to contribute to their private and state pension the only element that go some small way towards address the gender pension gap be that the national insurance pension be pay to woman from age whereas it be pay to man from age obviously that advantage be take away the fairness and the gender impact of the policy need to be urgently address and hope that we continue to fight for that in this house but today we be focus on the ombudsman finding the key finding be that the failure by the dwp to adequately inform thousand of woman of their state pension age constitute maladministration the ombudsman also find that as result some woman have lose opportunity to make informed decision about their finance and that the dwp failure have diminish woman sense of personal autonomy and financial control the ombudsman also recommend that the dwp acknowledge its failing and apologise for its impact on those affect the report conclude very clearly that the woman concern be entitle to compensation urgently we have discuss what the remedy could look like and the report be very clear that it leave that open to parliament to determine crucially it say that finite resource should not be use as an excuse for fail to provide fair remedy this be clear injustice and should be treat as one if we go down the path of decide which injustice be and be not deserve we be in very dangerous territory the report also point out that hm treasury require compensation scheme to be efficient and effective and to deliver value for money in particular any administrative cost associate with compensation scheme should not be excessive that lead the ombudsman to suggest that while parliament might favour mechanism for assess individual claim of injustice it might want to consider the point that flat rate payment would deliver more efficient resolution note of caution here it be important that we consider the impact of that carefully as some woman may be pay far less compensation than they be entitle to on the amount of redress as we hear from the hon member for waveney the ombudsman guidance on financial remedy set out six level of compensation the ombudsman suggest that solely in the very small set of six case that it assess the range could be within level but in further session with the work and pensions committee last week it acknowledge that that small subset may not cover all the extreme financial situation that many woman affect have face that could be address by an appropriate redress mechanism that parliament look at all the woman campaign group that have contact the all party group so far have state that set compensation at level would be grossly insufficient and agree when gather evidence the all party group find that in vast number of case the injustice be actually at level and that be the recommendation that the all party group make to the ombudsman whole range of option be be discuss from flat rate payment to flat rate taper payment the bell curve that the hon member for waveney speak about flat rate payment with top up over five year period or mediation for woman alongside an initial payment to address the full scale of loss and discrimination face whatever option parliament choose to take it be important that it be not mean test that it be fast fair and enshrine in legislation and most importantly that it garner the support of the woman affect however there be one major hurdle before we before we even get to the point of discuss and fine tune any proposal the government have they must first lay before parliament their propose redress mechanism there be no excuse for delay the report be lay before parliament in march it be now may and still we have no government response it be just not acceptable we have hear that nearly woman have already die wait for justice and as we speak at least one woman will die wait for justice every minute say to the government just do the right thing and as matter of urgency lie before parliament mechanism for redress so we can all act in accordance with the ombudsman recommendation begin by commend my hon friend the member for north ayrshire and arran patricia gibson not only for secure this debate on the ombudsman report but for her continued determination in represent the waspi woman and seek the justice that they have be so cruelly deny by their own government those include woman such as mary barclay from bellshill who come to my advice surgery just on friday to ask to come to this house today and ask this government to do the right thing by she and the thousand of other woman who have have the rug pull out from underneath they she also speak to about some of the woman who have die during this fight for justice and how along with thousand across my coatbridge chryston and bellshill constituency she will continue to fight for what they be entitle to put on record my thank to mary for the time she spend inform of the real and deep impact that this issue have have on she in later life across scotland it be estimate that almost woman be impact by the waspi pension scandal many of the woman affect be already in ill health other have take early retirement and be plan to get by until the age of when they think they would receive their state pension however westminster tories have different idea the uk government instead invent reason for countless delay in the hope that the waspi woman would simply go away but think they have prove that they will not go away no chance their campaign for justice continue return to that figure of some woman who have pass away without see the justice that be owe to they as many as woman be die every year without get any form of compensation that be outrageous and wilful neglect of the duty of any government it be shameful it be betrayal of the most callous kind of those impact by the uk government maladministration the snp welcome the finding of the phso report and it be clear that the westminster government must now take responsibility for the hardship that they have cause woman bear in the and make urgent amend for mistake make waspi woman have be struggle for year now with this injustice and just about every other whim and decision that emanate from this place have also take its toll we have hear about the horizon scandal and the infected blood scandal but there be also the cut to pension credit for mixed age couple the freezing of the hard earn state pension of pensioner live overseas and this government scrapping of free tv licence for the all those decision impact on waspi woman on top of the self inflict cost of living crisis it be just become too much for some of they the uk government must not only apologise for the harm cause by their clear and obvious maladministration but act urgently to deliver the justice and the compensation that these woman so richly deserve the report be clear and damning it have make finding of failing by the dwp in this case and have rule that the woman affect be owe compensation the phso chief executive rebecca hilsenrath say dwp have clearly indicate that it will refuse to comply that be outrageous she continue this be unacceptable the department must do the right thing and it must be hold to account for failure to do so to this very day the dwp have not acknowledge its failing it have also fail to offer any apology or explanation and have indicate that it will not compensate woman affect by its failure the snp here in westminster and in government in holyrood have always support and will continue to support the waspi woman and their valiant effort yet many here in westminster who be previously very vocal in support the waspi woman have now fall eerily silent the very same can be say for prominent tory and labour figure up the road in holyrood as well on may the scottish parliament move motion on woman state pension compensation that agree that the uk government must now urgently deliver on the ombudsman recommendation to pay compensation in full to those woman without delay that motion pass in the scottish parliament with vote from the snp the liberal democrats the scottish greens and the alba party the tories and the labour party shamefully abstain on that vote and that speak volume it certainly speak lot more than the silence that come from their benches have to say that if the waspi woman be pin their hope on an incoming labour administration they probably need to prepare themselves for yet more despair why be that they need only familiarise themselves with the length that the labour administration in north lanarkshire council go to in order to avoid pay out on equal pay claim owe to woman over many year spend million upon million of pound on legal fee in the process of fight those justify claim and then lose the same happen as we have hear in labour run glasgow city council those two party the tories and labour be not interested in equality for woman the evidence be before we friend so forgive if have no faith whatsoever in the change that the labour party be purport to offer labour could of course surprise we it could support the state pension age compensation bill in the name of my hon friend the member for kilmarnock and loudoun alan brown of which be co sponsor the uk government and the labour party could and should back his bill and immediately set up compensation scheme for all the woman affect we know that they will not but we be ask they here today and reinforce those call it be clear that only strong snp voice in holyrood and here in westminster can hold this or any uk government to account whether it be tory or lead government we have hear demand that the secretary of state here in westminster should apologise and quite clearly he should but my hon friend will remember that year ago almost to the day very senior former labour prime minister be do the round in scotland speak at meeting of middle aged and elderly people promise they categorically that their pension be safe with any united kingdom government do my hon friend believe that it be now time that an apology come from that politician for the way that he deceive and mislead million of people in scotland my hon friend make an excellent point that be just one of the mistruth we be tell during that campaign we be also tell that we would maintain our place in the european union the waspi woman have be completely shaft for want of well word by the politician who be charge with deliver justice for they the snp and the scottish government in holyrood stand ready to engage with the department for work and pensions when the uk government finally agree to compensate the waspi woman there be still hope that this government will agree to do so because justice should be do after year of promise make by tory and labour mp and msp both party be now refuse to accept the report recommendation to compensate fully the woman who have be impact it be time for the tory and labour party to stop dither and to put the funding in place so that these woman can get the justice they deserve before it be too late it should also be crystal clear once again this be not an extreme proposition and it should not be see as such that the only way to protect scotland pensioner from the whim of westminster governments and to ensure dignity and fairness in retirement be for scotland to have the full power of its independence this issue be very close to my heart and thank the hon member for north ayrshire and arran patricia gibson and the backbench business committee for the opportunity to speak about it in the chamber however some member be not work with good will and consensus and base on the cross party work that have be do in particular that of the appg lead by my hon friend the member for salford and eccles rebecca long bailey and her co chair the hon member for waveney peter aldous whom thank for their work have be acutely aware of the woman state pension injustice for long time have family and friend as well as thousand of constituent who have be impact by it since be elect in have write to and meet numerous woman in gower bear in the who have share their experience and tell of the profound impact this issue have have on their life lead an adjournment debate on the matter back in and have work to represent woman affect throughout my time as an mp by support their complaint to the ombudsman and speak at every opportunity the then conservative chancellor decision to accelerate increase in the state pension age in the pensions act produce considerable hardship for many woman as it mean that lot of they receive little notice of an increase in their state pension age the government fail to communicate the change effectively some woman be give only one year notice while other get up to five year notice but many receive none at all that put those woman in serious position woman who have already make plan base on previous pension statement have to scramble on and continue to work to make end meet woman income in retirement be already significantly affect by unequal and low pay at work pregnancy discrimination discrimination against part time worker and lack of affordable childcare and carer support recently my constituent carrie williams come to visit my surgery she be in the first cohort of woman affect initial leaflet on change state that the increase to would happen in she then receive letter in inform she that the change would be in force from and would gradually increase from then mean that she would have to wait not until she be but until her birthday an extra year before be able to receive her state pension follow period of poor health the knowledge that she would not be get her pension for several year more make she increasingly stress and combine with other issue that she have with the dwp at the time which be affect her income lead to she again fall ill and have seizure correspondence of the various change be litter with suggestion that carrie pay for financial advisor which as single mother in poor health she could not afford to do she do not have spare cash just lie around to set up new saving pot an isa or anything else that be suggest as an apparent solution to her problem be glad to share that carrie be now in good health but unfortunately for she as for many of the woman affect that be not the end of it not only do she unexpectedly have to wait until to access her state pension but the amount that she receive from it have drastically reduce year on year due to fiscal drag would not have believe it have carrie not bring about six or seven year worth of evidence this conservative government recklessness with our economy be squeeze everyone finance have see it with my own eye and exacerbate the hardship that the waspi woman have already endure this have be long and frustrating process for the woman affect several group represent they the women against state pension inequality campaign be probably the well know but there be also the pension justice for swansea women campaign which include woman from my constituency and other in the local area lot be hinge on the ombudsman report it take some time but we now have it it be serious report that require serious consideration and the government must not use it to continue kick the can down the road as they have do over the past year the report find the dwp guilty of maladministration the secretary of state say in march that he would provide further update to the house on the matter but be yet to do so he should update parliament or tell we when he will finally do so although there be strong feeling and variety of ask the overarching issue be that an injustice must be address lesson must be learn to ensure that this never reoccur and that everyone have the right to properly plan for their retirement thank my hon friend the member for north ayrshire and arran patricia gibson for secure the debate and the backbench business committee for grant it it be my privilege to speak on behalf of waspi woman particularly those in the falkirk waspi woman group who have be with for long time hold public meeting way back in for the approximately woman in my constituency who be affect by the state pension age change discover that the overwhelming majority of those who attend have not receive any notification of the change the majority of woman be only one year away from the original retirement age of year and face further six year of work life without any warning many have already start to make plan to retire because of ill health or their caring duty for grandchild elderly parent it be not just the woman who be badly affect by these change family member also have to make change or other arrangement in their life cohort of the falkirk woman get together and form the falkirk group in they make arrangement to join the very first demo down here in london in june since then they have participate in other demo both here and in scotland and in they publish calendar from which all proceed go to breast cancer care local co ordinator anne campbell and have have many discussion and meeting about this issue along with other stalwart of the group namely may rookes mags burns lorna binnie sheila harkness elizabeth lumsden maureen mcleod valerie sutter ruth mcintosh helen reeder may farrell elspeth slater and many other woman campaign on this total injustice pay tribute to they all the falkirk women be positive and strong in their endeavour to right the wrong that be foist upon they in the cruell and most calculate way praise they and the rest of the waspi woman for their organisational skill they would like an apology and compensation for the turmoil thrust upon they they want respect dignity and most importantly fair and fast compensation scheme to redress the injustice it be fair to say that those woman be not go away so the government ignore they at their peril the waspi woman need an answer and they need it now no more unnecessary delay the government can and should resolve this pitiful state of affair here and now and do the right and proper thing by put an end to this bureaucratic shamble they must not procrastinate any long action be require not more word stop insult the waspi woman compensate they now with speed and simplicity pay tribute to all the waspi woman and other campaign on this issue in wirral west and across the uk and those who be in the gallery this afternoon stand in solidarity with they myself be bear woman pay tribute to all who have sadly pass away too believe it be important to consider the broad pension landscape and the discriminatory and quite frankly sexist nature of provision that have adversely affect bear woman for example rule that require fix number of qualifying year to be eligible for pension have disproportionately adversely affect woman in the right to deferred pension be introduce for those who leave service on or after april provide that they be over year old and have complete at least five year service one waspi campaigner tell that she have work for the army for four year and then leave after she have have her baby she receive no pension for those year which be grotesquely unfair that five year qualifying period which clearly discriminate against woman be reduce to two year from april and so it remain for the army and civil service today again believe that this be discriminatory and ask the minister to look into it part time worker have be similarly adversely affect by the design of pension scheme there be insufficient time to provide detail today however woman have clearly be disproportionately affect by that too as they be by the current earning threshold of per year for auto enrolment again ask the minister to look at address that discriminatory element of what be otherwise very important policy that affect large number of woman and man on low pay woman bear in the have already be adversely affect by pension policy the pension gender gap be still high analysis by the dwp publish in put that gap at mean that woman have less private pension wealth than man at age the minimum age at which most people can start to take their pension woman have less state pension too analysis by the institute for fiscal studies last year show that woman bear in the early receive around less state pension income than man the reason include have spend less time in pay employment compare with woman bear in later period and the way that the rule for entitlement to the state pension before the introduction of the new state pension in create significant gap between pension for man and woman for example before married woman could opt to pay married woman stamp mean that they pay low national insurance contribution and then receive low state pension it be scandalous too that many of the woman who pay that married woman stamp do not receive all the pension that they should have be entitle to due to the complex rule and computer error by the dwp then of course the gender pay gap mean that woman be pay on average less into their occupational pension all those thing be still affect woman today so it be in that context that ask the minister to act swiftly in relation to the parliamentary and health service ombudsman report on woman state pension age the waspi campaign have shine light on how the change affect woman many bear woman find out about the change to their state pension age at time that be too late for they to alter their retirement plan other have say that they have no idea that they would have to wait long to receive their state pension as result many woman have suffer financial hardship and emotional distress survey of around waspi woman carry out in december of last year find that in the previous six month of waspi woman have see their economic position get bad have struggle to pay essential bill and shockingly have struggle to buy food as we have hear from members right across this house our constituent have speak about how they have be personally affect one woman in wirral west tell that she have struggle to feed herself and have have to sell her home as result of how she be affect another constituent write to recently to say that she feel rob of her future and still feel that she be be ignore it be insulting to those woman that the minister have barely acknowledge the clear maladministration that the ombudsman say occur can he tell we today when his department will acknowledge that maladministration and will he apologise for it because of significant concern that the ombudsman have that dwp will fail to remedy the injustice it have take the rare decision to bring matter to parliament attention and specifically to ask parliament to intervene and identify mechanism for provide appropriate remedy the ombudsman report set out what that remedy might look like it also say that it be open to dwp to forestall this process by act on what the ombudsman say to parliament will the minister take this opportunity to do just that to look carefully at what the ombudsman have say and come forward with fair and fast compensation for the woman affect jane cowley the waspi campaign manager say last week at work and pensions select committee oral evidence hear that we have attempt to meet with the minister throughout our campaign but unfortunately those request have never be accept this be incredibly disappointing that campaign be act on behalf of million woman adversely affect it be utterly astonishing that the minister should show they such little respect time be of the essence for the government to put thing right accord to the waspi campaign group by this weekend waspi woman will have die since their fight for justice begin to put it another way as have already be say in this house one woman die every minute the government talk about support all pensioner to have dignified retirement but can the minister honestly stand at the dispatch box and say that his government be treat these waspi woman with the dignity and respect they deserve last week at the select committee oral evidence hearing angela madden the chair of the waspi campaign express frustration that the dwp have never accept that they have do anything wrong when will the government remedy the injustice that so many bear woman have face minister must apologise to those woman who have suffer as result of government failing and must bring forward fair and fast compensation as matter of urgency commend the hon member for north ayrshire and arran patricia gibson for secure this debate and the backbench business committee for grant it however do think it be disappointing that the government have not seek to have debate on this issue in government time particularly when there be quite clearly cross party consensus about the need for speed on it follow the ombudsman report hope the minister will be come forward with some clear proposal today about where we go and hope he be also hear how strong the feeling be across the house that the government need to do something quickly on monday we have an impassioned debate in this place about the role of member and speech after speech state that we in this place must uphold the high standard and set the good example of good practice there be argument make by other about the importance of democracy and representation and may not have agree with the conclusion they reach from those argument in many case but can not fault their dedication to this place and to the job that we do here on behalf of our constituent we should all therefore be able to support the basic idea that when someone be wrong and an independent body investigate and make recommendation for recompense those recommendation must be action the hon member for south west bedfordshire andrew selous who be no long in his place make very important point about the fact that we as constituency mps refer constituent on to the ombudsman how can any of we continue to do that in the future if the government and indeed this place choose to ignore recommendation make by that ombudsman the government be not above the law and we be here represent our constituent it be damn that the report from the ombudsman have to be send by the ombudsman to parliament because in its word it have significant concern that dwp will fail to remedy the injustice and acknowledge the maladministration what do that say expect the minister will say that the department need more time to consider its response but have listen to the other member who have participate in the debate so far think many of we have no time for that any more and certainly the waspi woman do not listen with interest to the hon member for wirral west margaret greenwood about the fact that female pensioner be most likely to be live in poverty she make very powerful and compelling case for that and the reality be that the gender pension gap continue to this day because the gender pay gap also continue we must have social security system and pension system that actually recognise the work woman do and be more likely to do from caring perspective do lot of work on that in relation to my carer leave act but woman generally be more likely to work part time or have time out of the workplace so they be always go to experience low level of state pension the injustice that waspi woman have face be simply shameful the financial burden have be outline but the anxiety they feel be also huge constituent have contact to tell that the ordeal have have an enormous and horrible negative effect on her mental health because she simply feel so powerless to do anything about it do my hon friend agree that this government should immediately confirm that they will honour the ombudsman recommendation and come forward with proper plan to compensate the million of affected woman be grateful to my hon friend for her intervention and absolutely agree with she we have have the report for some time and think the government should be make statement to say that they support it it be quite clear that plenty of work have be do by both the appg and the ombudsman to outline what compensation scheme should look like my hon friend be right about the mental impact meet constituent of mine heather several week ago she be single woman so she do not have partner or spouse income that be the assumption make about woman to rely on she have have to give up work as teacher early than expect due to ill health and feel that the injustice be compound by the government not have yet acknowledge the ombudsman report properly the dwp have have full notice of the investigation by the phso and its finding and would argue that they should therefore have have the opportunity to plan accordingly with regard to the infected blood scandal the government have say that when the report be finally publish on monday they will make statement on what they will do very quickly thereafter feel therefore unmove by the argument that they need more time to respond to the ombudsman report when they have know for some time that it be come the first report on maladministration be publish almost three year ago so just do not accept that the government and the dwp have not have the time to consider the likely outcome of the finding we know that recommendation for compensation be likely so would have expect the dwp to have start make plan for administer it while sit in the chamber have be notify by my researcher that have have response to write parliamentary question which state that the department do not have sight of draft copy of the phso report at the end of last year my researcher have also confirm with the waspi campaign have meet angela madden and other several time who say that that be not the case and that the government do have sight of the draft report would be grateful for clarity from the minister on that be happy to give way to he or perhaps he can comment on that write response to the parliamentary question in his closing remark be it correct that the government do not have sight of the draft report at the end of last year on point of order mr deputy speaker opposition members be complain about the fact that dip my head in order to listen and suggest that be somehow evidence of not listen take exception to their criticism of my body position your comment stand on the record thank you mr deputy speaker certainly be not suggest that to the minister be say that have two different version of event the waspi campaign be say that the draft report be see by the dwp at the end of last year and have write response from the government say that it be not if the response to the write parliamentary question be find to be inaccurate would be grateful if the minister write to to confirm that if he be unable to conform that in his closing remark would be grateful if he would place that letter in the commons library have do lot of work with the minister previously he be heavily involved with in the all party parliamentary group on end the need for food bank so know that he care about people but really do not want to hear in his closing remark that this be just the department be thorough like many here have meet waspi woman and the campaigner who stand in the rain outside parliament on budget day have speak to group leader and to my constituent the one message they want to bring here today be that they be die they be die without the dwp admit to its error without any acknowledgement of the impact that this have have on their life without compensation and without resolution frankly they now feel that the government be wait for they to die in order for the problem literally to cease to exist waspi woman deserve compensation that be not just my view or the view of many member in the house it be the view of the ombudsman if we in this place can not adhere to the finding of the parliamentary and health service ombudsman what message be we send from this place generally mr deputy speaker be plunge into huge anger upset distress feel like have be scamme why have anyone tell my pension age have change why have know about it those be the word of hilary who like million of other woman bear in the be hit by the change in the state pension age hilary be leave ten of thousand of pound bad off she have budget for her state pension beginning at not six year later she struggle to make end meet and start to look for another job but she ask who go to employ woman in her late hilary be not alone million of woman bear in the be rob of their pension survey carry out by the women against state pension inequality campaign to whose tireless advocacy pay tribute today particularly those waspi woman in coventry south find that half the woman survey struggle to pay essential bill and one in four struggle to put food on the table but it be not just the financial hit it be the worry stress and the feeling that they have make mistake and that it be their fault they do not know that the pension age have change the ombudsman report put that to bed once and for all the fault for not know be not with those woman the fault be with the government and the department for work and pensions there be maladministration in communicate the change and an injustice be do that be what the ombudsman conclude and it utterly vindicate the waspi campaign justice delay be justice deny and every minute waspi woman pass away and be forever deny justice since the beginning of their campaign woman affect by the pension change have pass away never to see this wrong right it be utterly scandalous that the government seem intent on drag their foot for as long as they can on march after the ombudsman report be publish the secretary of state for work and pensions tell the house that he would respond without undue delay almost two month have pass another waspi woman have pass away and still this government be do nothing the government have still fail to heed the report recommendation to identify mechanism for provide appropriate remedy for those who have suffer injustice and that be no surprise the report conclude that it strongly doubt that the dwp will provide remedy to the injustice so it be up to this place and all our colleague to rise to this challenge and to right this wrong we have recent example of that happen after the post office horizon scandal be bring to life in tv drama the government respond to the public outcry and introduce legislation to address that injustice it be the right thing to do but it should not take toby jones and itv for the government to do their job they need to act and act now will finish with this the ombudsman report be right that an injustice be do these woman lose out some be make ten of thousand of pound worse off by these change they be make to feel like they have make mistake as if the fault be theirs the stress and pain have be immense will conclude by say that not only must the government compensate these woman as matter of urgency but they must go beyond what have be recommend by the ombudsman which be not nearly enough to cover the hurt distress and lose income face by many of these woman join the waspi campaign in call for fast and fair compensation give justice to woman who have be deny it for too long already too thank my hon friend the member for north ayrshire and arran patricia gibson for secure this debate and for her unflinche commitment and support for waspi woman everywhere this have be an important issue for for number of year in fact it be so important to that choose to raise it as matter of urgency during my maiden speech in this chamber in when highlight the scandalous situation experience by these woman there be an estimate million waspi woman although have die since the start of the campaign include my constituent margaret meikle and morag syne those woman die without receive the compensation apology or justice that they rightly deserve there be about waspi woman in ayr carrick and cumnock to some people they be just number to every single one of they be an individual daughter and possibly mother grandmother wife sister an auntie carer and friend they be important they matter they have all have their hope expectation and aspiration of retire at with reasonable pension crush by lack of notice of change to their pension age by the government each and every one of they deserve to be treat properly and the grave injustice they have suffer should be put right by the government since my first contact with waspi constituent nine year ago many have write to and meet express their frustration deal with burnout care for elderly relative and miss out on time with partner child and grandchild all in the context of cost of living crisis many have also comment on the lack of pension income and have to use saving to survive prevent they from buy clothe and present for their grandchild and seriously restrict any discretionary spending that would have be spend in the local economy above all they be leave with an overwhelming sense of injustice at not be inform of change to their state pension age which have leave they understandably angry and resentful the lack of information and the denial of choice by the government have result in reduce quality of life serious financial loss and sustain damage to their sense of worth mental health and wellbeing my hon friend mention the enormous toll on the mental health and wellbeing of so many of these woman do he agree that that damage have be deliberately make bad by the fact that they almost alone of the million of people who have suffer from grave injustice and miscarriage of justice have have government who claim to be look after they publicly say we will ignore the result of an independent inquiry and deny the fact that any injustice have be carry out against they could not agree more with my hon friend how much might it cost to properly compensate the waspi woman in march the times estimate that to pay they the ombudsman paltry offer of between and would cost between billion and billion the waspi campaign be call for about three time as which would put the cost to the public purse at about billion it may be slightly more or slightly less but by not pay the waspi woman the pension they rightly deserve to date the government have already save billion in only the last eight month of accord to the office for national statistics uk government total expenditure be billion the compensation demand by the waspi woman be insignificant in that context the fail covid test and trace system in england cost billion pay to former talktalk chief executive and wife of conservative member dido harding for no reason whatsoever that amount alone would have pay full compensation to all the waspi woman to date as many as million woman be give the news that their state pension age be to increase from to just as they be about to retire so too late for they to do any proper financial planning many be already in ill health or bad and other have take early retirement with plan to get by until age when they think they would receive their state pension and look forward to reasonably comfortable retirement this be long tale of suffering misery and injustice not only for the woman affect but endure by their immediate and extended family it have be allow to go on for far too long it need to be conclude without further delay therefore call on the government to apologise unreservedly and to act to compensate woman affect by the bad pension scandal in history they must do so immediately before even more waspi woman die without have receive an apology compensation or justice urge the dwp to bring proposal to parliament for financial redress scheme for all member to debate and vote on include mechanism for mp to put forward alternative before the summer recess in those proposal the government should set out eligibility for the compensation scheme the amount of compensation to be pay the administration of the scheme and the timeframe for compensation to be pay waspi woman everywhere have campaign to right this injustice but may pay tribute to the tireless work of frances brown and lynn paterson the local waspi co ordinator from my area who have give their good and their life to obtain compensation for all the other waspi woman in our area and across the country thank they for their support it be an honour to follow the hon member for ayr carrick and cumnock allan dorans and thank the hon member for north ayrshire and arran patricia gibson for secure this important debate be rather disappointed that she use the opportunity to bash the labour party with all due respect point out that have we win the election in my right hon friend the members for hayes and harlington john mcdonnell and for islington north jeremy corbyn can confirm this this matter would have be settle have the snp not lose seat to the conservatives we would not be have this debate we would have deliver justice for the waspi woman and for the miner who be desperate to have pension justice want to extend my personal appreciation to the dedicated woman of the waspi campaign who have tirelessly campaign for nearly decade for fair and timely compensation for woman affect by the dwp maladministration do not recognise the criticism of labour members think that have raise waspi case on occasion in different debate and remember how many member be in their place remember westminster hall debate where member be sit on the window sill because it be so crowded every effort have be make to bring this injustice to the attention of the public and the government thank the sunderland durham and hartlepool waspi group who have work diligently and assiduously in my constituency have have the pleasure of meeting and work with those remarkable woman over the past decade and be full of admiration for their dedication and selflessness there be around waspi woman in my constituency who have be wait patiently for the final ombudsman report which be publish in march be appal that the dwp refuse to comply with the report recommendation this unprecedented response undermine the ombudsman authority and credibility the library find no other instance of government department reject an ombudsman finding the dwp must own its mistake apologise to the million woman affect and swiftly deliver adequate compensation there be no doubt that the dwp fail to notify woman of their state pension age change and now it deny its wrongdoing as the phso highlight ignore the ombudsman finding set dangerous precedent allow government departments to evade accountability we mp have responsibility to ensure that the government establish mechanism for redress the urgency be critical do not want to rehearse the statistic because they have be give many time but the woman be die in number because of the age profile in march the secretary of state promise an update but as far as be aware we be still wait for that the government standard delay tactic evident in case such as the mineworker pension scheme the contaminate blood scandal the post office horizon scandal and now the waspi woman must end the impact of the state pension age rise on those woman with little or no notice be profound the appg on state pension inequality for woman chair by my hon friend the member for salford and eccles rebecca long bailey highlight that woman feel worthless ignore and disempowere lead to severe mental health issue and in some very sad case suicide there be no doubt that the dwp maladministration have cause immense stress the evidence align that with the phso definition of level emotional injustice warrant compensation of up to as member have say the government have save billion by accelerate the raising of the woman state pension age compensate waspi woman by up to would cost around billion that be fraction of the saving accrue by the treasury to date recently meet my constituent denise mckenna and kathleen kerr who illustrate the severe impact this issue have have both start work at kathy join the british army and denise start work at the inland revenue in their late they take early retirement due to ill health they carefully manage their finance they have only few year they think until they reach their retirement as married couple who be both waspi woman kathy and denise suffer double whammy an immense financial loss due to the pension age change they receive no write notification of the change the five year delay to their pension mean that they lose in excess of they exhaust their life saving and be force to sell their home surely that be not how we respect those who have work and serve our country many waspi woman like denise and kathy make significant life decision without know that their pension age have increase that injustice demand financial redress woman be force to return to work despite disability and condition that highlight this government disconnect from the reality that these woman face former pensions minister the hon member for hexham guy opperman now transport minister responsible for bus suggest in westminster hall debate in that the affected woman should retrain and take up it be greet with similar reaction at the time that ignore the challenge of re enter the labour market and the disproportionate care give responsibility that these woman bear successive government have fail these woman it be our responsibility and the duty of this parliament to right this wrong sadly it be too late for the over waspi woman who have pass away since the campaign start in but we can not delay any long compensation be not just financial reimbursement but recognition of the harm inflict on these woman my appeal to the minister be this heed the call for justice and acknowledge the emotional and psychological harm cause by the government decision and the dwp maladministration as representative of thousand of woman it be our responsibility as member of parliament to ensure that justice be serve it be considerable pleasure to follow my friend the hon member for easington grahame morris we have work together on many issue over the year remember the debate in westminster hall that he mention and the revulsion when it be say that waspi woman should go on apprenticeship scheme be delighted that my hon friend the member for north ayrshire and arran patricia gibson and the backbench business committee have secure this debate it be worth reflect that the parliamentary and health service ombudsman have ask parliament to find remedy for the waspi woman who have suffer injustice it strongly doubt that the dwp will provide remedy let we just consider that the ombudsman have proclaim that maladministration have take place so it would be fair to expect the dwp to accept its moral and ethical responsibility to the woman affect and their elect parliamentarian and to bring forward effective remedy for that maladministration the report be publish couple of month ago but we have the interim report three year ago so the report be not surprise to any of we here the government know this day be come and must now act with haste to bring forward remedy for the waspi woman the government if they be mean to be anything be suppose to be root in fairness recognise their duty to citizen and when judgment be make that there have be maladministration they should respond in an appropriate and timely manner it be damn indictment that the ombudsman have no faith in the government to provide the remedy and have therefore take the unprecedented step of ask parliament to intervene it mean that we parliamentarian must in effect do the government job for they collectively member from right across the chamber have to rise to that challenge all of we here every single member of parliament have responsibility to their constituent many of whom will be look at we today whether from the gallery or on television wait for we to take action we can not have any more procrastination we need to take action let we remind ourselves that there be million waspi bear woman who be affect by change to the state pension age they suffer from poor communication which adversely affect the life choice that they be force to make this issue must be resolve by this parliament it must not be kick down the road until after the election the scottish national party westminster group commission report on potential financial remedy for waspi woman which be present to the uk government as long ago as june but which sadly be ignore if the government need advice they might want to turn to landman economics which produce that report parliament have of course debate this issue many time in the chamber and in westminster hall and the work of the appg should be commend on november open an snp opposition day debate on motion call on the government to improve transitional arrangement for woman bear on or after april who be adversely affect by the acceleration in the increase in the state pension age there be vote at the end of the debate member vote for the motion and none against the voting be cross party five conservative members vote for the motion if the tory government have accept that proposition we would not be here now why do the government ignore that instruction from parliament do my right hon friend not think that that be regrettably typical of the attitude of this uk government to the waspi woman the government hope that they will simply go away if they be ignore that be heap insult on indignity and it be wholly unacceptable the life of constituent such as mine have be destroy by the uk government inability to see what need to be do they deserve so much well from this government of course they do we have hear today from great many member in all part of the house about the or waspi woman more in some case in every constituency we have all hear the heartbreaking story of those who simply could not afford to carry on working and who be not give adequate notice of the increase in the state pension age it be an injustice and it need to be deal with should emphasise that this be never about the equalisation of man and woman pensionable age we all accept that there have to be such an equalisation however some of we will remember the cridland review of pension cridland say that there should be no more than one year increase in anyone pensionable age in every decade the problem be the pace of the increase in woman pensionable age let we also remember that this be about woman who pay national insurance in anticipation of receive pension and who be hit with the bombshell that their pension be be defer in many case by up to six year with in some case only month write notice state pension should be see as right but the government change the term and condition of that right without consult those who be pay their pension some time ago thank to freedom of information request we learn that the department for work and pensions do not begin write to woman bear between april and april until april and do not complete the process until february despite the need to inform woman about change to legislation date back to the government do not start the formal notification period for year what be they do where be the responsibility to the woman affect take year to begin inform woman that pension that they have pay into be be defer be quite something can we imagine the outcry if private pension provider behave in such way there would be an outcry in this house and no doubt there would be legal action give that entitlement to state pension be earn through national insurance contribution with many woman have make contribution for more than year that be quite staggering woman bear on april who under the previous legislation would have retire on april would have receive letter from the dwp in january with the bombshell that she would not get pension until july think about receive such letter you think you be on the verge of retirement and the rug have be pull from under you no wonder there be need to pay compensation to those affect the new pensionable age be three year and three month later than such an individual might have expect with just month notice what she think be contract that she have with the government be simply rip up the implication of all this have leave woman with no time to put alternative plan in place despite many have look forward to imminent retirement then we have the issue of the change supposedly be phase in gradually we be deal with three month increase in woman pensionable age for each calendar month that pass it be simply scandalous that woman pensionable age be rise so rapidly that be why today we have the moral duty to immediately correct wrong this have go on for too long as have be say sadly waspi woman have die since the campaign start another die every minute and number have no doubt die while we have be have this afternoon debate we have the ombudsman report and we have to put in place remedy now the dwp have to play part in bring forward proposal for financial redress scheme before the summer recess and those proposal must be amendable most importantly any scheme must clear the parliamentary process before the summer recess we do not have long less than nine week of parliamentary time this mean that within day have respect for the minister as she know the dwp must come forward with proposal will the minister respond appropriately to that demand it be now nearly two month since the ombudsman report and we can not wait any long so many of the waspi woman who have suffer as result of maladministration should have receive financial remedy which be why we must now take action and this must not be party political matter it ought to be about all of we recognise wrong that need to be right and appeal to member from right across the chamber to recognise our responsibility to do the right thing let we make sure that the waspi woman get an apology and get compensation this have be timely and very powerful debate we have hear some incredible contribution from many member who have share first hand knowledge of their constituent and the way they have be treat be very move by what be say by the hon member for easington grahame morris about the couple in his constituency who have basically lose everything because of this whole sorry saga some million woman have be affect by this issue and many have now die possibly over this debate would not be happen if it be not for the bravery of the waspi woman campaigner over many year have always be impress by their verve and the demand that they bring to any occasion and by their dressing appropriately in suffragette colour one can not miss they at any event or meet anywhere we should pay tribute to all of they for the incredible work that they have put into draw attention to this grotesque injustice over many year they deserve to know that they will get an answer that will give they some comfort and hope in the last decade only three or four ombudsman report have go to parliament because the government have refuse to acknowledge or accept they the whole principle of the ombudsman be that it be an independent non political office that make recommendation on the basis of the evidence it have collect it go to great deal of trouble to collect evidence and choose sample of case to give holistic view on the situation so the very least we can do be expect that the government will undertake to act on the report be very impressed by the work and pensions committee evidence session on may be impress by the campaign detail by the evidence it present and by the commendable speed with which it respond to the committee and to the all party parliamentary group on state pension inequality for woman chair by the hon member for waveney peter aldous and my hon friend the member for salford and eccles rebecca long bailey we need to thank the campaign for its work the waspi woman come up during the last two general election campaign and let we be absolutely clear that my right hon friend the member for hayes and harlington john mcdonnell and commit that an incoming labour government would have deal with this issue compensate the waspi woman and accept that grotesque injustice have be do that would have be expensive but as try to explain in my interview with andrew neil it would only have redress an injustice it would not have be throw government money around willy nilly treat people properly be moral issue many would say that parliament be now confront with problem not of its own making and that it have to do something to try to resolve the issue well we be always confront with problem not of our own making we do not make well hope we do not make problem but we have to deal with they in the case of the problem that have recently come before we the injustice of the mineworker pension scheme the injustice of freeze the pension rate for overseas pensioner the horizon scandal and the enormous question of the contaminated blood scandal we be here to resolve those problem and secure justice for people who have suffer grotesque injustice people look to parliament to achieve that we have the report the information and the knowledge we understand the injustice that have be do the poverty that many people have be force into and the insult when person in their find that they can not access their pension and be tell by dwp job adviser to take an apprenticeship which be ludicrous they know full well that they be not go to get it those people feel sense of hurt they believe that they do the right thing and they believe that the government and the dwp have do the wrong thing by they rebecca hilsenrath answer question of the work and pensions committee evidence session on whether information should have be make well available which obviously it should have be by say that service should be user focused she think that the information system be poor and that the advertising of it be poor clearly many very well informed people be not aware of the dangerous situation they be move into with their own personal finance there be an opportunity to resolve this and it could be resolve with statement from the government today undertake that by july when understand the summer recess start they will put forward proposal for simple compensation scheme base on formula as the chair of work and pensions committee set out to ensure that compensation can be speedily pay if compensation be individualised we would clearly have to deal with several million individual case which would take very long time what we need be justice and it be up to this parliament to deliver that justice for woman who work so hard to deliver the service from which we have all benefit we owe it to they and we can do it now it be pleasure to follow my good friend and comrade the right hon member for islington north jeremy corbyn congratulate my hon friend the member for north ayrshire and arran patricia gibson on securing and lead this debate she start with some very hard truth that have to be hear include the simple fact that we would not be debate this subject today if the government have allocate their own time to discuss the report and how we go forward which be exactly what should have happen be get good at the game of anticipate what be in the government prepared text we will no doubt be tell that the pension change be make for the great cause of equality that if we punish people equally it be great stride towards equality the simple and brutal dynamic be however that woman bear in the have be discriminate against throughout their life it start with grow up and not have cheque book or be able to hire television unless they have the express permission of their father or husband there be the expectation that if they fall pregnant they be to leave their employment and give up their career to raise child as my hon friend the member for livingston hannah bardell say if they be divorce the expectation of the financial settlement be that their pensionable right would be there at the age of the discrimination against bear woman have be go on for long time to say to those woman with very little notice as if it be an episode of who want to be millionaire we do want to give you that we want you to work an additional six year in the name of equality be frankly ludicrous we need to recognise the injustice and discrimination that many bear woman suffer throughout their life we also need to recognise that this change be not about some magical equality formula it be to make woman work long we need to have serious debate about the huge difference between someone work age expectancy and their life expectancy because they be two entirely different thing particularly for woman whose work involve hugely physical task as in the care sector and the nhs my hon friend be make an important point want to go back to the cridland report remember meet cridland at the time on the issue of healthy life expectancy to be tell that the dwp do not hold such information because that be the responsibility of the department of health and social care show the dysfunctionality and the lack of concern about people healthy life my right hon friend be right have always be tell that there be join up government well be often tell that by member on the government benches but all too often hon member on the opposition benches meet that with the surprised and quizzical look that just get from the hon member for wirral south alison mcgovern on the labour front bench when say that my right hon friend the member for ross skye and lochaber ian blackford be correct that we need to consider such thing in future because someone particularly woman who work in physical environment such as the care sector the nhs or any other line of work will not be able to work until they be that be brutal dynamic several hon member include my good friend the hon member for easington grahame morris and my right hon friend the member for ross skye and lochaber mention the former pensions minister who rise to his foot in the great westminster hall debate that be pack to the rafter and say that one of the solution be for woman to apply for an apprenticeship in new phase of the economy those be the most ludicrous comment that have hear have hear many ludicrous comment in my time in this place but that be no on the list pay tribute to the waspi campaigner in glasgow and lanarkshire particularly the great kathy mcdonald and rosie dickson who have campaign rigorously and vigorously over the last few year include after the election when many people think that this issue be finish and be not get anywhere those waspi campaigner the bear woman who have campaign consistently on this issue for the last five year in particular should be commend in this house this parliament have issue to grapple with next week we will discuss the report on infected blood we will have piece of legislation rightly so for the postmaster and we have the issue before we agree with everyone who have speak so far that we need to conclude this matter before the summer recess so that we can all say as parliament that we know and accept the cost then we can debate matter go forward be very clear about justice for the bear woman the infected blood community and the postmaster those group should not be blame for lack of investment in public infrastructure the country badly need those thing and we should not use those wonderful campaigner as an excuse mention the great rosie dickson she contact early with quote from one of my favourite political philosopher the great jimmy reid who hail from govan in my glasgow south west constituency he say from the very depth of my being challenge the right of any man or any group of man in business or in government to tell fellow human being that he or she be expendable the view of many bear woman be that this government have view they as expendable want to send clear message to the house on their behalf as many of we have today that they be not expendable they deserve justice if justice be delay the price tag will go up hope the government recognise that hope the ministers will confirm today that we will see action and justice for those wonderful brave bear woman have live this campaign for about year as have number of other hon member today we have hear unanimity from speaker from all political party across the house unless we can get some action quickly despair of what parliamentary procedure be leave to we do not want to go back to swing the mace about again but something need to happen fairly quickly because anger be build up in the chamber outside and among the waspi woman do not share the view of some hon member about the equalisation of pension support the equalisation of pension but not on the basis of the retirement age for woman increase think we be enter period when we would be reduce the age that man have to work until so we would equalise pension that way the argument then be about whether the economy could afford it the reason be try to equalise pension by reduce man work age be largely for working class people in many of our city the difference between the life expectancy of the rich and the poor be something like year we be tell then that life expectancy would be continuously improve but it have stagnate many people do not work in sedentary role so as we increase the retirement age it be now go up to and beyond they will work until they drop that be not acceptable particularly in the economy that we have where we could redistribute wealth low people retirement age and give they decent pension be involve in design the scheme propose in we commission lord bryn davies who be one of the most respected pension expert in the country and work for two year with waspi and the different group to design the scheme my commentary on the proposal by the ombudsman reflect some of the work that be do we look at straightforward scheme go into individual case would take decade to be frank so we look at flat rate scheme for everybody base on an average loss of week that result in an average payment of which be lot of money we cost it at more than billion which seem lot of money at the time but it be less than third of what the government save by increase the pension age for these woman in addition we look at different option should we pay it over four or five year period and reduce the cost to billion year when say during the debate that this be large amount of money somebody say that we have just pay out billion to bail out the bank when they have cripple the economy then we go into and covid hit we the hon member for south west bedfordshire andrew selous make some excellent point but he ask we how we could fund decent pension and the requisite compensation look up the figure as percentage of gdp the uk spend on state pension and pension benefit in italy the figure be in france it be in denmark it be the oecd average be by any measure we be mile adrift also look at what have be provide in tax cut to some of the wealthy in our country since it be billion look at how much have be give in corporate welfare benefit and again it be billion therefore although it sound like lot of money at the time in the context of fairness it be the right amount that be why the ombudsman offer of between and be derisory it have to be more than that the reason for have flat rate compensation scheme be for ease of administration and would recommend that wholeheartedly we have hear today about the individual hardship that people have endure we can not allow that to go on any far which be why this scheme must be expedite the ombudsman report and be accountable to the public administration and constitutional affairs committee on which serve we have consider each of the report as they have come forward we be critical about the delay that be take place so we impress on the ombudsman the urgency of the situation when we get the report back we find that it have at least accept that there have be an injustice and that there need to be compensation scheme we wait with bated breath for the secretary of state to announce at least the timescale and the timetable for that compensation scheme but all we hear be that the government would go away and consider it that be week ago pacac write to the secretary of state and ask for timetable stress the urgency of the matter because exactly as member have say people be die some people can not wait because they either will literally not be here any more or they be live in poverty and hardship we receive reply this week the secretary of state say that he would be bring forward statement in due course what that mean be nothing it be meaningless as committee we have agree to write again to say that that be unacceptable and that we need clear timetable in which this matter will be address and proposal bring forward that we can vote on and if necessary amend in this house if this parliament be sovereign and the government be accountable to this house believe that there be majority an overwhelming majority of member who will vote for compensation scheme that be readily accessible and also at level that reflect the hardship that people have suffer and the scale that most member would want to see as we go into general election the issue will not go away the waspi woman and their campaign will not go away people have express admiration for that campaign which be not just impressive it be terrify unless proposal be bring forward it will become an election issue think people vote will stand or fall in many constituency on the basis of the decision come out of all the political party voter will however blame the government the most because there be an opportunity now as other have say to make statement by the recess with timetable for implementation we could almost certainly agree the funding we look at how to raise the fund some could be borrow but the government normally have contingency for legal liability this be legal liability we have the opportunity to act now and urge the government to wake up and listen to what the whole house be say if today response be not satisfactory we will be back next week and if necessary every day until the recess until we get some sense out of the government it be pleasure as ever to follow another expert speech from the right hon member for hayes and harlington john mcdonnell commend my hon friend the member for north ayrshire and arran patricia gibson for secure the debate and my hon friend the member for kilmarnock and loudoun alan brown for take forward his bill both be real waspi champion and they make fierce campaigning duo on the front bench the state pension be rely upon by more than million of our citizen and certainty about when they will be able to claim it be pivotal for many more who be plan retirement and make huge decision base on that date we now know that when change to pension impact bear woman be be implement those change be not communicate properly many receive no direct communication at all other find out what be to happen too late have already make major decision that they would not have make have they know the change that be ahead communicate change to the state pension must be do well in advance and use all mean possible that do not happen with the waspi woman that be the nub of what the ombudsman find and it be what the government have to acknowledge as the ombudsman say an apology be due and compensation be owe parliament have be ask to take the lead on this and so the first and most important point that member have be make unanimously be that the government must hurry up and deliver it have already be long and arduous road to justice for the waspi woman it have take far too long and as have be note tragically too many will not get to the end of that road with we once again pay tribute to my constituent june miller key figure in establish our cumbernauld waspi group it be an honour to work alongside she and the local team as they be establish their campaign group host public meeting and run waspi surgery june march outside parliament with her waspi colleague from across the uk in october she make the case forcefully eloquently and patiently typical of the waspi campaign it be heartbreake that june be one of more than waspi woman to have die during the lifetime of the campaign that be why the most important message that we be convey today be that the government must move swiftly the work and pensions committee be absolutely right let we have proposal before the summer and as have be say couple of time those proposal must be amenable to amendment by mps it be parliament specifically that have be task with this not just government ministers as other have say there be no excuse the government should have see this come month and year ago the big point of contention be clearly the level of compensation while the ombudsman speak of level compensation most of we know that that reflect only the handful of case that the phso look at and almost certainly not the range of experience face by the waspi woman as whole my view be that such level of compensation feel significantly understate and be not fair reflection of the impact that the maladministration have on many of my constituent know that lot of hon member feel the same way therefore join other in commend the work of the all party parliamentary group which have argue that fair compensation mean level compensation because of the profound devastating or irreversible impact that the change have the point that that go way beyond financial impact and cause extraordinary emotional physical and psychological distress be consistent with the experience of waspi woman in cumbernauld kilsyth and kirkintilloch east also think that there be considerable merit in system that allow for high payment for those who suffer the short notice and face the long delay until their state pension age there will be waspi case that have not be examine by the ombudsman where compensation for direct financial loss be absolutely appropriate but again speed be important general payment for lack of notice should not be delay but thereafter do not see why claim for additional award for direct loss could not also be proceed with and consider in that there would be parallel with the windrush scheme where concern about the slowness of decision making lead to pressure from the home affairs committee for provisional or interim payment to claimant which thankfully be implement it be possible to have speedy payment for all and thereafter to go on and have detailed consideration of individual claimant another perhaps even more important lesson from windrush that do not think have be mention in this debate be that surely it would be wise for the compensation scheme to be run independently of the dwp and preferably independently of government altogether that be surely sensible if people be to have faith in it particularly when the department be prove so reluctant even to recognise that it have do anything wrong the perception of lack of independence certainly hinder the windrush compensation scheme and undermine people confidence in come forward to claim from it we should learn lesson from that finally on another day we will need to come back to the question of why it have take so long to get here do not mean any of this as criticism of the ombudsman or its staff it be more to do with the resource available to they and the parameter within which they have to work however whether with waspi windrush horizon infect blood or any other recent scandal time and again the mechanism for put right injustice and government maladministration seem to have be slow and sometimes even more of hindrance than help we need to revisit and overhaul how such failing be examine and remedied as we have hear justice delay be justice deny and that have certainly be the case for too many waspi woman in conclusion our constituent be not ask for the earth they never have be they be quite realistic about what can and can not be do and now they have the backing of the ombudsman the government need to recognise to apologise and to compensate and more than anything they need to do so urgently it be pleasure to speak today on behalf of the waspi woman every right hon and hon member who have speak in this debate have do so with heartfelt desire on behalf of their constituent and wish to do the same lot have be say but want to offer northern ireland perspective in the debate it unite the voice of those in this chamber when we speak on behalf of all our constituent within the united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland in northern ireland there be some waspi woman lady who deserve to have their pension but have be deny it tragically many have pass away in my strangford constituency we have approximately who should qualify as waspi woman although be the only northern ireland mp in the chamber now know that many of my colleague from other party have speak on this issue have well attend debate on march it be unfortunate that in that debate member only have about three minute in today debate at least member have have at least or perhaps even minute depend on when they come in ask question on the same issue on march in this chamber and again on may this debate be vital but and say this almost as question be it necessary hon member will say what do you mean be it necessary that almost contradiction but it be not the debate be not necessary the problem be crystal clear and undisputed at least by every person who have speak that be the case we should recognise this and grant the compensation in timely manner that be what the debate be about that be what we be ask for and everyone from all political party be unite on that we have the ombudsman report why then do we need to debate this issue again today if the problem and the solution be clear and expect that be the way see it congratulate the hon member for north ayrshire and arran patricia gibson as often do on set the scene know this issue have be passion of hers in this house also congratulate the hon member for kilmarnock and loudoun alan brown who will sum up for the snp at the end of the debate on his bill which have sign along with other the government could grasp that bill push it through and have it all do by july also do not know until this debate when the right hon member for hayes and harlington john mcdonnell speak that he and the right hon member for islington north jeremy corbyn who be not in his place have bill or process ready to bring forward would it be onerous or unrighteous of to say that perhaps that be something that could be use as text to move it forward right hon and hon member have bring lot of idea forward say this with great respect to the minister who be an honest man and gentleman and who do his job well the government be drag their heel as we have say on multiple occasion each day that pass mean that another lady have be wrong my constituent and other be miss out not simply on justice that be reason enough but on the quality of life that should have be theirs party across the chamber have come together to reiterate that but the power for change and the reason change be not come forward lie with the government that be the way see it on the many occasion have speak about the waspi lady have give the example of constituent of mine who be school cleaner everybody constituency have school cleaner like she that lady clean the school toilet until she be with arthritis and pain she spend most of her time on her knee it be always good to spend time on your knee as long as it be in prayer but that lady spend her time on her knee on floor with cold tile and she end up with arthritis and pain that be the issue she focus on the end date when she could stop put herself in pain and start enjoy her retirement without have to worry about turn her heating on because she could rely on her pension that lady never have sick day in year boy what record she turn up every day for year to clean the toilet at the school she deserve credit for that we know that lady generation well there be no shame in it but she feel shame about take benefit and she work hard for the entitlement to well earn pension which she think she be get that pension be about nine month or year ahead of she when suddenly it turn out to be six year ahead of she what really there need to be action that be do to she without so much as by your leave or financial plan hear people say well they know about the plan but many of my waspi woman do not know at all can not remember which member say that of people do not know about their financial option my constituent option be to continue work on her knee scrub with tear in her eye and in pain which mean that she have to apply for sick pay this government do that to she and say that with respect to the minister that be the reason why it happen the ombudsman say that it be not right to do that to my constituent and that we should compensate that honourable lady and the other waspi woman in my constituency as well as all those across this great united kingdom we be no far forward in give she that entitlement meanwhile those extra year of hard labour have take their toll physically and emotionally genuinely have no word to say to that lady other than be sorry continually ask for compensation for you and the other be sorry that the government get it wrong and be sorry that it still be not rectify do not want to heap coal of fire upon the shoulder or the head of the minister but the responsibility for this lie with the government my word to the government be clear and direct and have plenty of they but they can all be sum up in few word do the right thing and do it now that be my request the government know their obligation understand their duty and accept the rationale behind that so all we need now be the action to make this happen we have see how quickly compensation can be sort so why be we in this position where we be no far forward and do the right thing seem not to be priority it need to be priority it need to be priority today follow this debate it need to be priority before the summer recess whenever that come that be the target date that be ask the minister to aim for because we need to give hope to our constituent and those waspi woman who have resolutely courageously and in many case physically withstand the test of time believe that compensation should be grant in the form of lump sum to help pay off any outstanding loan or debt and there should then be an enhanced payment for clear and set period of time we have hear story today of people who make their plan on the ground of the pension plan that they have only to find out that they have be disempowere and all the plan they have make have to be scrap they lose their house their job and their health what be we do to help those people the hon gentleman be make sensitive and excellent speech do he agree that this be not only about the loss of pension from the age of the fact that people have not be able to plan and so forth for many woman their occupational pension will have be tie to the date of their retirement or their state pension it vary lot depend on what the pension scheme be some woman have lose thousand upon thousand of pound as result of this decision thank the hon lady for that intervention the occupational pension be another factor it be incorporate in the plan that these people have make for their future it be wonderful how you make plan for the future and then the government scupper it on you all of sudden these lady have find themselves in difficult circumstance so believe it be necessary to have compensation scheme in place to help all of those lady will conclude with one more comment ever mindful of the time limit that we all indicate we would keep to understand the magnitude of such scheme but we be able to get support quickly to household across the uk for cost of living and energy payment something that commend the government on that can be do on many occasion we just need the commitment to make it happen know that the government have the ability and the capacity to roll out all these scheme so along with almost every other colleague in this house today sincerely ask that we prioritise find compensation formula and roll it out these woman our constituent brave courageous woman deserve no less and we must ensure that we give they no less call the snp spokesman it be pleasure to follow the hon member for strangford jim shannon like everybody else commend my hon friend the member for north ayrshire and arran patricia gibson for secure this debate and for all the work she have do in speak up for million affected woman for all these year also commend all the other member who have speak in today debate there have be powerful speech and powerful but harrowing story of how various constituent have be affect by the increase in the state pension age for woman there be back bench consensus today that the government have drag their heel that response be now long overdue and that compensation be due we have also disprove the nonsense that woman should have know about the increase in their state pension age financial adviser and lawyer do not even know as my hon friend the member for livingston hannah bardell say divorce be grant on the basis of woman access their pension at the age of some labour back benchers today have rightly criticise the government for their lack of action and for their policy elsewhere but then somehow bristle at snp speaker call out the silence of their own front benchers we be willing to work cross party but we also need pressure for action if we do not call out what we think be wrongdoing we be not do the right thing for the waspi woman who we be all here to represent today we would not be in this chamber today debate this issue as parliamentarian if not for fantastic campaigner such as ayrshire waspi group cunninghame waspi group waspi in my constituency waspi scotland and of course the wide waspi organisation pay tribute to my constituent ann hammell who bring the issue to my attention in my early period as an mp in again it be hearten to hear so many mp commend their own local campaigner turn to the ombudsman report there be few key aspect the finding and confirmation of maladministration in the dwp compensation to be pay and government failure will explore each in turn the ombudsman have not only confirm that it believe that the dwp be guilty of maladministration but have express outright anger at the belligerence of the department and by default this tory government welcome the robust comment of the ombudsman chief executive rebecca hilsenrath who have state the uk national ombudsman have make finding of failing by dwp in this case and have rule that the woman affect be owe compensation dwp have clearly indicate that it will refuse to comply this be unacceptable agree with she it beggar belief that in the government be suddenly pretend that this ombudsman report be bolt out of the blue and very complex it be three year since the ombudsman find that the dwp be guilty of maladministration because of its lack of communication about increase the state pension age it be scandalous that the ombudsman be actually have to ask parliament to find way to create mechanism to provide compensation for those affect if the ombudsman do not trust the uk government to do the right thing do not trust they either unfortunately at the moment also do not trust the official opposition who have be too quiet on the report finding to date that be why have bring forward my private member bill the state pension age compensation bill which set out compensation framework we need to remember that the prime minister be the chancellor who boast about set up the furlough scheme in couple of week for the covid lockdown clearly if there be government will there be way so why do the government not have the will to get on with compensation scheme for the waspi woman in the ombudsman report compensation be unfortunately set at just level which feel wrong for the majority of the million woman affect it feel like smack in the face compensation of between and be an inadequate maximum payout the waspi appg recommend level for the worst affected and my private member bill take similar approach have suggest framework that follow the clear logic that those affect by the big increase in state pension age while in effect have the short notice period should receive the most compensation as for the million woman who have have to wait five year or more to access their pension it would be absurd to award they just level compensation of less than in my framework they would be allocate compensation at phso level which be about those who have not have to wait quite as long but who be still badly affect in some case will get level and with minority on low level thank member from across the house who have sign my private member bill this subject have be debate in parliament for nine year and for over nine year these woman and their family have be fight for justice it be tragic that as have be repeat many time the woman be die at rate of year or one waspi woman every minute and they be not get the justice they deserve this underline that it be critical that parliament take action now however there have not even be suggestion on the way forward from the official opposition they should be put proposal to the government and say what they would do if they be in government if their solution be accept by the government they could then claim credit for get compensation over the line instead we have hear nothing from the opposition zip apart from weasel word about listen hope the shadow minister the hon member for wirral south alison mcgovern will change my mind and offer proposal during she sum up but there be bad example last week in the scottish parliament when labour mp sit on their hand when it come to vote for compensation for the waspi woman they have the temerity to get photograph take with the campaigner and to tell they that they back they but then they go into the chamber in holyrood sit on their hand and actively abstain which be disgraceful as say hope the shadow minister will bring forward proposal but would like she and the minister respond to the debate to consider the constituent story we have hear today and few of mine as well lynn be exhaust after work for year in the nhs and agree to take early retirement at but she find out on her last day of work that it would be year before she get the state pension not the five year she anticipate nancy be widow at the age of while she be work part time which be clearly traumatic emotionally and financially she have suffer umpteen chronic health condition while care for her parent but be force to take nhs bank work just to survive lesley who have sometimes work three job to make end meet be carer for her partner when he have cancer carer for her dad when he have cancer and have period of travel to southampton every weekend to visit her aunt superwoman effort that would exhaust anybody it be little wonder that she take early retirement age only to discover later that she have to wait six year long than she think to access her pension do not dare tell those woman and other like they that they need to wait long for justice these be woman who do not have maternity right back in the day they be pay less than man and be more likely to work part time and their private pension be small if they have they in reality pension age equalisation have far disadvantage those woman especially as they be tell that to get full pension they have to pay extra ni contribution it be time that the right thing be do and that right thing be fair and fast compensation now call the shadow minister too thank the backbench business committee for make time for this important debate from the limited time that it have to allocate have listen carefully to every contribution number of member include my hon friend the member for gower tonia antoniazzi the hon member for livingston hannah bardell for glasgow south west chris stephens and for strangford jim shannon and the right hon member for ross skye and lochaber ian blackford talk about the experience of woman who have be part of this campaign or who describe to their mp what they have be through some member include my hon friend the members for wirral west margaret greenwood and for salford and eccles rebecca long bailey also mention the context of those experience and the systematic sexism that woman have face other members describe the detail of the ombudsman report and the possibility for redress include the hon member for waveney peter aldous for north norfolk duncan baker for south west bedfordshire andrew selous for north east fife wendy chamberlain and for cumbernauld kilsyth and kirkintilloch east stuart mcdonald and my right hon friend the members for knowsley sir george howarth and for east ham sir stephen timms who chair the work and pensions committee we have have thorough and extensive debate this afternoon recognise and pay tribute to the woman who have join we today or who have watch the debate from afar as say it have be full discussion the ombudsman report be important and have serious lesson for the government it also relate the serious consequence for the woman who experience the event that it describe the ombudsman have rightly say that it be for the government to respond and that parliament should consider the report finding as we have hear the work and pensions committee have begin that process and will hear from ministers next week believe will follow those proceeding carefully in march the secretary of state say in this chamber that he would proceed without undue delay and on monday he say that he still require an appropriate amount of time to consider the ombudsman conclusion my first question be about time for all the reason that member have set out it would be helpful if the minister set out timescale and tell we crucially what advice have be provide to the government and what analysis be under way in the department it would be helpful to know what the process be in the absence of that further update from the government labour position remain the same as it be when the ombudsman report be publish we be all wait for the government to respond so will not diverge from what my hon friend and colleague the member for leicester west liz kendall say six week ago although understand the political reason why the snp want to put pressure on be not the minister and do not have access to the information and advice that the government have therefore call on the government to respond without delay issue around change to the state pension have span multiple parliaments but remind everybody that the moment that spark the woman against state pension inequality campaign be the pensions act in which the then chancellor george osborne decide to accelerate state pension age increase with very little notice time describe accurately by the right hon member for ross skye and lochaber george osborne comment that that probably save more money than anything else we ve do make angry at the time as imagine it anger many other woman during that period labour table amendment that would have ensure that proper notice be give so that woman could plan for their retirement that would have go some way to deal with the problem have the government even now do an analysis of why they press ahead with the change despite the clear consequence in any case the ombudsman begin investigate how change to the state pension age be communicate in that year the high court rule that the ombudsman could not recommend change to the state pension itself or the reimbursement of lost pension because those issue have be decide on by parliament as many member have mention the ombudsman report state that internal research from dwp in find that about of the woman affect know about the change to the state pension age be that still the government assessment now that the report have be publish or be they look for other evidence what be their assessment of the total number of woman who would receive compensation under the different option put forward by the ombudsman how many of they be the poor pensioner and how many of they be on pension credit how many of those affect have already retire or sadly pass away give that the government know as member have describe that there be problem communicate the change to the state pension age wonder about that moment in and precisely what advice be provide to ministers at the time let we think about the principle here the government be commit to provide year notice of future change to the state pension age in the pensions commission find that that should be year notice it be important for the government to state why there be that difference we all want result of this debate to be guarantee that information about any future change to the state pension age will be timely and helpful for the individual affect we have problem with the pension dashboard what be go on with pension information crucially will the response to the ombudsman report when it come contain list of the lesson that the department be learn and measure that it be put in place the ombudsman take the rare decision to ask parliament to intervene on this issue because it have doubt as many member have describe about whether the department would provide remedy in the light of those concern and to aid parliament with its work ask again as we do previously for the government to commit to lay out all relevant information and place it in the library have some experience of deal with historical injustice and must impress on the minister that my experience from deal with the hillsborough disaster be that open access to the evidence be extremely important hope that in the spirit of the hillsborough law the government will come forward and put that information before we so that we can see it look forward to hear what the minister have to say do not imagine that we will get response today to the ombudsman report but will he at least set out the timetable for response because we can not move on until we have that hope that the woman affect by all these change include those change expedite in who be bear just after the second world war can soon hear the government response as many have mention they be bear long before woman place at work and woman full right to their own earning and pension be secure this place have always be slow when it come to woman right in more than year after woman could first come here just of mp be woman yet woman of that generation build the platform that we all stand on they fight to change thing for woman and the least they deserve be response from the government to the ombudsman report it be pleasure to serve under your chairmanship madam deputy speaker be grateful to the backbench business committee for find the time to host the debate we have hear from member on both side of the house and from across the whole country who have speak both eloquently and passionately on behalf of their constituent know that many in the public gallery as well as those listen remotely who will be take close scrutinise interest in this matter be always conscious that it be on behalf of those woman that we be deliberate pay tribute to those in my own constituency who have campaign long and hard and meet down the year even in recent week readily acknowledge the strength of feeling on both side of the house the government be listen what colleague have have to say during the debate which have hear will be take fully into consideration in the oral statement make to the house on march the secretary of state explain that the ombudsman report be complex with the event that it consider span about year he commit to provide an update to the house once we have consider the report finding official report march vol understand the wide interest in this matter across the chamber we be all unite in want resolution the ombudsman investigation have take five year and produce substantial report that require careful and consider scrutiny it be only right that we should give it that scrutiny the government be give full and proper consideration to the ombudsman report and that work be ongoing the issue to be decide be significant and complex and require detailed understanding and deliberation would like to remind the house of the government strong track record of support pensioner in we will spend more than billion on benefit for pensioner that be of gdp and include spend on the state pension which be forecast to be about billion in we be honour the triple lock have increase the basic and new state pension by in april in the full yearly amount of the basic state pension will be high in cash term than it be in we now have few pensioner in absolute poverty after housing cost be grateful to the minister for share those figure be aware that people be bit sceptical about statistic someone say in the select committee the other day that of all statistic be make up be not sure if that be true can just advise the minister of this we have the poor pensioner in europe just of our uk gdp be spend on state pension and pension benefit compare with in italy in france in spain and an oecd average of his suggestion that our pensioner be generously provide for do not stand up to scrutiny be grateful for that contribution hear the hon gentleman make those comment in his speech as well be try to remember the precise figure but can not so will write to he more generally this point be often make to by pension expert the international number be not directly comparable because each welfare system be entirely different particularly in the public private split in how pension system be fund to say that one percentage be generous while another percentage be not generous be not quite the point shall write to he none the less because think that he will find the fine print useful for his future contribution the minister say that the government be to give the ombudsman report serious consideration before they decide what to do how long do he think that process will take if may will answer that in moment because will now turn back to the report in lay the report before parliament the ombudsman bring matter to the house attention make it clear that parliament have role in respond to the report the government intend to engage fully and constructively with parliament view this debate as crucial part of that process remind the house about what the ombudsman report say and indeed do not say the ombudsman have look not at the decision to equalise the state pension age but rather at how that decision be communicate by the dwp that be important to understand as the motion call on the government to deliver prompt compensation to woman bear in the who have their state pension age raise importantly the ombudsman report hinge on the department decision over narrow period between and and their effect on individual notification the ombudsman have not find that woman have directly lose out financially as result dwp action the report state we do not find that it the dwp communication result in they suffer direct financial loss the final report do not say that all woman bear in the will have be adversely impact as many woman be aware that the state pension age have change the stage report find that between and the dwp communication of change to the state pension age reflect the standard that the ombudsman would expect it to meet that report also confirm that accurate information about change to the state pension age be publicly available in leaflet through the dwp pension education campaign and dwp agency and on its website however when consider the department action between august and december the ombudsman come to the view that they result in bear woman receive individual notice later than they might have do have different decision be make welcome the wide range contribution from member on behalf of their constituent the ombudsman clearly say that the dwp be guilty of maladministration during the period of to do the minister accept the finding that the dwp be guilty of maladministration and should put its hand up to that recognise that there will be an appetite from some opposition members for the government to respond item by item to different part of the ombudsman report but the government wish to respond in full when they have reach conclusion from their deliberation will not go down the path that the hon gentleman seek to take along some of the detailed commentary from members today illustrate the interlock consideration at play depend on how each member of parliament respond to the report the fact that so many have speak today demonstrate the importance of this issue many parliamentary activity be worth note to understand how they fit in the chair of the work and pensions committee the right hon member for east ham sir stephen timms mention the evidence session hold last week and the recommendation that he have make to the department which read after he mention it so have only just see it late last month be able to meet the hon member for salford and eccles rebecca long bailey and my hon friend the member for waveney peter aldous the chair and co chair of the all party parliamentary group to discuss our initial view of the report and what step they intend to pursue to take further evidence be look forward to see what they have to say have note the evidence give last week to the select committee also take careful note of what occur in the scottish parliament the many view express so far provide valuable input to the ongoing deliberation let come to the question from the hon member for north east fife wendy chamberlain about the write answer she receive will take my glass off to read this because the print be very small and not clear in november alongside other interested party the dwp receive copy of the phso revise provisional view on injustice which be stage two of the inquiry and remedy which be stage three for comment the dwp respond with its comment in january the department be notify by the phso on march that the final report would be receive on march at meeting between the permanent secretary and the ombudsman note that the hon lady write question be about the final report as oppose to the preliminary report it be about the draft report but be grateful for that clarity member raise question about change to the state pension age as say the ombudsman report be clear that it can not consider the impact of change in the law on state pension age the change be set out in primary legislation and as such be agree by parliament the announcement in of the equalisation of the state pension age address long stand inequality between man and woman the change be also about maintain the right balance between the sustainability of the state pension fairness between generation

parliament from the until april the state pension age be for woman and for man the decision to equalise the state pension age for man and woman date back to it be right to address long stand inequality between man and woman state pension age the report of the pensions commission in recommend that the state pension age should increase in stag way to in the three decade follow the completion of equalisation in broad consensus on that be achieve largely due to the commission evidence base which show that state pension age should follow increase in life expectancy to help ensure the affordability and sustainability of the state pension legislation pass in introduce series of increase start with state pension age of between and and end with an increase to between and as have be observe the pensions act accelerate the equalisation of woman state pension age by month and bring forward the increase in man and woman state pension age to by five and half year relative to the previous timetable the change in the act occur follow public call for evidence and extensive debate in parliament during the passage of the act parliament legislate for concession worth billion the concession reduce the propose increase in state pension age for more than man and woman and mean that no woman see their state pension age change by more than month relative to the timetable set by the pensions act will the minister give way sorry will during the course of the ombudsman investigation state pension age change be consider by the court in and the high court and court of appeal respectively find no fault with the action of dwp the court make clear that under successive government date back to the action take be entirely lawful and do not discriminate on any ground during those proceeding the court of appeal hold that the high court be entitle to conclude as fact that there have be adequate and reasonable notification give by the publicity campaign implement by the department over number of year we recognise the importance of provide information in good time about the state pension age to help individual to plan for their retirement since the government have use range of method to inform people about the increase in state pension age include the provision of detailed and personalised information the method have include leaflet explain the legislative change pension education campaign press advertising and direct mailing exercise to million of people people have be able to request personalised state pension information since the we do not know the timing of the general election possibly november but maybe later but it be likely that we will have only about sitting week between now and general election can impress on the minister to take back to his fellow ministers that we need the proposal rapidly in those week and certainly before recess if we be to get viable scheme through parliament be happy to confirm that will take that message back have hear it clearly today understand the point about the work and pensions committee finding too the right hon gentleman will have hear the secretary of state and in oral question on monday say that we wish to have no undue delay that remain the case recognise that people be frustrate by that phrase but it be an accurate phrase we do not wish undue delay as keep say it be complex issue it be not just matter of tick box it need to be get right and we understand all the ramification and option that be open to we between april and february the dwp provide more than million personalised state pension statement and it continue to do so as well as issue letter to the million woman and man bear in the notify they of the state pension age increase the dwp send around million automatic state pension forecast between and which include leaflet explain that the state pension age for woman be increase as have outline the government recognise the importance of this issue the ombudsman report have be lay before parliament and we have be invite to take view and engage with this issue today be one part of that we will listen to the view of the house with great seriousness the report be currently be give active and extensive consideration within the department by and by the secretary of state we will seek to provide further update without as say undue delay and hope to give the issue the airing that it deserve as soon as that be practically possible let end the debate by make few observation the motion garner unanimous support from back bench speaker which express the will of the house but unfortunately the contribution from the labour and government front benches do not reflect that cross party consensus justice be too important to be deny for fear of the price tag remind the house that the parliamentary and health service ombudsman conclude that ignore the finding of the report would create an unprecedented constitutional gap in the protection of the right of citizen who have be fail by public body in respect of ensure access to justice that constitutional gap present danger to our very democracy what we have see today be an apparent refusal from the government front bench to accept the report finding while disappointingly the labour front bench continue to refuse to make any commitment to the waspi woman that be why labour members of the scottish parliament be order to abstain on call for compensation last week note that the tone of the response from the labour front bench to this crisis for it be crisis be entirely different from the tone of labour front benchers when they speak of the infected blood scandal and the horizon calamity it be disappointing that the uk government response take we no far forward and it be disappointing that the same apply to the labour front bench we have hear about consider engage reflect what we have not hear about be any action or any timeframe for action it seem that the cosy do nothing consensus between the front benches continue which mean that the campaign for justice for waspi woman despite be vindicate by the ombudsman must also continue question put and agree to resolve that this house note the finding of the parliamentary and health service ombudsman report on women state pension age and call on the government to deliver prompt compensation to woman bear in the who have their state pension age raise

woman in recent week we have speak about the infected blood scandal and more recently the post office scandal tonight we be go to debate another scandal the mineworker pension scheme scandal some of the united kingdom be on top of old coalmine so have hop that of this chamber would be full tonight but it be not maybe there be few reason for that the issue have be debate lot in this place both before and since come into parliament so maybe certain mp be get bit feed up of say the same old thing but we will keep try start in the pit in the go to work at sutton colliery in north nottinghamshire with my dad paul anderson he be rope fitter and go to work with he underground have good time work with my dad and my friend at sutton colliery which be family pit it be small coalmine with small coal seam and difficult condition it be family pit where brother work with their brother dad and grandad it be proper community but like all coalmine there be tragedy underground at sutton colliery in there be methane explosion and sadly five man lose their life know some of the friend family and descendant of the people who die then go on to cresswell colliery in north derbyshire to do my coalface training it be another family pit where again man work with their son and brother work with their brother and it too be ting with tragedy in there be fire at cresswell colliery and sadly man and boy lose their life the mine rescuer have to seal the pit off underground to save the colliery so that it could produce coal again they seal off some of the old working and leave the man inbye because there be no chance of save they but when they take the stop down just few month later the man be on the other side some of they have scratch their name into the wall it be terrible and this sort of thing be hard to explain to people who have not work down coalmine it be very tight knit community and people work in difficult condition have just over year of work in awful condition but my grandad charlie have year down the coalmine and finish up at new hucknall colliery it would have be year but he take break between and and go to fight hitler then he come back and go straight back down the pit the follow week when he finish in the pit in he get tankard certificate quid and meagre pension imagine that as miner we know about the risk underground when we go down the pit every day since mining start in this country in the over man woman and child have die in the coalmine so we know the risk we know there be always chance that something might happen but these be the risk we take the miner take these risk for simple reason to earn wage put food on the table and make sure their kid be well dressed in when be still work in the pit they be privatised in my area it be rj budge mining that take over the pit at that time big bone of contention be what be go to happen with the mps or the mineworker pension scheme it be probably one of the rich pension scheme in the world at that time and be worth hundred of million if not billion in today money it be always accept that there would be split in favour of the miner when the then government sit around the table with the trustee to make an offer to guarantee the mineworker pension scheme we automatically surmise that there would be split which would have be fair but at the last minute it end up be and depend on who you talk to whether it be the trustee at the time or the mining organisation involve in campaigning nobody can get to the bottom of it take it or leave it deal the government at the time never undertake proper financial risk assessment or have actuarial advice on the split we can never get to the bottom of that it be simple take it or leave it when be work at the pit with my friend we never really have say in this can not remember any man work with underground be happy with the split because we know how rich the pension fund be thirty year on from successive labour and conservative governments have not pay single penny into the pension scheme which be cash cow they have take billion out of the scheme some mining group say the sum be near to billion but will take the figure have here in just the last three year the government have take more than million out of the surplus which be lot of money this be miner money in effect the treasury guarantee be an insurance scheme it guarantee to make up the shortfall and pay the bonus and so on if there be not surplus but can not think of any insurance scheme anywhere in this country or the world that have never have to pay out in year not penny have come from the treasury or the taxpayer to top up the mineworker pension scheme think that be bit of scandal and so do my mining community think we all agree we have three hour debate in this chamber last thursday in which over member contribute and think there be unanimity on the unfairness and injustice of the surplus share arrangement when the hon gentleman be deputy chairman of the conservative party the former prime minister boris johnson visit the coalfield in mansfield and give certain undertaking and assurance to reform the surplus share arrangement so that the miner would get their money back as former deputy chairman of the conservative party be the hon gentleman aware of any discussion after the general election on implement those promise when be deputy chairman of the conservative party and even before that speak to the current prime minister who be then chancellor of the exchequer and to be fair he look into the scheme and the surplus arrangement one discussion at the time be that perhaps the whole pension scheme could be give back to the miner with the government not act as guarantor at all would have hop that we could come together little in this debate and not try to score political point be here for my community of mineworker for my dad for my brother in law and for the people of ashfield who toil underground will not get involve in silly petty politic in this debate the and be difficult time for the mining community pit be close people be lose their job and man be out of work and we see the injustice of this surplus arrangement with the government of the day there be other people try to rip off the miner these be the spivs the financial adviser who rock up in their new rovers they be call in at miner welfare club and work man club knock on door and turn up these man in shiny suit have never do day work in their life and they be con the miner my dad be one of they by tell they that the mineworker pension be no good and be not make money the miner transfer their money to these private pension scheme and they be rip off fortunately just few year later many of these miner include my dad be able to claim compensation against these shark and put their money back in the mps which be probably one of the good pension scheme in the world we talk lot in this place about level up and back in stand on manifesto of level up to be fair to the government ashfield have have lot of money about million we have have two new school rebuild nearly million in future high street funding and town funding and extra money for police and cctv for which be incredibly grateful to the government but real levelling up put more money into people pocket and let they decide how to spend it can not think of fair way of level up than give these miner their widow and their family little more money in their pocket know what great champion the hon gentleman have be for his community and the rest of nottinghamshire and indeed nationally on this issue be in many of the meeting that he describe early such as with the prime minister when he be chancellor and with other ministers the hon gentleman be miner in manton in my constituency he have show his lamp many time and tell many story motion lapse standing order no motion make and question propose that this house do now mann want to make point about the split and the surplus do the hon gentleman share my frustration about that at time we have believe that some real progress have be make whether on the split or the surplus and there have be chance to renegotiate to get some incremental progress to put some money back into the pocket of those widow and to make that change over time we could have be in well position now if not for those who really do not want to negotiate and who want all or nothing immediately the hon gentleman make some reasonable point to be fair the guarantee scheme have work in that the government have be able to take more risk with the pension fund and it have create high yield the problem that have face as member of parliament deal with certain group be that can not get the group to agree on the good solution or the good way forward that be incredibly frustrating there be still lot of bitterness even year on from the miner strike come from family who be on strike all my family be strike miner but there be still bitterness now when get involve when meet some of the mining group they say keep your nose out we do want scab get involve in our business because come from nottinghamshire that be not the way forward we have to have sensible debate like grown up thousand of ex miner be die each year the pension fund be probably worth billion billion or billion so it be massive pot of money when the last miner die be so be probably one of the last miner and one of the young ex miner leave all the money leave in the scheme will go to the treasury we could give the miner much fair deal and fair split and we could carry out the recommendation of the business energy and industrial strategy committee report to give the miner that money because it will not cost the government anything in year they will get pension pot worth billion of pound as say the way to level up in deprive area such as mine that have suffer job loss have be deskille and have go through the mill over the past or year be to give the miner and their family bit more money feel incredibly proud to stand here and represent the people of ashfield and the mining community of ashfield the widow and ex miner some of whom be friend use to work down the pit with all we want from the government be bit of justice we be not ask for much we be ask for bit more money for the miner and their family in this great country of our before the last miner die be incredibly grateful to speak in the debate which be the second on miner pension in week we have good debate about miner and mining community last week be grateful to the hon member for ashfield lee anderson who speak passionately about his and his family experience he will know from his first hand experience which be share by many of my constituent that mining be dirty and dangerous but it be well respected he be right to speak about how dangerous it be we have several memorial across barnsley to those man who go to work and do not come home in barnsley man work down the pit our community be build on coal and it power nation it be year since thousand of man be force to go out on strike to defend their industry battle that sadly they lose it be simply not right that decade later they be still fight for their pension in be pleased to campaign for and secure the beis committee report into the mineworker pension scheme it be cross party report and it very clearly conclude that the government should not be in the business of profit from miner pension some billion have be take by the government to date that have rise by million since that report the average miner be on pension of just week and widow be on lot less meet man in my constituency few week ago on week have raise this issue in this place dozen of time have meet with ministers and shadow ministers go to the treasury few week ago to make the case again could not be clear about my commitment to the issue indeed will continue to advocate not just on miner pension but on miner health and support for our coalfield community more broadly my constituency of barnsley east be yet to receive any levelling up funding in miner be in the scheme the government financial risk to the scheme be in permanent decline yet it be cost the same as it do year ago that deal be do without any actuarial advice as the government admit to some year ago in answer to write parliamentary question hold the last adjournment debate on this subject in in that debate speak about how man claim miner pension today that figure be sadly less than we need justice for the miner before it be too late it be pleasure to serve under your chairmanship madam deputy speaker pay tribute to the hon member for ashfield lee anderson with whom have work closely over many year it be clear that his personal experience and long track record put he in the good position to continue to fight the good fight on behalf of not just his constituent but people who work in this sector be strike by his willingness to engage across the political spectrum find time for the hon member for barnsley east stephanie peacock to contribute she have an impressive track record of raise the issue have secure beis debate and other debate respond to by former ministers while be only freshly return as minister in the whirlwind of mere three week have be lobby by many people on the subject include my hon friend the members for bolsover mark fletcher for mansfield ben bradley for bassetlaw brendan clarke smith and for sedgefield paul howell and the hon member for easington grahame morris have be increase my parliamentary question response rate recognise the importance of the scheme and the strong feeling on the different option that have be and could be consider thank the minister for give way he be be very generous which be completely in character do not think any of we want pat on the back what we want be the issue resolve in common with the previous debate about the woman against state pension inequality campaign the issue be the age demographic my poor mother be many miner and their widow be come to the end we need to resolve this in the interest of justice and the beis committee report from april give we that opportunity as say recognise the strength of feeling and want to set out the government position on where there be opportunity to look far it be right that we acknowledge the hard work of coalminer over decade and their contribution to national prosperity which be exactly what the hon member for ashfield do so well since privatisation the government have recognise the need to support former coalfield area through initiative such as the coalfield regeneration trust over the past year successive government have invest over billion in former coalfield area the uk government be commit to level up across the whole of the united kingdom to ensure that no community be leave behind and invest in place that need it most include former coalfield community again credit the hon member for ashfield on how hard he work to secure the significant levelling up fund that have reach his constituency be grateful to the minister for give way again do not mean to be nuisance promise it be all very well for ashfield which have have million or million easington have have nothing my community of horden which bid for levelling up funding be in the top most deprived community in the country hope the minister be not suggest that billion of the miner money can legitimately be use by the government for other purpose such as regeneration in coalfield or other area that be their money if the reserve investment fund alone be redistribute it would give they almost month directly in their pocket can confirm that the hon member be never nuisance but again would reflect on the ability to lobby and secure levelling up fund and those who do well be directly benefit their community specifically this involve range of project include the million to deliver two capital regeneration project that will revitalise town centre include in ashfield the coal authority have be work with public and private sector partner for number of year to develop the use of heat in water contain in the former coal mining infrastructure as resource for heat network and large space heating current scheme be heat multiple home and business at discount of at least below prevail market rate for heat the coal authority estimate that of property be locate on former coal mining area mine water heat can offer homegrown and sustainable source of heat boost local economy and also create more local green job the government commitment to mining community be also demonstrate through the continue guarantee give to the mineworker pension scheme the scheme remain significant undertaking it have more than member pay pension at an annual cost of over million and have asset in excess of billion the scheme be manage by the trustee the government role be as guarantor my official meet the trustee to discuss the operation of the scheme regularly when the scheme be set up in member contribute no more than per week and benefit be relatively small from contribution and benefit be link to member salary and british coal make up the difference at privatisation the government take on the guarantor role previously play by british coal the scheme have surplus in and of this surplus be use to enhance member pension immediately that be an interesting chronology will the minister inform the house when the government stop pay into the scheme there be substantial increase when superannuation come in in match by british coal be it not correct that after the government make no contribution to the contribution holiday the hon member be passionate to speed ahead urge he to be little more patient we be explore all of these point and be get to they fear not the other be payable to the guarantor the government of the day agree to leave their share of surplus in the scheme as the investment reserve this act as buffer against future deficit the arrangement for share scheme surplus be agree between the trustee and the government in their role as guarantor to the mineworkers pension scheme in at that time all party believe the equal sharing of surplus to be fair agreement that predate all of we the guarantee ensure that member guarantee pension include inflation increase will always be pay and member total pension include bonus pension will not fall in cash term the scheme have be success and it be to the credit of the scheme trustee that they have invest in such way as to enable those return and we know as politician that decision on pension and pension reserve be not always as successful as this but it be the guarantee that make high return possible without the guarantee the trustee would have to invest far more cautiously so as to avoid lose money and risk be unable to meet scheme obligation in former role in the dwp have also be respond to debate where pension scheme have fail and we can not lose sight of that we have see this scenario with many other pension scheme few equivalent scheme have be able to generate surplus and few still be able to use those surplus to improve member benefit the presence of the guarantee allow the trustee to invest in way that target high return and generate bonus for member the trustee acknowledge the importance of the guarantee and the ability to generate the bonus that it create the scheme website state that typical member pension today be around high in real term than it would have be have they receive only their actual earn pension up to privatisation welcome this success and believe that it would be unwise to tamper with such fruitful arrangement acknowledge the select committee report and its recommendation however like my predecessor can not agree to implement they this be question of balance and recognise that there be strongly hold different viewpoint but like the trustee the government recognise the importance of the guarantee and be committed to it all scheme member will continue to receive their full pension entitlement that commitment be unwavering implement the report recommendation would shift the balance of risk to the taxpayer in way that the government consider would be disproportionate the minister at the time of the report meet the trustee follow publication of the report to hear their view she set out that any change to the surplus sharing arrangement would need the trustee agreement to give up the guarantee which the trustee decline the minister then invite the trustee to put forward any further proposal to change to surplus sharing emphasise that the guarantee would need to form part of any discussion to date none have be receive the government have agree some scheme change though include additional protection for bonus pension and change to mitigate potential unfair impact of recent inflation change stress that we be also open to further suggestion be pleased to have work with the trustee and the then minister on the issue of bonus appreciate the argument that today minister be make and no one underestimate how important the guarantee be but do he acknowledge that member of the mineworker pension scheme have to date pay billion for that guarantee absolutely but nobody know how this would go when the deal be strike at the time the deal be strike it be deem to be fair but like many other pension scheme it could easily have go the other way if it have we would not now be have debate to say well we need to excuse the taxpayer it be fair deal at the time and we seek to ensure that it continue to overdeliver the minister say that it be fair deal at the time be work down the pit at the time assure he that nobody work with thought that it be fair deal we think that it be force upon the trustee it be take it or leave it it have prove not to have be fair deal as say when the last miner die billion of pound will go to the treasury we have receive surplus in return do the minister think that be fair yes or no that presume the investment will continue to return at the rate they have they could just as easily go the other way which suspect be why the trustee be reluctant to release the guarantee however to be clear remain open to explore option for improvement to the scheme and would welcome any suggestion that the trustee wish to make the door be firmly open future outcome be not know any market volatility could impact future scheme valuation and the guarantee will provide even great value should market condition make it hard to generate return if there be deficit in the future member will still see their guarantee pension increase by rpi and will continue to receive bonus pension to ensure that their total pension do not fall in cash term if the investment reserve that the government leave in the scheme to act as buffer be exhausted fund from the government will be find to ensure that payment continue to be make to scheme member to be absolutely clear that commitment from the government be unwavering question put and agree to house adjourn
