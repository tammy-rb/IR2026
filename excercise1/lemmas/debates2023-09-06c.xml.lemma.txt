have to ask have the right hon gentleman ask very sensible and serious question for which thank he obviously can not answer some element of his question in public but any additional funding require by the psni would be submit through an establish process we be currently at the very beginning of that establish process so it would not be right to pre empt that the government be clear that security be paramount and our focus remain on the item set out it will move on but it be currently specialist support and expertise in response to the late assessment thank the secretary of state for that response in his early answer he refer to the psni senior leadership team for the record my party fully support the psni in its impartial implementation of police across all community in northern ireland but we be in crisis situation not only with the data breach but with the loss of confidence internally within the psni although it be the responsibility of the policing board to make appointment do he agree that perhaps what we need now in the absence of chief constable be for someone to be bring in who have the experience and leadership credential that be need in the interim period pende the appointment of new chief constable to take control of this situation thank the right hon gentleman for that question the way he pose it and the point behind it the senior management team be strong and effective unit and the policing board have lot on its plate at this point in time believe it have even launch review into how the policing board itself operate be quite sure that

right on that time and again we be ask to intervene and every time we be ask to intervene that be call for direct rule we do not intend to get into direct rule it would be far well if local decision be take by locally accountable executive the government have show their commitment to support the people of northern ireland through the recent increase in the cost of living in the absence of an executive we all accept that one be absolutely necessary will my hon friend assure that the government will continue to intervene where necessary for the people of northern ireland we will continue to

pacific partnership this be unique opportunity in all of the world include right across the eu and be convinced that he and and we all should make the most of it restoration of power sharing what step his department be take to help restore power sharing in northern ireland thank the hon gentleman for his question and it be good to see he in his place our focus remain on deliver for the people of northern ireland who expect and deserve locally elect decision maker to address the issue that matter to they continue to engage regularly with all party leader and speak to they very regularly indeed thank the secretary of state for his answer but the lack of functioning devolve government in northern ireland mean that there be direct consequence for its people as be evidence by the high waiting list in the uk which would not be tolerate elsewhere in the absence of restoration of power sharing there need to be plan what be it obviously all my energy be spend on try to resolve the issue in order to allow the dup to come back to stormont and get the executive up and run there be myriad option available if we be to go down different route but be afraid none of they be as ideal as stormont function and the institution of the belfast good friday agreement all be stand up there be big opportunity over the come week to restore the northern ireland executive do the secretary of state agree with that key to that be the uk dublin and the eu listen hard to the concern of the dup about implementation of the windsor agreement thank the former secretary of state for that question he be absolutely right we have be listen in great detail to the right hon member for lagan valley sir jeffrey donaldson the dup leader and his team of negotiator over the course of the summer we have have very detailed negotiation and believe we be home in on what be actually require that might well mean we need conversation elsewhere but let we see where we get to in the course of the next couple of day call the shadow secretary of state the windsor framework which be agree seven month ago be great achievement but it be also intend to enable the restoration of power sharing in northern ireland that have not happen what be the government plan the secretary of state refer to the conversation he be have but what be the plan to get stormont back up and run sincerely welcome the right hon gentleman to his place and thank he for his question currently there be issue with one particular political party we be talk to that party on very regular basis at this point in time those talk have move forward substantially but he would have to check in with the dup leadership to see if be correct just because the right hon gentleman can not see that do not mean that it be not happen one thing have learn as have say many time from this dispatch box be that just because talk be be hold in confidential manner do not mean that they be not take place and move forward the secretary of state know that there be concern in the unionist community about unfettered access for northern ireland business trade with great britain the government say last month in the border target operating model that they be commit to that access as we all be and that these arrangement will be enshrine and far strengthen in domestic legislation can he tell the house when that legislation will be introduce hopefully in very short order dependent on make sure we have get it exactly right so it answer the question and allow stormont and the executive to re form postal communications customs what step he be take to help ensure that postal communication between britain and northern ireland be deliver without custom declaration under the windsor framework send parcel to friend and family in northern ireland will be as smooth and easy as it be today remove any burdensome paperwork cost or delay northern ireland consumer will be able to order from business in the rest of the uk and receive good in the post as they do now without customs process or burdensome cost this will maintain consumer choice for british good in northern ireland business send good to other business will use our new green lane number of constituent and consumer have contact to highlight that many ebay or amazon provider will no long ship to northern ireland as they state that they can not afford the enhance fee demonstrate that northern ireland continue to be treat differently it be cost small business and individual the ability to shop around what step can the minister take to revisit the framework with our eu counterpart to ensure free and fair trade throughout the united kingdom that be clear and easy to follow for all business under the protocol as it be all parcel would have need to complete full international custom process believe that the supplier to whom the hon gentleman refer will be make their plan under the protocol as it be under the windsor framework parcel to consumer will not be subject to those burdensome process he remind we all that we need to redouble our effort to communicate to supplier the message that they will be able to take advantage of new green lane and supply to consumer in northern ireland it be subject close to my heart and can see that it be extremely close to his too public finances what step his department be take to ensure the sustainability of northern ireland public finance the northern ireland budget no bill be progress through parliament and be due to be debate in the other house next week the secretary of state have use his power to request information and advice from the northern ireland civil service on measure that could generate revenue and improve the sustainability of public finance thank my hon friend for his answer congratulate he and the secretary of state on their anniversary and pay tribute to they for all they have do in the past year some have suggest that we could reform the barnett formula to address the sustainability of public finance in northern ireland but do my hon friend agree that that be not silver bullet and that trade off will need to be make to fund public service be extremely grateful to my hon friend for his question this be very important point although we will remain open to discuss proposal put to we by the northern ireland party it would not be silver bullet to reform the barnett formula an executive will still need to make trade off when they decide to spend scarce resource negotiation between the welsh government and the treasury on fiscal framework which include an adjustment to the barnett formula take place over seven year so with the good will in the world it be not an issue that can be solve overnight what we need be function executive and we stand ready to work with that executive in the meantime we will continue to engage with the northern ireland civil service on range of measure that could improve fiscal sustainability let welcome the shadow minister early year service be vital for child to reach their potential but they be underfunde and at risk in northern ireland northern ireland be the only part of the uk without childcare strategy accord to the department for education it be delay again because early year face potential significant budget reduction when can hard press family in northern ireland expect the childcare strategy will the minister commit to early year service receive the increase multi year funding that be need to invest in child be glad to welcome the hon lady to her place as she know education be devolve in northern ireland and it be matter for the education department there to take these decision but her point be well make and be confident that when she make her first visit to northern ireland like she will be engage with all party on just such issue electricity generation what recent discussion he have hold with the department for the economy official on electricity generation and supply after september my official and the department for energy security and net zero be engage with the northern ireland department for the economy to understand the fact and to assess any extra requirement energy be devolved matter thank the secretary of state for that response but can he indicate to people who be concerned about recent newspaper speculation on the future of generation and supply in october and beyond that it be secure and that there will be no hiccup or hiatus between now and christmas thank the hon gentleman for his supplementary question northern ireland benefit from be part of the united kingdom with access to electricity from great britain through the interconnector and it also benefit from be part of the single electricity market on the island of ireland and the minister of state work hard to ensure that that be preserve during the uk exit from the european union we be work very closely with all official across government here and in the northern ireland civil service to ensure that the right preparation be in place for the winter veterinary products and horticultural stock what recent assessment he have make of the availability of veterinary product and horticultural stock in northern ireland the cliff edge on veterinary medicine have be remove protect the supply of those medicine in northern ireland through to while we work through sustainable long term solution we be much more optimistic about reach those solution in the context of the windsor framework there will no long be any need for costly phytosanitary certificate for each movement of plant stay in the uk we have pave the way for ban plant specie to move again by the time of the next planting season these be priority case identify by the industry itself and we have progress further case since announce the windsor framework we be work closely with wide range of stakeholder to ensure that gardener farmer and grower can access plant and seed from wide variety of source with regard to veterinary medicine fear the minister sunny optimism may be somewhat misplaced after all his preferred stakeholder mr bernard van goethem the deputy director general for food sustainability have make it abundantly clear to defra and the uk government that the negotiation on this matter be over the deal be do there will be no change to veterinary medicine this mean that insulin will no long be available in northern ireland for animal veterinary medicine for be issue last year will no long be available what will the secretary of state and the minister do about this the hon gentleman have present with information about which be not aware beforehand be certainly happy to look at what have be say but what would say to he be that my right hon friend the prime minister do the deal that no one say could be do that have transform the relationship with the european union and be therefore confident that we will be able to deliver deal on veterinary medicine as we sometimes say do not recognise the information that the hon gentleman have present it be new to and shall be glad to look at it but we will certainly have to deliver deal the ulster farmers union estimate that veterinary medicine could be withdraw from the market in northern ireland unless the windsor framework be fix urge the minister to do that certainly my right hon friend make her point with great clarity of course have make it on an occasion such as this it have be hear by wide range of ministers and be confident that we will be able to redouble our effort to deliver what we need on veterinary medicine prime minister the prime minister be ask engagement welcome everybody back to prime minister question if he will list his official engagement for wednesday september would like to start by congratulate sarina wiegman and the lionesses on their fantastic performance at the world cup we be all incredibly proud of they also know that the whole house will join in send condolence to the family friend and colleague of sergeant graham saville it be testament to his bravery that he die in the line of duty and terrible reminder of the work that the police do every day to keep we safe this morning have meeting with ministerial colleague and other in addition to my duty in this house shall have further such meeting later today the labour party use to claim that it represent working class people but labour ultra low emission zone expansion to greater london will now hammer million of work people with bill of per day or per year do the prime minister agree that it be unacceptable that londoner and those in surround county face this regressive and unacceptable tax and will he do everything that he can to help work people agree with my hon friend it be disappointing that last week the labour leader allow the labour mayor to introduce ulez charge hard work people every time they start their car add to the burden of the cost of living all can say be that while we focus on help hard work family all the labour leader do be punish they we now come to the leader of the opposition join the prime minister in congratulate the lionesses and also in his comment about sergeant saville think we speak for the whole house when we speak on that subject also extend the warm welcome to my hon friend the new labour member for selby and ainsty keir mather he have already make history for the labour party by overturn the large tory majority ever in by election also welcome the hon member for uxbridge and south ruislip steve tuckwell and for somerton and frome sarah dyke the roof of singlewell primary school in gravesend collapse in may thankfully it happen at the weekend and no child be injure the concrete ceiling be deem dangerous and liable to collapse and everyone know that the problem exist in other school yet the prime minister decide to halve the budget for school maintenance just couple of year later do he agree with his education secretary that he should be thank for do good job know how concerned parent child and teacher be and want to start by assure they that the government be do everything that we can to fix this quickly and minimise the disruption to child education we make no apology for act decisively in the face of new information let provide the house with an update on where we be of the school in england the vast majority will not be affect in fact in two third of inspection of suspect school raac reinforce autoclaved aerate concrete be not actually present to tackle the of school that have be affect so far we be assign each school dedicated caseworker and provide extra funding to fix the problem in the majority of case child will attend school as normal and the mitigation take typically just day or week to complete we will do everything we can to help parent support teacher and get child back to normal school life as quickly as possible wood green academy in sandwell be on labour building list in the conservatives scrap it and now child there be in crumble school the head of the national audit office accuse the prime minister of take stick plaster approach the nao report say he cut million the person who run the department for education say the prime minister be personally responsible on monday he leap to his own defence say it be utterly wrong to blame he so why do literally everyone else say it be his fault the professional advice from the technical expert on raac have evolve over time indeed it be something that successive government have deal with date back to as new advice have come forward the government have rightly decisively and swiftly act in the face of that advice the right hon and learn gentleman talk about school budget and what have do but let just walk he through the fact of what that spending review actually do because he bring it no he bring it up so presumably he would like to hear the fact funding for school maintenance and rebuilding will average billion year over this parliament as result of that spending review represent increase on the year before indeed far from cut budget as he allege the amount spend last year be the high in decade that spending review maintain the school rebuilding programme deliver school over decade pace completely consistent with what have happen previously it be worth point out that during the parliamentary debate on that spending review the labour party and he do not raise the issue of raac one single time before he jump on the next political bandwagon he should get his fact straight carmel college in darlington be on labour building list in the conservatives scrap it and now child there be in crumble school on the one hand we have the prime minister say it be nothing to do with he and on the other hand we have the fact there be simple way to clear this up why do he not commit to publish the request from the department for education for the school rebuilding programme and what risk he be warn of before he turn they down the right hon and learn gentleman have now bring up twice the labour school rebuilding programme so let we just look at the fact surround it because we do know the truth about that programme the nao which he have call on review that programme later on and what do it find it find that labour school rebuilding programme exclude of school next what do it find it find that it be one third more expensive than it need to be needlessly waste resource that have go to school the bad bit because now he be talk about the physical condition of school be that that programme allocate fund solely on the basis of ideology with no regard whatsoever to the physical condition of school that be why the independent james review describe the programme as time consume and like the labour party more order we do not want to start off with somebody leave early because that be what will happen well mr speaker conservative members want more so let continue ferryhill school in county durham be on labour building list in the government scrap that and now child there be in crumble school the truth be that this crisis be the inevitable result of year of cut corner botched job and stick plaster politic it be the sort of thing you expect from cowboy builder say that everyone else be wrong and everyone else be to blame and protest that they have do an eff good job even as the ceiling fall in the difference be that in this case the cowboy be run the country be the prime minister not ashame that after year of tory government child be cower under steel support stop their classroom roof from fall in interruption order seriously calm down understand that this be the first session and people be excited to be back at school but we expect well behaviour this be exactly the kind of political opportunism that we have come to expect from captain hindsight here before today he have never once raise this issue with across the dispatch box it be not even worthy of order the same apply to those on the labour benches we will have calm question time go forward because want to hear the question and the answer just like your constituent before today the right hon and learn gentleman never once raise this issue with in parliament it be not even worthy of single mention in his so call landmark speech on education this summer if we have listen to he our kid would have be off school and lock down for long it be as simple as that he talk about year well let we see what have happen when we come into office two third of school be rat good and outstanding now it be we introduce the pupil premium to get more funding to the most disadvantaged pupil today they be more likely to go to university and as result of our reform we now have the good reader in the western world that be what year of education reform get you all of which be oppose by the labour party the prime minister claim to be man of detail but there have be parliamentary question from the opposition on this issue and an opposition day motion let we continue holy family catholic school in bradford be on the labour building list in the government scrap that and now child there too be in crumble order mr holden have hear enough this be the last time make up your mind either you go now or you be quiet for the remainder if you can believe it mr speaker in april this year the education secretary sign contract for refurbishment of her office it have her personal stamp of approval on it it cost can not quite believe million can the prime minister explain to parent whose child be not at school this week why he think that blank cheque for tory minister office be well use of taxpayer money than stop school from collapse what say to parent be that on the receipt of new information we have act decisively to ensure the safety of child and minimise disruption to education as we have lay out and communicate extensively that be the right thing to do also gently point out to the right hon and learn gentleman that while the department for education start this process month ago in spring of last year as far as can tell labour run wales still do not know which school be affect the right hon and learn gentleman bring up funding so again let we look back to what happen in that spending review in that spending review increase the department for education capital budget by to record billion it triple the amount that we spend on child with special educational need and disability it improve the condition of the overlook further education estate and it set the course for per pupil funding to be the high ever crucially it also invest billion to help our pupil recover the lost learning from covid he might remember that because we want pupil learn he want long lockdown just do not think the prime minister get how it all fine out there be at odd with the live experience of million of work people across this country let we go on this be long list in at least six school in essex be on labour building list the government scrap they and now child there be in crumble school the prime minister will not admit that the reason he cut budget and ignore the warning be quite simple just as he think his tax rise be for other family to pay he think his school cut be for other family to endure do that not tell we everything we need to know he be happy to spend million of taxpayer money spruce up tory office and billion to ensure that there be no vat on tory school fee but he will not lift finger when it come to protect other people school other people safety and other people child know that the right hon and learn gentleman come here with prepared script but he have not listen to single fact over six question about the record amount of funding go into school or the incredible reform to education impact the most disadvantaged child in our society record that we be rightly proud of yes we can name the school that be because we be react to information and publish it so that we know where the issue be something that we be still wait for from the welsh government of course the right hon and learn gentleman want to score political point from something that we be deal with in the right and responsible way but note that he have not mention single other thing that have happen since we last meet at the dispatch box he talk about hard work family across britain but what have happen to energy bill down what have happen to inflation down what have happen to small boat crossing down and what have happen to economic growth it have go up the right hon and learn gentleman try time and again to talk down the british economy but thankfully people be not listen his entire economic narrative have be demolish and the conservatives be get on deliver for britain hon member more there will be more call nicola richards against backdrop of improve economic news inflation fall energy bill come down and growth up people in the west midland be disappointed to see that labour run birmingham city council have go bankrupt as sandwell resident and west bromwich mp be no strange to labour incompetence do the prime minister agree that labour have demonstrate yet again that they always run out of other people money my hon friend be exactly right we start by hear how labour in london be charge hard work people with ulez and now we be hear about how labour in birmingham be fail hard work people lose control of taxpayer money and drive their finance into the ground they have bankrupt birmingham we can not let they bankrupt britain we come to the snp leader the public need no reminding that today mark year since the prime minister predecessor the right hon member for south west norfolk elizabeth truss take office upon her speedy departure they will have think that thing be go to get well but unemployment figure be high food price be high mortgage rate be high and economic growth be stagnant when be the prime minister go to get off his backside and do something about it what the hon gentleman fail to point out be the amount of time have sit across the dispatch box from he and his colleague and hear how somehow we be laggard when it come to growth he do not take the opportunity to correct the record now that figure have be publish which demonstrate that in fact we have the fast recovery of any european economy after covid mr speaker you would be forgive for think that the prime minister think everything be all right but let we look at his proposal for winter cost of live package on energy bill his plan be to do nothing on mortgage bill his plan be to do nothing and on food bill his plan be to do nothing when the secretary of state for education say early this week that everyone be do nothing she be refer to the prime minister be she think the hon gentleman be little out of practice because we have pay around half typical family energy bill over the past year that be support worth benefit family in scotland on mortgage the chancellor mortgage charter cover of the mortgage market and ensure that typical mortgage holder can save hundred of pound month on mortgage refinancing on energy thank to the action of this government we be support the hundred of thousand of job in the scottish oil and gas industry secure this country energy supply which he oppose will always do what be right for the people of scotland and it be time the snp do the same be delighted when the prime minister say last year that on his watch we would not lose swathe of farmland to solar application instead rightly argue for solar to be instal on rooftop yet my constituency see constant flow of planning application for solar farm and battery storage plant on food produce land can ask my right hon friend when will his pledge become reality my hon friend make an excellent point solar be one of the cheap form of electricity generation so it be right that we try and see more of it across the country but we do need to protect our most valuable agricultural land so that it can produce food for the nation and increase our food security that be why thank to our change the planning system now set this out explicitly with clear preference for brownfield site of course we want to do more to encourage barn top solar and the department for environment food and rural affairs will be update the house with further information on that policy in due course last week the prime minister state that he be proud of his furlough scheme wonder if he be equally proud of the billion he put on the national debt and the inflation it have cause be he proud of the job lose business close and life crush due to the lockdown be he proud of the increase nhs waiting list premature death and the million young people now need mental health support finally be he proud of the excess death affect every one of our constituency that nobody want to talk about and will he give an undertaking to the british public solemn under taking that they will never be inflict upon they again as the hon gentleman know there be formal inquiry regard covid which will examine all the decision that be make include lockdown and the impact of they but with regard to the furlough scheme be proud that at time of extreme anxiety in the country face an unprecedented situation this government put their arm around the british public to ensure that we protect million job as the report from the office for national statistics show last week those action combine with all the other thing we do to support the economy ensure that we have the fast recovery through the pandemic of any european nation as we be nation of animal lover the conservative government record on animal welfare be source of great pride but sadly too many abuse remain from pet theft the smuggling of puppy and heavily pregnant dog and dog with their ear horrifically crop to the illegal export of horse to europe for slaughter these issue be personal to as veterinary surgeon and to my constituent especially animal theft and livestock worry can the prime minister reassure the house that animal welfare be key government priority and that he will bring forward the necessary legislation to tackle these issue as soon as possible may thank my hon friend for both raise this issue and also his work and expertise in the area be proud that thank to the action that previous government have take on thing like cat microchipping the ivory ban and raise the maximum sentence for animal cruelty to five year we be now the high rank nation on world animal protection animal protection index but we be determined to go even far and deliver on our manifesto commitment individually during the remainder of this parliament the prime minister have say he will lead government of honesty accountability and integrity so can he explain how he be find to have breach the code of conduct this time for fail to declare his wife share in childcare agency that receive monetary boost from measure in his budget if the hon lady read the full transcript and the full finding she will see detailed explanation of what happen which the commissioner describe as minor and inadvertent breach give that at the time be not aware of the policy that be be discuss with and correct it later on and could have correct it with slightly different language she will also know that be not the only person across these dispatch boxes that have have the same thing happen to they may interest the prime minister in proposal from the commission for carbon competitiveness which chair that would deliver net zero cheaply and without deindustrialise our economy it would help british manufacturer face import from country with low energy cost make our export more competitive everywhere and cut fuel duty at home we have strong backing from britain heavy industry and cross party support from the excellent hon member for aberavon stephen kinnock whose name be also on the order paper would the prime minister consider add his name to our list of supporter as well be grateful to my hon friend and the commission for carbon competitiveness for the report that he have work on and highlight and the government be absolutely committed to put in place the necessary policy for uk industry to decarbonise successfully as he will be aware the government recently consult on address carbon leakage in particular with range of potential option we be in the process of consider those response and will issue formal response in due course every year billion of wet wipe go out into our river and ocean and clog up our sewer have be campaign for year to ban plastic in wet wipe the government have finally promise to ban plastic in wet wipe but that be five month ago and there have be nothing since then will the prime minister today finally give date for when that ban will come into force and make difference to our environment or be this another broken promise from his zombie government in the comprehensive plan for water that be publish by the environment secretary in april we confirm our intention to ban wet wipe contain plastic subject as be legally proper to public consultation that consultation will be launch in the come month in autumn this year and know ministers will keep the house update on progress would like to offer some assistance on the small boat issue have my right hon friend consider the incongruity of the fact that uk dinghy manufacturer try to sell into the eu market would have to apply the ce marking custom code and could be stop and check and similar situation apply perversely with simple thing like great britain to northern ireland trade but none of that apply seemingly when huge supersize dangerous cut and shut dinghy be take from turkey across the eu border into bulgaria and greece be my right hon friend as confuse as be by the eu double standard on that matter my hon friend be absolutely right that we must do all we can to stop the boat and tackle illegal migration we know that the export of small boat across part of the european continent be vital element of the smuggling gang tactic that be why specifically we be step up joint operation with turkey raise this with the president when we speak so that we can tackle organise immigration crime and specifically disrupt the supply chain of boat part that be use for these dangerous crossing will continue to keep he update on our progress two year ago in plymouth we lose five people in the bad mass shoot the country have see for decade the government have finally consult on firearm reform but after pressure from shoot group even those sensible measure look like they could be water down will the prime minister bow down to lobbyist from the shooting industry or will he stand with the grieve family and with those in plymouth who want to see no tragedy like this ever happen again with strong gun law know how important this issue be to the hon gentleman follow the horrific shooting in his constituency and my thought be with the family of all those who be kill he will know that firearm be subject to stringent control and rightly so but those control be keep under constant review for example we have take action to improve information sharing between gps and the police to ensure that people be not give access to firearm without their medical condition be check there be statutory guidance that the chief officer of police have be improve so that how people apply for firearm be assess properly include check on social medium on the matter that the hon gentleman specifically raise the home office be in the process of consider response to that consultation and will respond in due course later today be bring forward ten minute rule bill to include the provision of automate external defibrillator in all new housing development of dwelling or more will my right hon friend support that provision and ask his relevant cabinet colleague to engage with to ensure that these life save piece of equipment can become commonplace where they can have the most impact close to people home my hon friend be right to highlight the importance of these lifesave device that be why the national planning policy framework already expect planning policy and decision to promote public safety but it be also why recently the government launch million pound fund that will place around new defibrillator in community across england to help improve equality of access to these lifesave device in the outwood academy riverside free school application in middlesbrough be approve with its first year intake arrive the follow year there have be far intake every year since but there be still no new building have have no response to my request for meeting with the secretary of state but that original intake be destine to spend their entire secondary education in various temporary adapted premise with pupil be shunt around old building talk of level up and address the gcse attainment gap ring hollow will the prime minister and his education secretary get off their derrière and sort this out be happy to ensure that the hon gentleman get an answer to his specific question on that school but more generally be proud of what the government be do in teesside and tees valley to support education not only with the recent announcement of new sixth form but also it be an education investment area receive extra funding and resource that be why we have see standard in reading and math increase considerably and we be determined to keep go the prime minister be aware of how the raac issue have affect school in essex we have high number of school that have be impact he have rightly say today that the government be do everything they can to get child back to school know there be debate on this later today but will he commit to fully fund both the capital and revenue cost associate with get child back into school hope he will commit to meet the leader of essex county council because it be pioneer some great reform right now where it be look to support maintain school as well as academy trust think the government could get some good insight into how we can get child back to school fast and look at the funding model first thank my right hon friend for her constructive engagement with the department pay tribute to her school leader and local authority for everything they be do be happy to give she the reassurance as the chancellor have already say that new funding will be provide to school to deal with this issue to ensure that we can get through this as quickly as possible for my right hon friend constituent and parent and indeed everyone else the department for education be in the process of increase the number of dedicated caseworker from to we have project director regionally on the ground to support and we have more than double the number of survey firm so that we can rapidly over the next few week fully assess all the relevant school and have mitigation plan in place worker in my constituency have watch in frustration as other government have pump investment into decarbonisation while successive tory government have sit on their hand when will the prime minister finally conclude the talk with tata steel can he guarantee that level of investment will match what other european government be do on decarbonisation and will he guarantee that the conclusion will be base on serious engagement comprehensively with the steel union steel be absolutely vital to the uk this matter be of course of interest to the hon gentleman but have also discuss it extensively with my hon friend the member for scunthorpe holly mumby croft and that be because the industry support local job and economic growth conversation with specific company such as tata be ongoing but they be understandably commercially sensitive we share the ambition of secure decarbonised sustainable and competitive future for the industry in this country in the meantime we be support the sector with our energy intensive industry exemption which provide discount energy bill we also have the industrial energy transformation fund which support steel company with their energy bill and the transition through capital to green future two week ago the government announce that the bolsover school bid for sixth form in my constituency have be successful across the country some of school leaver at year old go on to sixth form but in bolsover it be in clowne it be and in shirebrook it be will the prime minister join in thank the redhill academy trust matthew hall the headteacher of bolsover school and all those who have help to bring sixth form to bolsover congratulate redhill and everyone involve with the successful bid for the new sixth form in bolsover be delighted that the bid be successful know that my hon friend share my desire to ensure world class education for every single one of our young people across the country because that be the good way to provide they with the opportunity for well life the new programme of sixth form will deliver that in his constituency and many other across the nation the east have be underfunde in term of transport investment for decade which be mean to be an economic development and connectivity lifeline be now not come anywhere near the northumberland dualle decision have be delay yet again and our regional rail service be still run on outdated infrastructure and roll stock with all that in mind will the prime minister commit the funding to reopen the leamside line from gateshead to county durham to take pressure off the east coast main line and aid economic wellbeing and the movement of passenger and freight service in the north east of england or be level up just rhetoric obviously it would not be right for to comment on specific project but to give the hon gentleman sense of our commitment what can tell he be that in real term since we have spend over third more in central capital investment in northern transport every single year compare with labour last six year in government that be what we be do for northern transportation specifically when it come to reopen and restore railway line where be the first one that we do from ashington to blyth have cheerful question that know my right hon friend the prime minister will find impossible to resist he will be aware of the work that have be do with no uk ambassador for mental health dr alex george to establish early intervention mental health hub across the country we have get the pilot which seem to be lose somewhere between the treasury and the department of health know he will sort that problem out but will he meet dr alex george and to discuss it far these hub will make massive difference in constituency across the country we all know the problem with child and adolescent mental health service and the perverse situation where child and young people have to get progressively bad before they get the treatment they need know that the prime minister will be very supportive of this one mr speaker know that my hon friend be rightly passionate advocate for improve mental health support for young people which be something know we be do and be proud of our record particularly in increase the number of mental health support team who work with school and expand community service know that the department of health and social care be look at the role that early support hub might play in this plan but be happy to meet my hon friend personally to discuss how we can push this through we have hear far too much lately about ministerial posterior and little about prosperity for the country even in these die day of lame duck government will the prime minister stop prevaricate and subscribe to the horizon programme for the sake of vital british science innovation and cancer research this government be invest record sum in british science and research and development because we believe that be critical to bright economic future and spread opportunity our priority and preference be to associate to horizon but we want to make sure that that be on term that be right both for the british taxpayer and for british science and research can commit to the hon lady that we have be extensively involve in discussion hope to be able to conclude those successfully and when we do hope she will be the first to stand up and congratulate the government september be childhood cancer awareness month but it also mark two year since the death of my constituent sophie fairall she be only year old every day in the uk young people will be diagnose with cancer and two of those will not survive those who do face lifetime of side effect from treatment that be just not design for small body when will the prime minister publish childhood cancer action plan thank my hon friend for raise this issue extend my sympathy to her constituent family as she raise she be right to continue campaign in this important area hope she will understand that can not pre empt the specific content of the strategy but can tell she that it will draw on previous work include submission from childhood cancer charity and stakeholder to our recent call for evidence of course we want to hear from they to highlight and get sense of the issue that she specifically raise but will ensure that we write to she to give she sense of the timing every year the snp scottish government mitigate against the cruell of westminster policy by spend million on support hard work family against the brutal bedroom tax and over million on cover the two child benefit cap astonishingly we have learn over the summer that the leader of the opposition be an enthusiastic supporter of these tory cruel welfare policy with turn after turn from the labour party give that the tories and labour be two cheek of the same arse no change no vision and no hope do the prime minister agree that the only way scottish voter can rid themselves order be not go to have we both stand up one of we be go to give way and it will not be let we think about language let we be more temperate and make sure that the pride of this parliament shin through that certainly will not be by use such language be happy to change the offend word to bottom give that the tories and labour be two cheek of the same bottom offer no change no vision and no hope do the prime minister agree that the only way for scottish voter to rid themselves of these heinous policy be to vote for the snp to leave westminster forever obviously not think the thrust of that question be direct at the leader of the opposition rather than and would not want to get in the middle of that what can say be that we want to ensure welfare system that be compassionate and look after the most vulnerable in our society while support into work those who can do so because that be also fair for everyone else and british taxpayer believe that be system that we be achieve right now we be provide people in scotland with thousand of pound of support to help with energy bill and everything else and we will continue to do so point of order on point of order mr speaker in prime minister question the prime minister say that my right hon and learn friend the leader of the opposition have never raise the issue of school building safety before and he specifically mention his education speech early this summer that be categorically untrue wonder if the prime minister want to correct the record my right hon and learn friend mention it as part of that speech in fact it have also be raise by the opposition more than time in this house and be the subject of an opposition day debate in the name of the leader of the opposition in may be sure that the prime minister would not want to give the house the wrong impression the hon lady have raise the point of order quite correctly and have correct the record herself be sure that the prime minister will be notify of the point she have raise we will leave it for now and see what happen on point of order mr speaker may seek your guidance on how hon member may hold energy company to account for their shortcoming with their business customer have be in contact with edf energy for number of month over its multiple failure that have severely impact the circle wonderful community interest company in easterhouse edf multiple failure to correct the mistake be incredibly worrying seek your guidance on how member of this house might be able to use its procedure to hold energy company to account it be disappointing to hear about edf and the way that it be not respond as an experienced member be sure the hon gentleman know that the table office can advise he on the various way that he can pursue edf on this matter on point of order mr speaker during prime minister question the leader of the opposition accuse the prime minister of spend taxpayer money to refurbish tory office believe the right hon and learn member for holborn and st pancras keir starmer be refer to the department for education whitehall government non partisan civil service office will you mr speaker ask the leader of the opposition to come back to correct the record do not think need to be tell by the hon gentleman what have to do he have certainly put it on the record and it will have be hear by the opposition you be right to raise point of order mr stafford but do not start instruct on what need to do we will leave that there at this stage automated external defibrillators housing developments motion for leave to bring in bill standing order no beg to move that leave be give to bring in bill to require the provision of automate external defibrillator in all new housing development of ten dwelling or more to require developer to provide funding for the maintenance of such defibrillator for period of ten year after installation and for connected purpose my bill aim to increase the number of automate external defibrillator by ensure that in future they be an essential feature of every new housing development that be vital step in our endeavour to increase cardiac arrest survival rate crucially my bill also require funding for the continue maintenance of defibrillator first will outline the scope of my bill and its link to important debate that the commons have have on defibrillator secondly will highlight the scientific evidence from around the world that overwhelmingly support the introduction of my bill and will present the important argument for maintenance provision in the bill be grateful to dave bowling community first responder in my constituency for provide the inspiration for the bill which as this speech will demonstrate have the potential to save many life the powerful benefit of defibrillator have already be highlight in parliament my bill follow the defibrillators availability bill bring forward by my hon friend the member for lewes maria caulfield and the automated external defibrillators public access bill bring forward by the hon member for strangford jim shannon additionally the hon member for erith and thamesmead abena oppong asare recently lead an important debate on public access to defibrillator and sponsor of my bill my hon friend the member for stoke on trent north jonathan gullis have be advocate for great uptake of aed through his leadership of the all party parliamentary group on defibrillator also note with appreciation that the leader of the house of commons my right hon friend the member for portsmouth north penny mordaunt be the first mp to call for all mps to complete defibrillator training such discussion and endorsement in parliament be of great value in increase public awareness of defibrillator acknowledge the very positive step that have be take to provide defibrillator in every school and on our high street and the funding that the prime minister mention early but the bill target an area that be yet to be address private residential home it be crucial to note that in the uk most out of hospital cardiac accord to the resuscitation council uk occur in the home however when look at my constituency and other on the defib finder website it be apparent that defibrillator be predominantly instal in non residential area that be problem in sweden researcher have find that person be three time more likely to survive cardiac arrest in public than at home that statistic could be mirror in the uk which be why be call for legal requirement to ensure that all new housing development have defibrillator an essential piece of life save equipment when cardiac arrest happen it be crucial that defibrillator be nearby accord to study by sarkisian et al the survival rate for cardiac arrest decrease by for every additional metre between the patient and the defib it be therefore concern that accord to recent study by burgoine et member will have read about it in the paper last week the median distance of publicly accessible defibrillator from any give postcode in great britain be metre when someone have cardiac arrest their heart stop and it be race against time to ensure that oxygen continue to travel to their brain cardiopulmonary resuscitation chest compression with rescue breath be essential for maintain the flow of blood and oxygen during this time however the use of defibrillator be the only method that can seriously improve survival rate by shock the heart and cause it to resume its normal rhythm that restore the flow of blood and oxygen to the brain if defibrillator be use before an ambulance arrive survival rate from cardiac arrest increase from less than to more than give that there be cardiac arrest in the uk every year it be crystal clear that my bill be necessary to increase the number of defibrillator in private residential area and hope that this will not be controversial issue for the house some may suggest that the bill will impose an additional financial burden on housing developer but the cost of defibrillator be small in relation to the entire budget of housing project just over the bill will also empower resident to learn about defibrillator and to know where they be and how to use they everyone should know what defibrillator be and hopefully where to find one the second part of my bill require developer to provide funding for these new defibrillator for year after their installation if defibrillator be to work and to save life they must be maintain so what maintenance be require first there must be an electricity supply to maintain the temperature of the defibrillator this protect the battery life of the device secondly battery need to be replace after four to six year replacement battery typically cost just thirdly electrode pad need to be replace after two year five replacement pad cost only as for who would carry out the maintenance believe that number of organisation would be well place to visit each defibrillator in an area once every two year for that purpose for example the fire service the first responder network include the local ambulance service or even perhaps the local authority funding for the maintenance could well be achieve through section agreement between housing developer and local authority my bill have two important aspect the provision of defibrillator in every new housing development consist of more than dwelling and the provision of year maintenance funding all for an additional cost of about or per property that be small price to pay for immediate access to lifesave defibrillator the scientific evidence overwhelmingly emphasise the impact that the bill could have and hope that the house recognise that and decide to take action to improve cardiac arrest survival rate let end with dave bowling call to action defibrillation for the nation question put and agree to order that stephen metcalfe anna firth mr mark francois jackie doyle price carol monaghan jonathan gullis sir chris bryant and giles watle present the bill stephen metcalfe accordingly present the bill bill read the first time to be read second time on friday november and to be print bill northern ireland troubles legacy and reconciliation bill consideration of lords message clause immunity from prosecution beg to move that this house disagree with lords amendment and let begin by remind the house that the government have seek to make realistic assessment of what we can well deliver for family more than quarter of century after the belfast good friday agreement nearly year since the first ceasefire and well over year since the trouble begin the backdrop be that current mechanism for address legacy matter work for only very small number of people rather than the overwhelming majority and establish criminal justice process be increasingly unlikely to deliver outcome that people desire especially in respect of prosecution we have only one issue leave to debate today conditional immunity the purpose of this legislation be to give people more information in short timeframe than be possible with the current mechanism we do that by create an effective information recovery process that rely on conditional immunity model attend decent chunk of the debate in the house of lords yesterday and although be sympathetic to the intent behind lords amendment which be to give family member role in decide whether immunity should or should not be grant immunity risk undermine the effectiveness of these provision and the principal aim of information recovery for example the public interest consideration element in condition would lead to uncertainty about the circumstance in which immunity will be grant undermine the clear and transparent approach that we have develop over time if we be to ensure that the independent commission for reconciliation and information recovery can obtain as much information for family as possible we need to ensure that the right incentive be in place for individual to come forward to provide that information appreciate that the secretary of state whom by the way greatly respect have come here to try to deliver the bill as it be but may make this point to he great many people out there have lose love one over the year we all know who they be and on every occasion they seek justice as say to my hon friend the member for east londonderry mr campbell even if there be only candle of light of possibility that someday those who have murder someone love one would be hold accountable for it that be what we need let say with respect that today the government be extinguish that light for all those who have lose love one there be many people in the chamber today and in the public gallery who have lose love one on behalf of all those family implore the secretary of state and the government to think very carefully about the direction that they be take because the family right to justice be be extinguish and that can not bode well for the future thank the hon gentleman for his point for the way he have raise it and indeed for the numerous conversation we have have on these matter outside this place and within it he know the answer that be go to give he will never and can never put myself in the shoe of the people who have lose someone just can not however can see process that have work for only very few people consider the quantum of people who be affect by the trouble and who lose people indeed the chance of get justice for they be dwindle all the time the government have come to the conclusion that this be the right way forward because we hope that we can in good time at least get some information recover for those family that ask for it and also through other element of the bill that be not the subject of this package of amendment if someone mislead the independent commission for reconciliation and information recovery there be criminal process involve perjury and whole host of criminal investigation that can take place whole host of thing have change that hope will allow lot of information to be recover in quick time for family the secretary of state say he can not put himself in the shoe of the victim but he could listen to they can he tell we how many or what percentage of the victim he have meet have show support for this piece of legislation very few have show support for this legislation but have meet many as have my lords minister lord caine in fact part of the process of change the bill have come from those conversation understand that lot of family do not want this bill but the question then be if not this bill then what interruption the hon member for foyle colum eastwood say stormont house but he know that stormont house do not have cross party agreement at the time and that the ulster unionist party do not agree to it rise happily give way please correct would the minister acknowledge that it do have cross party support the ulster unionists defer on one small matter and that it be recommit to by his government and the irish government as recently as january and it do not move forward because of the different political issue that come about the minister make this very point at an event that be at at the weekend but it be chatham house rule so be not allow to talk about it he put forward the argument that the party just could not agree but be involve in many of those discussion and can tell he that the british government drag their foot month after month around the issue of onward disclosure that be what happen and it be important to put that on the record the vast majority of political party and victim group in northern ireland support stormont house but the british government just do not want to do it that be why it do not get deliver be afraid do not quite believe that that be the case however the british government have commit to full disclosure to the icrir which allow for huge amount of information to be put forward in those circumstance and the possibility of ensure that the commissioner can obtain as much information as possible from family the minister say that if family be to have say on whether immunity should be grant it would undermine the whole thrust of the bill but the point of the bill be to ensure that people and family who have be hurt traumatise and damage by what happen as result of terrorist activity in northern ireland over year have their say surely the good way of give they justice after they have hear what the circumstance of the case be what the attitude of the individual be and what can be disclose be to at least let they have the final say on whether they feel that the individual concern should be grant immunity thank the right hon gentleman for his point the many amendment to this bill throughout the last year have include measure on how family should be engage with and how their view should be hear throughout the process to ensure that the commission can obtain as much information for family as possible we need to ensure that the right incentive be in place for individual to come forward and provide that information the possibility that eligible individual who co operate fully with the commission could then be prevent from obtain immunity from prosecution be highly likely to act as significant disincentive for individual to disclose that information this be never go to be an easy issue or an easy bill if it be easy it would have be do many year ago what the government be propose may be right or it may be part right and part wrong certainly think that give those survivor and their family right to veto would be the wrong step to take so the government be right on that however think the house will find comfort in the fact that the secretary of state will keep the progress of the enactment under review and if there be abuse or thing that be wrong we can revisit it tidy it up and make it work well this can not be see as closed chapter job do rather it be the start of new process quite experimental in some way of learn from other people experience if we have that comfort that this be amendable and reviewable it might help to assuage some if not all the concern thank the chairman of the select committee for his point he will know that other amendment have table have try to make this body as independent as it can possibly be be sure he will have take great heart from the appointment of the chief commissioner designate sir declan morgan and from the comment he have be make about how he intend to go about his business he be engage widely even at this point and will do so even far when the bill get royal assent and become an act just in the practice of sir declan in put the flesh on the framework that we be build here for the commission think my hon friend will see that there be lot of opportunity for it to do exactly what he wish it to do this be understandably an emotional and difficult topic and it be one that mean lot to have serve as parliamentary private secretary to the former secretary of state for northern ireland my right hon friend the member for great yarmouth sir brandon lewis and also have love one who live through the trouble on either side of the border the discussion be difficult and want to give my support to the secretary of state on this if there be threat of prosecution down the line it will be the family of british soldier and the family particularly in unionist community who will not get the answer they rightly deserve it will disincentivise people from come forward and present evidence even though justice might not be serve in court there will at least be answer to the question that family member have be ask for long time it will offer some small hope of reconciliation for those family if they can finally get the truth about what happen and who be involve in order to allow northern ireland to heal and move on have engage regularly with member of the northern irish community and they want to talk about education and about create more high skilled high wage job they be desperate to see prosperity for their great country and those be the thing that that nation want to move on to look forward to rather than continuously look backwards thank my hon friend for his point and for his committed work in my department be not there at the time but know of it understand the point that he make over the past year we have endeavour through amendment to make the bill very much focus on all victim of the trouble so that all victim can if they choose to do so contact the commission and start process that will hopefully get they some information in relatively quick time we have recently have an example of roman catholic priest who be involve in ira activity when talk about his role he say that his only regret be that his effort be not more effective in kill people if that kind of evidence be elicit if people come forward and show no remorse and no regret and offer no comfort to victim do the secretary of state really think victim will feel any well would not give they the opportunity to say in the light of that man attitude do not believe he should be grant immunity be well way of ensure that justice be at least see to be do for those people unbelievably evil thing be do in the course of the trouble unbelievably hideous act be commit and none of we can change that as say at the beginning of my contribution it have not be possible to give justice to huge number of those family even today even after the passage of all that time and even after numerous investigation in some case this bill try to get some information to family who contact the commission to request it so they can well understand the situation it will not change anything that happen in the past it simply can not be grateful to the secretary of state for give way again the premise of his argument and some of the argument we have hear from member on those benches which be sometimes extremely condescend to victim who have be go through this for many decade be that people will come forward with the truth if we grant immunity well there be one glare example that prove that be totally wrong during the bloody sunday inquiry the soldier be grant immunity within the context of the inquiry one after another they lie through their tooth and that have be prove by an international public inquiry with the disappear again ira people be provide immunity within the context of the organisation that be look to find those body and we still have body out there that have not be find because those people do not come forward and tell the truth even when they be grant immunity the lie that be be use to sell this bill be just that lie it be patently untrue and it will not do anything to give people the truth and justice they desire the hon gentleman characterise it completely incorrectly there be no guarantee that the bill will bring information forward but as try to outline very little new information have come to light that have lead to new case very few people have be able to receive justice he mention the point that in the past some people might have mislead judge lead inquiry well that be perjury and perjury be now part of this bill the bill have change huge amount over the past year and it be worthy of support this may well be our last chance to discuss the bill in this chamber may ask the secretary of state to reflect on the fact that virtually every independent human right expert include most notably the northern ireland human rights commission which have statutory function do not believe that the bill be human right compliant even sir declan morgan who have be appoint to head up the icrir could not give categorical answer to that question in recent newspaper interview indeed it be anticipate that whole series of case will need to be bring forward to clear up the issue around human right compliance understand that point and again that be the purpose of all the amendment we have make the hon gentleman will know that be not comfortable with the bill that inherit because as there would be gap in investigation do not believe it could be article compliant amendment have be introduce that completely change that and believe that the bill be now compliant but that will undoubtedly be test only when it be test and the result come forward can anybody actually say that the bill be article compliant as government lawyer truly believe it be the secretary of state be unhappy with the bill he inherit which be the context of the amendment and change that have be make to this bill have he consult with the chief commissioner designate on the lords amendment he be reject today if the chief commissioner designate be consult do he agree to reject the amendment determine not to speak to the chief commissioner designate so that could maintain his independence when the bill be enact in several of the secretary of state answer to question from opposition members he have say if there be extra evidence have he or the british government have the opportunity to speak to the irish republic government about their role believe the irish republic government through the garda síochána have an evidence base on the murder that be carry out by the ira along the border be very conscious of chief superintendent harry breen and bob buchanan in lexie cummings in and ian sproule in the people who do that escape across the border and the garda síochána have indicate order be very conscious of time you be down to speak and you have make your speech already other people need to get in this be very important issue and want to make sure that people can make their speech forgive mr speaker be try to take as many intervention as possible know we all know that mr shannon be very good but it be the amount of time intervention have to be short and punchy not speech he be go to make speech later can assure the hon member for strangford jim shannon that have be speak to the irish government about element of what he mention the commission will grant immunity from prosecution only if an individual provide an account that be true to the good of their knowledge and belief we have develop robust test for immunity in which their account must be test against any information that the commission hold if an individual do not provide truthful account of their action that could be pass to family or if they do not participate in the immunity process at all immunity will not be grant and they would remain liable to prosecution should evidence exist where prosecution take place and should conviction be secure an individual will not be eligible for the early release scheme under the northern ireland sentences act again that be result of amendment make in this house similarly although acknowledge the sentiment behind introduce licence condition under lords amendment respectfully suggest that the government have seek to address these issue through amendment that be adopt on report in the other place these amendment send clear message that once immunity be grant individual who be convict of offence that could impede reconciliation will lose that immunity in the government view this approach strike the right balance between provide sufficient certainty as to the effect of grant of immunity necessary to encourage participation and ensure that there be appropriate consequence for those whose behaviour after be grant immunity be not compatible with the fundamental aim of the bill the alternative propose by the opposition would not support an effective information recovery process and therefore ask that the house join in disagree to amendment and call the shadow secretary of state may take this opportunity to welcome my hon friend the member for putney fleur anderson to the front bench team and to express my thank to my hon friend the member for gower tonia antoniazzi for all the service she give during her time as part of the shadow northern ireland team as the house will be aware we do not support this bill but do not understand why the secretary of state be seek to overturn the amendment table by lord murphy and pass in the other place yesterday listen very carefully to the argument advance by the secretary of state but do not think they stand up because the lords amendment would not take away the commission ability to issue immunity to an individual who come forward and give truthful evidence about what happen lord amendment be not veto but it would allow the family of those who be kill or seriously injure in the trouble to have some voice in the process understand that relative of those who be murder be with we in the gallery and they be still seek justice let turn to the other provision relate to licence condition that would apply to the person seek immunity acknowledge what the secretary of state just say about other change have be make to the bill but these provision seem very sensible and reasonable to include in that the requirement that the individual in question should not approach or otherwise communicate with victim in the case of an injury or with victim family in the case of death unless they consent so we will vote against the government motion to disagree with the lords amendment today the secretary of state have talk quite bit about disincentive to people come forward but say to he that it be not entirely clear that immunity will achieve the purpose that the government have for it give that every other mean of justice be to be close down and give that the commission appear to have lifespan of only five year those who have commit dreadful crime only need to sit it out say to the secretary of state that if that be to happen and after the five year be over those individual start to talk about boast about or write book about what they have do how will he explain to the family of those they murder why the government allow that situation to arise that would be the consequence of take away from people as this bill do the mean of justice however hard however long however uncertain acknowledge the point that the secretary of state make about that this be the last occasion on which we will debate this highly controversial legislation which concern how we come to term with the terrible legacy of violence and brutality during the trouble in way that enable those most affected the family finally to know what happen to the person they love and to ensure that justice be do to hold those responsible to account this be the first time have talk about this give that be appoint only on monday but recognise how hard this be and acknowledge the change that the secretary of state have make to the bill during its passage include his comment that when he inherit it he be not happy with it however he must accept that this legislation do not command the confidence of the people to whom he be try to offer reassurance and comfort the most important word in the title of this bill be reconciliation we all want that to happen but the bill have self evidently not achieve its aim because all the community in northern ireland be clearly not reconcile to its content it be so striking to see the extent to which the government have fail to win support for their approach the list of people and organisation oppose to this bill be frankly astonishing all of the political party in northern ireland the church in northern ireland victim group the northern ireland human rights commission the former victims commissioner the irish government the council of europe and the united nations most extraordinary of all it be report that the person who have be appoint as the commissioner designate the highly respected sir declan morgan say recently that he would expect legal action by the family of victim of the trouble to try to challenge the bill on whether it be compliant with the european convention on human right that be the scale of the coalition that the government have manage to range against themselves but instead of reflect on that their approach have be to put their head down and plough on regardless that be why for all the government good intention they have fail to win public confidence even though the government say in in order to build consensus on workable proposal that have widespread support we must listen to the concern of victim survivor and other interested party do the wrong thing be not justification for this bill and if there be one lesson we must by now have learn about how to make progress in northern ireland it be that it can only be achieve patiently slowly and carefully so as to build consensus be sorry to say that the bill do not do that and it will not achieve the purpose ministers claim for it that be why we be committed as the opposition to repeal it if we get the opportunity call the scottish national party spokesperson be well aware that time be limited you will be pleased to hear mr speaker that so too be my capacity for repeat argument that have make many time previously my party believe that this bill be wrong in principle and that in practice it will not achieve the aim that the secretary of state believe no doubt with great sincerity that it will we will therefore be join the official opposition in vote to support the lords amendment be grateful for the contribution make by opposition members thus far number of comment have be make this afternoon that relate more to second reading than to the stage we be at it should come as no surprise to those in the chamber to hear that to we this be an irredeemable piece of legislation even though we be highlight in this chamber on second reading and so on the area where significant flaw be ultimately go to prove fatal to support for this bill the government entrench themselves on number of discrete issue they commit in this democratically elect chamber where they ignore our request that they would proceed with such amendment in the lords find that unsatisfactory although recognise that my colleague in the lords continue to push on those issue with lords dodds principally among they they have ensure that some of the commitment give have be honour however that do not change the fact that this be fundamental assault on justice with the erosion of hope for victim and of the opportunity to get the answer they seek and the outcome they desire those thing have be snuff out by government who have entrench themselves and greatly regret that this afternoon we have an opportunity with discrete and sensible amendment before we as the shadow secretary of state have say they be table by the labour party in the house of lords and be advocate and support by member across the other place yesterday afternoon this be an opportunity for the government to salvage at least some appropriate involvement for victim whereby they can have their say and sense of the outcome that they seek contribution be make yesterday by lord eames and it be worth repeat he say yes there have be attempt to bring the concept of victimhood into the legislation that be propose and yes the government can claim that they have make effort but in god name ask your lordships to consider the overall impetus of what change have be make to try to recognise the need of victim and their family and of those who in year to come when they read what have be say attempt and fail to be produce will find it incredulous to understand that the mother of parliaments have ignore their crying official report house of lords september vol those word be worth repeat this afternoon because lord eames be somebody who have lead the church of ireland but be in this parliament as peacemaker and who go through an ill fat attempt to reconcile issue of legacy in the past in consultative report with denis bradley in within this parliament and within our society he be somebody who probably bury more people in northern ireland during the trouble than anyone else when he exhort in such clear term that there be an opportunity finally for the government at this last gasp to show some recognition of the pain trauma harm and pursuit of justice that victim show the fact that this government would not accept it be great shame the list of organisation have be give it be give by former secretary of state lord murphy yesterday in the house of lords and by the shadow secretary of state here today show the lack of support for the legislation we will go through the lobby this afternoon to register yet again our disappointment at fail opportunity by this government who be more focused on what they can get out of this bill as they campaign for the forthcoming election than on solve the intractable issue that have plague our society for so long to start with the specific amendment before we the government approach right to this eleventh hour five minute to midnight in term of the bill reinforce the premise behind the bill immunity be the central foundation stone on which this flawed bill have be design and take forward and the immunity clause go to the heart of why there be no confidence in the legislation and why it have be reject by so many stakeholder most notably victim group that opposition span the entire political spectrum in northern ireland reference have be make to the history around this issue do not want to dwell on that overly but there be notion that the stormont house agreement be not agree to and be in some way flawed and that we need an alternative stormont house be agree by virtually every political party and there be effort make to implement it but beyond the political party it have the confidence of victim group and the approval of independent human right expert so it be the basis of move forward as have be say as recently as new decade new approach stormont house have explicitly be the policy of this government within three month from the launch of new decade new approach we have in effect handbrake turn with write ministerial statement by one of the secretary of state predecessor the right hon member for great yarmouth sir brandon lewis it be very clear that the immunity concept alongside the conservative party manifesto be drive that so the whole premise of the bill be drive by the politic of the conversative party not the need of northern ireland that be the fundamental reason why the bill will never be see as legitimate in any sense in northern ireland far do not understand the logic of secretary of state say that stormont house do not have full support so we can not proceed on that basis and then by extension introduce bill that have no support from any political party or victim group in northern ireland that seem utterly nonsensical to will not reiterate the point make about human right compliance but acknowledge that the shadow secretary of state the right hon member for leeds central hilary benn echo and reinforce the point that we will see legal challenge to the legislation finally welcome what the shadow secretary of state say about the repeal of the legislation if we see change of government after the next election hope that will be priority for the incoming government there be lot of thing that get angry in this job but this have get more angry than anything have ever have to deal with the people sit on the benches occupy by member represent northern ireland constituency have have to deal with get to know and work with the victim of our terrible past for decade frankly be embarrassed today as do not know what be go to say to they when speak to they after the debate because as whole as body politic we have fail they we have peace process we have peace and lot of we have be able to move on but we have leave very significant cohort of people behind and we be rubber stamp that today some people will walk through the lobby coldly without have the name of the victim ring in their head have their name go around my head right now have put many of they on record in this chamber during the passage of the bill be deeply ashamed that we be do this today there be pretence in the proposal for the bill that somehow the british government be not an actor at all in the conflict in northern ireland that be patently untrue they say that local political party in northern ireland be just squabble can not come up with any answer or deal with the problem that be patently untrue we come up with the answer which be stormont house the reason it be not deliver be that the british government drag their foot and change their policy after new decade new approach that be fact really hope that the irish government listen to the call by some of we to take this uk government to the european court of human rights in strasbourg because the bill be an affront to human right and article every single expert have speak to agree with on that and every single victim agree with on that as well the secretary of state use the phrase effective information recovery process lot of time effective information recovery process can take he to family today whose and year old be shoot in the trouble and their case have be close by this government until and those people tell we they want an effective information recovery process but the government be deny victim effective information recovery so that tell that the bill be base on lie it be an attempt by this government and dark force within the security apparatus of this government to close down access to truth and justice we all understand that justice will be hard to get for many family but most of those family have not even have any truth the process of investigation get they truth can take member to load of family today who never once even meet police officer even though love one be murder do anybody here believe that the ira be go to come forward and tell we who bomb particular pub or who shoot particular person it be utter nonsense this be an attempt to close down access to the truth and it be an affront to democracy immunity it be impunity give people licence to murder people on the street of derry belfast newry and across northern ireland and also on the street of london do not understand how any politician can stand and look at the face of cry victim and tell they that this be the right thing to do be ashamed that this be happen today let say one thing to end know these people they have have to struggle for decade after decade this will not be the end for they and we will be with they in support right to the end wish to add few word will not be labour too long in the chamber but it be important to make some comment in relation to where we be as again find myself in position where can not support what the government have put forward while some member on the government benches try to apologise and condition their support for the bill members on these benches include those from my party and our spokesperson my hon friend the member for belfast east gavin robinson as well as member represent other party include the hon member for foyle colum eastwood and for north down stephen farry have put forward their comment very clearly have many concern over the process in place for victim and the fact that there be not enough answer there will be ongoing investigation but will any of those investigation be into collusion over the border in my intervention on the secretary of state early refer to discussion that the secretary of state and the united kingdom government may have have with the republic of ireland in relation to collusion in investigation which in some case involve some member of the garda síochána and to the fact that the republic of ireland give sanctuary to ira murderer who escape across the border those be issue that some of my constituent wish to know about in his reply the secretary of state say that he have have discussion with the republic of ireland in relation to those matter but have the republic of ireland respond give evidence or investigate in the way it should have do the government of the irish republic again interfere in the affair of northern ireland and the united kingdom have threaten to go to the european court on this issue do my hon friend agree with give how tarnished they be in regard to legacy that whether we agree or disagree with the legislation that be be bring forward this be an internal uk matter and should be deal with internally through the process within the uk not by an interfere irish government thank my right hon friend for his intervention he have put on record very clearly his point of view and it be one to which many of we here subscribe let return to the point that be try to make about the secretary of state reply have those discussion take place have the evidential base be gather have the accusation of collusion between the garda síochána and the ira be consider there be the murder of chief superintendent harry breen and superintendent bob buchanan in car bomb on the border in the information that we have be make aware of indicate that detail be pass to the ira on what time they would be cross the border that be collusion that be an evidential base for what happen that information should be bring forward by the republic of ireland government and convey to the secretary of state and the government here there be many other such case for example the murderer of lexie cummings in escape across the border the murderer of ian sproule in escape across the border and again the murderer of my own cousin kenneth smyth escape across the border thank my hon friend for give way as this be raise in an early intervention it would be interesting to say to the house that someone come forward and volunteer information say that they have be involve in the ira campaign and yet they have never serve one day either in court or in prison for that they be question in and deny the allegation but as recently as they make full admission of their involvement in ira activity the case of the hyde park bomb which see people kill and injure be never bring to court in relation to that that be somebody who come forward recently and make that admission thank my hon friend for raise that matter he have clearly outline an evidential base which have to be part of this process unfortunately though with this bill that process do not continue in the way that we hop it would wish very quickly to speak to the lords amendment they have establish minimum criminal justice standard for review along the line of operation kenova the amendment would require the secretary of state to make regulation prescribe the standard to which review by the independent commission for reconciliation information recovery be carry out include what measure should be use to ensure that review comply sufficiently with the obligation under the european convention on human right the shadow secretary of state whom welcome to his place refer to that specifically in his contribution be very encouraged by his comment here today think we all be and look forward to constructive engagement with he as we move forward what be also cover be whether as much information as possible should be gather by review in relation to death or harmful conduct and whether all evidential opportunity should be explore by review victim must be consult and regulation can be change if review be conduct in way not envisage that be what the lords amendment be hop to achieve it be disappointing to personally and to all of we who represent northern ireland that that have not be fully consider by the government it be regrettable that the government have resist effort to embed minimum criminal justice standard at the heart of how the icrir conduct review they seem intent not only on narrow the legal route but weaken investigative standard in those aspect that remain it be hard not to reach the conclusion that the distinction make between review and investigation in the context of the bill be more about draw line under the past with minimal fuss in the short timeframe possible than about actually secure the answer and information that the victim and their family deserve and crave in conclusion it grieve to stand against the government on these issue but on behalf of the victim wish to say very clearly that those in the public gallery today expect to see all those who perpetrate and carry out crime to be hold accountable that be not happen the unfortunate thing for all of we here those in the public gallery who have lose love one we in this chamber who have lose love one and for all of we who represent northern ireland be that this be retrograde step it extinguish very clearly the hope for justice that we all want for those people who lose their life to the trouble with the leave of the house will answer couple of the point that have be raise be grateful to all hon member for their contribution in the debate today know that the time that have be relatively short so shall try to keep to it as the hon member for strangford jim shannon be just speak be remind of question that receive from my hon friend the member for wolverhampton north east jane stevenson in the second but last northern ireland office question she be approach by constituent who be after information about what have happen to one of their love one so there be people out there who will try to find and do find information about their love one if it can possibly be do the fact be that if people do not co operate they will not be grant immunity and therefore they will remain liable to prosecution and that will mean use all the police power at the new body disposal the government position be that we still feel that the prospect of successful prosecution be increasingly unlikely but none the less that prospect remain if may will correct one thing that the right hon member for leeds central hilary benn say it be straightforward correction and be not mean in any political way it be not correct to state that the icrir have lifespan of five year the commission will be wind up by the secretary of state at the time via affirmative resolution only once it have discharge all its function as set out under clause so its lifespan could be quite bit long than five year just think that would share that do recognise that this be hugely difficult bill and hugely difficult task an unbelievably difficult task which be reflect in the number of valiant attempt make to address the issue since the good friday agreement the secretary of state be outline the difficulty surround this entire process give the convoluted protract nature of this for such long time and give what inevitably will happen when this pass as it will it will end up in the high court do he understand that this will be an entirely convoluted academic process that will end up nowhere be afraid that do not be say that number of valiant attempt have be make to address this issue since the belfast good friday agreement as have remind the house in the past in one debate that attend with some of the woman who be behind the good friday agreement one be ask what be her big regret about the time the regret be that nothing be do for victim number of these attempt be undertake when the right hon member for leeds central be minister in government indeed slightly worry about his brilliant academic mind and his recall for any of our future exchange but know that he will remember all too well the difficulty and complexity involve in these issue none the less it be incumbent on we to ensure that any process for deal with the past focus on measure that can deliver positive outcome for as many of those directly affect by the trouble as possible that come it really do with finely balanced political and moral choice include conditional immunity process which acknowledge be difficult for very many but we must be honest about what we can realistically deliver for people in circumstance where the prospect of achieve justice in the traditional sense be so vanishingly small that be why the government be unable to support the opposition and will be disagree to lords amendment and will close my comment by recognise that the right hon member for leeds central have come to this debate with fresh pair of eye quite understandably he have not have much more than hour to go through what be very detailed piece of legislation but know that he have follow these debate in great detail from the back benches know that in due course he will look at this and reach his own conclusion encourage he when do so to reflect on the immense difficulty of this task and to consider how the government have genuinely seek to strengthen the legislation with encouragement from his party he may also want to consider the tough of all question if not this bill then what hope that upon royal assent the opposition will engage constructively with the chief commissioner to help to ensure that the new commission can deliver the well outcome for all those affect by the trouble that everyone across this house would like to achieve question put bim afolami adam afriyie nickie aiken peter aldous lucy allan lee anderson stuart anderson stuart andrew caroline ansell

present to his majesty that he will be graciously pleased to give direction that there will be lay before this house by september the follow paper submission from the department for education to hm treasury relate to the spending review in and and all paper advice and correspondence include submission and electronic communication include communication with and from ministers and special advisers within and between the cabinet office include the office of the prime minister the department for education and hm treasury relate to these submission concern with school building today we seek the release of paper that would tell we what have and what have not be happen in our school paper that the government refuse again yesterday to release and about which the prime minister again evade question today however this debate be about much more than just the document it be about more than reinforce autoclaved aerate concrete it be about more than school building and their safety this debate quite simply be about responsibility and whether the prime minister will come clean about the allegation that he know the risk that he be warn that he be tell that be the issue in the motion before the house today whether the prime minister be tell that urgent action be need to secure the safety of school but instead he slash the cost of champagne whether he will accept responsibility for his choice and whether he will be clear where responsibility lie all of we be here with deep responsibility to our constituent to be open to be honest to take decision objectively and selflessly to accept accountability to have integrity and to show leadership let be clear right from the outset that labour government would have show leadership on this not just in the last few week but for year on end that be our record in government labour secretary of state face today with sudden crisis such as this would have get those list of the affect school out quickly would have be straight back to london would have be communicate every day to parent and above all to child would be take step not just to mitigate the immediate challenge around order she be not give way perhaps she will give way later we would remember the lesson from the pandemic that every school day matter we would be ensure the continuity of education for every child in school we would be ensure in person learn for all our child we would be do that right now and we would not be look for plaudit blame other or demand praise we would accept responsibility for what have go wrong on our watch and we would take responsibility for fix it fix it fast fix it to last and fix it for good the government can not even fix send out their suggest intervention for today debate to the right set of back benchers it be hardly surprise that they can not fix the chaos in our school here we be today because of the utter shamble that have accompany the start of new school year for so many child the public realm be literally crumble around the next generation the defining image of year of conservative government be child cower under steel prop to stop the ceiling literally fall in on their head be it not always the case that when the conservatives be in power our school crumble in one in five school be inadequate and need to be rebuild by labour government because the conservatives slash the rebuilding programme under this government we be in the same dire situation again and the only party that can fix it be labour party in government my hon friend be absolutely right like he remember the transformation that that labour government deliver will come to that in more detail during the debate the welsh labour government have complain that the briefing they receive lack the technical detail require to take forward the work on school do the hon lady agree that the secretary of state should provide the other government with full detail from the working group when they become available know that conservative members have keen fascination with all thing go on in wales at the moment and that ministers have not always be in full possession of the fact at the dispatch box so will put few on the record so that we can all be clear about the situation in wales in wales school capital funding have increase by around in cash term and in real term between and perhaps we can use that as the basis for slightly more informed debate during today discussion today our first priority must be safety as it must always be guarantee that safety must ultimately be the responsibility of ministers and of government that be why repeatedly press the secretary of state to publish full list of all the school with concern about raac which she have at last publish today however gently note that there could be omission on that list number of which have already be draw to my attention hope that we can get full clarity about the situation across our school the hon lady have make whole series of allegation and challenge about the secretary of state and the prime minister but surely in devolved arrangement all those responsibility and challenge apply equally to the first minister she have recognise that the list of school in england have be publish why have such list not be publish for wales do she accept that that be an example of the welsh government fail education and school in wales the difference between the labour government in wales and the government here in westminster be that over the last year the welsh government have continue with school rebuilding programme unlike the uk government who have cut funding and cut support to our school time and again we want to be clear open and honest with local authority and multi academy trust about the step that the secretary of state be take to get in place the protection and mitigation that be need she say on monday absolutely nothing be more important than the safety of child and staff it have always be the case that where we be make aware of building that pose an immediate risk we have take immediate action official report september vol yet she be keen to spread the responsibility for the concrete crisis through time and space include to her colleague who understand have be sit on their backside to the welsh government topic of interest for member whose ability to act swiftly have be hamper by key information not be share and to the last labour government who leave office year ago the secretary of state be keen to emphasise that it be not her department responsibility or her to ensure the safety of our child at school push responsibility on to other local authority the school themselves multi academy trust without the power resource or support they need be very simply pass the buck and my word there have be an awful lot of that this week as minister have be keen to remind we concern be first raise about raac back in the by then the wide issue be that too many school build quickly and cheaply in the previous year be approach the end of their design life the issue be many raac asbestos and the simple reality in the school go to and in so many other state school across our the country of bucket in corridor classroom blacken by mould window that do not close and door that would not shut be at school back in the mid but know how serious labour politician take those warning and be proud that as the scale of the challenge become clear labour ministers rise to it in the buildings schools for the future programme be launch to rebuild every secondary school in our country over year in building schools for the future be join by the primary capital programme to give every child the chance to learn safely in first rate learning environment that be do not because it be simple or quick nor because there be no easy more popular or more eye catch choice but because it be right because it be responsible and because that labour government believe then as we do now that excellence must be for everyone and that every child deserve the good start not just some child but all our child the change we see in when the conservatives enter government reflect very different approach an entirely botched cancellation of exist programme not by ministers long since retire but by the minister for schools the right hon member for bognor regis and littlehampton nick gibb who be still sit on the treasury bench today and by former education secretary the right hon member for surrey heath michael gove who be still in the cabinet ambition be reduce and timeline extend minister know the consequence when they take those decision they bank the saving and leave our school to rot slowly quietly and inexorably do my hon friend not think that the vast overinflated amount of money spend on some free school site could have be well spend deal with the collapse school be grateful to my hon friend for all the work that she have do over many year as chair of the public accounts committee to draw our attention to the problem will say bit more about the recent report by the national audit office on many of these issue when we leave risk unattended they worsen and in time thing start to fail first quickly then suddenly in july ceiling suddenly collapse at singlewell primary school in kent where raac fail without warn mercifully no one be hurt month pass and an alert from central government and the local government association go out that autumn emphasise the risk it say the limited durability of raac roof and other raac structure have long be recognise however recent experience which include two roof failure with little or no warning suggest the problem may be more serious than previously appreciate and that many building owner be not aware that it be present in their property let emphasise that final point many building owner be not aware few month after that in may the standing committee on structural safety issue note on the failure of raac plank it say that all those instal before be now past their expect service life and it be recommend that consideration be give to their replacement it be not until march almost four year after that ceiling collapse that the department for education respond to the challenge of raac how it send out survey not surveyor not team of surveyor and not even fund for surveyor but survey if the issue be such priority and if the secretary of state and her department believe in immediate action why after school collapse in july do it take almost four year for the department to send out survey about raac in march appreciate that the secretary of state be not in post throughout that time but responsibility in government be not merely individual crucially it be collective and enduring it stretch across government and down the year if she do not understand that point perhaps she could seek advice from the schools minister who have be in post for so many year as he be today the key fact be that the welsh government order survey only in may while the uk government start engage with school in surely that show woeful lack of responsibility have here briefing document it would save we all bit of time and energy if conservative members just give we the number and let we deal with it the welsh labour government have be take consistent action to rebuild school during their time in office the hon gentleman might not like it but it be fact and that stand in stark contrast to what have be happen here in england my hon friend be make powerful case the work and pensions committee highlight last year the grow number of retire schoolteacher succumb to mesothelioma because of exposure to asbestos during their work life at the current rate of progress it will take year to remove all the asbestos from school do she agree that the department must get move on with that my right hon friend be right to draw our attention to that matter and appreciate the work that his committee have do on it it would also be helpful if we have some clarity today from the secretary of state about the risk that might arise when raac interact with asbestos if she could say little bit more about that be sure all member from across the house would be grateful will the hon lady give way be just go to make bit more progress for responsible politician be in government be not simply matter of press the agenda of their political party their donor or those who profit from government contract it be about rise to the challenge that face our country and accept the blame when thing go wrong as the price of acclaim when they go well the point about raac be make very ably by the secretary of state who say school can collapse for many reason not just raac they can indeed so many thing be wrong right now with our school estate there be faulty boiler inadequate insulation roof leak and asbestos in around four out of five of our school and as the pandemic teach we ventilation be simply not good enough in too many of our school how do we know that the condition data collection tell we all of it by the department own admission that exercise be not even proper structural survey despite come year after the risk of raac be first flagged and seven year after the government cancel labour school rebuilding programme have not even look at hazardous material the condition data collection find that more than element of the school estate be in poor condition and need to be prioritise for replacement be all those someone else responsibility too even the money that the department do commit the spend allocation of which the minister for schools speak so proudly so often with the keen pride of minister wholly oblivious to the scale of their own failure be not all spend again whose fault be that whose responsibility might that have be we be tell that part of the difficulty in recent year have be find the skilled labour to deliver the work that our school so desperately need invite conservative member to reflect briefly on why exactly that might be could it be the dramatic overall drop in apprenticeship start the shortage of construction apprenticeship in recent year or the utter failure of the government apprenticeship levy to deliver spending on skill at the scale and pace we need could it be their wide failure on further education and in work training thirteen year into conservative government who will take responsibility for that it be conservative prime minister who once savage the press of this country for seek power without responsibility today that be the entire ideology of the whole conservative party that failure to accept responsibility be not merely the ethic of the secretary of state and her ministers it come right from the very top today prime minister be yesterday chancellor and we know not just from the former most senior official at the department for education but from the schools minister himself that at the spending review when even ministers know that the problem need tackle urgently and the rate of rebuilding need to soar the now prime minister say no and every conservative member accept that cheap champagne yes safe school no there have never be clear picture of the priority of the conservative party the prime minister fond as he be of private donation to his old school have form on say no to high standard in school for other people child he say no to the proper pandemic recovery plan that the government own recovery tsar recommend in he say no to the capital spend that would have keep our school safe and our child learn last spring he say no to the desperate plea of civil servant in the department for education for the resource to make school safe in his spending review speech back in he even boast of return overall real term education spending in few year time to the level of the last labour government that be not an admission wring as repentant confession it be boast make with pride that one day but perhaps not yet he would take education as seriously as labour those who complain about party politic might reflect for just moment on whether they would level the same accusation at the national audit office in june the nao report that follow year of underinvestment the estate overall condition be decline and around pupil be learn in school that the responsible body or dfe believe need major rebuilding or refurbishment most seriously dfe recognise significant safety concern across the estate and have escalate these concern to the government risk register just yesterday in respect of raac the comptroller and auditor general be clear that the long term risk it pose take too long to be properly address on the sustained inadequacy of the government capital programme he go even far failure to bite this bullet lead to poor value with more money require for emergency measure or stick plaster approach fail to bite the bullet poor value sticking plaster year into this government those be absolutely damn word from the government own spending watchdog my hon friend will be aware that jonathan slater the former permanent secretary say that civil servant tell the government that there be critical risk to life because of the dodgy building and the failure to follow advice and invest in make sure our school be safe do she agree that this government be seriously put child life at risk through their incompetence and negligence and through the failure of the prime minister to make sure there be proper investment in our school my hon friend be absolutely right if ministers be confident about everything they have do and the decision that be take they will back our motion today allow we to see the paper and be transparent with this house should be shock by the lack of humility from conservative front benchers but sadly be not school be literally collapse around we and the conservatives want people to thank they for it do my hon friend agree that the education secretary need to get grip and explain why her office get million refurbishment while school be crumble under this tory government be grateful to my hon friend who make very important point finally let turn to the wording of the motion know that many conservative members share labour concern and ask they today to think of the young people and the school staff in their constituency however loyal they have be in every past debate ask they to help we put truth and transparency first and to force responsibility on their front benchers it be time for the full truth to come out about why our school be unsafe today and whose decision that be it be time at last for ministers and the prime minister in particular to take and accept responsibility for the broken country they will leave behind commend the motion to the house rise before call the secretary of state it will be obvious to the house that great many people wish to speak this afternoon so there will be time limit of approximately five minute on back bench speech give that warning can see that colleague be look at their long note and hopefully take few page out of they this government be commit to make sure that every child in this country get first class education and every opportunity to make the most of their ability more than that underpin that commitment be deep one to ensure that child be safe and secure in the place where they learn be glad that the hon member for houghton and sunderland south bridget phillipson have choose to raise the issue of the safety of school building and investment in the school estate nothing be more important than the safety of child and staff in our school and no issue could highlight more my willingness to take the right decision even if they be politically difficult the country and the child in our school deserve nothing less as set out in the house on monday the government will not shy away from that responsibility no matter how much the labour party descend into the political gutter understand that parent school and this house be concerned about the issue of raac we be act responsibly and move decisively to address it and minimise disruption to education interruption the right hon member for islington south and finsbury emily thornberry be shout from sedentary position so will answer her question million be sign off for government building for the department for education that be sign off by the department commercial director and be nothing to do with that be base on decision make in before be minister the right hon lady be very experienced so be sure that she will understand that minister do not sign off on government building it be the commercial director of the dfe who sign that off in to go back to the issue in this case because that be very misleading we be deal not with an issue cause in the last year the last five year the last decade or even the last year but with legacy issue date back to the as the chancellor set out we will not shirk this responsibility and we will spend whatever it take to keep child safe in leeds our school repair backlog be over million and the council be give million year by the government to tackle that the lead councillor for education councillor jonathan pryor have write to every single secretary of state for education since eight letter have be send to raise school condition funding but all plea have be ignore do the secretary of state really think that be acceptable will look at leeds specifically but we have award million to leeds the big difference between our programme and any programme that be ever do by your government when they be in power order think the secretary of state mean his government be sorry unlike the hon gentleman government when they be in power we actually do condition survey we have do two condition survey and we have do full raac survey which we be now finish with the response that be come in we know the condition previously the labour government do not know anything about the condition and no decision be make base on the condition of school st francis primary school in my constituency identify raac problem way back in it have to fund its own survey to do that since st francis have submit two bid to make its roof safe and both be reject they appeal both time and both appeal be reject can ask the secretary of state how she can justify the rejection of those bid and how can she justify the potentially much high cost that must now be pay from the public purse to make st francis safe the hon lady raise good point because of course the responsible body st francis have do the right thing by do its survey that be what everybody be ask to do in and in and in guidance since then there be condition and condition base request and if the school want to get in touch and give we the detail be very happy to look at that case be very serious about make sure that we get rid of raac in our school the school estate consist of over school and sixth form college with over block of course the condition vary across the estate and number of building be reach the end of their useful life that be why we have year rebuilding programme and why the spending review in and allocate more than billion for maintenance allocation for school on top of that programme rise should make bit of progress because do have an awful lot of this in the speech really do want to satisfy people with detailed information because have lot of it although local authority academy trust and other body be directly responsible for school building we support they by allocate significant capital funding each year deliver major rebuilding programme and provide guidance on effective estate management responsible body local knowledge of their estate and their work to maintain their estate make they much well place to ensure that school and college building be keep safe compliant with regulation and in good working order however the department always stand ready to provide additional support on case by case basis if we be alert to safety issue by those responsible body this be the normal pattern of maintenance careful and calibrate local response however we judge in this case that the issue of raac require we to take much more proactive and direct approach this approach be unprecedented across the uk where england be lead sense the scale of the potential challenge we improve our surveying so that we have the capacity to act even if we do not need to do so our condition datum collection which run from to visit nearly all school and sixth form college and be one of the large data collection of its kind it help we to understand what be need in school and to target our effort in the way that good meet need in contrast over the year of the last labour government there be not single comprehensive review of the school estate yes that be right they be simply in the dark individual report from the condition datum collection will the secretary of state give way will make bit of progress but be not ignore members and will take other intervention will the secretary of state give way will make bit of progress and then will come back to both hon member as we become aware of the specific issue with raac we supplement the data collection with more target survey especially for raac that be do so that when we make decision we would be able to act will leave colleague to draw their own conclusion from the fact that labour run wales be now play catch up to identify where raac be in its school estate on the question from the hon member for arfon hywel williams we brief wales verbally on new technical guidance on september and we share visual information on three case over the weekend none of we should be here to criticise the scrutiny of safety in school so can thank the department for dispatch fast as request two surveyor to look at the one school in my constituency of gloucester that be potentially affect also thank they for complete their mission fast so that the head could today confirm to his teacher parent and pupil alike that there be no raac in the school whatsoever thank my hon friend and he be absolutely right that be what we be do with any work we be be ultra cautious here the decision have make be ultra cautious and first of all it be to make sure that we survey all school as quickly as possible by the same volition school in my constituency send in the result of the survey on july and be promise by the department that it would be contact on friday or monday with the report but it have hear from no one and it be give telephone number that get it through to the wrong department we now have child out of school as precautionary measure which be surely unacceptable will the secretary of state look at this case but will she also say how many other school be in this position will definitely look at that case because that sound as though it take place before the decision take and also before stand up the caseworker propper cabinet and portacabin if the hon lady will give the detail of that case will look at it because that should not be happen what should be happen be exactly the same as what my hon friend the member for gloucester richard graham lay out the secretary of state be confident it seem that there be enough surveyor to do this work but since she make this decision about school question have be raise about many other public building and suspect structural surveyor be now in much short supply be she still confident that structural engineer and surveyor will be available to do this work and be she stick to her timetable of have answer by the end of next week be confident that because we start early we have do lot of these survey already quite lot of the school be involve at the beginning so be confident of that be also confident that the nhs have conduct survey of its main building and think the court have also do survey however we have now increase the number of survey company from three to eight to make sure that we can get through all the case include any that member be concern about as soon as possible back in january this year submit write question to the government about the number of school in my constituency of wirral west that have building rat as very likely to collapse in the response receive the schools minister say department official be clear that there be no area within school open to pupil where there be know immediate risk of collapse presumably those building would be evacuate if that be the case order appreciate that the secretary of state have be very generous in give way to member but she will not be as aware as be that there be people who wish to speak this afternoon the secretary of state be very politely give way to member who be not go to take part in the debate and if we have long intervention from those member people who be wait to speak will not have the chance to do so when we come to the end of the debate be try to get some fairness into this but do appreciate that the secretary of state be be polite and will allow she to respond to the intervention thank you for that madam deputy speaker and for give the reminder because do not want to take time away from people who have put in to speak what my right hon friend the schools minister say be absolutely right any time there be an immediate risk action be immediately take however what we be do be more preventive than that find out where everything be so that we could act when the three new case happen over the summer that be when make decision to be very cautious because do not want to take any risk whatsoever know exactly where to go because know exactly which school be judge as non critical know exactly what we need to do will the secretary of state give way be sorry but will not give way know promise the hon gentleman but will see if can make bit more progress we deposit copy of the school condition datum in the house libraries on july this year in advance of the summer recess it be also available on the parliament website and be sure that many member who be interested in this subject will be interested in see it the successor programme be now under way early indication from the programme which have be under way since march and will finish in and feedback from the sector suggest that in almost every case where grade bad condition be identify in it have since be address we be get on with the job that be demonstration of the approach that and my department be take we identify where the issue be and how severe it be then we take the right corrective action that be what our child deserve and what our school deserve when we have datum we can act to improve our school the spending review announce total of billion of capital funding to support the education sector between and include billion for school condition allocation that include billion announce in allocation for the first two year of the period to improve the condition of the school estate that be in addition to the school rebuilding programme which be rebuild school over year that build on nearly billion of capital between and include over billion for improve or replace building improve education be this government mission ensure that our education setting be safe be key part of that and we therefore prioritise it as part of our capital funding and actively manage funding and support for the school estate to stay open and safe also note the distinction between our target approach and what come before the system we inherit be find by an independent review of capital to be poorly target and wasteful we on this side of the house have act to protect child while other have ignore problem for decade school building be more effective and efficient than ever before the significant investment make in education in recent year by this government couple with essential reform have raise standard for our child and give they well chance of success in life since we have reform our capital programme to bring down the cost of school building the james review of education capital in find that building schools for the future the programme that the hon member for houghton and sunderland south be proud of be overly bureaucratic and do not deliver outcome that be good or affordable just as the people of birmingham be find out so heartbreakingly today and as see as young girl grow up in liverpool the consequence of labour always see thing bad off than when they start by contrast at the spending review we announce our year school rebuilding programme which will transform building at school across england we have already announce of those school include in december prioritise those in poor condition and with evidence of potential safety issue will my right hon friend give way perhaps could make little more progress as feel will not have be fair if do we currently have further place on the programme and the government will continue to focus on invest in the school estate we strive to deliver value for money it be easy to spend money but get value for money be what the people of this country expect and ensure that our capital funding be spend as efficiently as possible as the national audit office conclude in the priority school building programme the predecessor to our school rebuilding programme replace school more efficiently cost approximately third less per square metre than the previous capital programme building schools for the future we commit to school over year through our rebuilding programme with an average of school enter delivery every year that be in line with the scale of project deliver every year since the start of its predecessor there have be some debate about the scale of rebuild in recent day but the level of our ambition be unchanged we have not scale back our ambition for school rebuilding and we will not although the school rebuilding programme be in its initial stage of delivery it be ramp up as more project begin construction the exact amount that rebuild programme spend will differ year on year base on the stage of delivery that project be in at any give time that be the norm for significant capital project which mean that when we try to make comparison lot of cherry picking go on overall since school have be rebuild or refurbish through our central rebuilding programme and further be in the pipeline we be build school more quickly more efficiently and well target on condition and need than ever before sometimes however there will be issue that we have to deal with outside the normal process the role of government and of ministers be to respond to that and to take ownership and full responsibility when new information about raac cross my desk over the summer understand that the buck stop with even if the problem be year in the making as set out in my statement to the house on monday the safety of pupil and staff be this government absolute priority we have regularly and swiftly update our guidance in line with the late technical advice to ensure that responsible body be aware of the risk and able to act in light of the three new case over the summer and give the disparate nature of the school estate and most importantly the fact that child be involve we make the difficult decision that it be no long reasonable or safe for space know to contain raac to be use that be very difficult decision because there be operational implication for other and an impact on parent and child it be important to note that the technical advice on raac do not say that we must put mitigation in place in all building that be not what the raac advice say where raac be present we can keep it as long as we manage it well we have act with the utmost caution to reassure parent and teacher and to establish comprehensive plan to mitigate and resolve setting with raac because we know where they be let be clear we be able to do that only because we have prepare for this eventuality have hop that that preparation would be unnecessary but sadly it be not and have to take decision be grateful to previous secretaries of state who make decision to ensure that we be able to establish where raac be present and to act rapidly we could show leadership we could show direction and we could tell people exactly where to go with their portacabin and with their propping professional advice from technical expert on raac have evolve over time and the question of how to manage its risk have span successive government since nobody be blameless in that include labour members who be warn in and alike unlike they be interested in keep our child safe and improve learning they try to play politic and they can play politic all they like but as they be find in wales the public can smell opportunism and recoil at politician who fail to show leadership we on the government side of the house see the risk and decide to prepare my department alert the sector about the potential risk of raac in and in february we issue guidance we be concerned that not all responsible body be act quickly enough so we decide to take more direct approach as lay out on monday ensure that we get all the survey we find out where raac be and we take action the vast majority of school will be unaffected as we have set out in information publish today and of the affected setting be offer face to face education for pupil each impact school and college have dedicated caseworker to help implement mitigation plan for the past few day that have be my main concern operationalise this and ensure that we can establish and scale up programme to give school the support they need due to the decision have to take most people will receive little disruption to their education but that could include use other space on the school site or in nearby school or elsewhere in the local area until structural support or temporary building be instal project delivery property and technical expert will be on hand to support school to put face to face education measure in place as quickly as possible we have publish the list of school that we know to be affect by raac and we will be publish an update in two week it be important to give those affect school and college time to focus on mitigation with support from my department and to inform parent directly thank to the hard work of education leader and local council setting be provide face to face learn for all pupil this week further setting have hybrid arrangement in place with some pupil learn off site while have delay the start of term by few day to ensure that pupil can start attend face to face learn safely on site only very small number four have need to move to remote learning we anticipate that the majority of those will be able to offer pupil face to face learn soon ensure that disruption to education be keep to minimum nine setting have since be find not to have raac after be reinvestigate want to be clear that we will spend whatever it take to keep child safe with extra funding come from dfe capital budget to fund mitigation that include pay for emergency mitigation work need to make building safe include alternative classroom space where necessary where school need additional help with revenue cost such as transport to other location we be actively engage with every school affect to put appropriate support in place we will also fund long term refurbishment project or rebuilding project where need take responsibility take action and show leadership as all member know the spending review be the process that determine how the government will spend money over the course of parliament it would be inaccurate incomplete and inappropriate to disclose the detail request of the sensitive negotiation between his majesty treasury and individual departments inaccurate because it would show only part of the picture of complex decision make process that take place between multiple departments ministers official and other individual with vary priority incomplete because such process have to look across the board at priority and trade off for all department to ensure we can deliver for everyone yet this motion focus on only one and inappropriate because it would be categorically in breach of the long stand tradition and expectation that confidential and often commercially sensitive information be not disclose into the public domain and that official can give full and frank advice to ministers some labour members present have themselves serve in government they know that those in the civil service use every ounce of their professional skill to help they as ministers and deliver the objective of the elect government they serve have to ask what would those member say to those official about motion that might result in the making public of the advice of civil servant people who can never answer back themselves which they have think be be give to ministers in confidence we know that they would not want that to be do it be vital to the conduct of good government and very much in the public interest that official and ministers in departments and across government have safe space to provide free and frank advice to inform policy and spending decision note that such an exemption be one of the bedrock of the freedom of information law that the labour party introduce in the case of the spending review and related discussion anything else would undermine that position and make it hard for government now and in the future to make the right balance of decision and to maximise value for money for the taxpayer that can not be right regardless of party colour or the political event of the day repeat what say at the start of this speech nothing be more important than the safety of child and staff in our school we be invest billion of pound rebuild our school and provide the funding and support that academy trust local authority diocese and school need to manage the school and college estate effectively as the prime minister and chancellor have say we will spend whatever it take to keep child safe in our school after this debate will return to that work and to oversee the operational response that ensure we be keep child safe and protect and their education ongoing in the meantime urge all colleague to vote against this motion this evening rise as say early great many people wish to catch my eye so there will be time limit immediately effective of five minute on back bench speech the debate we be have today be important it go to the very heart of what it mean to govern and the very purpose of good government which be to educate and protect our young people properly the issue of the safety of school building and the safety of our child be of paramount importance be shocked that even have to be say but unfortunately what have emerge in the past week have make it apparent that it do despite the secretary of state exasperation on this issue will not be congratulate she on her handling of it the secretary of state be member of party and government that have see school budget as expendable and place to save money whether that be the abolition of labour building schools for the future programme which will say more on later or the prime minister decide in his previous role as chancellor of the exchequer that the safety of our people be not priority for this government view that he have continue into his premiership be sure that the government will be tired of hear the word of jonathan slater the former permanent secretary to the department for education from to but he know what he be talk about he say that the investigation by civil servant lead to they recommend that to school need repair each year the department request treasury funding to cover yet the decision make in be to halve the number of school repair from to who be the chancellor at that time make those decision it be the prime minister who be now preside over this conservative government education crisis this be not just number on page across the country more than school be affect eleven so far have be report in the north east four of which be closed they be vital to the future of our child but those school be now unsafe it be shameful tellingly in his response to the former permanent secretary the prime minister say in an interview with the bbc if you look at what we have be do over the previous decade that completely in line with what we have always do yes cut funding to repair and build school could not agree with the prime minister more it be exactly what conservative government have do over the past decade ignore the priority of the people of sunderland the north east and the country ignore the life chance of our young people and ignore this issue which have be on the government desk for few year we go from crisis to crisis and it be work people and family who suffer that be why we need change in this country build schools for the future the programme that the last labour government have for replace all or part of school that need to be rebuild be abolish by the conservative lead coalition in when labour leave power the economy be grow it be the policy of austerity by the coalition government that lead we to recession the conservatives then be the same as the conservatives now threat to our economy with lack of care for our school in sunderland in under bsf wave the council be inform of an indicative budget of million to cover school rebuild or ict infrastructure replacement when the plug be pull on bsf that funding be withdraw the issue in the school remain today two of those school have be identify on the list of the school in the bad condition in the country thirteen year later action have not be take refurbishment of the other have have to be fund by alternative capital due to the absence of government support six of they be still in need with no progress since that be shocking the use of raac in school building and probably other public building as well be not the responsibility of any one government but sort the problem that have cause be the government complete lack of prioritise school building be fit for purpose or funding education properly have lead to the crisis that many of our school find themselves in today this be self make school crisis that the government have bring on themselves it have force school to close and it be the result of year of neglect by conservative the secretary of state might like to play the victim here but it be our child who be in danger in this crisis someone need to take responsibility for put our young people in danger and so far the prime minister be refuse to accept it the education secretary have say that the safety of school building be not the responsibility order be afraid that the hon lady have exceed she five minute call the chairman of the education committee be grateful for the opportunity to speak in this debate and be grateful to the opposition for give we the opportunity to debate this issue which be of urgent concern across the country the education committee have request ministers to attend session and be glad to report that we will have minister attend the committee the tuesday after next to give evidence on this important issue want to raise some of the specific concern we be hear from school leader about the way in which the announcement come about and their timing think we all agree that it be deeply unfortunate that change have to be make so late in the school holiday and before understand from conversation that have have with ministers today and from public statement that some of the information come to light only very recently the select committee will push for more detailed timeline on when information come to light and when decision be make hear many time when be minister the concern of head and leader in education about announcement make late in the holiday just before school return and think we all agree on that it be deeply unfortunate and troubling in this case however do understand ministers take zero risk approach on roof collapse and child from what have be tell it seem that the estimation of risk the idea that there be low risk and high risk form of raac fundamentally change it be important that we get more detail on that so that we can scrutinise the decision making on the consequence for school we now need to ensure that there be the minimum disruption welcome some of the step set out by the secretary of state in that regard welcome the fact that there be dedicated caseworker work with those school where issue have be identify and that more survey be take place where there be uncertainty would gently say that there be deep concern over the fact that responsible body be many and various in this respect and their capability in understand their building be highly varied what work for large multi academy trust or local authority manage number of school and have dedicated estate team can be different from more isolated school and single academy trust in particular small primary will not necessarily have the expertise to manage these issue seek assurance from the secretary of state that there will be extra support for those more needy school and that the department will cover the cost where there be uncertainty of surveying it be important that we have that assurance in the come week be grateful to the chair of the public accounts committee the hon member for hackney south and shoreditch dame meg hillier that be able to join that committee session on school capital before the summer and to question the permanent secretary at the department for education over raac at the time it seem that visit relate to raac and the gathering of information be be accelerate but give what we know now in the light of the risk change it be great shame that all those visit have not be complete by that time and we do not have more complete risk picture an update on the figure give to that committee would be useful look forward to join the public accounts committee in our scrutiny of this issue when it meet next week there be many more question to ask crucially we need to ensure that lesson be learn from this for the long run and that when we build public building we do so with material that have life that will match their use that mean multiple generation not year or year rise will give way briefly to the hon gentleman but want to conclude shortly be grateful to the hon gentleman for give way give the concern he be now express about how public building be build in the past do he stand by his comment about labour motion on school building in may that he describe at the time as scaremongere that motion be similar to this one humble address which for the reason already set out do not think be an effective way of go about get the relevant information think that proper parliamentary scrutiny be the way and absolutely intend to provide that proper parliamentary scrutiny there be huge risk in the approach that the opposition be take with repeat humble addresses undermine the confidentiality of advice give by official to ministers the idea that future labour government would want to disclose all submission in spending review be be afraid for the bird we have to be realistic about make sure we have proper process of scrutiny will hold ministers to account on this and as chair of the select committee have lot of question to ask my member do as well and know that number of they have affect school in their constituency we will want to press ministers on those issue do not think that humble address be the right way to go about it and that be why will not support the motion but do fundamentally believe that we must ensure there be more investment in replace school building and increase investment in the quality of the school estate yes that be to address issue such as raac but it be also to address issue that have cause real harm such as asbestos which we may not have much time to talk about in the debate it be important to take into account the point make by the chair of the work and pensions committee the right hon member for east ham sir stephen timms in that respect as well will not detain the house long because will have my opportunity with the select committee to ask ministers much more this be hugely important issue and we need all government to get it right urge ministers in the uk government to work with the devolved administration to ensure that they can take the proactive measure need to make school across the uk utterly safe want to start by extend my thought to every student parent teacher and school staff member who be this week have their education disrupt unable to do their job or have to work around the clock to find alternative teaching setting my first question be what new evidence have be present do not believe that evidence be the right word to be use through the public accounts committee nao report and visit have be look at raac and just from have glance online it be easy to find multiple report include report from february by the institution of structural engineers that say that although visual survey help to assess the condition of panel the nature of any warning sign of sudden failure at the bearing be not fully know not all defect be visible panel which appear to be in good condition may conceal hide defect which could present risk to the integrity of the panel the corrosion of reinforcement could lead to large piece of raac fall which present risk to occupant so do not believe that there be new evidence what believe be that the risk have come to fruition what we need to understand be why in this place we have not take the risk seriously enough when we have know since about the risk of sudden failure without any warning sign thankfully have be inform by the dfe that it be not aware of any confirmed case of raac in my constituency but government action have undermine my constituent confidence in the inspection process one school which we be in close communication with have second survey carry out this week by the local authority after there be confusion by the department as to whether the first survey have take place raac be not identify in either survey however some part of the survey could not be complete due to the possible presence of asbestos leave that school in limbo not know if raac present problem underneath the asbestos parent should not have to worry about the safety of their child when they send they to school and teacher should not be worried about their workplace be at risk of collapse but here we be be frankly not that surprise that the secretary of state say it be not the job of the department for education to ensure that child be learn in safe school environment at the start of the year raise the case of my constituent carla parent who suffer serious head injury after foot piece of board fly off the outside of her child school she suffer significant injury she have black eye and go on to have headache she need to have an mri scan and minor scarring and she still suffer from tinnitus it could have be lot bad someone could have die as result of that event as carla say in her statement to this could have be prevent and it be pure luck that no one die that happen when she be go to collect her child it be exceedingly lucky that the three incident this summer happen when no one be there to be hurt accord to datum from the government from to school in sheffield have at least one grade poor construction type and be find to have at least one grade construction type have visit school and speak to headteacher all of whom report similar story of decade old building go unchecked repair to the basic be leave undone and of struggle to manage capital budget that have be cut over the year to fix thing such as boiler be really concerned that to grapple with this issue we need to ensure that all the school estate be look at in the round so that issue such as asbestos do not get forget while two school benefit from the government last round of funding it be barely enough to cover the basic repair many miss out on any funding at all have to question why the guidance to school on this year funding round state that not all raac be dangerous would like to ask the secretary of state if she stand by that statement that not all raac be dangerous why be it not the aim to eradicate raac from school as state by the nhs and the department of health and social care finally hope that school will be reimburse for the cost associate with raac litigation and set up classroom and temporary accommodation want to know what assurance the secretary of state have receive that the odd school await inspection or that have be inspect be the upper limit of those at risk of raac what assurance do she and the department for education have about the quality of the survey be conduct rise as the member of parliament who unfortunately probably have more raac school than any other that do not take into account nearby secondary school three of which be identify on the list of cancel project in the building schools for the future programme with raac in colchester in the constituency of my right hon friend the member for witham priti patel and which be all likely to be attend by pupil from my constituency heave deep sigh opposition day debate be about blame the government have be in opposition and we all know that they be not about what have fundamentally go wrong and what lesson there be to be learn like the prime minister as he point out early on the spending review can find no reference to raac school in hansard relate to any statement urgent question or debate from when the building schools for the future programme be cancel and cancel it be for very good reason labour motion be retrospectively try to allocate blame in the past not explain what labour government would do now or in future be tempt to my foot to say that there be properly plan programme of renewal of school and although raac in itself be not the only issue be look at it be part of that discussion just because it be not name do not mean that there be not plan there be plan and conservative secretary of state ax that on day one of the coalition government that be of no comfort to my constituent be afraid because nearly all the school concern be primary school and there be no primary school in the building schools for the future programme because it be politically drive programme fund by the discredit public finance initiative which make it extremely expensive do not think we should go back there the labour party do not actually criticise what my right hon friend the secretary of state decide last week to protect the safety of schoolchildren and teacher that be the subject of my intervention on the shadow secretary of state the hon member for houghton and sunderland south bridget phillipson do she think that the secretary of state have do the wrong thing will give way to she now if she would like to say that be not secretary of state no but the point be that this debate arise because the secretary of state make brave and courageous decision to act on the advice she be give the opposition have nothing whatever to say about that she do the right thing interruption if the shadow secretary of state want to intervene by all mean she may the hon gentleman would do well to show little humility for the mess that his party have create right across our school there we have it the hon lady will not say that the secretary of state have do the wrong thing let the politic play itself out what we have here be much more fundamental wide systemic failure in the management of building safety which have go on for decade dr john roberts the former president of the institution of structural engineers write in the times early this week as chartered structural engineer in active practice from the early never consider use raac as it do not feel correct for permanent structure so why be it use one lesson be that perhaps minister should encourage their official to challenge they more with uncomfortable truth let we agree that the wide question be why such critical building safety issue be systemically neglect decade after decade we should thank the good lord that none of the ceiling collapse on classroom of pupil or the government would by now be announce full public inquiry rather like the grenfell inquiry there the parallel continue because like cladding raac be long persist and neglect building safety risk which successive government have fail to address and other include the former fire and housing minister nick raynsford the former chief investigator of the air accident investigation branch dr keith conradi and senior building surveyor kevin savage make submission to the grenfell inquiry our recommendation to help to address the failing be principally twofold and relate to unresolved conflict of interest in the building safety management regime of building which be not address by the building safety act or the establishment of the building safety body which be now statutory function of the health and safety executive at present it be the hse will the hon gentleman give way no will press on if may at present it be the hse that decide how building safety failure should be investigate unless the government take over with their own inquiry there be need for truly independent building safety investigation body equivalent to the accident investigation body in aviation marine rail and offshore safety no regulator like the hse should also investigate safety failure because it may find itself conflict if part of the failure arise from failure of regulation that be what lord cullen find in the paddington rail crash inquiry and why the rail accident investigation branch of the department for transport be establish will the hon member give way be sorry have no time the second conflict that need to be resolve concern the role of local authority building control body and their private sector counterpart know as approve inspector the building safety act will regulate the private sector approve inspector but not local authority building control which be not only responsible for approve the cladding on grenfell tower but hazard guess probably approve the building control on most of the school build with raac the main point be that failure such as raac and clad arise because of the failure of the building management safety system which be endemic to that system the failure also arise from the failure to find the cause of build safety incident through proper independent investigation body that possess permanent accumulate expertise that one off public inquiry have to attempt to acquire from scratch hope that amid the politicking all political party will recognise that such reform be necessary in build safety management or there will be more systemic failure in build safety arise from thing such as the wrong cladding and the wrong concrete in the future have second if the hon member for wansbeck ian lavery would like to intervene very briefly do the hon member think that the government reduction in the hse budget since be helpful in this situation have hop that the hon gentleman would raise point relevant to my speech there have be enough politick about this issue be make more serious comment about the building safety management system of this whole country which affect whole lot of other public building as well fear will upset the chair of the liaison committee the hon member for harwich and north essex sir bernard jenkin because will use my speech to blame the government the secretary of state must be the only scouser have ever meet who think liverpool be leave well after the last year of conservative government it have be evident to my constituent for many year that our public service be crumble under the tory government never have that phrase have rarely be so literal as it have become in the last few day just day before school be set to reopen after the summer holiday our education system be throw into chaos by the crisis of unsafe concrete in our public building more than school have already be force to close due to the risk of collapse the prime minister himself suggest that more than could be affect this scandal go to the heart of the incompetence and short termism that have characterise the last year the emerge timeline of event be truly staggering upon take office in the tory liberal democrat government scrap labour school rebuilding programme which the then education secretary call waste of money department for education official say that to school need to be rebuild every single year because of degrade concrete but the government say they would only pay for in the department be inform of the sudden collapse of roof on school in kent since summer its own risk register recognise critical and very likely risk that building collapse could cause death or injury official in the department again ask for funding for school rebuild to be double instead the then chancellor now prime minister recklessly cut school funding in half now our school the bedrock of our society be literally potentially collapse around we and the tory government have the audacity to expect gratitude today labour will force bind vote to reveal what the prime minister know about the risk pose by reinforce autoclaved aerate concrete before slash the school rebuilding programme conservative mp have choice stand with those of we on the labour benches and let parent know the truth or stand with the government and cover up what be know and the scale of the crisis the crumble concrete in school hospital and court be fitting metaphor for tory rule and the year of neglect of public service across the country after year of conservative lead government britain be fall apart our nhs be on the verge of collapse our railway be in chaos raw sewage be be pump into our river and housing be unaffordable and insecure my constituent say election after election that enough be enough hope the rest of the country will follow suit shortly we need nothing short of national renewal and labour stand ready to take office and begin the difficult task of rebuild britain for the well unlike some welcome the opportunity to follow up monday statement from the government front bench and my right hon friend the secretary of state to discuss raac more than school in essex be affect and begin by pay tribute to essex county council and its leadership councillor kevin bentley councillor tony ball and officer lead by claire kershaw they have be robust in their leadership and be do so much to help parent teacher and pupil should add that our council be work not just with local authority school but academy trust too they be not say that it will help one school over another they be step up to deal with the challenge and we be grateful to they commend they for convene essex mps madam deputy speaker my right hon friend the member for epping forest dame eleanor laing have also raise concern on behalf of her school directly with the county council as have the minister for skills apprenticeships and higher education my right hon friend the member for harlow robert halfon he have school that be affect sir frederick gibberd college we be work together because we believe in find solution we be not interested in politick at this time want to thank parent and pupil in essex for understand the difficulty we be all face they have be inconvenience by the raac issue but it be important to point out that certainly in my constituency community group and business have come forward to help find alternative provision and site thank they too the focus right now have to be on find solution to the immediate challenge we be face minimise disruption to learn and ensure affected pupil parent and school be support do not think they be interested in political point scoring they want answer and solution will use my time to put some question to those on the government front bench and know they will come back on they in due course welcome from the minister the detail of the step that have be take across government to mobilise the strong operational that be the whole point delivery response we want the prime minister give an assurance early that all funding necessary will be provide include capital and revenue that be important because our county council be already liaise co ordinating and cover cost in the interim it will be send in an invoice and we hope it will come to the department for education the council will of course need to know when those cost will be meet and who in the department it will be liaise with so would like some assurance on that we have concern about the impact on learn have raise raise it on monday in this house concern around child with special need disability and vulnerability and the impact of miss learning on parent with difficulty around childcare we be look at find practical solution so would welcome any update from the front bench on that too we will need to think about how the impact particularly on exam and ofsted inspection will be manage it be inevitable post pandemic that we will see more ofsted inspection locally know that from my own school but we have key year group in exam year and we have to support they on temporary measure be put in place all member will be concern about the pressure on the market and the demand for portable classroom and facility the secretary of state and have already speak about those demand and the potentially increase cost so it would be helpful for the government to give supply update alongside the pressure of supply for temporary classroom be the impact on the construction sector and extra insurance cost and premium school and the local authority will be look at those issue and quality control measure this have already be touch on in the debate and over the past few day but issue other than raac be affect our school and have raise they in the past such as damp and old building that be wear out and need update and replace perhaps not today this be an opposition day debate but we will need an update on what this all mean for we go forward finally this be difficult and challenging time for teacher school pupil and parent on behalf of all of those affect in the witham constituency essex and the whole country today be chance for the government to give an assurance that they will do everything possible to ensure that face to face education can come back for affected school and that we be do everything we can to support they early today the prime minister say that he have act decisively on raac early this week the secretary of state say that school in which critical raac have be identify have be fix immediately as we have come to expect from this government neither of those statement be true critical raac be identify at st james catholic primary school in my constituency in june and action be not take immediately or indeed at all it be tell that it could open in part and then as with many other school it receive just hour notice that it have to close in full school would not be in this position have the government act decisively they have know raac be unsafe since and they could and should have take action much early decade of cut money from vital public service have literally leave building crumble and leave our kid at risk sit in unsafe building the government decision have leave all our public service on their knee not just our school but crumble hospital and court it be not just the building whole service have collapse staff too be be fail worker in school the nhs and local government have all be leave prop up service huge increase in workload couple with real term pay cut have also leave public sector worker at the point of collapse we know that the government rhetoric on level up be yet more untruth and we know why the prime minister boast about move money from poor area to rich area cut tax on champagne spend million on new office while our northern community like hebburn boldon jarrow and gateshead in my constituency be leave behind it do not surprise to see so many of my colleague from the north east present today community be neglect and leave pay the price of tory chaos while ministers their spouse and their crony get rich conservative members attempt to gaslight the country into believe that everything be okay but despite their panto scream during prime minister question they know the reality that year of tory governments have ruin our country from the cost of living crisis and food and energy bill to our water school and nhs every part of our country be fall down the secretary of state like to keep say that decision be nothing to do with but the fact that our school and the country be fall apart be absolutely down to the government at this moment thousand of parent be petrify because of this crisis while we have prime minister and secretary of state with foot of clay they need to accept that their time be up and move aside so that the labour party can start clear up the mess that they have cause no member of parliament would dispute the crucial importance of safe and secure school premise or indeed all vital premise whether those be hospital court or prison or the fact that they require adequate government investment implicit in the opposition motion however be an allegation that the conservative government have fail on education and fail child more broadly and that be charge that do not accept nor in fact do some of labour most revered figure philip collins write in the times on monday say the core case for the government would be in education its emphasis on academic knowledge have be salutary he go on to say that the conservative free school programme create productive experiment in school improvement can attest to that because send my kid to free school he continue the stress on phonic to teach reading introduce in by the schools minister have work in per cent of year pupil achieve the expect reading level by that have rise to per cent member must be familiar with this by now but in this year progress in international reading literacy study an international five yearly assessment the uk rank fourth globally and first in the western world for child literacy the proportion of school rat good or outstanding by ofsted have increase from two third in when we come to office to today time be limited so will not go on but the fact be that the quality of child education have never be high because of the reform introduce by this conservative government let now deal with the issue of building there be good aspect of labour building schools for the future programme st bartholomew school in my constituency be rebuild as result of that programme and give labour credit for that however the private finance initiative programme be badly lacking the national audit office note that the building be third more expensive than it need to be and that be not in dispute the independent james review say in that building schools for the future have be time consume and have an approach that with hindsight be expensive and do not get to school with the great need fast enough give the dire state of the public finance when we come to office it be right to shelve that scheme know that that the note leave by the right hon member for birmingham hodge hill liam byrne do the round on social medium and labour members will groan but it still blow my mind that senior member of the last labour government think it be joke that they have run down the public finance in that way to they the interest of the public be somehow derisory and secondary to the primary objective of thumb their nose at the incoming conservative government who have just win general election entirely disagree with the claim that the conservatives have put nothing in place of that programme in the three and half year in which have represent my constituency brilliant new primary school highwood copse have open in the south of newbury two more francis baily primary and whiteland park primary in thatcham have receive significant fund for badly need overhaul three secondary school trinity park house and kennet have also receive significant fund in fact only one secondary school have not receive money john secondary in hungerford be one of the school select for funding from the government billion school rebuilding programme in september have watch school premise in my constituency improve significantly so know that the money be there finally want to align myself with what be say by the chair of the education committee my hon friend the member for worcester mr walker know from work closely with my local headteacher that they need information and transparency respect the secretary of state for take difficult decision in the light of information that become available but would also say that the information publish today reveal more positive picture than be first fear more than of the school affect less than of the total of in the country be already back in operation and run face to face teaching only four be currently online do not like online teaching it do not work very well for my kid understand from what the prime minister say that we be talk about matter of day or week so ask the secretary of state for transparency and clear timeline for those school the shadow secretary of state for education say that the symbol of year of conservative government be child cower under concrete block but the endure image of year of conservative government be high level of academic excellence than have ever be achieve by any government and that would be impossible under anyone other than the conservatives in the week of the first anniversary of prime ministerial reign that be outlast by lettuce we again see lay bare the staggering incompetence of this conservative government mortgage holder private renter and those look to get on the housing ladder bear the brunt of that debacle this time it be child parent and teacher who be pay the price for the government failure and failure do not get much big than this the prime minister decision to slash the number of school to be rebuild reportedly against the advice of official have leave classroom up and down the country unsafe to learn in taxis on many parent have never be high it be not unreasonable for they to expect that their child could go to school that be not at risk of crumble around they yet the conservatives seemingly disagree with that not especially lofty aspiration they want my constituent to thank they for do good job as vital public service be quite literally run into the ground my experience of the conservatives school shamble come at quarter to last friday when receive letter from the same secretary of state who want to be pat on the back for do good job because she know where the affected setting be in that letter she advise that an education provider with many site across greater manchester have confirm case of raac at its site in my constituency assume an error as be previously unaware of any issue call the mps hotline to confirm whether the affected site be indeed in my constituency the adviser be adamant that it be despite my protestation it be only when speak to the principal of the site in my constituency that it become clear that the site be completely fine and that there be no raac involve at all the secretary of state be nod the site refer to be mile away in another constituency and be different part of the same group for this to happen once would be bad but for it to happen twice in the same letter this be comedy of error from secretary of state who supposedly know where the affected building be be deeply concern of the four school that be notify be at risk from raac one be not even in my constituency this be just glimpse of the chaos and incompetence that have characterise the past week if the secretary of state be lean into her knowledge of where the problem be as an example of her efficacy suggest that she rethink her strategy countless school be now in limbo with headteacher be tell that they have suspect issue with raac but will have to wait week for survey to confirm it what horrible position to put school leader in should they tell parent about suspect raac issue and risk cause unnecessary panic or should they say nothing to parent about their child learn in potentially unsafe building have the conservatives not cancel labour school rebuilding programme in every secondary school building in england would have be significantly refurbish or rebuild by instead the define image of this government will be child sit in unfit building worry that the ceiling could literally crumble above they if the conservatives want any credibility on education they should vote with labour today to release the document show what the prime minister know when he be chancellor about the risk pose to child from raac before he slash school rebuilding programme in and when he know it for member who think that parent child and school staff deserve answer on who be responsible for this mess and have right to know the true scale of this crisis there be only one way to vote today and that be to support this motion it be pleasure to contribute to this debate have school in my constituency that be affect by raac wood green academy and pay tribute to james topham its headteacher who have do fantastic job of swing into action by staggering start time and ensure as well as possible that education can continue thank my right hon friend the minister for schools for work with over the weekend and in the early part of this week to address that situation know his official have follow the issue closely and will continue to do so the frustration for wood green academy be that its two affected block house specialist classroom for design and technology and for other important specialist part of the curriculum that we need to support particularly in my constituency to ensure the participation of student pay tribute to the school for its work to minimise disruption in listen to this debate it have be nice to hear that the opposition finally remember where wednesbury be for the benefit of labour members it be about mile from birmingham which be the council they bankrupt yesterday wednesbury be in sandwell where the council be put into special measure because there be lack of transparency and borderline corruption in the way that labour be run the authority wednesbury be also about mile from stoke on trent which have just say it have go bankrupt too will not take lecture from labour members on chaos we need to look at the big picture my hon friend the member for newbury laura farris give fantastic speech and pay tribute to the measured way in which she tackle this issue the issue of funding have be at the heart of some of the opposition line today but the shame and scandal of labour pfi programme continue to haunt my community hope that when the minister sum up he will confirm that if school with pfi contract be impact in any way by the need for emergency remediation we will consider way to resolve the issue cause one of my headteacher have have to choose between buy book and pay to get the grass cut that be the legacy of labour school building programme and this be in the most deprived community possible labour member sit there and they gaslight with this arrogance that wind up the community represent all they have do be turn their back on those community it be as simple as that every single labour member should apologise for the legacy of pfi because it be scandalous absolutely scandalous once again it be my constituent who will have to suffer for half century because they lot decide to play fast and loose however they wish it be absolutely outrageous we have to look to the future and the truth be that government funding particularly in my constituency have be quite generous last year there be announcement of condition improvement funding for silvertrees academy and ocker hill academy both in tipton in some of the most deprived and needy part of my community we have also see cash increase in the basic need allowance for to say that there have be slashing of funding and capital investment be narrative that my community simply do not recognise the technical point of the motion be important as say when we debate similar motion early this year the house have mechanism that we can use to allow for the scrutiny that the motion suggest my hon friend the member for worcester mr walker the chair of the select committee be no long here but he touch on that as the secretary of state say and as former ministers know although be unfortunately not one of they it be important that minister be able to take discreet advice from their official so that they can make the right decision without fear that official who can not stand up for themselves will be put at the forefront of scrutiny can not support the motion because it undermine process that labour members use themselves when they be in government please help we if that ever happen again find it hilarious that they think that the motion propose viable process that would not set precedent in any way shape or form let get to the heart of this we need transparency thank my right hon friend the minister for schools for the work that he have do we clearly have to look at the matter from an operational point of view and at the core of it be make sure that child get the education they deserve support the motion which stand in the name of my hon friend the member for houghton and sunderland south bridget phillipson and the leader of the opposition it be interesting to follow the hon member for west bromwich west shaun bailey may just correct he by say that pfi be start by the conservative major government as pupil parent and teacher be prepare for new school term last week and this week they be meet with horrify news that throw into question whether their school be safe to go into headteacher be leave scramble around over the weekend to arrange new site and portacabin or bad tell parent that their child be not to come into school this week rise will not give way as know there be quite few people to speak school have be rush to book survey to find out whether they have raac this be week when parent should be fill with joy and excitement about new year take photo of their year in their new uniform not worry about how to find holiday childcare for another week or two week who know this situation do not happen by accident conservative member like to pretend that the past year be fever dream but this crisis stem primarily from the decision make in to cancel labour building schools for the future scheme it be massive and historic programme of investment that investment would have benefit school in my constituency and across england school that have raac school that have asbestos and school that have have little serious investment over the previous year of conservative government prior to in the conservatives cancel that programme because they do not know the value of investment or the role of public service and do not care about the condition of our school the prime minister be so out of touch with the country that he struggle to use contactless card machine what hope do we have that he might really understand uk state school when the prime minister be chancellor he make the decision to block extra funding to the department for education funding that would have go towards fix repair and improve our school estate one of the most senior civil servant in that department even admit that funding for school building be block because the government want to push more towards free school for example that involve pay million of taxpayer money way overpay for former sport facility on old metropolitan open land in osterley once again the conservative ideology trump value for money and public safety we live in country where ambulance do not turn up the police have to be order to investigate crime and school building now face collapse thirteen long year of conservative rule have utterly ruin our public service there be no more fitting legacy than the fact that the public realm be literally collapse in front of we the letter receive from the dfe on monday say that there be nothing more important than the safety of child young people and staff in education setting even if that be the view of official within the dfe it clearly be not the view of the prime minister who be chancellor in when the government know about this problem indeed there have be warning long before that if the government really think that there be nothing more important than the safety of child young people and staff in education setting why be school collapse and why be child be tell to say at home this week hon member have choice today they can vote with labour and give parent the right to know who be responsible for this mess or they can vote to conceal the true scale of the crisis and the prime minister failure to keep our child safe be grateful for the chance to speak in the debate follow the statement make by the secretary of state for education early this week draw the attention of colleague on both side of the house to the speech make by my hon friend the member for newbury laura farris this be bad timing on my part as she be just leave the chamber about the legacy of this government on education which be something to be proud of will not use my time to repeat her point but when post on my facebook page later will add link to her speech so that all my constituent can see it too in year of conservative government standard have go through the roof my right hon friend the schools minister and other in government should be proud of that and trumpet it at every possible opportunity can point to recent example in my own constituency include queen elizabeth academy oak tree primary school and vision west nottinghamshire college that have go through difficult time in term of quality but be rat good some for the first time ever because of incredible amount of local work and drive for high standard and well opportunity for kid in my constituency from this government no one should let anybody tell they that the conservatives do not care about kid education or school because that be demonstrably nonsense in the debate labour members have be ask for information that they would never release themselves if the shoe be on the other foot they would never allow that to happen and they would vote against such motion they know perfectly well that there have to be the ability to have confidential conversation behind the scene when budget be set because otherwise no idea would ever come forward and no plan would ever be make the government be release information about school in england which be be publish today but that can not be do for school in wales because labour run wales do not have that information as work to mitigate the challenge have not be do my right hon friend the secretary of state have very little choice last week when she make the decision there be no choice about when expert advice come forward and change the balance of risk she have to take risk averse safety first approach that be absolutely the right thing to do the immediate response have be very good feel her frustration yesterday because this work have not just happen in the last week but have be go on for year the department for education take decision identify the school support those school and commit the fund to tackle the problem that happen fairly quickly and the outcome as my hon friend the member for newbury say be that few school be affect than be originally think last week that be something of success the history of the issue go back several year the idea raise by opposition members that the problem emerge only last week or in be nonsense be the leader of county council the responsible body for maintain school in my constituency and around it we have be do survey work with the dfe since so it have be ongoing for long time there have be local and national condition improvement fund to work on the quality of those school in that time as result when the announcement be make last week we have very good datum and information to be able to tackle the situation quickly the sum total of affected school in nottinghamshire there be no affected school in my constituency be one primary school be delay in its return by couple of day that be not an accident it have happen because lot of work funding and support have go in over long period of time in place where that have not happen the dfe step in directly in which be good and responsible thing to do pay tribute to the work of colleague in the department and in my own council who have manage this well over number of year we have local million school condition improvement fund of our own and four school in my constituency be be rebuild these be all good news story for school not just because of the quality of education have describe but for school building in my constituency and around it the level of new school over decade be consistent with any programme in recent decade the number under the programme that labour members be laud end up be something like or few than that they never reach the target they say they be go to reach shock horror this problem be an issue back in to but it be never mention at any point they tell we now that if they have be in government they would have use their psychic power to figure out the problem before the expert do and would have tackle it well in advance of course we know that that be not true or possible the big concern want to raise be about reassurance have hear three time from opposition members that school be literally fall down around our child name one because they be not each time hear that be remind that will be get email from my constituent say be worried about my kid safety in their school when no school be affect in my constituency they do not need to worry and those kid have all go back every single one safely to school this week that fearmongering and rhetoric be irresponsible parent will be unnecessarily worried about the condition of their kid school when know for all the reason have describe that we have manage this well over number of year and it be not an issue in my constituency urge hon member to think long and hard before they put that unnecessary stress on parent who be already find this difficult thank those on the opposition front bench for select this urgent issue today and my hon friend the member for houghton and sunderland south bridget phillipson for her opening remark today debate will mean lot to my constituent many of whom have be throw into disarray because of this avoidable scandal how tory back benchers vote this afternoon will show those constituent just whose side they be on the side of parent teacher and pupil or the side of this rotten government who need to go my constituent want two thing today first they want ministers to know exactly what they have to go through when st leonard catholic school in my constituency be order to close last friday secondly they want to know what the government be do for they and their child so that this crisis do not become disaster mention in my contribution on monday that the closure of st leonard cause real difficulty and distress for my constituent they understand that this be not the fault of st leonard which by the way have lobby the schools minister in the coalition year about its crumble school but they do know that this be the fault of conservative ministers past and present on friday at the last minute childcare and work have to be rearrange all against backdrop of austerity and the cost of living crisis one of my constituent could not afford to take time off work so they have to ask their parent to take time off to look after their child parent have tell that this have cause their child anxiety and frustration child who have already be through so much because of the disruption of the pandemic parent have also write to to express how horrified they be that they have be send their child to an unsafe school they be perplex about why the school could not have close early after all raac be identify in the spring and we have have an entire school holiday to repair this mess parent and child alike be extremely concerned by the effect that this situation may have on gcse result there be already grade attainment gap due to inequality between the north east and the rest of the country something my constituent know all too well which far compound their anxiety should say madam deputy speaker that have hear more practical idea from my constituent than have from ministers or the local council which have be absent throughout this crisis even in time of great stress parent be think of way to help their child and their child friend as be durham university which have be of great assistance to my office since last friday the same can not be say of ministers who be more concerned with inter departmental argument between no and the department for education the education secretary tell on monday that there would be financial support for st leonard but will support also be offer to the parent and pupil who have be affect will additional travel cost be reimburse will the department meet extra staff cost will the department meet all the capital cost or will st leonard be expect to pay and will the education secretary return to the house next week to outline support package be mainly think of those parent of child with special educational need as well as child on free school meal teacher at st leonard have tell that they be most concerned about the impact on those child from vulnerable background for whom school be safe haven conservative members must do the right and honourable thing this afternoon and join we in the lobby if they do not they will have no right to ever say that they be on the side of hard work parent pupil or teacher the education of the next generation be an issue that be close to my heart as be the case for member across the house on that we can agree this afternoon it be our duty to ensure that child can study with minimal disruption strongly support the measure that the secretary of state have take to address the issue of raac in school throughout england wish to highlight three of those measure the first be that the government have act quickly to issue guidance to school on how to manage the risk associate with raac which be in sharp contrast to what the welsh government have do in the department for education publish guidance for school about the need to have adequate contingency if they have raac it initiate its survey of the school estate for raac in march and update the guidance in light of new evidence last month the second point that will make be that the uk government will ensure that school have the funding that they need so that teacher can focus on get student back to school and so that student be safe the chancellor and the prime minister have confirm that the government will spend what it take to address the problem as quickly as possible so that child can go to school safely the third point that will emphasise be that the government be ensure that the majority of school affect by raac remain open for face to face teaching minimise the disruption to student learn by support school to put mitigation in place the government have help the majority of school to remain open for face to face teaching ensure that disruption to pupil in affected school be minimise in contrast the opposition be play politic and refuse to take responsibility for their failing in government they fail to address issue with raac despite warning about the problem in and from the building research establishment and the standing committee on structural safety finally as welsh mp for clwyd south make no apology for comment on the situation in wales note that no welsh mp have take part in the debate or be present on the opposition benches this afternoon the welsh government have take their eye off the ball rely on council to do the work that the uk conservative government be lead on in england as say in my early intervention the welsh government order survey only in may the uk government start engage with school in march where be the accountability where be the responsibility that lack of preparation work mean that school survey in wales will not be complete until december this year education have be devolve to wales for year labour be in charge of school in wales so building safety be its responsibility the welsh government receive for every spend on education in england but in the independent auditor general for wales discover that only reach the classroom labour prioritise its vanity project such as new blanket mph speed limit cost the economy billion and introduce legislation for more politician in the welsh parliament but it have cut the education budget in wales in real term this year the welsh government approach to raac show woeful lack of responsibility by the labour party in wales of which they and those on the opposition benches should be deeply ashamed couple of people have drop out which give we little more time will remove the time limit for bit and see how we go may have to reinstate it but little more time be available while it be welcome that it have be report today that raac have not be find in any of our school in salford must stress that the fact that the government be unable to produce that information until today have know about the risk since at least when school roof in kent collapse be completely unacceptable be glad that salford have no school with raac problem but in bolton we find out on friday that st william of york st andrew church of england and st bernard be affect st bernard be not even on any list and st gregory be still await the result do you agree that the government should publish the full list not the half bake one that they publish this afternoon order the hon lady know that she must not address she hon friend as you otherwise she be address apologise completely agree with my constituency neighbour stress that not just school be affect by this crisis it extend to public building and concern have be raise in recent day by the building industry that certain residential property particularly social housing could also be affect on hospital alone report by the national audit office in july this year say that structurally unsound raac be present in at least hospital the turnberg building at salford royal hospital be report to be one of they despite this clear national building safety crisis there be no detail from government on what action will or will not be take no detail on the urgent funding and support that will be provide to remediate and no assurance so far that the cost will not come out of exist school nhs and local authority budget worse still there appear to be an emerge message today from government that this crisis be stand alone that it be simply sad indictment of less regulate old building practice that be now outdated that be not the true story the real culprit here be the unashamed pursuit of austerity by this government and the coalition before they let we not forget that to start with the coalition rip up labour building schools for the future programme in and never adequately replace it worse still between and the department for education capital spending decline by in cash term and in real term that be in addition to nhs and local authority budget be slash on similar basis with the effect that most ongoing public sector estate upgrade programme be tear to shred sadly as the institute for fiscal studies state the current crisis illustrate just how costly fail to keep on top of necessary investment in building and infrastructure can be how much money be actually require have the government take action on school when it should have the national audit office in publish report on capital spending that state that it would cost billion to return all school to satisfactory or well condition that report be also clear that there be significant risk of major cost arise from deterioration of the estate action be need in but in november in the government spending review they allocate only billion less than half the amount of investment require just to keep building tick over safely then the story become even more absurd in march realise that there be problem the department for education send questionnaire to all school ask if they have raac on their estate but later tell school not to spend any money on survey to find out even after that in may when government document be leak to the observer show that school building could be risk to life cause great alarm in school up and down the country half the school then apply for funding to remediate and do not get penny from government in june the national audit office say the condition of school building be decline and warn that pupil be learn in building that it describe as unsafe or ageing it state clearly that the dfe have receive significantly less funding for school building than it estimate it need between and the government know that this crisis be come and the cause of this crisis be very deliberate austerity be be and always will be political choice but it be both immoral and economically illiterate the only political choice the government should have make be to ensure the safety of their people sadly if they have make that choice the cost borne then would be mere shadow of the cost require today to assist with guidance will put seven minute limit on it be pleasure to follow the hon member for salford and eccles rebecca long bailey my fellow science innovation and technology committee member we begin this debate with bit of lecture from the shadow education secretary who presume to tell we what the nature of government be government involve difficult decision it involve respond to event but it also involve live within our mean and prioritise the safety of the people we represent in particular that of child as other hon member have say in this debate honestly believe the education secretary have no other option when the risk assessment change as result of thing that happen just in august she take rapid proactive and very precautionary decision to make sure we address it in the most appropriate way possible she demonstrate the wisdom of that approach in the response she give member on both side of the house during her statement on monday when labour be in charge of thing it do not always take that approach it fail on all the thing that have mention labour fail in place such as birmingham where it have run out of money and in neighbour stoke on trent which look like it will go bankrupt as well it have clobber people with taxis in place such as london where the mayor and his ultra low emission zone be epically unpopular with voter and the hard work family who have to pay that cost and of course on this particular issue labour fail in wales where it have have its head in the sand have look at the bbc list of all the affect school in england scotland and wales for wales there be link to one article that say that only two affected school be find both in anglesey well in construction scandal that have affect country across the world with all the building build with raac over the year if there be only two in the whole of the welsh education establishment will eat my hat two have be find in anglesey but labour need to get its finger out and start find the other as soon as possible instead the shadow education secretary indulge in the luxury of opposition what have labour members focus on since this story break they want the list why do they want the list they want to scaremonger and whip up media storm about it my hon friend the member for southend west anna firth who be no long in her place mention on monday special school in her constituency the name of that school get into the press presumably the local press and the school be then mob by national medium that be presumably what labour want to happen in all case one school in my constituency sir thomas boughey academy in halmer end be on the list that school be very instructive on why we be right to have take the course that we have because it have be proactive and work with the dedicated caseworker provide by the dfe have explain thing to parent in fact the school have already take much of the require action to repair the hall classroom and roof construction in which it find raac there be currently small amount leave in boiler room but it be be remove and the room have be make safe that school be able to be open today with face to face teaching in all classroom and no restriction only that boiler room still have raac because the school take proactive action and that show the value of the work that the english government the uk government have be do in get that survey ahead of time that be not happen in wales because labour have not do the work we be proud of our record on education and my hon friend the member for newbury laura farris speak powerfully about that output matter most but on input we be provide record funding in real term with school budget of nearly billion next year we have record number of and teacher start salary be now an extremely competitive deliver on pledge that the government make on top of that we be spend million on initial teacher training incentive to get people into the area in which we need to see more teacher include math and science we on the science and technology committee conduct an inquiry on diversity in science technology engineering and math and we consider the need for well teaching in science particularly for girl we be deliver that through teacher training incentive output be more important and our record be absolutely outstanding of school be rat good or outstanding compare with the figure that we inherit from the labour party in an english year old from disadvantaged background be now more likely to go to university than they be decade ago represent number of disadvantaged community and be proud of that record many of those people go to keele university in my constituency phonic be the absolute epic success story of this period of conservative government pay tribute to the minister for schools my right hon friend the member for bognor regis and littlehampton nick gibb who be sit on the treasury bench our primary child be now the good in the western world at read we have rocket up the league table not just for reading and literacy but for math we be proud of our record here in england sadly the scottish education system be not as good by deliver what we have through phonic we be give child the good possible tool to succeed in world in which they will need more and more of those tool in all honesty give the amount of money that be available to labour during the boom time for the city in the parliaments of course it then famously run out it should be ashamed of its record not only do labour not deliver the building schools for the future programme about which labour member have speak many time today but it be costly and slow scheme that do not deliver what it promise more than that labour fail on output it leave child unable to read or write we have put that right in our time in government be very proud of what we have do on education think that we have react in responsible way to the raac situation as say on monday recognise that the timing be terrible pay tribute to mrs hingley and her staff at sir thomas boughey academy for what they have do to ensure that their school like so many other on the list remain open for full face to face teaching today it be not the case that child be cower in classroom which be an appalling thing for the shadow education secretary to say what they be do be learn which be what they should be do it be privilege to have the opportunity to contribute to this debate but must say that be particularly disappoint by the tone with which it have start this be very serious issue there be high number of concerned parent and teacher and headteacher who work in those building and obviously their primary concern be the child would specifically point out the selective interpretation and opportunism show by labour members because they only have to look the other side of offa dyke or the prince of wales bridge to see what be happen in wales they forget that labour have be in power in wales for year if that have not be sufficient time to reform education and rebuild these building do not know how long they will need let we remember that education in wales be entirely devolve that give the administration the freedom to survey assess and repair building and rebuild they where necessary labour have be in power for year but the reality be that we still do not know the state of the building in wales that be the truth of the labour administration the synthetic anger we have hear from the labour benches have create an awful lot of hot air but can direct exactly the same question and accusation at the administration in wales they have be there for year but we still do not know can we imagine the synthetic anger that we would hear from labour front benchers and back benchers if the secretary of state or the minister say today be sorry but we still do not know it be go to take another couple of week there would be understandable outrage but labour members be completely ignore the situation and the state of the education service in wales the right hon gentleman be talk about wales speak as an english mp the bbc be report that at least school with raac be set to be rebuild under labour plan but those building project be scrap by the conservative lead government in the former secretary of state for education the right hon member for surrey heath michael gove say that he scrap that scheme because he do not want to waste any more money and work on school be halt do the right hon gentleman not agree that that be an appalling thing for he to do with the great respect to the hon lady be not sure whether she be refer to wales or to england the point be make be that labour have be in power in wales for year two school have be identify as have raac issue but we simply do not know about the rest there would be understandable anger and frustration if the secretary of state or the minister dare to come out with that response no welsh labour mp have participate in this debate and up until now none have even be present in the chamber let we remember that the former first minister in wales say in relation to education that the welsh administration have take their eye off the ball do not think their eye have ever be replace on the ball bear in mind the standard in wales many colleague on the conservative benches have list whole host of education outcome and uplift my hon friend the member for newcastle under lyme aaron bell just go through whole host of success and other colleague have mention the number of good excellent and outstanding school here in england but sadly my constituent do not get the same benefit any international comparison be it the programme for international student assessment or any other show that wales have fall back in comparison with england the opposition day motion be opportunistic as we have already highlight but let we at least humour it for moment when the hon member for newcastle upon tyne north catherine mckinnell respond for labour will she assure that if my colleague in the welsh senedd table this motion labour members will support it exactly the same question apply in wales as in england so ask she to respond specifically to that question will happily give way if any labour front benchers want to intervene now but notice that they be all keep their head down they be frightened suggest that they be embarrassed to look at and to respond to the question that we be raise the investigation start in england month ago and it start at much late point in wales the reality be that we still do not know the outcome and we have two week leave to wait can imagine the anger that would be feel by labour members if that position be share by my right hon friend the minister however let we be realistic about this new evidence come to light and therefore new decision need to be take and that be exactly what have happen in this situation there be whole host of ministers official teacher and parent co ordinate effort to make real difference and get through this immediate challenge much of which will be very short term this have be long stand problem and there be need for whole host of quick decision to be take as well as for transparency and for clarity let close my contribution with the comment of the children commissioner for wales this be not from any party political person but from an independent individual appoint by the welsh government she have say that the statement issue by the welsh government minister so far do give family the clarity they need on what this mean for they or the next step for their school and on what exactly will happen over the next few week and reassurance that school be safe that be from the children commissioner for wales appoint with statutory responsibility to protect the interest of child and even she have lose faith in the decision making transparency and clarity of the welsh government finally will the shadow minister reassure that if my friend or colleague in the senedd table this motion labour members will support it rise to speak in this debate because suspect have mention raac on the floor of the house more time than most since be elect indeed have be bang on about this issue since my maiden speech three and half year ago my focus have be on raac in the health sector and hospital particularly the queen elizabeth hospital in king lynn unfortunately it happen to be the most prop hospital in the country it have many thousand of steel and timber support prop in place and they be there to keep the staff and patient safe that failsafe work have be fund by the government at cost of ten of million of pound as it have be in other hospital that demonstrate commitment to address raac issue in hospital as well as across the education sector other part of the public sector and public building be delighted that the health secretary announce in may that the queen elizabeth hospital and the other raac hospital would be add to the new hospital build programme the big hospital building programme in history and we will have new hospital in king lynn by that really underline the commitment of this government to deal with raac have discuss this directly with my right hon friend the prime minister on number of occasion as well as with his adviser and many ministers ironically give the issue have have locally in the nhs have not be notify so far of any issue of school be affect in my constituency of north west norfolk when recent event occur ministers respond rapidly and that have cause concern for pupil parent and teacher not least give the timing which be not of course in the minister gift understand that concern well from my local hospital work around prop and other support measure bring many challenge for staff and patient as it will for teacher and pupil have have the new advice work be now under way in school to ensure that they remain safe space for child to learn and for staff to work other members have attest to the rapid nature of the support provide by my right hon friend the minister as well as by baroness barran and other in the department in norfolk my hon friend the member for mid norfolk george freeman have an affected school know that he be support it to manage the issue work closely with the department for education as it and other school across the country do that it be right that the chancellor have commit to spend whatever it take to address these issue and to keep pupil safe we hear early during prime minister question about the increase spending that he approve for maintenance in the education budget in his previous role welcome that and welcome the extra billion funding this year and next give the pressure that school be face that be vital to continue the major improvement that we have see in literacy and other standard through our reform which my hon friend the member for newbury laura farris set out so ably also declare an interest as governor of school that be part of the school rebuilding programme programme that will deliver new school as well as deal with maintenance and backlog issue hope that the considerable expertise that exist in the department of health and social care the nhs other part of government and externally be be share and make available to school adviser and local authority as well as co ordinate through the cabinet office so that other potentially affected sector such as our prison estate and court also benefit from it of course pupil staff and parent at affected school be concern and it be important that we tackle these issue in serious and consider manner and not by use some of the alarmist language we have hear today that will just create unnecessary concern know from issue that my hospital have face be regular visitor talk to staff how important it be for the confidence of staff and patient that we do this in measured and responsible way learn from what we know about raac in the nhs and elsewhere and how we have secure it school leader will always put the safety of their pupil first we should ensure that they have all the support and resource they need to do that and that be what this government be do it be only day three of new term yet once again we find ourselves in the position of have an opposition day debate on an incredibly important subject that be pure politicking from the labour party we have not hear anything new other than what we hear at the beginning of the week when we devote an hour and half to mature and sensible debate on this matter would have hop that labour members would have spend the long summer recess reflect that so often these debate make thing bad not well because they frighten the public and spread confusion and misinformation sadly that have not be the case and once again today we have hear point scoring misinformation and scaremongering believe what the public want and deserve at this point be responsible sense of risk and proportion about this problem we know that school have be affect by raac of which one third already have mitigation measure in place only school be inform this week which be under of the school across the country some have be close as precaution include one in my constituency that will come on to talk about the vast majority of school in our country be not closed and even some of those with raac have not be close in their entirety the majority be expect to open next week unlike labour members wholeheartedly applaud this government for put the interest of pupil family and staff first the absolute last thing we could possibly want be for disaster to happen in any one of our school but we should not be spread fear or exaggerate the scale of this problem it be recklessly irresponsible to scare child by suggest that their school be not safe when they overwhelmingly of school in this country be safe and child have go back and be learn in they over the past year this conservative government have invest in their school and school building we have invest billion since we have invest billion since to improve the safety of our school with priority give to those with potential safety issue of course we be committed to go far than that and as member of the education committee have strong focus on this area accord to the commons library estimate capital spending in our school for the past financial be around billion that be real term increase compare with the year before we be also undertake huge rebuilding and refurbishment programme to improve over of our school include blenheim primary school in southend which very much welcome be part of this programme be look forward to see spade go into the ground if may remind the schools minister that he would be welcome to come to blenheim primary school to see that new refurbishment take place let we compare our record with labour record in government its building schools for the future programme be slow costly and substandard that be an apt description would say of the entire last labour government in the commission for architecture and the built environment find that half the school build by labour be architecturally substandard with mere be excellent we need to understand not only exactly why raac be use in school but more importantly how we can avoid anything like this happen in the future we need to ask whether all the money that we be spend on remediation measure would not perhaps be spend more sensibly on rebuild programme there be range of thing we need to look at and that be why call yesterday for special session of the education committee look into this issue the point of that session be to learn and scrutinise not to point finger as the labour party be seek to do today in essex we be disproportionately affect by raac because we have such an extensive school building programme in the and sadly in my constituency the brilliant kingsdown school be close this week after raac be find in some of its building kingsdown school be the only special school in the country that have this problem so the house will forgive for dwell on its issue in particular it be wait for three thing the first be the result of risk assessment the inspector appropriately go in very quickly last week but the school need the result of that risk assessment if it be to open next week it also need emergency equipment in the form of portaloo demountable classroom and portable staff room those thing have be promise and the soon they be deliver the well the third thing be remediation measure because these plan be short term and the child in the school be among the most disabled physically and mentally in southend if not the south east this be special school where some of the child need special feeding equipment or special temperature there be hoist everywhere this be not normal school and these remediation measure be vital it be special school and make no apology for argue that it should be special case finish by applaud the work of the headmistress louise robinson who have be work around the clock along with conservative control southend on sea city council councillor helen boyd the cabinet member there and liz hunt they have be work hard to get thing move the only thing that have not be helpful at all have be the press attention on this special school the headmistress tell that she can not pick up the telephone because the press be focus on this school that be appal when one consider how anxious the parent and child must be it be completely inappropriate intrusion finish by remind the labour party that by call today debate order the hon lady have run out of time this be concern issue and the amount of politicking and scaremongering of parent teacher and pupil that the opposition do on it worry many school and public building build with raac be characteristic of the brutalist style of architecture favour between the and the building be cheap and not build to last and they pop up under various government that show the seemingly prevailing attitude of short termism at the time government know it would be somebody else problem in the future as indeed it be now it must have be the same attitude that prevail in and when labour government take no action on raac despite be warn about the danger by the building research establishment my right hon friend the member for surrey heath michael gove stand at the dispatch box in the coalition era and criticise labour building schools for the future programme for often target the wrong school and in the light of this week evidence it seem that he have be prove right so find the opposition outrage quite performative the department for education as understand it publish guidance to school on the topic in be sorry madam deputy speaker but my back have just go have problem with my back carry on be sorry to hear that will move on to the next speaker munira wilson do hope that the hon member for hyndburn sara britcliffe be okay thank you madam deputy speaker and the house for allow to go and lead westminster hall debate just now that be why be out of the chamber for minute the crumble concrete crisis be one that first raise with the secretary of state on the floor of the house back in january it be extremely damaging for several reason it be not just because anxious parent have have to tell their child why their school be shut or drive they to alternative site it be not just because child learning have be disrupt yet again with some eat lunch in marquee or go to the toilet in portacabin it be concrete sign of government who have give up on community up and down the country for many family the school be the public service that they interact with most when parent read about crumble concrete when the parent teacher association have to fundraise for basic repair and maintenance and when the local school rebuilding plan be reject year after year they know that the government have let they down and take they for grant just consider how that make our young people feel if their classroom have bucket in various corner if they spend all day in coat because the boiler be break or bad if their school close altogether the message that they hear be that they do not matter that their education their future be not worth invest in when the announcement be make parent look to the conservative government for three thing empathy responsibility and leadership be sorry to say that they have provide none of they government with empathy would not put out social medium advert say that most school be unaffected instead they would tell concerned parent that one school with risky raac be one too many this may be just the tip of the iceberg some school in twickenham and richmond be await survey other council be wad through the guidance and complain that the dfe have lose the questionnaire they have send in pupil just over the river from my constituency at st paul primary school in thames ditton at langney primary academy in eastbourne or at the royal college manchester in cheadle will now want the government to give they concrete timeline on when their at risk building will be repair an education secretary who understand collective responsibility would take the flak for her government failing not pass the buck and fish for compliment prime minister who show leadership would listen to his official and invest in our child be it completely and utterly wrong to blame he for the crisis let ask this who be chancellor in when accord to the institute for fiscal studies the three year average spend on education capital be at its low since who be chancellor when education official tell the treasury that it would cost billion to mitigate the most serious risk of building failure yet sign off only two third of that amount who be the chancellor who be tell to build more than school year but approve only it be the right hon member for richmond yorks rishi sunak these penny pinch tactic be come back to bite he yet even now the treasury will not stump up new cash to remove the raac it be put off repair to other dilapidated school building every crumble classroom stand as concrete sign of year of conservative neglect of our child and our community of course pupil safety be paramount and unsafe classroom should be shut but we should never have get to this point this crisis be year in the making liberal democrats know that when we invest in the fabric of our school we invest in our child future our nursery school and college should have be treat as critical infrastructure yet too often with this government child be an afterthought liberal democrats would have invest in our school remove risky raac and clear the backlog of school repair in may tell the house neglect school and college building endanger our child and may well contribute to this government downfall official report may vol be sorry to say on behalf of parent pupil and school staff that the chicken be come home to roost before call the shadow minister want to emphasise how important it be that those who contribute to the debate get back in good time for the wind up there be those who be not here which be discourteous to the shadow minister this debate be incredibly important as it get to the heart of the responsibility that we all share to the next generation responsibility to give every child the good start in life and the opportunity to thrive at school and throughout their life and above all responsibility to keep child safe the government be not just fail in that fundamental responsibility worse they be hide from reality from scrutiny and from the consequence of their decision over long year those consequence mean that this week child can not go to school because their building be unsafe and still the secretary of state and the prime minister and have to say hon member on the government benches be desperately try to pass the buck they be refuse to be honest about the fact that they speak not just for this government today but for the government in which they have serve and on whose record they stand the secretary of state have be ask for praise today because she finally publish the list of affected school but this be about much more than the school on her list it be about school the length and breadth of this country that be not fit for our child to learn in or staff to work in that be why our motion ask for two thing first we be ask for the department for education submission to the spending review in which instead of increase school building budget the prime minister then chancellor choose to cut they secondly we be ask for the correspondence on those submission like that release in the observer last year in which official at the department for education warn that school building be risk to life the hon lady be make number of serious allegation do she apply those equally to the welsh government consider that they have be in power and in charge of education for year in wales repeat the point make in my contribution would labour members in the senedd support similar motion that would achieve the same effect if table by conservative colleague unlike the conservative government in england the welsh government be invest in rebuild school which be why they face different situation from the one we face today we be look at history and for transparency not for geography lesson parent and the wide public deserve to know how and why decision be take such as why the number of school that the government be plan to rebuild each year have be cut to just the prime minister have be look for plaudit but under his leadership the treasury almost halve the money go into school building this week we hear the former permanent secretary say that he be shock when the number of school that the government plan to rebuild each year be not increase to but cut that be what official say be need to keep child safe not thrive we be not talk about bell and whistle but just safe the prime minister as chancellor say no to the request to rebuild our school and make they safe just as he turn down request to deliver proper recovery programme for the child recover from the pandemic while donate to american college he have condemn child in england to crumble building and now another round of learn from home conservative members have choice today they can vote with we to be honest with parent pupil and staff about the decision the prime minister take and the consequence for our child or they can stay in their not guv rank and vote to keep parent in the dark yet again the prime minister promise to lead government of integrity and accountability so today at least they have an opportunity to make that reality my hon friend the members for sunderland central julie elliott for sheffield hallam olivia blake for liverpool walton dan carden for jarrow kate osborne for stretford and urmston andrew western for brentford and isleworth ruth cadbury for city of durham mary kelly foy and for salford and eccles rebecca long bailey all make incredibly powerful speech about the importance of this issue to the child parent and school staff in their area many conservative members also highlight the challenge the issue have pose in their constituency yet all seek to deflect the blame that be why this debate be about take responsibility the speech from my hon friend set out very clearly why this matter to the parent and in particular the child in our constituency who be affect by it we be of course please that the government finally publish the list of school this morning but be they sure it be accurate just today we be hear report that school the secretary of state tell to if be allow to say it get off their arsis have in fact return their raac survey and in some case have go ahead and remedie the raac themselves in the absence of any support from the government other school be emerge that be not on the list but have be identify as have raac there be concern and it explain why the secretary of state have be so reluctant to release the list there seem to be lot of chaos in government not only in the lead up to this situation but in handle it at this stage have no the secretary of state for levelling up housing and communities have literally just walk in be not sure what his contribution be at this stage but will come on to he in moment have no doubt that when the minister of state stand up he will like the secretary of state want to talk about labour record on education so think would get ahead of he labour in government reduce class size by recruit thousand of new teacher and introduce teach assistant to raise standard for all our child we increase participation in education and see record number progress to university and we have school rebuilding programme build schools for the future set out pathway to rebuild or refurbish every secondary school in england back up by the primary capital programme to invest in the maintenance and repair of primary school across the country the last labour government set out plan to transform our country school estate lead to improvement in standard and behaviour and make school safe place for child to learn because labour know then as we know now that child can not get first class education in second class school it only take the current levelling up secretary six year to admit that he regret scrap the building schools for the future programme and cancel over school building project but it seem that the lesson he learn be not be pass on to his colleague it will therefore be for the next labour government to make our school estate one to be proud of once more and to make sure that every child in every corner of the country can go to an excellent local school expect the minister will also quote from the james review and tell the house about the survey of school building that his government have undertake when he do perhaps he could clarify this on january this year the minister respond to write question from the shadow secretary of state my hon friend the member for houghton and sunderland south bridget phillipson state that their survey be visual inspection only and do not assess the overall structural integrity of building two day later in response to another question from my hon friend he repeat that say that the condition data collection be not safety survey however less than month later on february he say that the survey provide robust evidence base for target capital funding it would be helpful if the minister explain how both those statement can be true at the same time and how survey can provide robust evidence base if it be not assess safety or structural integrity what this look like to be yet more chaos and contradiction from the government it be become clear by the day that year of conservative government have fail our child for our school estate they have be year of cut price plaster solution and inefficient repair when green rebuild and long term plan be require we have see age building many of which be build decade if not more than century ago with unmet repair crack wall asbestos bucket place in classroom catch leak and crumble roof the government complacency on this be unforgivable but it be clear that they be not go to own up voluntarily to the scale of this problem or their failure whether the issue be lockdown party speed ticket government contract or school building this government be incapable of transparency that be why the house must force they to be transparent and to be honest with parent about the choice they make to leave the school estate crumble around our child because it be parent child and school staff whose life could be at risk those be not my word but the word of senior official in the department for education last year the government invite bid from school for building replacement or repair more than school apply yet the prime minister proudly tell we that he plan to rebuild just over the next decade we be already see the impact of these short sighted decision on our school estate my hon friend the member for sheffield hallam have tell the house that parent in her constituency be injure when piece of cladding fall on she recent freedom of information request from schools week find that teacher be reportedly admit to hospital after be hit by fall ceiling tile at school in bradford what could have happen if those event have occur at different time or place when there be more child in the classroom do not bear think about until the government own up to their responsibility it fall to the house to ensure that child go to school that be safe that teacher and staff be not put at risk and that we be honest with the public about the decision that have be make for more than decade conservative government have neglect that duty as my hon friend the member for houghton and sunderland south say in her opening speech the define image of year of tory government will be child cower under the steel support that stop the ceiling fall down say to the government come clean own up and support our motion today let start by welcome the hon member for newcastle upon tyne north catherine mckinnell to her new post and congratulate she once again on she in my view promotion to that position this have be debate on an important subject but behind all the understandable concern be one key piece of information that the house and the country need until last week the advice and guidance that the department for education issue to school be that if raac be present in building structural surveyor should assess it and that if it be grade as be in critical condition the building should be take out of use where raac be assess as non critical the advice be to continue monitor it but not to take the building out of use what happen over the summer be that the department be make aware of three case one commercial and two in school one of which be outside england in which raac that have be grade as non critical collapse or fail it have become clear that visual assessment alone would not definitively identify crack panel that be on the verge of failure give that evidence say this to every member of the house how would your decision differ from that of the secretary of state and ministers at the department for education on the question of whether to change the guidance to require all building with critical and non critical raac to be take out of use what would your decision have be give that evidence professional advice from technical expert on raac have evolve over time indeed the question of how to manage its risk across all sector have span successive government since the department for education systematically make the sector aware of the late guidance from technical engineer in follow sudden roof collapse at primary school we publish warning note with the local government association that ask all responsible body to identify any property construct use raac and to ensure that raac property be regularly inspect by structural engineer in february we issue guide on identify raac concerned that not all responsible body be act quickly enough in we decide to take more direct approach we issue questionnaire to the responsible body for all school to ask they to identify whether they have or suspect they have raac responsible body have submit response to those questionnaire for of school with block build in the target era and we actively chase the remain response in september we start significant programme of technical survey with the dfe send professional surveyor to assess whether raac be present in those school where the responsible body have respond to the questionnaire say that there be suspect raac there be more than school and college in england and the vast majority of they be unaffected by raac to date school and college have put mitigation in place of the school in the list we publish today be provide continued face to face teaching for all pupil further school have some pupil learn off site and have delay the start of term by few day to ensure that pupil can start of the term in face to face teach safely on site only very small number four have need to move to remote education they include st leonard catholic school in durham which be mention by the hon member for city of durham mary kelly foy every school and college that be impact have dedicated caseworker to help implement mitigation plan this will include use other space on the school site in nearby school or elsewhere in the local area until structural support or temporary building be instal we have increase the supply of temporary building work with three contractor and we have accelerate the installation of these we have the support of lead utility company to ensure that those temporary classroom can be connect to the utility and open in the small number of school with confirm raac that have disruption to face to face teaching this have last only matter of day in the past we have also set up an operational hotline to ensure that member of this house and other interested party can if appropriate fast track issue to caseworker since we have invest billion of pound in school capital we have create over million more school place and open over new free school help to drive up academic standard in some of the most disadvantaged part of the country we launch the priority school building programme rebuild or refurbish school between and in we launch the priority school building programme rebuild or refurbish school between and in the prime minister when he be chancellor announce the school rebuild programme to invest in project over the next decade for new and refurbish school building prioritise building in the poor condition it be only this government who have conduct survey of the whole school estate start with the property datum survey in we have the condition datum collection in and now we be partway through the third survey of all our school it be only because of this work that we can target capital spending on rebuild school in the bad condition there have be question from hon member on the detail of the funding arrangement to support affected school and college to reiterate the word of the chancellor we will spend what it take to keep child safe that include pay for the emergency mitigation work need to make building safe include alteration and alternative classroom space on school and college site where necessary where school need additional help with revenue cost such as transport to other location we be actively engage with every school affect to put appropriate support in place we will also fund the long term refurbishment or rebuilding project where these be need to rectify raac in the long term the hon member for sunderland central julie elliott complain about school close because of raac but as have say only four of the list school have actually close my hon friend the member for worcester mr walker be right to say that it be clear this government be take zero risk approach to the safety of building where new evidence emerge the hon member for sheffield hallam olivia blake and the shadow education secretary the hon member for houghton and sunderland south bridget phillipson both raise the issue of asbestos all school have an asbestos register and if asbestos need to be remove to put in place raac mitigation work it will be remove my hon friend the member for harwich and north essex sir bernard jenkin correctly challenge the opposition to say whether they think the secretary of state have take the right decision and they could not answer because they know it be the right decision he ask important and serious question about how raac be allow to be use in the first place the hon member for liverpool walton dan carden seem very cross on behalf of his constituent but of course none of the school on the list we publish today be in his constituency or in liverpool my right hon friend the member for witham priti patel raise the issue of cost and we will cover all capital cost and subject to need revenue cost school should discuss this with the my hon friend the member for newbury

ben bradley and for newcastle under lyme aaron bell be both right to say that the secretary of state have take the right decision in the interest of safety my hon friend the member for clwyd south simon baynes be right to contrast the swift action by this government with the approach take by wales that point be also make by the former secretary of state for wales my right hon friend the member

member of parliament for crawley constituency that proudly include gatwick airport within its boundary and as the chair of the all party parliamentary group for the future of aviation for which declare an interest it be in those role that have be determine to support the aviation travel and tourism industry as they continue to recover from the pandemic and call on the government to introduce duty free shopping on arrival at airport and international rail and ferry terminal in great britain reinstate duty free shopping for passenger arrive from europe and significantly increase inbound personal allowance upon brexit prove popular with increase in sale of duty free item by uk passenger shop overseas in our first year outside the european union however british business and airport do not benefit from that passenger can spend their increase allowance abroad only at their point of departure the introduction of duty free on arrival store at airport ferry port and international railway station would repatriate those sale to great britain crucially ensure that british business be the main beneficiary of the post brexit duty free system will highlight three main benefit the effect on the recovery of the travel industry the impact on british competitiveness and the importance of choice and the passenger experience on the first benefit travel recovery and regional connectivity do not need to repeat to the house the full impact of the pandemic on the aviation sector as the sector continue to recover we know that travel hub need non aeronautical revenue such as retail and duty free indeed as much as half of total airport income can come from those activity all uk airport and international terminal will benefit from duty free on arrival store the creation of new retail area at uk airport would trigger significant capital expenditure for building work as infrastructure be adapt to take advantage of this new opportunity result in further economic investment include create construction job for the duration of those project the increase in sale can be reinveste in new route improve passenger number and attract more visitor make london and regional hub across the uk more competitive with rival city such as paris milan and barcelona draw the house attention to the example of norway be non eu nation norway introduce duty free on arrival store in and there be an immediate impact on aberdeen airport sale to norwegian bind passenger fall by with the average spend per passenger halving the result growth on commercial revenue in norway be invest in route development which allow it to attract new airline by lower charge norway now have the low aeronautical charge per passenger in the whole of europe more passenger growth more income and more investment all without the need for the government to fund support the second benefit be the impact on global competitiveness we know that more than country have now implement duty free on arrival include most major travel hub in asia the middle east and oceania as well as fellow non eu country if the eu implement arrival duty free store before we do it would have detrimental effect on british port of entry european travel retail confederation modelling predict arrival duty free gross value add boost would be some million for spain million for italy and million for france such sale would have devastating impact on uk port departure store however the uk government could get ahead and legislate for arrival store first future proof the sector completely agree with the hon gentleman argument my own local airport edinburgh airport would benefit greatly from duty free arrival not least because as in quite few international airport passenger have to go through the shopping area to get out of the airport therefore in some case there might not even be the need for capital investment have experience this in australia it be very tempting when we arrive in duty free area to buy duty free so there would be huge incentive for people come to this country to buy duty free on arrival and benefit the local economy the hon lady be exactly right have experience similar when travel to australia or close country such as switzerland the boost that that give to those local economy be quite significant in this country however we need to act quickly such plan for arrival duty free be under active consideration by the european commission as part of the directorate general for taxation and custom union review into travel and tourism taxation introduce arrival duty free be the only way we would be able to level the field the third benefit be great choice and passenger convenience the modern passenger have come to expect the retail element of the travel experience duty free purchase on arrival will contribute to more seamless travel experience arrival shop be separate market in competition with departure duty free sale from airport abroad the lack of arrival duty free be place we at competitive disadvantage arrival duty free be not only convenient but popular too polling commission in find of traveller regard carry duty free item back to the uk on their flight as an inconvenience polling conduct at several uk airport last year find that in many area include my own gatwick airport two third of people would support the government introduce such store nevertheless be aware that there remain concern among those on the treasury bench and be keen to address they the first concern from his majesty treasury suspect be the revenue implication for the exchequer research from york aviation predict that such store will result in additional sale of million each year an increase spend of between and per passenger be also anticipate therefore ask the government to again look at the example of norway where as of duty free on arrival sale have increase by since the policy implementation and be grow consistently at an average rate of more than each year in this scenario the initial loss of excise duty for hm treasury be quickly offset by other form of taxation in addition to new job at zurich airport for example the introduction of single arrival duty free store mean an additional job for the uk the increase in income tax and corporation tax be estimate to be an additional million each year for the exchequer even at the low level of predict sale the impact on government revenue be still likely to be only cost neutral at worst the policy would also increase sale on duty pay category the second concern that suspect the treasury have be about the impact on the domestic high street although appreciate that concern we need to be clear that the only competition to arrival duty free store be from overseas departure duty free store the introduction of the policy have the support of many brand that sell in the domestic market both on the high street and in travel retail channel the size of the inbound duty free market be less than of the domestic market for the same product even if the policy be more successful than expect any impact on the high street would be nominal passenger at an airport be draw from far wide catchment area than those in town centre store for example to look again at example from elsewhere switzerland and norway have both have arrival store for over decade and neither have detect any impact on high street sale the third concern that suspect the treasury may have be about implementation let we be clear in the model of arrival duty free store propose by the industry arrival store would be locate before custom clearance that would avoid any additional staffing or resource pressure and could provide more robust level of control and oversight border force and his majesty revenue and customs would have the opportunity to observe and audit purchase use exist mechanism as they do now and monitor inbound duty free allowance limit as result of brexit only secondary legislation will be need for implementation so the change would not be burdensome on the busy schedule and agenda of this house let reiterate my support for sustainable aviation fuel more broadly and for the wide aim of the aviation sector reach jet zero the commitment that uk domestic aviation will achieve net zero carbon emission by will my hon friend give way order no the hon gentleman have only just come into the chamber this be an adjournment debate and he should have be here from the beginning to intervene as he know do not notice my hon friend slink in behind but be grateful for his moral support madam deputy speaker even though by your order he be unable to vocalise it on my support for sustainable aviation be pleased to host and address new industry alliance hydrogen in aviation just last night here in parliament the alliance be design to help the uk lead innovation in that field that would along with duty free on arrival well support our sector aviation and our port be vital for uk trade and employment we can do this in clean smart way and duty free arrival can play an important part for the sector in closing it be clear that the introduction of arrival duty free store would support economic growth and provide timely boost to the recovery of aviation travel and tourism from the pandemic this plan would be fund by industry and would be at bad cost neutral for the exchequer it be low risk policy that have already prove successful in some country around the world there would likely be no impact on domestic high street sale due to limited market overlap and differ customer behaviour in duty free store by introduce duty free store on arrival the government can reaffirm their commitment to support the aviation travel and tourism sector and the economic prosperity that they afford by provide employment to so many of my constituent and to community across the entire country the policy be also popular with the electorate so hope that the government will act swiftly to achieve this additional brexit freedom first congratulate my hon friend the member for crawley henry smith on secure tonight important debate he bring so much experience and expertise on this issue to the chamber not just through his chairmanship of the appg for the future of aviation but as the member of parliament for gatwick thank he very much for that be conscious that people outside the chamber may be watch the debate so let say that what we be discuss be duty on the sale of alcohol and tobacco which would ordinarily attract uk excise duty and vat my hon friend advocate for the removal of that duty and vat for passenger who have enter great britain from outside the uk before they have reach custom control entry point will give some background on the government duty free policy because it be an important part of the overall picture in january the government extend duty free sale to eu bind passenger for the first time in over year which be significant boost to airport and international rail terminal in great britain that change mean that passenger travel from the uk to the eu be able to purchase duty free good once they have pass security control at port airport and train station on international route they also become able to purchase duty free good onboard international transport route from great britain as my hon friend say we understand that customer find it convenient to buy their product during the flight or to order they in advance and pick they up at the end we be pleased that the change in policy have be boost for uk travel hub indeed watch with close interest to ensure that the tax saving bring about by this conservative government be pass on to consumer because that be important hope that retailer watch the debate will note the minister interest in their do the right thing and ensure that those saving be pass on when we make those change in we say that we be not consider similar policy for arrival for several reason first as my hon friend have identify there be serious concern about the impact on shop in the uk whether on the high street or close to an airport duty free on departure encourage purchase in the uk that might otherwise be make abroad that case be less clearcut with regard to allow customer to buy good duty free on arrival that could create an unfair playing field for the domestic duty pay retailer work either in the confine of the airport or station or beyond they the hon member for edinburgh west christine jardine mention her local airport of edinburgh be think of arrival at heathrow where once passenger have go through custom they be in the arrival hall and there be shop there sell product as one would expect must confess that have never try to buy cigarette or alcohol from those shop so know not what price they would charge but importantly because they be on the arrival side of the barrier they have to charge duty and vat on product there might be only few foot between those retailer sell product duty free and other sell the very same product beyond the barrier on the arrival side secondly we would have to consider the need for adequate infrastructure and resource for the publicly fund border force so that it could combat fraud ensure compliance with requirement and enforce any charge at all entry point in moment will go into some of the duty that border force have at airport but we must remember the enormous responsibility on those officer at travel hub and the range of offence and activity that they have to be alert to as former home office minister would have to be very careful to understand how give those officer extra responsibility regard the sale of duty free alcohol and tobacco would be of wide benefit to the british public business would also need to put support infrastructure in place which would be costly to they finally duty would of course be lose from those sale we have consider very carefully the york aviation report my official have brief on it and we appreciate the effort that have go into it but we consider that the report fall into the error of overstate the size of any additional economic activity that would result from the proposal we remain to be convince that this change to vat and duty policy would lead to rise in sale of these product that would support the creation of many new job across the economy would treasury ministers be willing to meet industry representative to discuss the concern that the minister be express about the impact of the policy change through such dialogue we could probably find solution that would alleviate fear across the board be very happy to meet my hon friend and representative but must temper expectation for change to be make of this nature the economic case for the entire uk economy would have to be very strongly make he will appreciate that receive many well intentione suggestion on remove vat and other form of tax but particularly vat from product indeed think we be up to billion worth of suggestion since we regain our freedom on leave the eu we have to be very clear as to the economic benefit but be always very happy to meet my hon friend the report also deal with the issue of job again we remain to be convince that if job be to be create they would be additional to the job already in place in the high street that involve sell alcohol and tobacco with duty and vat charge as they be oblige to be charge on the uk high street be afraid that we do not accept the report conclusion will give my hon friend little bit more detail on the broad objective behind duty free on arrival first we be very conscious that the duty we charge on alcohol and tobacco serve not just an economic purpose but the critical public health objective of try to persuade people to stop smoking or to smoke far less and to have healthy relationship with alcohol indeed my hon friend will know of the very sensible change make to the alcohol duty regime in the finance act to enable product with high strength of alcohol to be treat differently from product with low alcohol content that be do because as think we all acknowledge reflect the strength of alcohol in the duty price be way we hope of help people to make decision about their health our current duty free on departure policy strike balance between those objective and support international travel but we would have to consider carefully whether duty free on arrival would maintain that balance secondly we ask whether displacement would occur and whether any loss would outweigh any indirect benefit of increase economic activity outbound duty free for eu passenger alone be estimate to cost around million per year primarily through displacement of duty pay high street sale to duty free store the chancellor have be clear that it be vital that we continue to act responsibly with the public finance so the risk of erode tax revenue be not one we will take lightly finally there be also compliance angle the government would have to put measure in place to mitigate the risk of increase illicit activity which would require the diversion of border force staff from other crucial area that include the priority that we rightly set for they include matter such as illegal immigration drug smuggling gun smuggling terrorism and other serious offence that be why we must be very careful before contemplate add to border force responsibility and its vital work of protect the nation day in day out and ensure that the law be obey by those who travel overseas or into our country of course we keep this policy under review would be happy to meet my hon friend to discuss it far but we would need strong evidence to assure we that high street duty pay business would not be disadvantage by policy of duty free on arrival before we even consider any such change to reassure my hon friend ask my official to pick up on the point that he raise about the eu contemplating change to the system and as far as we know we do not believe that the eu be consider that of course we will ensure that that information be up to date be tell that as recently as the eu parliament say that it be not consider that but appreciate that international politic change reiterate the support that the government have commit to the aviation industry indeed often at the behest of my hon friend during the pandemic in may last year we publish flightpath to the future strategic framework for the sector to build back well through it we aim to make uk aviation cleaner green and more competitive than ever before the framework explore key issue include workforce and skill connectivity global impact innovation and decarbonisation note with interest those part of my hon friend speech concern different type of fuel for the airline industry that be the sort of work that we wish to help the aviation industry with and more particularly to develop in the uk as far as possible in conclusion thank my hon friend for his speech reiterate that we have consider this matter carefully but we must prioritise our responsibility for the public finance that be why we do not feel able at this point to agree to the suggestion but be happy to keep the issue under review and to meet he to discuss it far question put and agree to house adjourn
