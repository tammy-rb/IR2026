it be great pleasure to serve on the public bill committee on this bill we have great debate and there be actually lot of agreement across the committee room these be deeply conservative reform champion by none other than mrs thatcher start in which she continue to do throughout opposition and during her premiership gently say to opposition members of whatever party that they must not fall into the trap of make this political football they must engage with the seriousness and complexity of these reform in part because as we have hear they do very little to advance these very significant reform during their own time in office suspect that they back away from it because of the very significant legal challenge they would have face as we ourselves will no doubt face pretend they do not exist be not serious position say to the minister and the secretary of state who be aware of my comment that we must not buckle but must continue to take this forward it be great to see the package of amendment lay by the government particularly new clause which be ban on leasehold house want the minister to think carefully about how he will address the inevitable imbalance in the creation of two tier system in which some people will have the freehold of their house but some will not there be an additional imbalance between flat in our urban area and new freehold house that point be very well make by james vitali in policy exchange report be slightly worried about the omission from this of retirement property so perhaps the minister could return to that in committee speak about the need to truly move towards commonhold system think the opposition new clause be something of that nature very much hope that as the bill go through complete its stage the government here or in the other place can look at that suggestion think we do need to set out the future legislative scaffold for our fifth term in office and to build on the work we have do so that we can finally get rid of this leasehold system other members have mention lot of the point would have make about share service my hon friend the member for cities of london and westminster nickie aiken raise that and it be one of my concern my hon friend the member for harborough neil have do fantastic job in talk about the lack of adoption by local authority there be also new clause which know be again an opposition amendment and new clause and this problem be not go to go away it be blight on many homeowner in redditch and it also go to the heart of our planning system we really do need to look at that we can not pretend that it be go to solve itself thank the minister for write to about one of my concern which be litigation cost think new clause look at that he have reassure that what be in this bill will go the distance in ensure that leaseholder be not subject to unjust litigation cost by their landlord that be one of the case highlight by liam spender and many other these be hugely complex issue but we must tackle they want to see ground rent reduce to peppercorn it be pure extortion and feudal relic from medieval time when people be serf and work the land we should not have this in or in any year refuse to believe that there be not way through the wit of man and the considerable intelligence of ministers on the front bench to solve the issue perhaps where some financial asset be hold in pension fund do not buy the pretence of that incredible con artist mr steve whybrow and his outfit that somehow we be robbing pensioner would urge anybody with an interest in this debate to look at the genuine pensioner who be fight for the right to have pure enjoyment of their own property which they richly deserve after lifetime of working will make my final remark on forfeiture it must go the forfeiture of long lease can not be right it can not be right that freeholder can hold this nuclear bomb over somebody such as dennis jackson pensioner of plantation wharf he dispute service charge which lead to an legal bill and he have his flat forfeit during minute hearing at wandsworth court thank lease for all the work it have do to help he that just simply can not be right and we must address it want to see we finally finish the job that mrs thatcher start when she be opposition housing spokesman in we must finish that job and thank the minister for all the work he have do so far feel for the minister today because he must be kick himself this be probably one of the few debate have hear in this place recently where have not hear bad idea as constituency mp we see time and again the problem cause by retain this feudal system of leasehold and suspect that the minister who have be look at this issue for some time be kick himself because what he would really like to do be abolish the whole thing indeed today we have hear support from across the house to do just that in the short time available let say again to he that he would have our support to move to commonhold he talk about how commonhold be probably the well model and for those of we live in the vortex of gentrification where thousand of flat have be build in our community this be an incredibly pressing issue we know that the casework we have see over the past few year will expand as result of leasehold continue that be why wish to see the government change their mind perhaps in the other place about get rid of leasehold altogether and why have be press my local authority to listen to concern of local resident who be stick with leasehold and change our local plan to make commonhold the default hope that they have hear this debate and will rethink their opposition to that support the amendment in the name of my hon friend the member for greenwich and woolwich matthew pennycook and wish to draw the minister attention to two new clause that have table on issue with the exist system and the problem that leaseholder face with leaseholder in walthamstow know that these issue will come up time and again new clause be about the fact that although we have leasehold legislation it do not tally with our consumer legislation leaseholder pay service charge they have contract with freehold management company to oversee problem in their property but few resident feel empower to access right that exist under the consumer rights act to have reasonable service within reasonable timeframe for repair today colleague across the house have give countless example of that so let add my own which be where my propose new clause have come from be sorry that my hon friend the member for lewisham east janet daby be not here she talk about leigh court and new clause but resident in essex brewery in walthamstow have be without hot water and heating since before christmas indeed they be still without hot water and heating with little sight of any change essex brewery be build just five year ago it have become apparent that the build by crest nicholson be poor at good and downright con at worst until january this year crest nicholson be on the management committee and make more than million in profit in the year that essex brewery be build it have make half that this year possibly less because of widespread concern about the condition of the build it have make what do someone do when they have buy possibly their first home whether through shared ownership or leasehold as hundred do in that development and they find that the pipe that bring in the hot water be faulty be sorry to say that those resident have little redress because the management company kinleigh folkard and hayward another multimillion pound organisation leave they without any explanation of why it would not repair the hot water until after christmas what christmas present that be the grinch have strong competition that be another layer of bureaucracy kfh be appoint by the essex brewery management company which be establish by the freeholder helpfavour to meet those obligation kfh tell the resident that because their insurance policy say that as long as they have water at all the property be habitable and it be not go to do anything about it that have leave hundred of resident many of they vulnerable for month on end without any hot water or heating in the current weather resident have have to boil kettle to get hot water to cleanse their baby or pay bill that they can not afford for extra heating through portable heater for those who have share ownership it be even more complicated metropolitan thames valley state that it own of those property and that it be prohibit by law from fix the problem new clause be about match consumer legislation with leasehold legislation and give resident the right of redress not say you ve either get to buy out the leaseholder if you want some property control or you be stick with they and wait to see hope kfh hear this debate and be ashamed of its behaviour amendment be about leasehold tribunal know the minister speak of precedent setting but resident across the country would tell he otherwise beg he to look at the warner property in walthamstow and at management which repeatedly rip off constituent across the country the hon member for harborough neil be not here but he ask why people have to pay terrorism insurance in walthamstow that be the warner estate company which say that because the plane bomber live in our constituency household have to buy terrorism insurance such case come up time and again with leasehold and they do not get fix in the tribunal amendment would give precedent diane abbott debbie
