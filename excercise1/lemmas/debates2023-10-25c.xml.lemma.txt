the rest of the political party put together we know that that lead to well outcome for british people but there be always further to go that be why we have commit to enact section of the equality act so that all political party would be require to be transparent about the diversity of their candidate why will the government not do the same at the end of the day it be the electorate who decide who get to represent they the hon member might be cherry pick statistic on which party be the most diverse we can do the same and talk about how the conservatives have have three female prime ministers

appalling practice call the shadow home secretary almost day have pass since the government first promise to ban conversion therapy and day have pass since conversion therapy bill be promise in the last queen speech the delay be not this minister responsibility accord to the press they be result of differ view on the government front bench but because of that there be still no bill can the minister tell the house whether the next king speech will include commitment to full loophole free ban on lgbt conversion therapy yes or no should have think the hon lady would know that no one ever make announcement about what be in the king speech ahead of his majesty delivery of that speech let also say to she respectfully that she should not believe everything she read in the press as for the rest of her question refer she to the answer give few moment ago would therefore counsel the minister to advise his colleague to stop brief the press on these issue and get on with deliver because

increase by more than in the last five year and more than third of all hate crime be now violence against the person offence know that the minister care deeply about this subject so can he please

these issue but want to make this point keep hear that we do not care about lgbt issue it be this government who introduce same sex marriage and it be this government who introduce it in northern ireland it be this government who introduce ture law in we have modernise gender recognition certificate and make they affordable we have remove self funding for fertility treatment for same sex

this have have massive impact on tackle unequal pay for woman and black worker in particular have talk about pilot similar salary history measure why have the government appear to stall on what would be really positive policy we be not stall our pilot will support employer to take step towards transparency in their own organisation to see the impact for themselves we know that this be not straightforward which be why we will ensure that employer look to implement great transparency in their recruitment process be able to access good practice and learn from each other call the scottish national party spokesperson the uk government inclusive britain update report acknowledge the value of measure the ethnicity pay gap and the government have publish guidance for employer note that employer can use ethnicity pay gap calculation to consider evidence base action to address any unfair disparity despite that the uk government will not legislate to mandate reporting since employment law be reserved matter will the minister urge her government to do the right thing and mandate ethnicity pay gap reporting or urge the devolution of employment law to scotland so that the scottish government can absolutely not this be something that we will not be devolve and it absolutely should not be mandatory ethnicity pay gap can not be measure in the same way as gender pay gap have say this to the hon lady at this dispatch box multiple time we can measure pay gap where population be binary male and female but we can not do it across broad spectrum of ethnicity we have publish guidance for those employer who want to do this but it would be absolutely wrong to mandate disabled people additional costs what recent estimate she have make of the level of additional cost affect household with disabled people we will spend around billion this year on benefit to support disabled people and people with health condition no such estimate have be make but as government we be provide total support of more than billion from to and we be determined to help all household and individual with the rise cost of bill this include an additional for more than million disabled people that be great but back in the real world the minister really do know that the rise cost of living be have disproportionately negative impact on disabled people they face high living cost as consequence and they still face barrier to employment do she accept that target action include disability pay gap reporting be now need to support disabled people if the hon gentleman be concerned about his disabled constituent can point he to the household support fund which be also help those constituent and their carer in his constituency in his real world an additional million have land to

disabled people this week on exactly this matter in relation to one of my own constituent and will see that he hear it again from my right hon friend topical questions if she will make statement on her departmental responsibility as the minister for women and equalities it would be remiss of not to reflect on the way religious community in the uk have be impact by the terrible event in the middle east all our citizen have right to feel secure and at peace in britain one of the reason we have be able to integrate people from all over the world be an unwritten rule that people with root elsewhere do not play out foreign conflict on the street of this country we owe duty of care and civility to our neighbour whatever their ethnicity religion or background all of we be free to practise our faith and celebrate our culture but we must do so in positive way consistent with fundamental value that be the bedrock of britain be afraid to say that in recent day we have see that social contract be breach in particular believe that the hostility direct towards our jewish community the call for jihad the ostentatious indifference to the victim of terrorism the aggressive chanting by mob brandish placard of hate and the odious people rip down poster of miss child do not reflect our value as nation we must all stand firm on the boundary of acceptable behaviour particularly in the public space that we all share that be why today be remind public sector organisation that they have legal obligation as part of the equality duty to consider how they contribute to the advancement of good relation in community as they deliver public service where organisation be have difficulty do that urge they to write to as soon as possible for advice on how they can fulfil their legal obligation thank my right hon friend for that answer there should be no place for hatred in our community as woman in her member know how challenging the menopause can be especially when you have busy

will she take to address that thank the hon lady for her point in there be few female pensioner in absolute poverty than in after housing cost point the hon lady to the barnett consequential of the household support fund in scotland which be there to be distribute by her government to those in need as you will know mr speaker watford be thriving multi faith community and it be privilege to take

the inter faith network on november to promote national organisation to understand how we can all engage well with the different faith in our community and will he please also consider attend the event if diary permit faith be vital part of people identity and of their community we fully support the invaluable work be do by people around the country who be inspire by their faith my hon friend

happen will be happy to look at it if she raise it with in its census the office for national statistics estimate that there be transgender people in the uk do the minister agree with the separate office for statistics regulation that due to skewed methodology this number be likely to have be huge overestimate share the concern that the office for statistics regulation have raise and in february ask my official to explore with the ons whether because of lack of understanding of the question the census have the number right we need to be very careful about language people do not often understand what we mean when we use term such as transgender and gender identity we have to make sure that they understand they the ons will be conduct and report on research to explore that issue and it should publish the result by the end of the year and will monitor they go forward some year ago the united nations find that disabled people right be be systematically violate by conservative ministers recently the equality and human rights commission find that nothing at all have change be the minister not ashamed thank the hon lady for raise that matter the point regard the ehrc be that it be an independent and public body but do not think that any member come to this house to erode anybody right whether they be disabled or have health issue absolutely refute what the hon lady say

million civilian million of they child of food water medicine and fuel be not in accordance with international law will he press israel to restore the supply of these essential for the sake of innocent civilian and the future of the entire region it be important that we do everything we can to get humanitarian aid to those who need it in gaza which be why on monday we announce doubling of our international aid to the region and why the development minister be actively engage with our partner on the ground to ensure that that aid get to those people as quickly as possible double child rapist and murderer colin pitchfork have yet another parole review hear only few week ago thank the justice secretary for have listen to and engage the reconsideration mechanism rule know that the prime minister do not have any decision make role on the independent parole board it be independent of government but it be wing of the executive it be not the judiciary do the prime minister agree that generally as point of principle man sexual offender who rape and brutally murder young woman as mr pitchfork do to dawn ashworth and lynda mann in my constituency should remain in prison for most of their natural life agree with my hon friend that the public should be confident that murderer and rapist will be keep behind bar for as long as be necessary to keep the public safe that be why we be reform the parole system our victims and prisoners bill will mean that minimise risk and protect the public be the sole consideration in parole board decision it will also give the justice secretary the power to step in on behalf of the public and take second look at decision to release the most serious offender include murderer and rapist last week we announce that we will be introduce long sentence for dangerous criminal for the most heinous crime life will mean life call the leader of the opposition join the prime minister in his comment about all those affect by the storm start

have be do to support the most vulnerable over the past year in fact join the right hon and learn gentleman in welcome the new member to their place after all suspect that the new member for mid beds may actually support little more than the last do notice that the new member say that they will be oppose new housing in their local area while the new member for tamworth claim that they will protect green space urge they to have word with their leader because that be not exactly his position although with his track record of turn who know what his housing policy will be next week so much for be the change candidate the prime minister can not even distance himself from those appalling comment have to ask he where on earth do he think his candidate get the idea in the first place that throw expletive at struggle family be his government official position let we just look at the record of what this government be do to help those people pay for around half of typical family energy bill over the last year support worth over the most vulnerable in our society receive in direct cost of live support record increase in the national living wage record increase in welfare and this winter pensioner to receive an extra or alongside their winter fuel payment to help they through what we know be tough time all of that significant support fund by this government would be put at risk by labour reckless plan to borrow billion year the prime minister keep boast about how great thing be the voter keep tell he that he have get it wrong can see why the tamworth candidate think that he be just follow government line annalisa and her two child live in their home for eight year in may they be kick out with no fault eviction notice despite his government pledge to scrap no fault eviction this week the prime minister crumble to the landlord on his own back benches and kill the policy what message other than the message deliver by his candidate in tamworth could annalisa possibly take from that we have take significant action to help renter like annalisa and other we have cap hold deposit at one week we have protect tenant from rip off tenancy fee deliver almost half million affordable home for rent halve the percentage of substandard home in the private rented sector and strengthen local authority enforcement power because the government be deliver for renter we be also

stand in the way of that interruption order just to say it be prime minister question not opposition question interruption be sorry prime minister it be prime minister question do not need you nod against my decision be sure that annalisa and her child who have now be evict will take great comfort from that non answer emma and her teenage son see their mortgage go up by more than government

interest rate be global challenge they be at their high level in america and europe for more than or year mortgage rate have double in america and treble in europe to help mortgage holder we want to ensure that they can use the mortgage charter we have agree with the bank thank to the step we have take someone with property with about leave on their mortgage could save more than month and lock in new deal six month before theirs end and repossession will be prohibit for month from the first miss payment the right hon and learn gentleman might have miss that that policy be twice as generous as labour absolutely tone deaf in every caff pub and supermarket in britain people be have the same conversation we can afford that put it back on the shelf it too expensive the prime minister be completely oblivious just pat himself on the back emily and jamie have work hard and be save to buy their own home they be nearly there last year but he scrap house building target because his back

live crisis and government who have abandon they abandon renter at risk of be kick out abandon mortgage payer struggle to make end meet and abandon people who dream of own their own house the truth be that the prime minister candidate in tamworth sum up perfectly just how he and his tories be treat the british public so will he just call general election and give the british public the chance to respond as they do in selby mid beds and tamworth they have hear the government tell they to eff off and they want the chance to return the compliment as we see with the right hon and learn gentleman recent decision on build new house politician like he always take the easy way out whereas we be get on with make the right long term decision to change this country for the well on net zero on high speed on smoke free generation on education and on energy security contrast that with his leadership too cautious to say anything and hop that nobody notice let tell he come that general election the

true mr speaker like my right hon friend the prime minister have the honour and privilege of represent rural constituency be sure that he like occasionally feel certain degree of frustration that although progress have be make in this area the rubric of funding formulae for thing such as the environment agency local government the police and education still fail to adequately reflect the difficulty and challenge of deliver public service in rural area will my right hon friend the chancellor and the wide government use the opportunity of the autumn statement and the forthcoming budget to explore those issue far and make the delivery of service well for the prime minister constituent and mine thank my hon friend for raise that important issue on behalf of his and my constituent it be vital that we have the same high quality service in rural area as in our town and city be pleased to tell he that we be provide million through the rural service delivery grant to help rural council achieve exactly that we be currently review the police funding formula remember work with he to ensure that the national funding formula for school take account of the different characteristic of school and their pupil we will continue to keep all those thing under review agree with he entirely our rural community must be give the same funding and public service as everyone else in our country call the snp deputy leader yesterday the un warn that hospital in gaza have just hour of fuel leave to keep their electricity go that be hour ago the electricity run out tonight we have human responsibility to all the people in gaza but we have particular responsibility for uk citizen some of whom be in those hospital with no food no water no medicine and no way out how much bad do the situation have to get before the prime minister will join we in call for humanitarian ceasefire from the start we have say that the first and most important principle be that israel have the right to defend itself under international law our support for that position be absolute and unchanged but we have also say from the start that we want british national to be able to leave gaza hostage to be release and humanitarian aid to get in we recognise that for all that to happen there have to be safe environment which of course necessitate specific pause as distinct from ceasefire we discuss that with partner yesterday evening at the united nations and we have be consistently clear that everything must be do to protect civilian in line with international law and to continue get more aid flow into gaza the grow call for ceasefire be also about calm the situation in the broad region especially the west bank unicef have report over fatality and over injure child since the conflict begin due to unrelenting attack if we ignore that we risk pour petrol on fire in place that only require spark to ignite can the prime minister understand that join call for ceasefire be now the good and maybe the only way to stop this conflict escalate beyond all control we have to remember that israel have suffer shockingly brutal terrorist attack hamas be responsible for this conflict and israel have the right to protect itself in line with international law as the un charter make clear we will continue to urge the israelis to follow international law but we also have to remember that hamas cruelly embe themselves in civilian population we be do everything we can to get aid into the region be pleased to say that an raf flight leave the uk for egypt this morning carry tonne of aid for gaza the relief supply include more than medical kit solar light and water filter for family and warehousing equipment our team be on the ground ready to receive we will continue to do everything we can to increase the flow of aid include fuel into gaza in the matter of walleys quarry my constituent have be utterly let down and fail by the environment agency not only have it fail to prosecute rogue operator for the repeat breach of its permit we now learn that for the past seven year all of its monitoring equipment include in your constituency mr speaker have be grossly under record level of hydrogen sulphide by factor of approximately two or three that be the monitoring equipment that people have be rely on to tell they that their air be clean and safe to breathe give everything that have happen we really need to see some proper action now have have enough of the ea and my constituent have too so will the prime minister do everything in his power to get grip on this fail organisation my hon friend be absolutely right to raise the concern of his constituent the environment agency criminal investigation be ongoing so as hope he understand can not comment far on it however with regard to his concern about the measurement inaccuracy have be assure and have check that the environment agency be work swiftly to understand the scale of the problem the environment secretary be monitor the situation and have ask she to keep my hon friend update regularly few short month ago the world come to belfast to celebrate the good friday agreement at the heart of that agreement be the realisation that we could not use violence as tool for revenge or to achieve our political aim as israelis and almost palestinians lie die or dead when will the prime minister say enough be enough when will he call for ceasefire when will he tell israel to stop mete out collective punishment to the people of gaza and when will he and other world leader insist on political solution that involve palestinian state for the palestinian people as say an important principle be that israel do have the right to defend itself under international law to ensure that attack like this one which be brutal and horrific for its citizen can not happen again we continue to support that position but as say from the start we have also want to ensure that humanitarian aid can go in and hostage and foreign national can come out we recognise that that mean there have to be safe environment which of course necessitate specific pause as distinct from ceasefire we discuss exactly this with our international partner yesterday at the united nations and will continue to do so as make clear on monday we have double down on our effort to find well future for the palestinian people that have be feature of all our diplomacy in the region and we will continue to give all our effort to make that happen for too long bradford council have fail to represent the good interest of my constituent whether in its catastrophic failure on child service its inability to invest our own council tax back into keighley and ilkley or its refusal to instigate review into child sexual exploitation across the bradford district local resident and be feed up of be ignore by bradford council and we want out will the prime minister meet to discuss my case for leave bradford council and

discuss his concern far with he as my hon friend do not do so maybe can plug his event this afternoon in the jubilee room keighley and ilkley showcase perhaps the minister can come to that event and discuss it in person then just year ago the new prime minister promise to unite our country not with word but with action quite rightly voter make judgment on action but in my constituency as in many other the prime minister have not deliver on his promise arbroath house in easington colliery be gp practice without the funding to deliver basic community health service community such as shotton south hetton haswell and horden lack the police officer to tackle crime and antisocial behaviour we see sewage be dump on our coastline at seaham and blackhall without prosecution of the privatised

the benefit of sustainable drainage system which work in different way it be already requirement that sustainable drainage system should be give priority in any major new development and development

council like my hon friend and of emergency responder everywhere who have be work tirelessly in affected area they have our thank and we stand ready to consider any request from council to support their recovery effort point of order on point of order mr speaker the house rise tomorrow for day believe regrettably and sadly it may be likely that ground invasion of gaza will commence during that period this not only have consequence for the palestinians and the israelis but could create turmoil and destabilise the whole middle east appreciate that it be the government who determine whether or not parliament be recall but in your conversation with the government will you advise they that the house should be recall to debate such serious issue you be absolutely right that it would not be for under the normal rule although recognise the importance of major escalation and what could happen in the middle east you be correct that it would be for the government not for unfortunately to recall the house will work through the usual channel to try to ensure that quite rightly we look to see what can be do in what would be special circumstance because obviously the house will have prorogue do not lose sight of what you have say and take it on board will work with other behind the scene to see how we would manage such situation far to that point of order mr speaker can assure the house that the foreign commonwealth and development office my office and other departments across whitehall be very aware that this house will want to be keep update about the ongoing situation many right hon and hon member will have constituent directly affect and we be work with the house of commons library to ensure that people be update about the situation during the recess okay thank you on point of order mr speaker seek your guidance to understand how we can table write question about the government policy of evict afghans from hotel accommodation project run by the minister for veterans affair out of the cabinet office have give the minister notice that would raise this issue despite the minister have give multiple statement to the house this year on the housing of our afghan friend my front bench colleague and be unable to table write question to the cabinet office which instead be be reallocate to either the home office or the department for levelling up housing and communities the table office staff be great but think bit of parliamentary plumbing need to be put in place to make sure that effective scrutiny via write question of the minister lead this area be possible please could you advise how can ensure that the minister for veterans affairs can be successfully scrutinise by write parliamentary question for the area he lead on in government be concern by what the hon member have raise and grateful to he for give notice of his point of order he will know that the table office be guide by government departments about the matter of which minister respond to question and on policy area will look into the matter take it very seriously and be very concerned we all know that the minister for veterans affairs be very concerned about veteran so be sure he will be disappoint to know that those question be not reach he will investigate the leader of the house be here and be sure that she will assist be sure that we can work together because no member should be unable to lay question to the minister minister be answerable to this house all member from whatever party should have that ability be very disappointed by what have be tell we will get to the bottom of it register of derelict buildings motion for leave to bring in bill standing order no pm beg to move that leave be give to bring in bill to require local authority to publish register of derelict building in their area to make provision in respect of the preparation and maintenance of such register and for connected purpose my home town now my home city be place be very proud of doncaster have many wonderful asset and the people be the good in the land however although plus per cent of it be great some part be not so the bill will make real difference to that derelict building be problem they blight our city town and village this place have provide local authority with power to tackle derelict building sadly though those power be not be use as we intend the bill will provide an incentive to local authority to do their duty and exercise their power for the community as parliament intend it will start to address their dereliction of duty we do not even know exactly how many derelict site there be or precisely where they be how can we as society tackle the problem of derelict building until we truly know the scale of the problem it be problem of real significance as come home on the train to doncaster from parliament on thursday evening the first list building see be denison house by the railway station the window be smash weed be grow out of the guttering and there be general neglect derelict walk through the station and see the grand theatre another list building derelict again walk through town past waterdale derelict pass by the new expensive and shiny but half empty council building and on south parade see another denison house also list and also derelict this be the former home of sir edmund beckett denison the man who in bring the railway to doncaster that building of his be now an eyesore derelict again as drive to the town and village across my constituency pass tyram hall derelict keep on drive into thorne to view the work to reopen the leisure centre and drive by haynes house derelict pass thorne brewery derelict have secretary of state visit doncaster and take he to edlington leisure centre derelict prince crescent many property there be also derelict the list go on and on why be this so it be because there be no register no personal responsibility and no example set by labour control city of doncaster council the power they hold be not be exercise labour care for our city be seemingly as derelict as the property have describe we can not let this state of affair continue if we do all we shall see be further deterioration and more derelict building it drag we all down to their level level down not level up my bill would ensure that all derelict building be identify it would answer three question first what be the definition of derelict building secondly who will create and maintain the list and thirdly how will it be accessible to the public albert einstein be repute to have say this about solve problem if have an hour to solve problem spend minute think about the problem and five minute think about solution have give this considerable thought and it seem to that the first step must be to have register of derelict building the obvious body well place for this exercise would be the local authority local authority already have the necessary infrastructure and resource they have list of all the empty building already they maintain record for council tax and business rate for property include those that be exempt they will accordingly have list of all building and structure within their area of jurisdiction within their boundary it be important to note that their department for planning and building control as well as for council tax and business rate will have record that can be cross reference not only be local authority an obvious candidate but they be the one well place there be no need to set up quango no need to spend enormous sum of taxpayer money and as we have see local authority already have the infrastructure and the record it would merely be question of identify which of the empty building be derelict they all have website with information accessible by the public the small step require of they by the bill would not incur substantial additional expenditure ongoing maintenance of the record would not require much time effort or expense either my bill will be the first step on this journey to address the blight of derelict building in our community this be the first step to the solution by pass law require all local authority to identify derelict building in their area we can start to make progress let start with the definition derelict site be define in my bill as site that have structure or structure upon the land that be ruinous derelict or in dangerous condition the next step be to identify the derelict building and property council officer would first check their exist record for empty property most such property if not all will be easily identify by their status regard payment of council tax or business rate provisional list can be easily create which then should be publish additionally all local authority have district councillor who should know their ward intimately conservative councillor do that do know it seem to that each councillor could easily provide the council with the detail and address of building they believe be an eyesore in their locality and they should be put on provisional list would not expect there to be many that be not in that list those property would then be visit by council officer to establish the condition the property on the provisional list would then be classify as derelict and the owner give day notice of the intention to give that classification to the property any owner would have the right to object provide reason in writing these objection could then be review the local authority could then either withdraw the classification or confirm it so why be such list of any value to we the advantage be numerous it would enable we first to know the scale of the problem it would provide an incentive to all area to see that list reduce rather than increase should the building be leave as they be be improve or be demolish these be question that will arise and the right answer may be different across the board should improvement work be exempt from vat should compulsory purchase order be make should owner be require to carry out improvement or demolition should they be persuade to address that by carrot or stick or indeed by both many such question arise the bill do not attempt to answer they it would however enable we for the first time to understand the scale of the problem face by every part of this wonderful country want to ensure that our city town and village be not blight derelict building be blight there be no doubt about that let we identify the scale of the problem let we learn from the wisdom of albert einstein let we think about the problem the bill would enable we to do exactly that then and only then shall we find the solution and return all our town and city to their former glory question put and agree to order that nick fletcher dr liam fox antony higginbotham mark eastwood damien moore paul bristow brendan clarke smith mark jenkinson danny kruger lia nici alexander stafford and miriam cates present the bill nick fletcher accordingly present the bill bill read the first time to be read second time on friday november and to be print bill economic crime and corporate transparency bill consideration of lords message after clause failure to prevent fraud beg to move that this house insist on its amendment and disagree with the lords in their amendment and with this it will be convenient to discuss amendment and the follow motion that this house insist on its amendment in lieu and disagree with the lords in their amendment in lieu be pleased to bring this important bill back to the house this afternoon for what sincerely hope be the last time give that this will be the third time we have debate and vote on similar issue urge opposition front bench members and those in the other place not to risk the safe passage of this hugely significant page bill by continue to press these amendment the government have appreciate the input of right hon and hon member from both side of the house include the right hon member for barking dame margaret hodge and for birmingham hodge hill liam byrne my right hon and learn friend the member for south swindon sir robert buckland and my hon friend the member for bromley and chislehurst sir robert neill to help change the bill for the well we be discuss failure to prevent together with the identification of doctoring the government be take world lead measure think this be the first time that major economy such as ours have implement they which we should be proud we be implement through the bill of course if the elect chamber express its strong will on these remain issue for the third time very much hope that the other place will agree that now be the time for it to accept that position think we would all rather have what we have do than see all this good work be in vain by let the legislation fall let discuss the two issue in turn will keep my remark brief as the argument remain the same as on the precede two time we have discuss they will first address lords amendment and on the failure to prevent threshold will also address amendment table last night by the right hon member for barking on government review of the threshold while my noble friend lord garnier amendment have move close yet again to the government position by exempt micro entity and small organisation from the offence be afraid that the government will not support the lowering of the threshold at this time let repeat the reason why it be already an offence to perpetrate fraud the objective of the new offence be to ensure that there be accountability where fraud occur in large organisation there be simply no need to apply any such offence to small organisation every time such an offence be introduce business owner end up distracted from run their business by take time to reassess their compliance risk which often involve take professional advice we assess that the revise threshold propose by lord garnier would cost medium sized enterprise million in one off cost and nearly million in annual recur cost we should be make it easy for business to operate in the uk and only impose additional regulatory burden when absolutely necessary the government completely reject the notion of use such an offence simply to raise awareness among business owner of the seriousness of the problem of fraud there would be other more proportionate way to do that if necessary in response to the amendment table by the right hon member for barking the government have already future proof the bill by include delegate power to allow the government to raise low or remove the threshold altogether of course as with all legislation the government will keep the threshold under review make personal commitment to do that and to make change if evidence suggest that they be require do not think that government review be necessary for that to take place so ask the right hon member not to move her amendment we must bear in mind that review do not guarantee change anyway what guarantee change be have the right people at the dispatch box make change whether those be people from her party or my party and both party be equally exercise by these concern urge all right hon and hon member to support the government motion to disagree with the lords amendment to ensure that we take proportionate approach and do not impose unnecessary measure on legitimate business that would curb our economic growth turn to lords amendment table by lord faulks on cost protection in civil recovery case the government remain of the view that such an amendment would be significant departure from fundamental principle of justice that the loser pay and therefore not something that should be rush into without careful consideration furthermore as set out when we last debate this issue we have see no clear evidence that the amendment would increase the number of case take on by law enforcement however that be not to say that such an amendment be necessarily bad idea that be why we previously add to the bill statutory commitment to review the payment of cost in civil recovery case in england and wales by enforcement authority to publish report on the finding and to lay that before parliament within month with regard to civil cost reform in england and wales the government would normally look to consult appropriate consultee include the senior judiciary the law society and the bar council enact the reform now without full review would not allow judge and relevant organisation or indeed their counterpart in northern ireland and scotland to comment on how it would be read and apply in practice we therefore feel it would be irresponsible for we to rush into make such significant change at the end of bill passage without full consideration by government and further scrutiny by parliament very much hope that all right hon and hon member will agree that that be the responsible approach to take and therefore support the government position the minister say clearly that there have be consultation with scotland and northern ireland will he indicate who those discussion have take place with be it bank or the departments look after matter in the absence of function northern ireland assembly be keen to know who do the work to ensure that there be accountability for everyone that be good point there be clearly different legal jurisdiction in northern ireland and scotland with of course the court of session in scotland from legal perspective the counsel in those jurisdiction be the people who discuss this in wide issue such as failure to prevent bank and many other stakeholder have people who will consult during the process be happy to keep up the conversation with the hon gentleman the reason ask the question be quite specific although it might not necessarily relate to the issue directly the minister refer to bank number of local organisation and community group back home which be register and constitute as community institution have have their bank account close bank have close their account down because they say they be non profitable be it right that bank should be able to do that know the minister understand the matter order can just help little bit the hon gentleman be very good but his intervention be very long why do he not put down to speak it might be easy have to get other people in as well the hon gentleman raise very important issue relate to the concern about de banking that we have across the economy the economic secretary to the treasury my hon friend the member for arundel and south downs andrew griffith be look at it as be the treasury in future it be our intention to ensure that when bank close account they give valid reason why rather than close they summarily he be absolutely right to raise the point and be very happy to engage with he on it because it affect business as well as community group to conclude encourage everyone to agree with the government position on these two area it be vital that we achieve royal assent without delay so we can proceed to implement the important reform in the bill as quickly as possible it be an honour to speak on the bill again be hop that we could conclude the proceeding on the bill as soon as possible and it be disappointing that the government be yet to make further compromise the bill be welcome in principle but it should not have take the war on ukraine to prompt the government into action be grateful to my right hon friend the members for barking dame margaret hodge and for birmingham hodge hill liam byrne and to members across the house for work together to improve the bill economic crime pose threat to our country national security our institution our economy and cause serious harm to our citizen and wide society conservative estimate place the cost of economic crime at million year accord to the national crime agency and the failure to stop criminal benefit from the proceed of their crime can fund further criminality that can include offence such as funding organise crime group terrorist activity drug dealing and people traffic this be very serious issue economic crime as the minister know have many victim for too long the government have turn blind eye to corrupt and dirty money allow russian illicit finance to flood into britain that let putin crony stash ill get gain and even recycle the proceed of crime into luxury property that be well document and have be highlight by many member across the house as well as in select committees accord to analysis by transparency international property to the tune of billion have be buy through suspicious wealth of those almost quarter in value be buy by russians accuse of corruption or link to the kremlin most be hold via secretive offshore company that drive up property price for ordinary people in our country more than two third of english and welsh property hold by foreign shell company do not report their true owner research by the london school of economics and warwick university show that the register of overseas entities be not fully effective for of such property essential information about their beneficial owner remain miss or publicly inaccessible despite the register that mean we still can not know whether sanctioned individual money launderer or other corrupt individual be benefit from those property we must not sustain economic growth off the back of dirty money the government have already delay the bill and these action for too long in that time money have be lose economic crime have become ingrained and the uk economy have once again lose out give that the nature and necessity of the bill have already be discuss at length will focus on address the two amendment during the passage of the bill helpful alteration have be make to ensure that it be robust the lords amendment before we today seek to address two omission we be very disappointed that the government be not willing to compromise and not willing to heed the wise and expert input of the lords that be deeply disappointing because great deal could be achieve if the minister and his government take note include from hon and learn member on their own side rise if the minister be brief rather than talk the bill out like he do last time will give way will be very brief on the question of compromise the hon lady will have notice that there be no failure to prevent offence when the legislation be first table nor be there an identification doctrine there have be significant compromise on the government side our preference clearly be to move forward in that spirit of compromise we have achieve great deal with the bill which have move from under page to page do not think it be right to say that the government have not compromise when the minister be back bencher he be powerful advocate on the very issue we be discuss today it be shame he have be muzzle but appreciate that he be in difficult position hope we can have some comprise but clearly he have not manage to persuade senior member of his government ask the government to once again carefully consider these amendment so that we can well tackle the problem of fraud and economic crime the minister highlight all the problem with the amendment but want to talk about their strength the noble lord garnier amendment on failure to prevent fraud which exempt small and micro enterprise highlight that the criminal law should be uniform and apply to all in similar way this be not just small insignificant amendment but change that would significantly alter law enforcement for context fraud be the most common crime in the uk account for of all crime introduce failure to prevent offence would help to deter company from engage in or facilitate fraud to fully change corporate behaviour we must ensure that the offence apply to all company regardless of size as have be state on many occasion since the failure to prevent bribery cover all company there be no reason why this measure should not also cover business of all size it simply create more discrepancy and confusion for business the size of business should not determine who be exempt the government have tout this exemption as protection for small business against unnecessary red tape but in reality this carve out deprive small and medium size enterprise of the defence of have put in place reasonable anti fraud procedure small company will instead be cover only by the fraud offence itself when large company would be catch by the light failure to prevent fraud offence the introduction of new failure to prevent offence should apply to all and the corresponding defence of put in place reasonable defence procedure should be available to all in effect through this carve out the government be create an uneven playing field that be bias against small company the bill currently leave large gap for economic crime to not only persist but flourish which know be not the intention of the minister the amendment would have go long way to address those issue ask he once again to carefully consider the amendment rather than reject it want to turn to the amendment from the noble lord faulks on cost protection in civil recovery case the amendment give more discretion to court judge to alter the allocation of legal cost to ensure that extortionate legal fee be not hindrance to justice the spirit of the amendment be that it will help to prevent criminal benefit from the proceed of crime here or around the world when it come to case where enforcement agency be try to prosecute high level large scale economic crime cost order remain serious barrier know that first hand from evidence we receive when serve on the treasury committee where we conduct two inquiry on these issue our enforcement agency need strong backing if they be to take on fraud money laundering and other type of economic crime on the large scale right now the government should be on the side of our agency rather than tie their hand behind their back the amendment would ensure that criminal crony and kleptocrat be not give cover by leave the back door open for they to spend their way out of justice that can not be right it would ensure that the size of their bank account and asset do not give they guarantee get out of jail free card just because they can afford to meet any expense require to support their case the minister know that this be problem he have hear evidence of it he know that it be serious issue that need to be address it have be disappointing to observe the government lack of willingness to protect our law enforcement it seem reasonable that court could have discretion on how to allocate cost especially when we know of previous case one of which result in family seek cost amount to staggering million that represent of the national crime agency annual budget between and the bill be almost over the line and acknowledge that there have be some improvement but we could do great deal more we have welcome the bill and we welcome the lords amendment so we be disappointed that the government continue to fail to support they we would be in much well place if there be compromise the failure to prevent offence be case in point for year we have be call for replication of the success of the bribery act sadly our capital city have be nickname londongrad and be now consider to be capital where money laundering and fraud be rife that mean that we must do more to tackle these issue but the bill provide only part of the solution the present circumstance require much more radical action than the timidity that we have witness both today and in the last session it be sadden that the government have miss such an important opportunity we will continue to hold their foot to the fire but give the lack of compromise it will be for the next government the next labour government hope to pick up the piece and toughen up our response in order to end the corrosive impact of dirty money in our country rise order before call the next speaker let point out it may not be obvious that we only have until pm to complete this business therefore appeal for brevity be not go to impose time limit because give that everyone present be distinguished and experienced member we should not need one on point of order madam deputy speaker just want to be clear about this assume that we can speak until pm and vote after that be that correct it be let say for the purpose of clarity that the right hon lady be absolutely correct there have be great deal of improvement in the bill and much of its content be welcome recognise that and also recognise what the minister have say but be sorry to say that the dead hand of the treasury have yet again get in the way of our get the bill into the good possible state let we be blunt about it the government regrettably have not move which be why support the amendment table by the right hon member for barking dame margaret hodge and my right hon and learn friend the member for south swindon sir robert buckland which have sign and which think offer sensible compromise if it take long for the treasury and other part of the government to be persuade well and good let we have proper review after month however serious issue have arise and want to make two brief point about it let deal first with the point make in the other place by lord garnier about the inherent contradiction in test of criminality base on the size of an organisation can see that there be proportionality point to be make about very small enterprise but there be good evidence and anyone who practise in the field will know that fraud and other illicit activity be often channel through small company and the people in those company be precisely the people over whom we do need to have degree of control law enforcement be not with respect needless bureaucracy it be fundamental to good business and think that that point be regrettably be miss it be point underline when we hear public evidence on the bill people explain to we how number of different small company might well be set up to become conduit for fraud that be compelling point and it accord with the evidence that the justice committee be give in relation to our inquiry into fraud in the justice system the irony be that the government current stance may well create perverse incentive that be certainly not what the minister want and it be not what anyone in the house ought to want the point about cost cap be important as well but be particularly exercise about the failure to prevent offence everyone have argue for that and we be nearly there hop that the government be reasonable would say let we have look at it let we have commitment in the bill accept that the minister be an entirely honourable man and accept what he say but know from personal experience that minister do not stay forever at the end of the day we want an assurance that this provision will be write into the statute and there will be review because it be so important beg the minister to reflect on that otherwise those of we who want to be able to support the government today will find ourselves in position where we can not do so although there be so little between we the ability to move just that little bit far would send much well signal as it be the lords pass these amendment last time with large majority than before and they will be entitle to take note of that in the event that the bill go back to they again therefore hope that even at the last minute the government will reflect call dame margaret hodge beg your pardon call alison thewliss know that when you refer to we all as distinguished and experience member you do not mean madam deputy speaker this be the third time we have be back here and think it incumbent on the government to listen to the lords they have make it clear that they feel strongly about their very reasonable amendment which show how important they be and how we should be get this right there be no question that as the minister suggest we be go to let the bill fall today think that if he be worried about that he would accept the lords amendment this afternoon rather than allow the process to go on and on we do not need to be here at the last minute he could have accept many of the amendment at much early stage because fundamentally he agree with they we know that because he say it on many occasion before he take ministerial office think that great deal can be do if the minister will make that compromise this afternoon the notion that of business can be exempt from the failure to prevent offence be absolutely mad small business be both part of and victim of economic crime some figure from uk finance arrive in our inboxe early today accord to its finding criminal steal million through unauthorised and authorise fraud in just the first half of uk finance say that that be decrease but it be still significant amount of money business as well as individual be lose out and the government should be pay more attention to that the minister describe failure to prevent as distraction for business wonder if he also think for consistency sake that the failure to prevent bribery offence in the bribery act and the failure to prevent tax evasion offence in the criminal finances act be distraction for business if he think that failure to prevent economic crime be distraction for business he must surely think that those other offence be also an unnecessary bit of bureaucracy that business have to carry out it do not make any sense fully support the level playing field for cost protection we must give our enforcement agency both the tool and money to do their job no enforcement agency should be think we can not afford to take on this case we can not afford to prosecute these economic criminal the government should be support law enforcement allow this lords amendment to go through and ensure that we make the good possible legislation there be no excuse for the government not to do these thing the government agree with they and we in the house agree with they on cross party basis the government should get on with it and not return the bill to the lords will certainly remember your exhortation to brevity madam deputy speaker as you know that be something of challenge for at the good of time no no think my right hon friend may suffer from the same affliction dare say but will draw veil of charity over that my hon friend and my friend the minister have campaign assiduously with we in the trench on this issue for many year yield to none in my admiration for he and want to put on record how grateful be that he be in this place in that spot do the job that he be do we have come long way well remember be on the parliamentary business and legislation committee give authorisation for this bill in the first place and know then that it would require heavy amendment during its course it be inevitable that in the light of the appalling incident in ukraine and the change world situation the bill would develop and mature and mature it have the identification principle change be truly radical and reflect view long hold by the law commission and other that we need to update the tesco nattrass principle which be now year old salute the minister and colleague in the lords for make sure that that have happen but must press he again about the basis upon which the government make assertion very much at the last minute about the regulatory or administrative cost burden on small and medium sized business do not think that they be go to be as dramatically high as they assert we have not have proper time to test the estimate and do not think that they stand up to scrutiny they do not reflect the government position on previous failure to prevent offence namely for tax evasion and bribery and this beg huge range of question there be no doubt that my colleague in the legal profession refer the house to my entry in the register of members financial interests on every occasion and do so now will feast upon these threshold definition bad than that unscrupulous operator in the field will exploit these threshold definition and find clever way around the law we know what that mean we will see shell company and people of straw we will see the same behaviour that we be rightly try to eradicate because we want this country to be one of the good place in the world to invest this be chiefly an economic argument yes there be morality to it but chiefly it be an economic argument that be why at the last minute as we come up to prorogation remind my hon friend the minister of the increase majority in the other place for these amendment and in particular of the attempt we have make to compromise with the government at the last minute impose myself upon the goodwill of the clerks in order to get further amendment in before the time limit it be manuscript amendment to increase the period of one year mention in the amendment to month it have not be select for debate but the important political point that we wish to make be that we be seek at the last minute to come up with reasonable compromise will give the minister another idea bill normally come in with royal assent which we imagine will happen either today or tomorrow with the prorogation ceremony two month be the normal period for bills to then come into force but he have the power to lay commencement order to ensure that certain part of this bill do not come into force until statutory instrument have be lay he have that power so why not use it in this case and accept the amendment table in the name of my right hon friend the member for barking dame margaret hodge he can see that we be command all the ingenuity that we have to come up with reasonable compromise that will allow the bill to pass in the good possible order make last minute plea to he to accept these exhortation and not to oppose the amendment in the name of my hon friend the member for bromley and chislehurst sir robert neill and can say no more to my hon friend the minister other than to thank he and ask he to go that extra yard this be another leg in long journey want to focus on the amendment that stand in my name which be support by the right hon and learn member for south swindon sir robert buckland and the hon member for bromley and chislehurst sir robert neill may place on the record my thank to everybody across the house some of whom be here today for the way in which we have manage to work together as member of parliament and put our political affiliation behind we in try to find common sense pragmatic way to tackle horrific problem and to improve the bill that be lay before we almost year ago also pay special tribute to member of the house of lords who have again work incredibly hard to improve the bill in practical way in particular thank lord garnier lord agnew lord vaux and lord edward faulks all of whom have move important amendment that have be support by member across the house many of whom be member of the all party parliamentary group on anti corruption and responsible tax draw to member attention what happen to the amendment to the failure to prevent measure when it be first consider by the house of lords it be pass by majority of three when it be consider second time it be pass by majority of when it be consider third time last week it be pass by majority of so the strength of feeling in the other place about the importance of the proposition in the bill simply grow over time as the argument be hear by more and more member of the house of lords and bet that if it go back again it will get through again with an even great majority say to the minister that people be vote for this and it be not just partisan issue cross benchers and member of the conservative party be either vote or choose to abstain that be why we be secure those majority in the house of lords our amendment be move in the spirit of compromise all we be say in that amendment be that we would require the secretary of state to carry out review year after royal assent with report to parliament within month of royal assent where it would assess the impact of exclude so many business from have duty to prevent fraud it would also look at the impact of that on the incidence of fraud and assess the potential merit of bring more company into scope want to take member back to when the government promise to introduce failure to prevent offence on the basis of new clause introduce by the right hon and learn member for south swindon and the hon member for bromley and chislehurst when we consider the bill on report they be detail new clause to which we have give great thought the government agree at that point to adopt our proposal on the basis that we would not seek to divide the house on the issue we keep our side of the bargain but sadly the government have fail to deliver on their commitment so lord garnier try valiantly three time to hold the government to their word and every time he put it to vote he get great majority in favour of what he be propose this measure be first champion when the minister be back bencher as he be well aware he be the individual on our all party parliamentary group who argue the case for it with the great passion and commitment so it be especially sad that the effectiveness of the new offence have be so undermined and weaken by the change he have choose to make or be force to make by colleague in his own department or in the treasury he often argue that we be the first country to introduce failure to prevent offence agree with that but would simply say to he we be also the jurisdiction of choice for dirty money so surely we have duty more than any other jurisdiction to lead on reform and to clamp down on this evil matter the government change have substantially weaken the power of the new offence and the minister have to accept that he have take out the failure to prevent money laundering and the offence now cover only fraud he have exclude all medium sized small and micro business that mean that his carveout have exclude of all business it have exclude two third of all the people employ in private enterprise it have exclude half the turnover that flow through private enterprise say to the minister that this be miss opportunity by his government that represent failure to act firmly and decisively against the scourge of dirty money the government own report national sme fraud segmentation find that medium sized company employ between and employee be significantly more likely to experience fraud than large company the metropolitan police and uk finance have warn that sme be particularly vulnerable to fraud and the procedure to prevent company from commit fraud be exactly the same as the procedure to prevent company from experience fraud why on earth and on what basis have the government choose to excuse they can not understand the logic some of the most worrying actor that we know be engage in either connive or facilitate fraud be now out of scope if we look just at law firm we see that only of the law firm in britain today be now likely to be in scope just yesterday have meeting with lloyds bank which describe to terrible scam relate to house purchase whereby the purchaser have an endless round of email with the solicitor about all the detail of the purchase of property but then an email appear change the bank detail to which the purchaser should pay the deposit as the solicitor do not have the system in place to check on that the purchaser pay into fraudulent account and lose the deposit on the house which be massive amount of money if the solicitor have have those procedure in place that fraud might never have occur repeat to the minister that only of the law firm in britain will now be in scope if the government will hold the right hon lady be make very important point however the failure to prevent offence as draft would not cover that situation because it cover only situation where the benefit be to the corporation concern or an officer within it situation in which third party hijacked system would not be cover whatever the threshold that be an interesting point the simple response be that obviously the drafting of the failure to prevent offence need further improvement to ensure that it cover that sort of instance there be similar argument about the burden on sme when we introduce the bribery act in survey of sme find that nine out of have no concern or problem with the act and also say that it do not affect their ability to export although fear be express before legislation be introduce once it be on the statute book people find that it actually help they under the term of the bill sme already have an appropriate defence as the minister well know that they should only take action that be reasonable in all circumstance that test of reasonableness would protect microbusinesse and sme from have to engage in overly bureaucratic procedure although the argument be overwhelming the minister do not agree we have hop that the government would support and accept our amendment if they be to do so we would not put all these amendment to the vote this mean that the next government labour government we all hope will seize the opportunity that the minister have miss and grasp the issue labour will become the anti corruption champion save our country and our economy this bill arrive in sorry state and we have improve it accept that with the identification doctrine clause on strategic lawsuit against public participation the improvement of accountability with an annual report to parliament and the reluctant acceptance that there may be an increase in fee for companies house but there be still large gap trust have not be cover as they should be and authorise corporate service provider could end up with future dud register cost cap which other hon member have allude to be not in there the whistleblow regime be not in place and asset seizure still have to be tackle we hear whisper that there be third economic crime bill be pleased about that but if we have achieve more with this bill we might not have need another one after all the work that all of we have do to achieve cross party consensus and give the value that we all share would hope that the minister would be bold enough to accept our tiny little compromise and put this bill to bed so that the propose legislation could be pass by the time we prorogue rise to speak in favour of the amendment table by my right hon friend the member for barking dame margaret hodge which give an opportunity to thank she for her extraordinary leadership on this agenda our country be safe and strong for the work that she have help lead in this house over long period like other right hon and hon member be grateful to the minister for ensure that by and large we have approach this bill in the spirit of compromise my right hon friend be absolutely right to say that unfortunately the bill arrive in this place in sorry state of course the good way to examine that be to look at the fantastic manifesto of the all party parliamentary group on anti corruption and responsible tax which of course the minister use to co chair when look at that manifesto which we launch together in westminster abbey not too long ago see that this bill cover fair number of its proposal but not all of they that be why something of mystery still hang over the chamber today and that mystery be that we know that the minister probably want to go much far in this bill he have be collegiate enough not to explain to we either in public or in private just how his hand be tie and why he have pull his punch on so many of the policy proposal include those that we be debate this afternoon want to underline why the failure to prevent clause be so important and why the responsibility for fail to prevent fraud and money laundering should apply to all company not just of uk plc we know as my right hon friend say that unfortunately this country be now one of the two global centre for money laundering and fraud that be badge of shame there be think tank in place such as washington that now write report about what they call the uk kleptocracy problem that be because we have leave our financial service and companies house too weak to police what be grow problem to underline how fast the risk to our country be grow ask the house of commons library to look at the amount of foreign direct investment that be come into our country foreign direct investment come into britain through company that be set up at moment notice from uk offshore account from dictatorship and from country that be only partially free and the reality be that that money have grow fivefold since quarter of trillion pound of foreign direct investment have come into britain from uk offshore account dictatorship and country that be only partially free overwhelmingly be sure that money be clean and good but we all know in this house that some of it be not we have responsibility in this place to make sure that our regime for police corrupt money be as strong as it possibly can be this bill although it make progress still leave weakness in the argument the minister have base his argument more recently on whether we be create undue over burdensome cost to business like he be in business previously be in the wrong place at the wrong time and be elect to this place in know what it be like to grow business from two people around table to multi million pound enterprise that employ lot people know about the responsibility on company director but we grant special privilege to company director in this country and we grant special privilege to company that regime be introduce in when viscount palmerston move that legislation through the house he say that the limited liability act be important because it would act for the common good of the country yet if we have regime that do not ensure that director have responsibility that match those privilege frankly that common good be undermine as my right hon friend say we already have regime in this country that bestow some important responsibility on director include the failure to prevent bribery and the failure to prevent tax evasion therefore there be already important regulatory requirement on director which we as house have judge to be essential to keep our economy clean ask those director to take one more responsibility which be to prevent fraud be not significant extra burden do my right hon friend not agree that if we be to have successful financial service sector we will never get it on the back of dirty money therefore it be ever more important that in relation to both fraud and money laundering we have failure to prevent offence which be not about bang up people in prison but about change the behaviour of company and those who work in they my right hon friend be absolutely right this be point of cross party consensus know it be point of cross party consensus because it be the minister who use to use precisely the same argument to argue for some of the change that we see in the bill we all know that our country do well because by and large we have reputation for clean trade around the world when company file and incorporate in this country that be credential that do they well around the world that be credential that we must do everything in this house to protect which be why the amendment be so important we can not leave weakness in our armour as crime and fraud multiplie the minister say that the proposal would be cost to british business that we could not withstand or sustain but the truth be that while it might be cost to some british business it would also be saving to british business to the british economy and to british taxpayer because it be always cheap and more effective to prevent fraud in the first place than to have to police it or to prosecute fraud after the event when of business small business in this country be victim of fraud we can only imagine how widespread that cost of fraud have now become that average be much high than international average and therefore there be an additional argument that we need to go that one step far to make sure that we be do everything in our power to prevent fraud from arise in the first place all we ask in this amendment be for the minister to face the fact he should bring the fact together put they in report assess they analyse they and present some conclusion to the house how can we have situation where the minister be essentially ask for the freedom to look away that simply can not be the basis of good policy be grateful to my new colleague on the business and trade committee who agree yesterday that we will ask representative of companies house to come before we for hearing frankly if the minister be not prepared to put the fact around fraud in one place shall ask the select committee to do the job for he with the leave of the house wish to thank member who have contribute to the debate we have much in common despite the fact that some small difference still remain as say early the government have come long way since the original tabling of the legislation the number of page have increase by more than so the content of the bill now stand at nearly which show the importance of the legislation that we be debate do not agree with the shadow minister when she say that the government have not be willing to compromise that be not the case at all the failure to prevent offence particularly the identification doctrine be key world lead measure in my opening remark make the commitment and make it again that will we keep this matter under review and that include in particular the threshold even if there be requirement for review in statute there be no requirement on the government to make change follow that review so it be important to maintain the goodwill that we have experience during the passage of the bill perhaps the minister can tell what he mean when he say that he will keep this matter under review what precisely do that mean the way that we have legislate here and the reason for do so in that way have always be inform by information that have come from third party from spotlight on corruption transparency international and other that have be interested in the bill the right hon lady and have work together on this issue in the past in various all party group those be the kind of body that will inform progress as we implement this legislation which again say be world lead the shadow minister talk about level playing field and say that these measure move away from that could not disagree more the key thing be that we do not have level playing field now in small company it be much easy to identify who be responsible for fraud that be why it be more difficult in large company which be why we be apply this to large company fraud be fraud whatever the size of the company this legislation do not allow small or medium sized company to facilitate fraud if they be guilty of fraud they be guilty of fraud and it be far easy to identify the people concern let address the comment of my hon friend the member for bromley and chislehurst sir robert neill and thank he for all the work that he have do on this legislation and on the justice committee ask he not to doubt my motif have not be influence by the treasury at all be influence by want to do the right thing in term of both tackle economic crime and make sure that we do not put undue burden on business can assure he that for as long as be in this role we will keep this under review and make sure that the threshold be fit for purpose my hon friend talk about good business but it be good business to make sure that we do not put undue burden on business can promise he that from my experience while be chief executive of my company we implement the rule on bribery and tax evasion which be significant in our business these would be significant measure for business say to he and to my right hon and learn friend the member for south swindon sir robert buckland that they will have real impact on business and significant cost of implementation do not think that they would be proportionate or need within small enterprise because of the ease of identify the people responsible if fraud be facilitate in an organisation appreciate the kind word of my right hon and learn friend and the work that he have do remember lobby he on this issue when he be the secretary of state for justice and fine job he do we have get much far this time than we do at that time which show our collegiate way of work all the way through the bill passage the hon member for glasgow central alison thewliss have also do fantastic work in this area and appreciate all her effort she say that we do not agree we have right to disagree where we disagree and we honestly disagree about whether this proposal be require we do not want to put unnecessary burden on business completely understand the strength of feeling of the right hon member for barking dame margaret hodge on this matter too feel strongly about implement the right measure to tackle economic crime while not put undue burden on business so say to she again in the spirit of good will that we have operate under for many year we will keep this under review if the threshold need to be change we can do that under secondary legislation congratulate the right hon member for birmingham hodge hill liam byrne on his election as chair of the business and trade committee know that he will do fine job he be right that in that spirit of good will we have achieve much in the manifesto that we launch just over the road again hope that he do not doubt my motif in what we be do to tackle economic crime without put undue burden on business urge everyone to support the measure that we have in place already and ask those in the other place to respect the clear will of this house question

former aide say which contain very extensive one sided attack on the hon member for wellingborough this be not in any way to judge the right and wrong of this matter but merely to put the principle of

proceeding on consideration of lords amendments shall so far as not previously conclude be bring to conclusion one hour after their commencement subsequent stage any further message from the lords may be consider forthwith without any question be put the proceeding on any further message from the lords shall so far as not previously conclude be bring to conclusion one hour after their marson question agree to non domestic rating bill consideration of lords amendment must draw the house attention to the fact that financial privilege be engage by lords amendment if lords amendment be agree to will cause the customary entry waive commons financial privilege to be enter into the journal clause requirements for ratepayer etc to provide information beg to move that this house agree with lords amendment with this it will be convenient to discuss lords amendment and it be pleasure to return this bill to this place after its positive reception both here initially and in the other place more recently reform business rate be manifesto commitment and have conclude our review of rate the bill seek to deliver fair and more effective business rate system the amendment that the government invite the house to support today be minor and do not change the policy intention of the bill which we have debate before in this place two amendment deal with the penalty regime for the new duty on ratepayer in clause they be design to ensure that the penalty system be fair and the third be minor and technical amendment that remove some obsolete wording as result of another part of the bill will deal with each amendment briefly lord amendment concern the civil penalty that the valuation office agency can apply if ratepayer do not provide information under the duty these include an additional daily penalty of which may only be apply if ratepayer persistently fail to meet their obligation follow an initial penalty notice the government have listen to the view of the expert in the other place and agree to create an additional safeguard for ratepayer by cap the financial value of penalty that can be impose under this provision daily penalty will be cap at equivalent to day worth of penalty this change will also bring the valuation duty in line with the separate duty to provide his majesty revenue and customs with taxpayer reference number for which cap on penalty be already in place lord amendment concern the penalty for the criminal offence of knowingly or recklessly make false statement an offence that be subject to high penalty than simply fail to comply the bill prescribe that for high penalty to be apply the voa must be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the ratepayer have make the false statement knowingly or recklessly have reflect we have recognise that we need to apply the same burden of proof to the procedure on appeal the amendment therefore provide that the valuation tribunal must remit penalty unless it be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the ratepayer have knowingly or recklessly make false statement this provide additional protection for ratepayer finally lords amendment be minor and technical change to the local government finance act as consequential effect of the provision in the bill concern business rate multiplier this be simply draft correction to improve the clarity of the statute book and the government do not foresee any practical effect the government invite the house to agree to three minor amendment that be unanimously support in the other place lord amendment and refine and improve the compliance framework for the new information duty and lords amendment be minor consequential change to improve the clarity of the statute book commend they to the house call the opposition front bencher be pleased to respond to these three lords amendment on behalf of the opposition clause of the bill introduce new duty on ratepayer to provide information to the valuation office agency in order to support digitisation and short revaluation cycle it also introduce penalty to promote compliance and establish an associate appeal system through the bill ratepayer will initially face penalty for fail to comply with the new duty the bill introduce if have receive that initial penalty the ratepayer continue not to comply for further day they will be liable for an additional penalty of per day as we hear from the minister lords amendment cap the total charge arise from that additional penalty at equivalent to day worth of daily fine as my hon friend the member for luton north sarah owen say on second reading we be aware of concern relate to the new duty and the associate penalty from those represent shop and small shop in particular although doubt that all the concern of those representative organisation and their member have be address by the government we realise that this limit on the level of the penalty may help to protect ratepayer from much large charge while still support the valuation office agency move toward frequent revaluation which we support on that basis we will not be oppose its inclusion in the bill through clause the bill also introduce new criminal penalty which apply if person make false statement while purport to comply with the new duty it introduce the bill set out that the valuation office agency will decide whether an offence have be commit and its decision may be appeal to the valuation tribunal for england as originally draft the bill permit the tribunal to remit such penalty when it be not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the person have knowingly or recklessly make false statement lord amendment would require rather than merely permit the tribunal to remit the penalty in such circumstance we believe that the amendment be sensible so we will not be oppose its inclusion in the bill finally lords amendment make technical change to the local government finance act omit section of that act that section which refer to ministers make separate estimate of rateable value for england and wales have become obsolete as result of clause of the bill which make separate provision about the calculation of multiplier for england as this be essentially draft amendment we will not be oppose it either be tempt to talk at much great length about labour plan to scrap the current system of business rate replace it with system of business property tax that rebalance the burden of business property taxation away from the high street and retail firm towards online tech giant however realise that that may be out of scope and that time be tight so will simply confirm our intention not to oppose any of these three amendment this bill unlike the levelling up and regeneration bill on which we consider further round of lords amendment yesterday have progress through parliament quickly second reading in this place take place on april and the bill will complete its passage today or tomorrow it be conservative manifesto commitment to carry out fundamental review of the business rate system this bill be the start of that process but it do not mark its completion and on its own it can not be describe as fundamental the amendment before we be straightforward lord amendment be draft correction to omit requirement relate to wales that be now obsolete lord amendment and relate to the new duty to notify they cap the level of and increase the burden of proof require for penalty that will be apply for not comply with the obligation to give require information to the valuation office agency they be to be welcome but as highlight on report this burden should have be much reduce and there should be reciprocal penalty on the voa as have mention this bill must mark the beginning of the reform of business rate not the completion of the task business rate remain heavy and uncertain burden on many business they act as brake on growth disincentivise capital investment and be barrier to level up reform must be more radical and must be carry out much more quickly urge the government to strive towards achieve the follow goal first the uniform business rate multiplier must be reduce to an affordable level the ubr currently sit at in the pound at such high level it deter investment and ultimately reduce the tax base it should be reduce to the order of the level at which it be first introduce in lower the ubr would have the long term effect of expand the tax base failure to do this will ultimately see the government increase the ubr on an ever shrink tax base and in do so threaten vital source of local government revenue secondly as important as they be to so many business we ultimately need to remove the myriad stick plaster relief that be invariably lobby for and announce at every spring budget and autumn statement they be an implicit admission that the ubr be too high the government have be force to offer many of these relief as many business be unable to pay ubr of by remove these relief and reduce the ubr the government would simplify the system and reduce the administrative burden on both ratepayer and the voa instead of the annual cliff edge as business lobby for and then nervously wait for relief to be extend such reform would introduce an element of long term certainty which would encourage investment finally while the government have take welcome step in the right direction by move to three year revaluation they must keep go towards the ultimate goal of annual valuation shorter valuation be necessary to ensure that business rate respond to the dynamic and increasingly volatile movement of the market it be vital that rateable value be assess as frequently as possible to ensure that ratepayer be pay fair amount my last point be to express regret at the curtailment in the definition of material change of circumstance this be provision that give ratepayer recourse to pursue relief on their business rate bill when circumstance outside their control hinder their ability to run their business despite the government protestation the bill in effect disapplie many common situation of material change that up to now have be acknowledge as such and be even describe in the voa own guidance in conclusion this be the start of the reform of business rate but it be not the finish there be some way to go before we reach that magnus magnusson moment thank my hon friend the minister for listen to my concern during the passage of this bill and be grateful to he for meet last month to discuss the situation have subsequently write to my hon friend the financial secretary to the treasury set out some idea as to how this reform process can be continue would be grateful if he and she commit to complete the task of the fundamental review of business rate that be so vital for business large and small all around the uk will not seek to detain the house for any more than few second express my gratitude to the shadow minister the hon member for ealing north james murray for his constructive comment and his willingness to support the amendment as well as for resist the temptation to go over again some of the thing we have talk about in previous iteration of this bill also thank my hon friend the member for waveney peter aldous who have be involve since the beginning he have do the house significant service in both review the bill and offer his comment during its passage as he say this be significant change and one that think everybody accept be big leap forward particularly on the revaluation frequency move from five to three year while we be on the subject of late game show although in his view we have not yet finish this matter accept that we never finish we be grateful for his mastermind quality

anum qaisar rise beg the hon member pardon chris stephens thank you very much mr deputy speaker forgive you for that after your excellent address to the all party parliamentary group on cyprus last night it be an excellent event rise to speak to the amendment in my name and that of my hon friend the member for airdrie and shotts ms qaisar indicate now that will be look to divide the house on amendment to which will confine most of my remark however many in this house be deeply disappointed at what the government be do in proceed with this bill as the hon member for oxford west and abingdon layla moran say on monday now be not the time official report october vol let say at the outset that we all condemn the killing of innocent civilian we do condemn hamas and their act of terror on october and hamas must release all hostage we must equally recognise that there be humanitarian crisis in gaza and it be legitimate to question the action of the israeli government it be perfectly legitimate to call for ceasefire to address that crisis and let humanitarian aid flow in to save the life of innocent palestinian people there be vastly more people around these island who be perplex by the government play party political game when the middle east be in crisis and the rest of the world fear the start of an even broad conflict this be not the time to seek electoral advantage through trip up political opponent during semantic exchange exploit small difference in language to pretend there be vast gulf between position or sell that to the electorate as one party good all other party bad commend the hon gentleman on the way he be make his comment do he agree that it be positively dangerous to do what this government be do when we see the huge rise in antisemitism and islamophobia just now our community need we in parliament to be show lead and to be unite on this and not to do something that be so divisive and so deliberately provocative and deeply damaging to the unity of our community thank the hon member for that intervention and hope that those on the government benches listen to she many of we have that real fear this be not the occasion to push forward this legislation polarisation be game that have long be play by the government but this be not game this be real life or the loss of it and such cynicism have no place here in israel and palestine we have two people who feel that they be under existential threat from the other almost everyone understand that and we have all be try to find solution that will bring peace to that region ringfence the interest of one group by diminish the right of the other can never yield long term solution to the entrenched problem in the middle east it simply exacerbate the tension between the two the very real fear which the hon member have just express be that it force people into one camp or the other it feed hatred and it fuel the evil that be antisemitism it be not too late to withdraw the bill if the government be determined to proceed with it hope they listen to the advice from both side of the house in particular from government back benchers and amend the clause that will otherwise far inflame the division that the government claim they be try to heal as with most conflict verbal and military there tend to be collateral damage that have either not be fully anticipate or where the perpetrator simply do not care about the consequence in their assumed aim of defend the right of israel the government be attack the right of many sector of our own society range from the legislative and judicial right of the devolve parliaments to the democratic right of elect local authority and cut swathe through the individual human right of all people across these island in its long title the bill be describe as bill to make provision to prevent public body from be influence by political or moral disapproval of foreign state when take certain economic decision it would appear that public body be not fit to make political or moral judgment and as we will see later individual be not fit to make such judgment either as say in an early debate the electorate will not miss the irony of tory government present themselves as the sole moral arbiter for the whole of these island the pretext for introduce this legislation be an assumed need to respond robustly to the boycott divestment and sanction movement or bds which advocate complete boycott of israel and israeli people and which suggest that the state of israel do not even have the right to exist the government ignore the fact that in line with other government in europe and the eu itself the scottish government and the snp unequivocally condemn and distance themselves from member or affiliate within the bds movement rather than wish the state of israel to cease to exist most democratic country be strong supporter of two state solution with the government reassert that position to the house early this year and president biden reaffirming support only last week we as house be generally unite in support two state solution and to imply otherwise be red herring and dangerous distraction to mature debate more than israeli non governmental organisation have call for this bill to be reject as have the union of jewish students and yachad with the latter say that we be unequivocal about the need to protect the right to express difference of opinion even if they be opinion that we fiercely disagree with let we listen to they on the broad issue of human right at home let we listen to some other organisation amnesty international assert that the bill would make it almost impossible for public body to use their procurement and investment policy to incentivise ethical business conduct that be human right compliant but we know that already amnesty go on to say company depend on public contract will feel more confident that their global impact on human right and the environment will be irrelevant to their success in tendering process see this bill as clear incitement to such company to lessen their commitment to human right and the environment as they will no long need they to gain public contract company that respect human right face be undercut by those that knowingly breach international standard with little fear of consequence what horrible race to the bottom there be niggle problem here for the government regard human right there be global consensus on the human right standard applicable to company the united nations guide principle on business and human right be unanimously endorse by the un human rights council the european union the organisation for economic co operation and development and the international standards organisation the uk be the first country to develop national action plan to implement those guide principle and now we appear to be the first country to renege on those commitment the uk be in danger of be rogue state in this field go against the tide of international opinion which consider that public body should use procurement and investment policy to incentivise business to be ethical and human right compliant would argue that be in the public interest let we consider an example from amnesty whereby an nhs body might choose to avoid source medical equipment from certain supplier such as malaysia thailand pakistan or mexico say that they have be implicate in modern slavery those overseas supply company could take legal action under this legislation on the ground that the decision maker be influence by political or moral disapproval of foreign state conduct and the court would then have to determine whether the exemption in the bill for labour relate misconduct apply in that particular case let we imagine that public body in scotland decide to stop source beef from brazilian meat distribution company whose product have be link to deforestation of the amazon if the propose law have be in place during the previous brazil presidency when exploitation of the amazon be be actively encourage the brazilian government or the company whose product be be exclude could have challenge the decision in the high court on the ground that it be influence by political or moral disapproval of foreign state conduct since it be unclear whether the environmental misconduct exemption refer to in part of the schedule to the bill would prevail the risk attach would have be likely to deter any public body from take such decision on environmental ground they would have be compel to be complicit in deforestation liberty and other group have point out that the bill give the enforcement authority the power to issue notice to public authority request an assessment of whether there have or may be breach of the ban or the prohibition on make statement the bill give the enforcement authority the power to impose compliance notice where they consider person be likely to contravene the ban not have contravene but be likely to contravene we be in the realm of orwell think police or philip dick the minority report with precog catch criminal before they have even commit the crime the normal police come for someone if they commit criminal act but the thought police be different they act if someone intend to act in some particular way under the bill the authority do not need to demonstrate any proof of intent to publish particular kind of statement that be impossible to do in the normal world so let we just rely on telepathy for find out someone intent clause of the bill would prohibit public body and their leader such as university vice chancellor local council leader or even the chief executive of private company deliver public service from publish public statement indicate that they intend to act in way that would contravene the ban or that they would in theory intend to act that way if not for the ban local council could no long publish statement such as our local council would have boycott these good from this state own enterprise due to the state conduct in relation to this territory but the law do not permit this and we intend to comply with the law never expect to say these word as someone who subscribe to socialist theory but we must remove clause say that just on this occasion notice that an amendment to that effect have be table liberty have also point out that in other jurisdiction anti boycott law have have severe impact on freedom of expression in one case in the us speech pathologist in texas lose her school contract because she decline to sign an agreement promise not to boycott israel on the basis of similar anti boycott law in another dermatologist be withhold payment for lecture for fail to agree not to boycott israel us campaigner have far warn that anti boycott legislation once enact be liable to be extend to plethora of issue from fossil fuel to gun control fear we be look at another damaging cultural import from the united states of america follow the early scottish example let we look more broadly at the consequence of the bill for scotland and the uk other devolve government be hold in glasgow and there have now be watering down of the government climate commitment but scotland remain committed to combat climate change in fact the government of scotland northern ireland and wales be all attempt to use the leverage of public procurement to incentivise company to behave sustainably with regard to human right fairness labour right and the environment those policy will clearly be undermine by the bill despite investment and procurement be devolve to all three parliaments have hear the secretary of state say several time that the conservatives be in favour of devolution so should they not be require to seek consent from the governments of scotland wales and northern ireland before they proceed my hon friend be correct that they should suspect they will not receive it from either the scottish parliament or the welsh senedd for many reason as he say there be clearly an impact on devolution devolution be approve overwhelmingly by the people of scotland and any erosion of it be strongly oppose by most but not all party in that parliament will let member guess which party be least protective of scotland interest scotland current legislative power be guard jealously and there be strong demand for many possibly all reserve power to be transfer to scottish control that be not surprising and other will continue to explore the bill deficiency again today point out its many contradiction compliment the hon gentleman on his excellent speech he have give very good democratic social and moral reason for why the bill be in deep defect do he not think well process would be for the secretary of state now to withdraw the bill altogether that would be very helpful indeed the right hon gentleman be right those of we who have table amendment be try to clean up dog breakfast which be very difficult we be all try to make the bill little well but as my good friend say the ultimate solution would be to withdraw it entirely have highlight the bill contradiction counter productiveness and profound consequence and will be seek to divide the house on amendment look forward to hear other member pursue their amendment would like to speak against all the amendment and new clause before we today and in support of the bill as currently draft we need this bill thank the government for include it in the conservative manifesto and take it forward and urge the whole house to back the bill and reject the amendment this of all time be time to stand with the jewish community follow the bad attack on jewish people since the holocaust bds have be identify in succession of study as drive rise in antisemitism by single out the world only jewish state for criticism above and beyond that direct at any other country in similar circumstance believe bds campaign fall within the international holocaust remembrance alliance definition of antisemitism the french supreme court have rule that bds be discriminatory and the german parliament view the movement as antisemitic since the shocking hamas terror attack we have witness deeply disturbing scene on our tv screen and in our street these include sicken so call celebration of the horrific murder in southern israel and the anti jewish racism and hatred visible at successive protest on the street of our capital city at time like this when jewish people be in fear for their friend and relative in israel it be appal to compound their anxiety and distress with hate fill banner and chant at such protest find it deeply depress that jihad jihad have be shout with impunity on the street of our city and that isis flag have be on blatant display the dramatic rise in antisemitic incident be wholly unacceptable and it show we that we need campaign to bring community together not drive they apart there can be no doubt that bds be absolutely focused on division not unity the bds movement deplore co existence and peacebuilde initiative for example it have condemn co operation between israeli and palestinian university the movement founder omar barghouti have repeatedly express his opposition to israel right to exist as we go into the vote lobbies this evening we be in situation where the question to be ask of all of we be which side be you on make it clear that strongly support the right of israel to defend its land and its citizen from terrorist attack of course we all worry about the plight of innocent gazans put in harm way by hamas who brutalise they and deliberately use they as human shield of course we need to get supply to civilian so long as there be confidence that they can not be divert or misuse by terrorist we must always remember that it be hamas who have endanger the people of gaza hamas be the people who have cause the humanitarian crisis in gaza be in no doubt that the israeli defence forces be make and will continue to make the great effort possible to prevent civilian loss of life israel be one of the most democratic country in the world and it respect the rule of law be certain that its democratic and legal institution will hold its armed force rigorously to account those on the labour benches who line up to casually and wrongly accuse israel of war crime should check their fact not rush to judgment we need our local authority to concentrate on deliver service not on conduct their own trade and foreign policy we need campaign that promote peaceful progress towards two state solution not bitterness and exclusion we need to take all possible action against the antisemitism that we have see increase so shockingly in recent day we need this bill call the shadow secretary of state follow the right hon member for chipping barnet theresa villiers let say this when thing be so delicate we all have responsibility to take additional care in the language we use and to operate on the basis of fact alone official report october vol those be the word of the prime minister in his statement to the house on monday he also say that this be not time for hyperbole and simplistic solution he be absolutely right about the importance of tone in today debate as we discuss the october attack and event in the middle east what we say and how we behave in this chamber really matter because it echo out across the country it go without say that the disgusting rise in antisemitism and islamophobia since the attack on october only make that point more profound fear that the prime minister powerful statement at the dispatch box early this week have be undermine by how he and his ministers have bring this bill before we today at the last minute and with the least possible notice the tension and disagreement surround the issue be well known to the secretary of state yet in the middle of humanitarian emergency in the middle east he have choose this week of all week to force this legislation on to the parliamentary timetable bill that fail the prime minister own test of avoid simplistic solution there can be no doubt that labour be oppose to policy of adopt boycott divestment and sanction against israel as it wrongly single out one individual nation and be counterproductive to the prospect of peace we know this be serious issue the right hon lady say with some force at the dispatch box that labour be clearly oppose to single out israel through bds measure yet where labour be in government in the uk wales the welsh labour government seek to bring forward procurement note that single out israel and the palestinian territory can she explain what her position be when her colleague in wales seek to do that thank the right hon member for his intervention we be hop to get consensus around what we be try to do stand by my statement but we do not want one nation to be single out in this boycott we do not agree with boycott tactic which be why we be concerned enough to table our amendment to the procurement bill back in february when shadow the cabinet office which would have prevent council from single out israel or any other country the government have consistently oppose that amendment today we be present with bill that will not address the problem it rightly seek to solve as it stand the bill have needlessly broad and sweeping draconian power and far reach effect it be poorly draft legislation that risk create fresh legal dispute and will only serve as new flashpoint for community tension we remain far from convinced that protract legal battle over the bds would serve or protect jewish community in the uk my hon friend the member for wigan lisa nandy clearly spell out those issue on second reading as do my hon friend the members for nottingham north alex norris and for caerphilly wayne david in committee today be the fourth time that we have present the government with chance to change course and choose more constructive way forward yet the bill have be bring back nearly totally unamended the only change be to the explanatory note it be all too clear that the secretary of state have not listen however there be way forward in our view it be not wrong for public body to take ethical investment and procurement decision there be difference between apply consistent ethical principle in legitimate criticism of foreign government and what in recent year some individual and organisation have try to do seek to target israel alone hold it to different standard from other country question its right to exist and equate the action of the israeli government to jewish people and in do so create hate and hostility against jewish people here in the uk that be completely wrong amendment on which we will seek vote today address that problem it would allow public body to produce document set out their policy on procurement and human right the policy would be cement in framework base on principle that apply equally to all country rather than single out individual nation such statement of ethical policy would ensure consistency in how public body decide on these matter and would be subject to guidance issue by elect ministers and lay before this house any inconsistent application would be prohibit under labour proposal if public body be to act only against particular state for instance the world only jewish state and fail to comply consistent approach to human right everywhere such action would be unlawful we be disappoint that the government choose not to support our amendment at previous stage but repeat today our offer to the government indeed the whole house to work together and speak with one voice on this most serious of issue by accept the amendment move on there be four more concern area in the bill that wish to raise briefly with the secretary of state first we have serious reservation about how the bill effectively rewrite uk foreign policy by explicitly equate israel with the occupied palestinian territories and the golan heights that be an unprecedented step that to my knowledge have never be take in british statute and be unique in british legislation an essential cornerstone of british policy support across this house and at the un be support for two state solution as viable long term solution to give israelis and palestinians the recognition and security that they deserve the wording of the bill not only call into question the uk long stand position in support two state solution but run counter to the un resolution such move would also go against the very aim of the bill by single out israel in such an exceptional manner fail to treat it like any other country or nation secondly and relate the secretary of state claim that the bill be non country specific and of general application but the only state and territory name in the bill be israel the occupied palestinian territories and the golan heights quite apart from single out israel the bill apply as much to china myanmar and north korea as it do to israel for example it could have significant effect on the ability of community to support the uyghur minority in china who be victim of grave human right abuse as my right hon friend know be former local authority leader in trafford be incredibly proud that when be the leader of trafford council my labour administration take step to cease procurement link to the xinjiang region because of the oppression and suppression of uyghur muslims be correct to interpret the bill as seem to suggest that my labour administration and be incorrect to do that and that other up and down the country who speak up for human right and against that sort behaviour be in the wrong my hon friend make very important point which be why we be try to gain consensus across the house through our amendment it be important that people should be able to raise concern appropriately and in the good way the bill do not allow that even the foreign secretary office warn no about the impact of the bill on our foreign commitment for that reason we welcome amendment in the name of the right hon member for north west hampshire kit malthouse which have support across the house include from member from the liberal democrat and snp benches we think it will go some way to address the problem thirdly want to re emphasise the concern raise by member from all major party about clause the so call gag clause acknowledge the change make to the explanatory note in this area but this unprecedented restriction could have far reach consequence for our democracy and urge the secretary of state to think again have table amendment which would address the issue of elect body it be mark of the concern across the house that there be so many amendment to the clause include from member from the government and the snp benches the seriousness of the clause must not be underestimate it be an unprecedented restriction on the ability of the public body many of they directly elect to express view on policy effectively gag they from even talk about it we be concerned that clause would be incompatible with article of the european convention on human right which protect freedom of expression labour amendment seek to remove the most sweeping provision in the bill through which the secretary of state intend to hand himself unprecedented power to change the scope and application of the bill through regulation lastly it be important to note that the bill in its current form will not set out what it seek to achieve there be loophole that will allow discriminatory act to continue unchallenged our new clause present just one example and be sure that there be many more the new clause require the government to review the impact of the bill on discrimination and address one form of it that have be raise with refusal to provide kosher food we on the labour benches know that that impact on many british jews across this country cause much distress and suffering that be the type of concern practice that should be tackle but the bill in its current form will not address it urge the secretary of state to take pause take step back and consider that there might be another way through assure the secretary of state that labour feel strongly that bds practice against israel offer no meaningful route to peace for the people of either palestine or of israel as my hon friend the member for wigan say on second reading we on the labour benches do not claim that all those who support bds despite our profound disagreement with they on that issue be antisemitic official report july vol but let we be clear the effect of bds would be the total economic social and cultural isolation of the world only jewish state and there be those who use the campaign to whip up hostility towards jewish people provide no route to peace and two state solution can assure the secretary of state that labour will continue to condemn and oppose that in the strong term do not believe there be genuine disagreement between we on that point but let be totally clear too both as shadow minister and as deputy leader of the labour party now more than ever we expect council to bring all their community together and represent all their citizen it would be utterly wrong to choose one community over another or bad pit one against another agree with the right hon lady that we must be moderate in our tone and the language we use do she agree it be therefore very unhelpful for the scottish labour leader to use term accuse israel of breach international law when we be discuss such sensitive subject as say at the start of the debate people have to be responsible and in fairness acknowledge that the prime minister at the start of this week also outline that people have to be responsible say that across the whole house and genuinely mean it we all have to be responsible know people feel very strongly at the moment about these issue and rightly so and hope the hon gentleman see from my contribution to this debate that be take that very seriously as well we rightly expect that our local government must surely stay by the principle mention but we must also make sure that our national government do too that be real leadership of our community and of our whole country instead fear we have government unwilling to recognise what be need from they at this moment on this bill careful precise deliberation and to bring community and the country with we be disappointed that the secretary of state have take the reckless path of force the bill back to parliament today bill that fail on its own term his approach risk divide our country our community and even his party urge he now not to divide the house and to accept the amendment propose by member on the opposition side and his own for our part labour stand ready as we have at every single stage of the bill to work constructively with the government and other party to build consensus behind workable sensible solution there be no doubt that the people of our country want we to speak with one voice labour stand ready and willing to work in good faith to achieve that goal the question be be the government the prime minister be absolutely right early this week to say that the tone we adopt be incredibly important give the gravity of the event we be see in the middle east at the moment every single member of this house be obviously absolutely horrify by the tragedy that be unfold and the barbaric atrocity commit by hamas in my case absolutely support the right of israel to self defence but it be possible to believe all these thing to be friend of israel too but nevertheless to be reluctant to pass bad legislation through this house unamende when we have the opportunity to make amendment on report it be possible too to believe strongly that freedom of contract and freedom of speech be important pillar in our liberal democracy and that although we might sometimes fetter those key pillar of freedom and our liberal democracy we should not do so lightly for that reason would support amendment and in the name of my right hon friend the member for north west hampshire kit malthouse because put the occupy territory and israel into the bill be unusual for bill of this sort we must ask this question if the purpose be to make it difficult for future government to take position that would change the approach to our close ally why be the united states not also list many of the group that people object to such as bds be often quite anti american as well so why do we not have full list of country to make it difficult for they to add more importantly this send an unfortunate signal around british foreign policy it have be the long stand position of all british government that we support two state solution and that the israeli settlement in the occupied territory be illegal that be consistent british government position over long period of time and we must be careful not to send signal that that have change more importantly would also support amendment because clause be strong violation of freedom of speech it have come to something when we be say that not only would people not be free to follow the procurement policy they want but they would not even be allow to say that the reason why they be not free to do so be this bill will support amendment or if either go to vote this evening however want to focus principally on the two amendment in my name amendment and although much of the debate around the bill be understandably conduct through the context of bds and of israel and the palestinian situation the scope of clause be very broad what be before we this evening be broad procurement bill that place quite broad restriction on procurement and apply to every country in the world presume the reason be that the government legal advice be that to have something that focus just on one country israel or on just one campaign group bds would create some legal issue so they then have to construct bill that affect every organisation every issue and every country and then through the schedule try to piece back some of the liberty affect by the imposition of clause want to focus on that schedule because it list lot of different issue that be outside the scope of clause and rightly so include environmental misconduct but there be no mention of animal welfare there will be time when public body will take procurement decision base on animal welfare they need to be free to do that and it be not at all clear from the schedule that that could be do paragraph mention environmental misconduct and at the end talk about the life and health of plant and animal but it do so very much in the context of the environment and the wild environment rather than through the context of keep animal the government buying standard be recently revise to encourage all public body and all government departments to take account of animal welfare in their procurement policy but the bill would appear to curtail the right of local authority to do just that legitimate issue will come into play here these be probe amendment on which be look for reassurance from the minister and an undertaking to consider these matter far in the other place for instance be local authority to judge that it would prefer to procure lamb from new zealand over say australia because new zealand have high animal welfare standard while the australian sheep industry have poor level of animal welfare and do not have in place the right regulatory power to deal with certain practice that would be legitimate consideration indeed it be not only legitimate but consideration that the government own buying standard and the crown commercial service encourage all public body to pursue in closing my question which be very much link to my two amendment be this be the minister understanding that it would be entirely in order under the bill for any local authority or public body to make decision base on animal welfare and that any such decision relate to animal welfare would be totally outside the scope of clause this be dreadful piece of legislation when we debate it on second reading and it return to we on report in an equally dreadful state in july on second reading say that the bill be be introduce at the wrong time give the violence and unrest take place in the region never in my bad nightmare do think that we would experience the brutal inhumane and indiscriminate massacre that be unleash on innocent israeli civilian on october and the subsequent humanitarian catastrophe that we be now witness in gaza to bring this wrong headed poorly draft and politically motivated bill back to the house in the midst of these horror horror that we be see every hour of the day and every hour of the night on our television screen and on social medium be an act of complete irresponsibility and unbelievable foolishness speak as proud jew speak as strong supporter of israel committed zionist and speak as someone who oppose the bds movement and believe that its intent be to try to destroy the state of israel but do not speak on my own know that speak in the name of thousand of jews in britain who be not always represent in this house particularly by some jewish members in the house and for million of jews in israel simply ask the minister and the secretary of state who be now in his place to please withdraw this nasty bill and come back in the autumn with properly consider proposal that can be accept by we all this be an emotional time to we all it be for but urge ministers we should all be work together at this time every mp in this house should be work to calm thing down in the middle east to contain conflict to secure the release of hostage and to stop the humanitarian catastrophe we be see in gaza we should not be seek to divide member now put it to ministers that the bill contain proposal that will only heighten tension between community work by the community security trust show we that there have be increase in antisemitic attack from to october my own family and my own grandchild have be subject to such attack and know what difficulty this bring to many many family in this country the bill will only deepen the hostility it will not help our community it will only strengthen the polarisation that be already so evident we see it in our school in our university and in our workplace the bill will not help israel as it seek to defend itself against an existential threat it will simply become just one more thing to enrage those people who oppose the state of israel it will not help jews at all as we struggle to come to term with the pogrom that take place in the kibbutzim and the music festival some two week ago it will not help we as we all struggle to find route to peace that allow israel to defend itself without inflict intolerable hardship on palestinians who have also become the victim of hamas terrorist activity plead with the government to withdraw this legislation and to help we to work together appreciate the remark that the right hon lady be make she speak with some authority because of her background but fail to see the logic of her point that bill that prevent local authority deliberately highlight their opposition to the existence of the state of israel and boycott good from it be likely to lead to bad community relation surely stop local authority act in such partisan way will help to establish well community relation beg to differ with what the right hon gentleman say because the bill in itself be so contentious that it will not actually stop activity but encourage those who want to argue against the state of israel and want to argue against what be currently happen in the israeli palestinian war it will give they add strength so simply disagree with he at time like this the bad thing we can do be introduce contentious legislation respect the right hon lady for her view but just on that last point the idea that we should not do something because the people who hate israel will be even angry about it do not seem to to be very credible argument these people be out in front of the embassy in the immediate aftermath of the attack demand boycott of israel before israel even have time to respond be it really credible argument that we should not do this because it might make the people who hate israel even angry hope that as develop my argument the hon member will listen because it be the flaw in the bill that think actually damage its intention which be to limit and deal with the evil of the bds movement say little early that oppose the bds movement recognise that the bds movement probably have the intention of try to destroy the state of israel want to tackle that but think that do so in the way that be propose in this legislation will simply damage that intent not meet it think maybe that be where he and differ the bill be flawed in so many way the main reason be that it be not design to tackle problem it be design to score crude party political point as say on second reading be afraid that the secretary of state himself give the game away on that occasion when he say the question for every member of this house be whether they stand with we against antisemitism or not official report july vol respectfully say to he that that be not the question but it do lay bare the truth about the bill the government believe that they have set trap for the opposition if we speak against the bill they will try to paint we as antisemite but say to the government that if they pass the bill in its current form it be they who will be encourage antisemitism by fuel hatred they will be encourage antisemitism by specify on the face of the bill only one country where the boycott of good would be illegal simply confirm in people mind that israel and the israel palestine conflict be special case different from all the other case around that be constant problem constant issue that be raise with by people who be worried and concerned over time not particularly in relation to the war as it stand about attitude in the uk to the israeli palestinian conflict everybody say why pick on israel so why do the government now select israel it be they who be encourage antisemitism by gag free speech in our university and council chamber it be they who be encourage antisemitism by trample on the democratic right of local politician it be an incredible arrogance for we as mps to sit here and think that somehow we be well than or different from locally elect councillor who also have political view and who also carry out important democratic job in their council it be the government who be encourage antisemitism by ignore our obligation under the un security council it be they who be encourage antisemitism and say this on the basis of my experience of fight the british national party in barking from until the general election in by refuse to engage in an open debate by close the debate they give add credibility to the idea that those who seek to destroy the state of israel be somehow wrong as the right hon lady know have huge amount of respect for she and she speak on these issue with an authority with which many of we can not speak about they she know well than anyone that tide of vile antisemitism have be unleash in the country last week some of we hear from jewish student who be afraid to give their surname because they be afraid of give away their jewish identity afraid to admit that they be jewish one say that they feel as if jews be be push out of british university if july be not good time to introduce legislation to draw line in the sand and if now be an even bad time when be good time to make stand on behalf of jewish people who be at risk at this time let start by say that the growth of antisemitism on the street and in our community be absolutely terrible it be affect some of the young people in my own family and it be dreadful to observe the impact that it have on young child so be completely with the right hon gentleman on that my point be that the legislation be so flawed that it do not meet its intent would love to work with ministers and with member across the house to produce piece of legislation that would tackle the issue that we know exist in relation to bds but would do so in way that be not contentious it do not have to be like this we could do it in another way and do that as soon possible would be really good thing to do surely this be the point that my right hon friend be make surely the answer to the question ask by the right hon member for preseli pembrokeshire stephen crabb be that good time would be time when those of good will have have sufficient opportunity to engage in the necessary discussion to find consensus that would lead to an acceptable and sensible piece of legislation my hon friend make very valid point and be grateful to he for his intervention do feel really emotional about today it be think an emotional day for many of we in the chamber let just say this to the secretary of state he be try to put forward legislation in the name of the jewish community but he be not do so in my name or in the name of literally thousand of people talk to here in the uk who be all good jews proud of their jewish identity also know from my conversation with family friend and colleague in israel that there be many there who also think that this be poor piece of legislation plead with the secretary of state please please to withdraw the bill which think would be more damaging than helpful and to engage in the sort of debate that have be suggest by my hon friend the member for birmingham selly oak steve mccabe which could bring we to mutually agree conclusion reach the objective that we all want rise order may provide little guidance if member speak for maximum of about eight minute we will be able to get everyone in support this excellent bill and wish to speak against all the amendment commend my right hon friend the secretary of state for take the bill through the house support it for three principal reason first it be genuinely need secondly boycott be inherently discriminatory and contrary to public policy especially when engage in by third tier local authority and thirdly the bds movement internationally be inextricably link to antisemitism will explore those three point briefly perhaps can give the house just two example of why the bill be need the first be the example of the now bankrupt birmingham city council which threaten in not to renew contract with the french multinational company veolia due to its operation in the west bank in veolia withdraw from the israeli market as consequence and the bds movement claim that decision as victory of course that hurt palestinians as well as everyone else another example shamefully be that of the supermarket sainsbury in at least one of its branch it be put under so much pressure that it remove kosher food product from its shelf follow virulent anti israel protest so this be about protect community and avoid antisemitism succeed the bill will prevent divisive behaviour that undermine community cohesion across the country be afraid to say that bds activity have legitimise and drive antisemitism in the united kingdom as it exclusively target israel my second point be that it be inherently discriminatory to engage in boycott of this type be not alone in say that pray in aid on this point none other than the supreme court of france which rule as long ago as that call for boycott of israeli product in france constitute discrimination and be as such illegal under french law also refer member to the german parliament which designate the bds movement as antisemitic in may and again cite the harm to palestinians with the infamous example of the soft drink company sodastream which under intense pressure have to shut down its operation cause the loss of palestinian job the company simply move few mile into israel and other people get those job this be harmful to all side of the community it be worth rehearse that it be state in evidence to one of the bill committees of this house some time ago that the bds national committee an international centre point for the movement include member of the council of national and islamic forces in palestine which be coalition of hamas palestinian islamic jihad and the popular front for the liberation of palestine those be all terrorist organisation that be proscribe by his majesty government the general co ordinator of the bds national committee be mahmoud nawajaa who have publicly support hamas armed wing the al qassam brigades and the leader of the council of national and islamic forces in palestine khaled al batsh be senior official of palestinian islamic jihad proscribe terrorist organisation fund and co ordinated by iran so it be for those reason bds international link to antisemitism and its discriminatory province and how obviously the bill be need in this country as well as its principle that it must be for central government to make decision on foreign policy and not for borough and city council that with the great possible respect can not possibly appreciate all the nuance involve in these international decision endorse and agree with everything that my right hon and learn friend have be outline and the argument he be make be very powerful do he agree that right now there be obviously hugely important moral and ethical purpose to be clear about our opposition to antisemitism in any form at any time and from any organisation let alone the abhorrence of what bds stand for in the light of the terrorist atrocity that we have see this bill predate the atrocity that we see early this month and return to his core point its original purpose be the correct one which be to remind we that central government role be to deal with foreign policy and to ensure that local council be make decision that be base not on their foreign policy or any other ideological pressure or view but on the good value for local resident absolutely agree with my right hon friend who make his point eloquently israel clearly have vibrant economy and welcome everyone challenge those both outside this house and in other country who support the bds movement to bear in mind that suspect that they would not be able to function in today modern society if they be to personally boycott company that be already deeply engage in israel and do business there will give some example apple google intel microsoft alibaba amazon fujitsu aol siemens bosch sony texas instruments samsung nestlé coca cola western digital xerox mitsubishi pfizer salesforce visa mastercard honda ford have list of dozen of company that do business in the state of israel let we bear in mind that those person who seek to boycott israel do so with an air of double standard that be the very least that can be say about it support this bill and reject all of the propose amendment call jeremy corbyn have not put in to speak call john mcdonnell thank you madam deputy speaker may echo the comment of my right hon friend the member for barking dame margaret hodge if we descend into accusation that those who do not support the bill be antisemite or that those who support it be islamophobic think we be lose to be honest it be important that we be careful about our language there be profound misunderstanding about what we be debate if this be about the bds movement itself there be mechanism that the government can use to proscribe an organisation but the debate on this bill should be about bds as method tactic have support boycott disinvest and sanction whole range of regime campaign with and support the anti apartheid movement of bds with regard to south africa actually large number of member on both side of the house support that also do so with regard to saudi arabia and its execution tragically it be still do this of member of the gay community have campaign with other across the house with regard to sri lanka and the persecution of the tamils include the murder of number of my constituent when they visit their family be do the same at the moment with regard to bahrain because of its imprisonment of the political opposition it be the same with russia be founder member year ago of the ukraine solidarity campaign and we have be call for sanction against russia for year in advance of even the government to be honest it be the same with iran chair the iranian worker movement committee which support trade unionist campaign in iran many of whom be unfortunately in prison there be also the uyghurs on all of those have urge the use of bds because when other representation and diplomacy fail there be not many option leave one of the option unfortunately be the use of arm in not promote that we have try to find middle lane and that be economic isolation to try to influence to be frank it do work in south africa that be why we have try to ensure that it be mechanism that can be draw upon agree however with my right hon friend the member for ashton under lyne angela rayner on the front bench the important thing be to ensure that if we use this mechanism it be use properly and fairly and that we do not discriminate against one particular country that be what have not do have call for bds with regard to good come from the occupy territory and iran because they be against the international order have sit in this house for year and listen to speech from conservative representative have learn bit about conservatism so what find extraordinary be that this bill be profoundly unconservative those on the government front bench seem to be reject many of the individual amendment in front of we have listen to government members argue that the conservative party stand for freedom of speech support for the law the right of property the democratic right of this parliament local government and other agency devolution of decision making and support for the action on the environment and human right let turn to the amendment on freedom of speech amendment and prevent the government introduce gagging order on even just talk about this have debate about it that be profoundly unconservative can not believe that government members be not support those amendment on the issue of right of property say to the conservative member whose constituency can not remember that we be both member of the local government pension fund the government be override the right to my property which be my pension fund can not believe that the conservatives be do that that be my store wage for over year of service in local government over which now lose control and the amendment simply say that the member of that pension fund will be allow to decide my right hon friend will recall the day when we manage to persuade the glc pension fund not to invest in apartheid south africa but as be sure he will agree the fundamental of the bill be that it actually reduce very large area of freedom of speech for elect local councillor that to undermine the whole principle of representative democracy within our society agree be chair of finance at that time it be interesting because there be an awful lot of cross party support on that as we be then at the stage of the imprisonment of nelson mandela and the bad oppression that be go on include what happen in soweto let go through the amendment themselves on devolution and local decision making all that amendment and new clause do be ensure that local democracy take place the argument that have hear from those on the conservative benches on several occasion be that local councillor should have the right to represent their local community and above all else they should listen to their local community when there have be row on the government benches it be often as result of council not have listen to their local community and sometimes have agree these amendment simply enable the local community to express their view and for that to be take into account on environmental concern amendment and be simply reinforce many of the policy that the conservative party have be advocate in our attempt to get to net zero and protect animal at the same time have often hear government member say that uphold the law be an essential part of conservatism well that be what amendment and do they be simply say that the use of this mechanism can be helpful in uphold international law this bill be bad bill agree that there might be the potential to gain consensus on it one way forward be through the amendment that the labour front bench have table to try to look at human right in general to see how statement define human right can be make by government and that then influence what happen in other decision make area such as in local government pension fund and so on believe that there be an opportunity for that but what come back to be that this be not the time to do something that in any way divide our community if the bill be in any way amendable let we just pull it the government have do that before there have be pause on legislation allow wise head to come together and to come back with something that actually might work if there be argument about the bds movement and totally condemn some of the statement that have hear from some of the leader associate with it that be separate issue this be about method of try to influence individual country to behave in line with international law protect the environment and so on it be about try to set standard in other country that we want to promote globally anyway this legislation be not something that would expect from conservative party at any stage in its life and certainly not now if the government pursue it it lead we to the conclusion that my right hon friend the member for barking reach that it be be do for grubby political purpose if that be the case we be in the gutter of politic rather than at the high level of politic that we should be debate in this country the right hon member for hayes and harlington john mcdonnell put forward clever argument but many of we see through it to the real motivation he himself say that he support part of the bds campaign the issue of timing be interesting be not sure whether we be be ask to wait until hamas give we permission to bring the bill back should we wait for their decision to end the violence so that we be then able to bring this forward people advance the same argument that they be advance today before the massacre so there will never be good time to bring the legislation forward if we follow that line the right hon member for barking dame margaret hodge and have disagree on some thing but respect she very much she have be very brave in lot of the thing that she have do in recent year but think that it be beneath she to accuse people who support the legislation of drive antisemitism that be an unfortunate slip because it be fact that the jewish leadership council and the board of deputies support the legislation she may be right that other in the jewish community do not but it be fact that leadership group within the community support the legislation why now for it be go down to see one of the march two week ago do not want to call they march for peace because they be not they be march fill with hate there be people there enjoy what happen in israel see many of they hold deeply antisemitic sign many of which call for boycott of the israeli state that say to that this be moment when we have to grasp this issue which have be poisonous part of political discourse on the middle east for so long if not now then when there will never be perfect time as say in my intervention even before the israeli government have act in any way in gaza in self defence bds campaigner be outside the israeli embassy after israelis have be murder the bad murder of jews since the holocaust what be those campaigner do they be not there express sympathy for what have just happen they be demand that people boycott the state of israel this be pernicious nasty antisemitic campaign and there be no pretend otherwise as indeed some people who oppose the bill will agree the metric be clear bds activity drive antisemitism that be fact and we be all in agreement on that on the pretence that there be lot of other country at which this be aim let we be honest only israel be the focus of bds activity that be where the action in local government and the welsh government have be it have all be about israel let we be honest for some of the people argue against the legislation it will always be about israel whatever have happen they be always here with word against israel hold israel to different standard it be the same people they just find different argument it be the same on every issue relate to the middle east they be always here some of they in this house and it be always about the behaviour of the state of israel find it really bizarre claim that because some people might react unpleasantly or potentially violently to we ban campaign that all of we who have speak so far well maybe not all of we agree be antisemitic that might inflame community tension what we be say there in effect be that the elect house of commons of the united kingdom should not act because some people might not like it and might get violent country that follow that line of argument be country that be lose we agree that this be antisemitic and it should not matter therefore whether some people who might not like our approach might react they have be react fairly unpleasantly already we have all see the march so just do not buy that argument have huge amount of affection for my hon friend and understanding of what he be say ask he to give his view on the following which relate to my concern take everything that he be say but at time when our country can play pivotal role in try to de escalate and find peaceful solution to the horror unravel in the middle east what assessment have he make of the damage that could arise from claim of partiality be level against the government for bring this bill forward at this time my hon friend say he have affection for not many people say that so welcome it and will be frame that part of hansard however will just push back on the point he make how be impartiality impact by outlaw something that all of we agree be antisemitic who sit on the palestinian bds national committee it be hamas and islamic jihad so be we say that we should not ban this antisemitic campaign because some people might not like that we can push that argument quickly back in the other direction go over my time on the last occasion so be go to stay absolutely within my time now madam deputy speaker will end with powerful quote in the jewish chronicle today from its former editor stephen pollard he say you might think that now of all time when the world have witness the bad massacre of jews since the holocaust there would be clamour rush even demand for the bds bill to be pass now of all time surely be the time to stand up and say we see where jew hate lead that be the good argument for this legislation and for why now rise thank the hon gentleman for keep within time but be now go to impose time limit of eight minute just to ensure that everybody get the chance to speak the speech we have just listen to from the hon member for brigg and goole andrew percy show exactly why this be not the right time for this bill and this debate the speech from the right hon member for hayes and harlington john mcdonnell that he criticise be perfectly reasonable one make the case for the tool of boycott sanction and divestment to suggest that those tool be intrinsically antisemitic be clearly and evidentially wrong the vast generalisation that the hon gentleman have deploy again show why this bill be deeply unhelpful and the timing downright dangerous the brutal attack on israeli civilian by hamas on october have fill every right think person with horror and underscore the urgent need to stand against violence we do that in part by defend and advocate human right these principle need to guide our response to the collective punishment of the civilian population of gaza too and to any other unlawful action be perpetrate by the israeli or palestinian authority or by hamas be struggle to understand why as one of the lead global champion of human right the uk would want to send signal that it think that human right matter only selectively that would be the impact of the current wording if the bill pass it would say to the world that some people right matter less than other people frankly the timing seem design to make political capital from horrendous situation and the government should be ashamed this be new low and it be reckless provocative and deeply damaging the government risk ignite the situation far by bring back this bill with the clause single out israel and the occupied palestinian territories this legislation in effect apply restriction on the right to freedom of expression and debate in way that risk polarise view even far at any time let alone in this most sensitive of contexts enshrine in law such partiality towards the conflict be beyond irresponsible have table three amendment to the bill two on the ability of public body to make decision about their activity on environmental ground and one to exclude fossil fuel from the bill provision first on fossil fuel there be worrying lack of clarity from the government about what it may or may not be permissible for public body to do should the bill be enact my amendment be intend to clear that up and protect the right of public authority to divest from fossil fuel early this week friend of the earth publish evidence that at least billion of local government pension fund be invest in fossil fuel the clarity that seek to provide with my amendment be need because fossil fuel be obviously not cover by the environmental misconduct exemption in respect of illegal activity because obviously extraction currently happen legally it be need because decision to div could easily be bring into the scope of clause because fossil fuel company especially in the case of state oil and gas firm could easily meet the threshold for association with foreign government majority state own or control oil or gas firm such as saudi aramco equinor petrobras and gazprom or other company that be highly associate with foreign government would obviously be consider to be affiliate with certain country which would affect decision about thing like pension fund the ability of pension scheme in particular to divest from fossil fuel under current legislation and guidance be well establish and compatible with fiduciary duty the consideration of whether to divest often include the discussion or consideration of individual state as example of why divestment be desirable campaigner will often publicly cite example of state where fossil fuel extraction be take place as reason to divest from fossil fuel asset even if the divestment seek be much broad this be reasonable and entirely responsible given the financial risk associate with thing such as carbon bubble and stranded asset let alone the climate crisis more broadly and it be currently lawful but if the legislation be pass such consideration run the risk of be judge to have be influence by the political or moral disapproval of foreign state conduct and thus bring divestment decision within the bill scope if the minister do not intend fossil fuel divestment to be cover by the bill it must be explicitly exclude not leave to run the kind of risk that have outline on environmental misconduct some sorely lack clarity need to be inject into the bill hence my two amendment the bill have an exemption that be limit to environmentally harmful behaviour that amount to an offence whether under the law of part of the united kingdom or any other country or territory much environmentally destructive activity take place entirely legally indeed that could even be the rationale for boycott or divestment campaign during the passage of the environment act the limitation of due diligence measure that target only illegal deforestation be make clear for example because significant proportion of deforestation due to soy or palm oil in brazil or indonesia respectively could take place legally or because it would be incredibly difficult to distinguish between legal and illegal deforestation my amendment would expand the environmental ground on which public body be allow to make certain economic decision beyond activity that be currently simply an offence without it the exemption be unworkable at worst and will undermine good practice at well let explain several pension expert who give evidence in committee warn that the bill will impact on environmental social and governance investment decision and cut across pension scheme fiduciary duty those expert include the northern ireland local government officers superannuation committee and the local government association it be now standard practice to consider esg factor when look at investment and there be widespread concern that the environmental misconduct exemption be so weak that it do not provide the exemption that minister claim it provide in turn this be threat to adherence with thing such as the united nations principle for responsible investment or indeed the sustainable development goal it fail to recognise that investor often consider divergence from good practice and not simply breach of law and it fail to reflect the fact that in country with for example opaque legal system the establishment of whether an offence have occur may not be straightforward there be also risk that campaign direct at persuade public body to boycott or divest on environmental ground could end up come within the scope of the legislation that could happen if for example case study be judge to constitute the criticism or disproval of foreign state or if they identify where an environmentally harmful activity such as log in the amazon be take place the government be fond of claim that they have the very good environmental credential so why would they want to scupper the potential for public body to demand high environmental standard for example in their supply chain or from their pension fund manager with poorly word reference to environmental misconduct my amendment would tackle that and provide for proper exemption my amendment would extend the definition of environmental misconduct to include damage regardless of whether it be legal or illegal as well as specie habitat and the natural world it replicate word for word the definition of natural environment in the government own environment act as such hope that it provide the consistency and clarity that be not currently afford by the current wording would be especially interested to know why ministers do not use that wording in the first place give that it be already in the act and why they be not aim for consistent definition of natural environment across different legislation to conclude my amendment be design to properly protect the exemption that ministers claim be in the bill in line with definition in other legislation rise to speak in favour of the motion and to support the bill the event on october mean that we be debate the bill in different context we be do so against the backdrop of the murder of at least jewish people and the kidnapping of hundred in israel as well as rise in antisemitic incident in the uk the bill be not on its own solution to antisemitism or the key to solve every problem in the middle east however will explain why it will not only provide much need reassurance to the jewish community here but benefit both israelis and palestinians will set out why the bds movement be harmful internationally and discriminatory towards jewish community here in the uk and why it be vital that israel be name in the bill be not jewish grow up in dudley where we do not have jewish community grow up hungry to know more about history and politic but when be young my father work for an israeli company iscar he move around job as salesman so remember his work by which country the company originate from for israel be just another one of those place where he have travel for work iscar be set up by stef wertheimer german bear jew who flee the nazis in he start small metal shop and tool make company call iscar in stef believe that capitalism be well equip than politic to solve the conflict he believe that if economic disparity be at the core of the tension between arabs and jews he might have solution in it be report that of iscar employee more than be of druze or arab origin in the eye of the bds movement that normalisation be problematic and should be boycott my right hon and learn friend the member for northampton north sir michael ellis have already mention sodastream successful israeli company that export its product across the world it have be provide job to countless israelis as well as once employ about palestinians who rely on the company for their livelihood but in it be force out of the west bank because of the bds movement lead to those palestinians lose their job that harm the very people the bds movement claim to support ali jafar shift manager from west bank village who work for sodastream for two year sum it up when he say all the people who want to close the factory be mistaken they do take into consideration the family it be those family we should think about when vote on the bill when sodastream close its factory in the west bank it move to rahat in the negev desert on the final day of ramadan it organise the large iftar celebration in israel almost israelis and palestinians come together to break bread at the factory the bds movement remain against sodastream factory in the negev desert because it have find new reason for do so it say sodastream be still subject to boycott by the global palestinian lead bds movement for palestinian right its new factory be actively complicit in israel policy of displace the indigenous palestinian citizen of israel in the naqab negev sodastream mistreatment of and discrimination against palestinian worker be not forget either why be the integration success of company such as sodastream and iscar not tell because they show normalisation they show neighbourly relationship and peace between people have be strike by the story of the hamas hostage and their family some of they have live in gaza and move when the occupation end in but still have palestinian friend there we do not hear about those kind of relationship extremist do not want to portray any kind of normal life success or quality of existence whether they be from hamas or the bds movement neither promote peaceful coexistence the bds movement boast that in year it have do year worth of turn darkness into be quite some sugar coating if you ask madam deputy speaker the bds movement have an anti normalisation charter that forbid the participation in any project initiative or activity local or international that bring together on the same platform palestinians and israelis and do not meet the follow two condition the israeli side publicly recognize the un affirm inalienable right of the palestinian people which be set out in the bds call and this be the most important part the joint activity constitute form of co resistance against the israeli regime of occupation settler colonialism and apartheid that be evidence if it be ever need that the bds movement do not want peace bds ignore or reject the jewish people right to self determination and occasionally call for the eradication of israel the world only jewish state so if bds objective be not peace what be it at its core it be antisemitic the anti defamation league have assess that bds campaign often include allegation of jewish power dual loyalty and jewish israeli culpability for unrelated issue and crisis will now explain why this have such negative impact on the jewish community here in the uk the jewish leadership council have make the case that public body in the uk be more likely to interact with people than the government be and that it be therefore important they be trust by all community the jlc believe that most relationship between jewish community and public body be usually positive but that this be undermine when those body seek to involve themselves in international matter and support bds movement the event of the past few week will hope give many people well understanding of why israel be so important to the jewish community have work in the community visit israel number of time and work with holocaust survivor think understand but for many in the jewish community around the world repeat that october be the big loss of jewish life since the holocaust bring with it unimaginable pain and new understanding israel very existence be bear of the need for safe haven for jews the event of october be never mean to happen hamas know they strike at the heart of israel and therefore the heart of the jewish community when movement seek to single out the world only jewish state as unique evil it be clear why that could be regard as antisemitic there be no comparable campaign about any other state on this scale none that mobilise as many people and seek to divide and maintain division rather than strive for peace if they be to have their way supporter of bds might claim victory however they can not claim with any credibility to be supporter of two state solution boycotts harm israel they harm palestinians and they harm any prospect of peace the bill be not barrier to peace the bds movement and oppose the bill be barrier to peace applaud the government for their strong stance in take action against bds and for bring this bill before the house and will be wholeheartedly support it order will now announce the result of the ballot hold today for the election of the defence committee chair four hundred and thirty three vote be cast three of which be invalid there be single round of vote with valid vote the quota to be reach be therefore vote robert courts be elect chair with vote he will take up his post immediately and congratulate he on his election the result of the count under the alternative vote system will be make available as soon as possible in the vote office and publish on the internet rise to speak to the amendment in my name as well as amendment table by my right hon friend the member for ashton under lyne angela rayner both relate to how the bill will impact public body right to make ethical decision on matter relate to international law and human right so that be the subject will begin with gaza the united nations have say have become hellhole israeli bomb have decimate whole neighbourhood in six day alone bomb be drop on the besiege enclave more bomb than nato force drop in an entire year of intense fighting in afghanistan an israeli military spokesperson be frank about the purpose of the bombing the emphasis be on damage and not on accuracy nearly palestinians have be kill include nearly child last night be the deadly so far with people dead this be happen to one of the most densely populate area on earth where million people half of whom be child be trap in an area no big than the isle of wight even before the recent violence gaza have be besiege for more than decade and half with access by land air and water blockade back in even conservative prime minister david cameron call it prison camp but now israel have impose total siege cut off water fuel electricity and food the un say hospital will run out of fuel today and incubator with premature baby will stop work israel evacuation order demand that million people flee their home be describe as impossible without devastate human consequence by the united nations and the world health organisation have call it death sentence for the sick and injure indiscriminate bombing collective punishment and forcibly displace people be clear violation of international law not accord to but accord to the united nations secretary general this be in no way downplay or deny hamas appal attack on israeli citizen which absolutely condemn and again echo the call for the release of hostage just as and no member here can imagine the fear and anguish of family who have see love one take hostage can not imagine the terror of palestinian family face constant israeli bombardment on this question the united nations secretary general say yesterday international law be clear yet in this house people do not want to accept that hamas crime in no way excuse what we have see since that be relevant to this debate because these clear violation of international law have be give the green light by political leader here in the uk and beyond even with an israeli defence official promise to turn gaza into city of tent the prime minister have still refuse to acknowledge these clear violation of international law and unlike grow number of his counterpart across the world he be still refuse to call for an immediate ceasefire that be utterly shameful and it go to the heart of the problem with this bill and the need for these amendment israel brutal war on gaza be not an isolated example for example the saudi lead war on yemen which have speak about repeatedly in this house have claim the life of more than people it have include war crime such as the saudi bombing of school bus which kill more than child and dozen adult that war have also be wag with the british government support include considerable military equipment and assistance let we find some historical example perhaps the most notable be the government support for the apartheid south african regime which people should be absolutely ashamed of and embarrassed about the then prime minister margaret thatcher call the african national congress and nelson mandela terrorist and young conservatives proudly wear badge call for he to be hang in each of these case whether it be israel war on gaza the saudi war on yemen or apartheid south africa violation of international law and gross injustice have be commit with the support and complicity of the british government if the bill be pass unamended on these matter and more public body such as local council and university will not be able to make ethical procurement or investment decision local democracy will be sideline and they will be force to ignore question of human right and international law the case of south africa show most clearly why that would be such mistake will the hon lady give way be go to continue while the government support the apartheid regime local council across the country rally around the anti apartheid movement with council across the country have divest from company operate in south africa by if this bill have be put in place then that action would have be illegal that be why huge coalition of more than organisation have come together to oppose it those organisation include trade union such as aslef the fire brigades union unison and unite and campaign group such as greenpeace and liberty amendment in my name and amendment seek to address this grave mistake by protect the right of public body to make ethical decision not leave they at the whim of the deeply unethical decision of national government such as ours urge member from across the house to support the amendment some year ago an elderly jewish constituent come to see in my surgery concerned about her own safety follow rise in violence in israel and palestine and the result antisemitism here in the uk say to she then that if the mob ever come for she before they get to she they would find stand in her driveway with my baseball bat in hand have stand with the jewish community across the uk particularly in london over the last nearly year of my political career when be tell that in seek to improve this legislation or in express doubt about its impact be somehow pick side with the implication that be not stand with that community find it both insulting and offensive particularly come from member of this house who while accept unquestioningly this legislation have not do so with other legislation come from the government we all have duty at this point in time as the prime minister and other have say to choose our word carefully on monday he say it be time for care and caution and he be exactly right for those who say that there be never good time there be certainly well time as israel reel from the profoundly evil crime that be commit against it at the same time as palestinian parent search in the rubble for the body of their child for we to bring forward legislation that member on the government benches have say in term be pick side seem remarkably insensitive not least because our prime minister be frantically tour the world try his good to work with the qataris and other to release those hostage they must be release as soon as possible can not see how choose even to amend the programme motion to get this thing under the wire at this time be anything other than create difficulty in that regard have table five amendment to this legislation and seek to improve it understand that the government be try to pursue manifesto commitment manifesto on which stand and while might have doubt about the impact of this legislation on civic society generally recognise that there be some legitimacy to it however the form of the legislation matter will take my amendment in turn as they appear on the amendment paper first amendment go to the heart of much of the objection that people have to this legislation by carve out israel the west bank and the occupy golan heights in the legislation be afraid the secretary of state be play into the antisemitism we have see rise in this country over the past few week quote jonathan freedland on second reading and it be worth quote he again he write in the jewish chronicle what be the favourite refrain of the antisemite that israel be the one country you not allow to criticise this bill take canard and in the case of boycott turn it into the law of the land there be no requirement in law for this carve out to exist if we agree to amendment the impact of the bill would be precisely the same on daily basis israel would merely be treat as all other country in the world would be treat for the purpose of our legislation the dreadful thing about this carve out be that prior to this awful crime be commit israel be try to achieve normalisation with its neighbour with american sponsorship it be in fruitful talk with country that have be at loggerhead with it for year yet here we be exceptionalise israel again amendment also speak to some significant legal concern that have be express about the impact of this legislation under international law and on our undertaking at the united nations and about the conflation of the three territory and the signal it send not only to palestinians live in the west bank but to those who occupy the golan heights would be interested to hear what the secretary of state have to say about that issue if clause remain guarantee that this legislation will end up in the court and there will be wrangle for year before it be give any kind of effect amendment would amend clause to lift the effective ban on criticism of this legislation by other elect individual again the proposal in the bill strike at the very heart of what we try to achieve at every level of our democracy in this country which be sense of ethical and moral conduct and that people should be able to express their view my right hon friend be make powerful point like he have spend lot of time in local government do he agree with the point raise on second reading that key issue be that our local elect brother for example those specifically elect on foreign policy platform such as the councillor who serve at one stage on birmingham city council on behalf of the justice for kashmir party may have specific democratic reason for be there to express that foreign policy view there will be circumstance in which councillor include those who sit in the house of lords and who sit as part of international body such as the congress of the council of europe benefit from parliamentary privilege in express their view there be therefore risk that this gagging order be not simply gag what people should expect as freedom of speech but be also ineffective in the objective it set out to achieve my hon friend speak with experience and he put it extremely well to assume that councillor be merely elect on the basis of their attitude towards pothole and refuse collection be completely erroneous they be elect for all sort of reason many councillor and member of the devolved administration who campaign on social moral ethical and indeed foreign policy issue would say that they have mandate and not even to be able to express opposition to the law while still comply with it seem very un british extremely illiberal and unnecessarily draconian we have lot of law in this country to which councillor and indeed other elect official of oppose political persuasion can express opposition to have an exception on this basis seem faintly ridiculous on amendment declare my interest as member of the local government pension fund which understand be the only pension fund affect by the bill as say on second reading it be unfortunate that as the right hon member for hayes and harlington john mcdonnell say my accumulate saving be be put under the control of the secretary of state if in pursuit of this control my pension diminish in value because be force to follow the decision make by the secretary of state what will be my compensation in retirement amendment be about exempt university as public body there be technical reason as well as principle reason for this amendment outline my objection on second reading not least because we have just appoint free speech tsar and legislate for free speech on university campus but here we be busily curtail free speech through this bill the technical issue be about university be classify as public body as the secretary of state will know there have be flurry of activity in the treasury because further education college have be classify as public body which mean all their debt come on to the public balance sheet this be another step towards university with their even great level of debt come on to the balance sheet about which the treasury ought to have say hope and believe that when the bill go to the house of lords the treasury will want to have look finally amendment be about international law know that the secretary of state like every member of the government be extremely keen on international law and want to ensure it be follow in all circumstance and particularly in this current horrific conflict in israel and gaza one of the great benefit of our more flexible system be that as the government call for boycott of russian business and russian individual follow the invasion of ukraine other part of civic society be able to move extremely quickly to comply whereas under this legislation they would have to wait for the government to issue some kind of regulation which would have to go through this house and be debate that could possibly take week if not long particularly if the house be in recess amendment propose that if the government declare that country or situation be in breach of international law other organisation can immediately respond by issue their own sanction or disinvestment honestly believe that the amendment have table understand that only amendment which be probably the most important will go to division this evening represent an attempt to improve the legislation rather than necessarily pick side although this debate have be afraid be position as pro israel or pro palestine debate be primarily pro britain want to get the legislation right for this country for the jewish community and for every community in this country so that we can live with the consequence for year to come human right group have rightly condemn the bill as an outrageous and unwarranted interference in the ability of council university and other public body to use their purchasing power to pursue ethical procurement and investment policy in order to help defend human right and tackle issue such as climate change everyone who care about issue such as the illegal arm trade activity of arm manufacturer and trader whose weapon fuel conflict around the globe or climate justice correctly will be horrify by this blatant attack on the basic democratic right of elect public body to act on behalf of the resident who elect they the bill specifically protect the state of israel israeli company and their human right abuse from local authority sanction no matter what human right abuse they might commit or be commit now it be self evident that council and other public body must be free and indeed have duty to act to prevent or discourage breach of international humanitarian law it be clear that israeli settlement be illegal under international law and no local authority or government should offer support to such activity the government anti bds bill contradict the guide principle on business and human right publish by the united nations it penalise public body that comply with the uk responsibility as permanent member of the un security council it take away the democratic right of public body to make ethical financial decision the bill uniquely shield human right abuse by israel allow it to act with impunity indeed the bill exempt specific country namely israel despite its human right abuse and war crime even though we do not know what future action such country may take that be show of complete contempt for the people of palestine and the daily inhumanity abuse and discrimination they face the bill be textbook case of divide and rule politic it be profoundly disappointing that the government be pursue the anti boycott bill at this moment when tension be extremely high in our community in the past few week almost palestinians have be kill almost half of they child and israelis have be kill and the civilian of gaza have be massacre by israeli airstrike war crime be happen in real time an immediate ceasefire be require and the prime minister the government the leader of the opposition and all political leader in this house should be call for it boycott divestment and sanction be an effective mean of peaceful resistance the bill be no less toxic than at its previous stage if it pass it will close off vital democratic avenue for the close representative of ordinary people at local level to demand accountability and change it will show how little this government care about the life of civilian and the plight of persecute and exploit community around the world welcome this bill which fulfil manifesto commitment and restate and protect the government foreign and trade policy prerogative by prevent local authority and other public body from pursue politically motivate foreign policy objective of their own some have say that the bill would limit free speech but that be not correct because individual councillor and public body can still say whatever they like as private citizen as long as that speech be lawful but local council have no democratic mandate to use their control of taxpayer fund and asset to create their own foreign policy or to express divisive opinion that undermine social cohesion in the community for which they be responsible we have hear devolution speak about in the chamber be supporter of devolution but the whole point be that certain power be devolve and certain power be not when my constituent go to the ballot box at local election they vote for the candidate who they think be the good person to ensure regular bin collection well maintain road or social care they be not vote on foreign policy defence policy or income tax rate because these be nationally reserve issue for the westminster government it be therefore unjustifiable for local authority to pretend they have democratic mandate to use ratepayer money to signal their own foreign policy position this bill do not restrict free speech rather it restrict public body from undermine policy decide nationally by national government elect in national ballot none of the amendment we be debate today would enhance the bill and in fact some be intend to make it unworkable amendment for example would make the pension scheme divestment provision unworkable and amendment and seek to remove an important clause relate to israel these amendment miss the crucial point of the bill and the reason why it be be bring forward all record recent example of public body pursue boycott against foreign state or territory have be against israel pm bds which we have hear about extensively in today debate be unique in its targeting of the world only jewish state the bds movement be not harmless peaceful movement it have alarm link to extremist include the hamas terrorist group which have just commit probably the bad crime in my lifetime the bad mass killing of jews since the holocaust public body fund by uk taxpayer should not be express public support for the divisive ideology advance by the bds movement its founder have indeed repeatedly express his opposition to israel right to exist as state of the jewish people and have endorse palestinian armed resistance when public body seek to undermine british foreign and trade policy and choose to do that only for matter relate to israel it give legitimacy to and encourage the sort of appalling antisemitic protest and attack we have see over the past few week let take my home city of sheffield as an example in the council pass motion regard its position on palestine it have nothing to do with the council responsibility as local authority but everything to do with its attempt to signal its anti israel political view and in under week time on november the green party councillor will put forward motion entitle stop the genocide in gaza that make no mention of hamas and their terrorism since the horrific terrorist attack on israel by hamas we have see some shocking scene on the street of sheffield the israeli flag tear down from the town hall antisemitic chant on our street even roadblock set up by supporter of hamas intimidate driver and ask for money find it unbelievable and shameful that after witness the despicable attack torture and rape of jewish civilian such action can take place in sheffield supposedly city of sanctuary it be very difficult for the jewish community in sheffield to feel safe when the local authority the official elect body appear to align itself with hard line anti israel movement that be why we need this bill because yet again israel and the jewish people be be single out and subject to discrimination across this country and across the world this single out of israel the only democracy in the middle east be just another form of the world old prejudice of course the government of israel can be criticise by british citizen as can any government in the world but it be unacceptable for local authority and public body to abuse their position to make divisive political intervention for which they have no democratic mandate that be why support this bill go forward unamended want to begin by say that be not sure it be helpful to link these proceeding with the current crisis in israel and gaza which be what some have seek to do in this debate think we should be careful about that and want to thank my right hon friend the member for ashton under lyne angela rayner for the tone she adopt in her opening remark and for her call for sensitivity and moderation in our approach to this issue the nature of the bds campaign be to promote anti normalisation it encourage the notion that there should not be contact trade exchange negotiation or even dialogue with israel the founder of the bds movement have repeatedly express his view that the israeli state should not exist for the aim of the movement be clear consequently be utterly opposed to the aim of bds and believe that they be as detrimental to the interest of the people of this country as they be to the people of israel and the palestinians when hear people talk about the bds movement often think they completely misunderstand the exact nature of our relationship with israel in trade medicine security and technological exchange and how people in this country be keep healthy and safe as result be therefore utterly oppose to bds not only do it target israel and hurt the palestinians it be also completely detrimental to the interest of the people of this country just in pass as birmingham mp want to refer to the point make by the right hon and learn member for northampton north sir michael ellis who be unfortunately no long in his place want he to know that veolia still have contract with birmingham city council despite his great effort to suggest that birmingham be responsible for veolia pull out of israel think he rather overstate the case say to the secretary of state and to the minister who be extremely courteous and reasonable throughout committee that after so many hour in committee and such period for reflection be really disappointed that we have have so little movement from the government on report hate to say this but find it hard not to conclude that the aim and argument of bds may not be the total priority hope that be wrong and hope that people can demonstrate that to remain strongly of the view that the government would be well advise to drop clause altogether as think it will probably make thing bad find myself in total agreement with the right hon member for north west hampshire kit malthouse on that also remain unconvinced by clause support amendment and also support new clause which seek to provide protection for religious dietary requirement think it be mention that one of the bds movement proposal be to remove kosher food from supermarket shelf can not believe that anyone in their right mind would think that reasonable way to proceed so welcome the new clause we need bill to address the iniquity of the bds movement we need bill to unite people on both side of the house who genuinely want consensus and broadly share the same aim regret that the bill in its present form be not piece of legislation that will achieve that outcome and urge ministers to seek consensus there be still time to reconsider the approach it seem to fall to to speak last in the debate from the back ah excellent my right hon friend the member for clwyd west mr jones and may be on similar theme it be pleasure to follow the hon member for birmingham selly oak steve mccabe if be not mistaken we visit gaza together some year ago think one colleague mention that the question tonight be which side be you on do not think that be the question at all if be ask that question my answer be always the same be on the side of the united kingdom that believe be where everyone in this house should be with the possible exception of those who seek not to be in the united kingdom that require and all of we to define the national interest in the context of that and any propose legislation we can define national interest in different way deep family tie with commonwealth member our close cultural and economic tie with our neighbour in europe our share value with fellow democracy and our historical link with nation around the world but we would place first surely our security and the potential vulnerability of this nation to terrorist and nation abroad who would damage we it be therefore strongly in our interest to bring forward legislation that build bridge for community both here and abroad as part of our role as permanent member of the united nations security council commit to the rule of law and promote the value of free speech and transparency strong in the belief for example of democracy stick to international rule of engagement because to do otherwise risk we descend to the level of the thugocracie that exist elsewhere where do that leave and we in today debate it mean that we without reservation condemn the appalling act of hamas in their invasion of several village and kibbutz in southern israel close to the border their murder of civilian and their taking of hostage from believe country it mean that we strongly support israel right of defence but it also mean that we believe that the invasion of gaza by air let alone by ground have inevitably already cause as many if not more civilian casualty in way that have already almost certainly break the rule of international engagement include in term of access to water electricity fuel medicine and so on understand and accept that all infrastructure in gaza be compromise by hamas there will be building and basement of school and hospital and so on that hamas be use but that do not justify for example bomb building of refuge in the compound of st porphyrius our position in this nation be for genuine two state solution that allow for both the state of israel remarkable state with so much to admire and state of palestine with people have suffer since the nakba of over access to land sometimes seize illegally in the occupy territory as united nations law make clear that be the right position however difficult to achieve and however abuse by this israeli government continue deliberate building of illegal settlement in the occupy territory and by hamas hezbollah and iran refusal to allow israel to exist at all this then be the relevance of pro uk policy to this particular bill into this delicate landscape of increase polarisation throughout the middle east stride the economic activity of public bodies overseas matters bill agree with the principle of reduce local government posturing on foreign policy some of we be old enough to remember the labour lambeth borough council nuclear free zone and the principle of the bill can be reasonably in the national interest agree with the hon member for birmingham selly oak and many other on both side of the house that the bds movement be clearly antisemitic it be clearly aim at israel there be no question about that but at the same time when my hon friend the member for brigg and goole andrew percy advise that we should therefore stop everything regardless and support israel and its government statement on any issue regardless do not think that that be the case our support should not be at the price of explicitly give the israeli government completely free hand in their policy towards the west bank and the occupy territory rid roughshod through un security council motion draft by the united kingdom without they the fact on the ground as the government like to call they make two state solution hard and hard therefore the motivation behind the drafting of amendment which be support so strongly be not to bow down before threat by hamas and those who wish for no state of israel at all it be not to support the constituent of mine who say to during peace march note the irony of those word that hitler have point no be not back amendment to support anything like that be do so because there be many other among my constituent and other muslims in this country who do believe in two state solution and who do want to see peace believe that the representative of those arab government who have reach agreement with israel and sign the abraham accord have do so because they do not want to see israel destroy and they do want to see peace in the middle east and do not believe that any of they would support the clause in this bill that prevent we from hold the occupation the illegal occupation by israeli settler to account although also support other amendment table by my right hon friend the member for north west hampshire kit malthouse who speak so well this evening it be principally amendment that give we chance to put the bill back on the right track by remove an aspect of it that prevent or at the very least inhibit we from hold the israeli government to account in the way in which so many people in this country and abroad would like this be not about be naive it be about recognise that the bds movement be deeply unpleasant and be target israel yes we must be vigilant against both antisemitism and islamophobia but we should not exclude hold israel to account that be why be support amendment this evening it be pleasure to follow the hon member for gloucester richard graham too wish to speak in particular about amendment table by the hon member for north west hampshire kit malthouse it be with heavy heart that be take part in this debate be half minded not to do so because now be not the time the impact of the awful violence in israel and palestine on community across the world can not be underestimate but the answer be not to debate the bill right now by all mean let we have some space some time there have only be statement and we have not have chance to talk about it by all mean let we do that but not this it be unwise even to table the debate for this week and on monday urge the prime minister to change his mind in his response he speak about the importance of not undermine community cohesion politely suggest that if government do not want to undermine community cohesion the last thing they should do be introduce bill such as this may associate myself with the argument advance by the right hon member for barking dame margaret hodge what she say be exactly what member of my jewish community have say to they be appal that the government be choose to play politic at this time the bill be divisive at the good of time and the fact be that this be the bad of time that hold true regardless of what we may think of the bill content the liberal democrats be on the record as register our opposition to specific clause on second reading but be here primarily to talk about the timing amendment cut to the chase it address the fact that on the face of the bill in clause be reference to the conflict in israel and palestine conflict that have cost thousand of innocent life over the past three week and conflict in respect of which intense diplomacy be require be shocked that the foreign secretary and the prime minister have tour the middle east and have understand the strength of feeling but also the sensitivity have decide that this in any way help they to do their very important job make no mistake those leader in the arab world be watch what be happen here today and do not think that it show we in the good light if the prime minister back two state and want to take any sort of lead he need to mean it be sorry to say that arrange for this bill to be debate this week be not the mark of statesman it be disgrace it be disgrace because this conflict be affect family across the uk as well as those abroad maybe they be fearful of become the victim of hate crime we have see dreadful rise in antisemitism and islamophobia over the last three week the community security trust have record the high ever number of antisemitic incident across this day period or maybe they be fearful for their family in the region have speak many time already about my fear for my extended family in gaza or maybe they be fearful for their love one who be be hold hostage by hamas if we be go to engage in this conflict we should speak about how to get those hostage free early this week and my party leader meet some of those family include the aunt of ariel and kfir who be four year old and nine month old be disgusted to see picture of four year old ariel deface with horn and hitler imagery at bus stop in finchley this morning an utterly grotesque act hope the perpetrator be catch and the full force of the law be apply this hateful antisemitism have no place in our society and that be not up for debate on palestinians we should be speak about the situation on the ground in gaza and how we can get aid in child in gaza be write their name on their hand so that if they be kill they can be bury with their family attend vigil yesterday where we mourn those innocent child whose life have be needlessly lose it be not right that innocent palestinians be be hold accountable for hamas atrocity have hear argument primarily from the government benches that hamas be purportedly tell people not to move and find safety but that be not what be hear certainly not from my own family find it deeply offensive for people to suggest that hamas be give my family order the reason people be not move be that they be frail and can not move but even if they do the south be be bomb too the conversation have change in gaza no long do they ask where do go to be safe the question now be where do go to die so how be we to facilitate release those hostage how be we to safeguard innocent civilian life it be through humanitarian ceasefire that be position back by the pope the archbishop of canterbury united states secretary of state blinken and finally it seem the government this morning what the house should be do at this time be dig deep into our humanity and our compassion it be time for leadership for soothe word and for calm to bring people together all people directly affect or not and to demonstrate by what we do here how to let the light pierce into the darkness and despair so support amendment wholeheartedly and believe that this place can and should offer more than division let make my final point very clearly do not want something like this to drive wedge between any member in this house and our jewish community stand with member of my jewish community in oxford in the first week of the attack and grieve with they we shed tear together stand shoulder to shoulder with they now we all stand shoulder to shoulder with they now say to those members who suggest that should pick side or even bad that by not vote with the government today be against peace how dare they will tell they what be on the side of be on the side of basic humanity be on the side of those who want to bring consensus be on the side of the israeli community the palestinian community and the jewish muslim and christian community this be tragedy that affect the whole world and say to this government do well support the amendment in the name of my right hon friend the member for north west hampshire kit malthouse and wish to speak specifically to amendment and this bill be introduce pursuant to conservative manifesto commitment at the last general election to ban public body from impose their own direct or indirect boycott disinvestment or sanction campaign against foreign country it be important to note that the wording of that commitment be not country specific it be agnostic but it be very clear from the debate thus far most particularly on second reading but also today that the measure contain in the bill be aim primarily at the bds campaign that have for some two decade target the state of israel this be quite proper foreign policy in this country as other hon member have say should be determine by the government of this country not by local authority or other public body the bill be broadly draw except in one respect which paradoxically rob it of its breadth it contain specific measure to prevent any attempt at later date to modify its provision in respect of the conduct of the government of israel in relation to the territory of israel the occupied palestinian territories and the occupy golan heights it be clear from the secretary of state remark on second reading that the principal mischief that the government intend to target be the undoubted evil of antisemitism and antisemitic behaviour which have be among the most regrettable in fact deplorable consequence of the bds campaign clamp down on antisemitism be obviously important indeed it be essential no one would dispute that it be good thing in fact give current event in and close to gaza and indeed on the street of london do everything possible to prevent it be very much priority it be more than arguable that in the case of public body there be legislative vehicle for do that already in the shape of the equality act most particularly section which impose public sector equality duty on such body require they to pay due regard to the need to foster good relation between person of different religion ethnicity and nationality however the government have decide that the equality act be insufficient and have decide to go far by effectively outlaw the activity of the bds movement in relation to israel only use this bill as the vehicle that be not country agnostic ambition of the sort envisage in the manifesto commitment this be broad bill with one particularly anomalous element as such it throw up problem which the amendment seek to rectify amendment address the problem that arise under clause which provide that the secretary of state or the minister for the cabinet office may by regulation specify country or territory as one in relation to which section do not apply in other word permit public body to make procurement or investment decision in such way as to express political or moral disapproval of the conduct of foreign state clause however go on to provide that such regulation may not specify israel the occupied palestinian territories or the occupy golan heights the effect of clause therefore be to make it absolutely clear that the sole purpose of this bill be to give total and unique protection to israel from bds activity do not believe that it should be necessary to state that in the bill there may well be future circumstance in which it would be appropriate and desirable for public body to seek to express disapproval of the conduct of foreign state if any regulation be make permit such conduct they would self evidently be do in circumstance in which they be approve of by the government however except israel the occupied palestinian territories and the occupied golan heights from the ministerial power to make such regulation be very strange approach in the first place it be not as have say country neutral which it should be the absence of neutrality may indeed cause offence to people from other country around the world not least those moderate islamic state that be do their very good at the moment to try to defuse the tension that have arise in the middle east moreover it create an unacceptable equivalence between the status of the occupied palestinian territories and the golan heights both of which be arguably illegally occupy and be certainly in the view of the government in the case of the opt illegally settle and that of the sovereign territory of israel itself that be matter be afraid that be likely to attract significant international criticism as it may well put the united kingdom in breach of its obligation under un security council resolution be find to be in breach of that resolution be not something that the government should be happy to risk secondly that exception be frankly perplexing it mean that if at some future time the government be to decide to show disapproval of the action of the state of israel cabinet minister would not be able to do so without launch stand alone primary legislation how can that possibly be sensible approach and why be it necessary be secretaries of state and cabinet office ministers so capricious so inclined to engage in frolic of their own that they will pursue measure that be not approve of by the government be they not trust by the government to behave responsibly and if not why be they member of the government at all the provision be illogical unnecessary and potentially damaging to the interest of the united kingdom and its reputation and believe that the amendment be therefore entirely right amendment seek to remove clause which constitute perplexing and unacceptable constraint on free speech if decision maker be prevent from make particular investment or procurement decision because of the provision of the bill if indeed it be enact that should be the end of the matter there be no good reason in free country why they should be preclude from say what they would have do be it not against the law to do so this be conservative government conservative believe in and value free speech indeed the government have recently legislate to protect freedom of speech under the law in the higher education freedom of speech act which make this provision all the more anomalous find myself in the extraordinary position of agree entirely with the remark of the right hon member for hayes and harlington john mcdonnell in this regard this be deeply un conservative measure and believe that the amendment be right and that the provision should go thank all member who have contribute to this debate for the thought and care that they have give to the legislation before we appreciate that we be debate these measure at sensitive time and that across the house people will place different emphasis on aspect of the legislation and the broad issue with which it deal let be clear have respect for everyone who have speak and the argument that they have make where there be disagreement it be in the context of everyone in this house be unite in their horror of terrorism their desire for peace and their belief in two state solution we be seek in the bill to give effect to manifesto commitment as my right hon friend the member for clwyd west mr jones have just point out the bill be introduce early this year indeed it complete its committee stage under the careful and thoughtful stewardship of the under secretary of state for levelling up housing and communities my hon friend the member for kensington felicity buchan with contribution from all side of merit thought and care of course those debate take place before the horrific event of october to which so many colleague in this debate have refer it be important to remember do not think that anyone in the house can forget that on october we see the large loss of jewish life since the holocaust that atrocity be perpetrate by terrorist from hamas whose aim be very clear and very simple the elimination of the jewish state the elimination of jewish life whatever the background belief or origin of those jewish life they be to be exterminate more than hostage be still be hold by hamas in gaza across the house we grieve for they and their family thank in particular the hon member for walthamstow stella creasy and for brent central dawn butler with whom have be in touch who have be work very hard to ensure that their constituent be release and bring home also thank the shadow business secretary the hon member for stalybridge and hyde jonathan reynolds who join and many member from all party at vigil in trafalgar square on sunday to call for the return of those hostage we also sympathise across the house with the innocent people of gaza and with all those palestinian people who have suffer we recognise that many of the innocent people in gaza be hostage too they be hostage of hamas palestinian islamic jihad and the other terrorist organisation that operate within that territory it be vital at all time that we draw distinction between those who suffer in gaza and those who be perpetrate suffering in the name of terrorism be very conscious that we be debate these issue against that backdrop but it be important that we look at the principle behind the bill also thank our friend the ambassador of the state of israel who be here in the gallery to listen to our consideration she and other ambassador have be work with the foreign commonwealth and development office to ensure that every hostage be release back to their jewish home with their family it be important to recognise what the bill do not do number of legitimate concern be express that actually do not reflect what be in the bill and what the bill be intend to achieve the bill do not prevent any individual from articulate their support for the bds campaign or indeed any particular policy that the bds campaign put forward it simply prevent public body and public money be use to advance that case any of we as individual have total right to freedom of speech however offensive or difficult some of the word that some utter might be free speech be not affect by the bill the bill also do not prevent human right consideration from be take into account by local authority the bill make it clear that legitimate human right consideration provide that they be non country specific should be take into account note the point make by my right hon friend the member for camborne and redruth george eustice about animal welfare if specific human right consideration need to be add to the bill we will consider that in the lords also note the comment make by the hon member for brighton pavilion caroline lucas we want to ensure that there be robust way of ensure that local authority can uphold human right on non country specific basis note some of the concern express about the impact on the local government pension scheme let stress again that there be no damage to the fiduciary duty that trustee of the scheme will have to uphold in ensure that they secure the good value on their investment for their member what the bill do do be deal with the broad principle that foreign policy should be reserve to this house it be important to stress that when other public body take stand on foreign policy they risk vitiate the power of both the government and the house to achieve goal for the benefit of the united kingdom and risk create specific community tension talk of specific community tension take we of course to the specific menace that be the bds movement it be of course possible for local government to consider adopt boycott in variety of way but the truth be that if we look at local government and as my right hon friend the member for preseli pembrokeshire stephen crabb point out at the devolved administrations the only country that have be single out so far for boycott divestment and sanction campaign have be israel let we not hide from that fact the reason for that be that the bds campaign be in itself antisemitic it be not exercise disapproval of some particular foreign policy or domestic policy decision of the state of israel it be say that israel should not exist it be instructive though not easy to look at the communication that the bds movement have issue on social medium since october not one word of sympathy for the israeli people in their suffering indeed what it have say on social medium when talk of those death be that their blood of the jewish people the israeli people kill be on the hand of the israeli government the bds campaign have say that the root cause of this violence the death on october must be acknowledge israel as the occupier the bds movement have cite variety of politician as what they call partner in genocide rishi sunak joe biden olaf scholz and ursula von der leyen of course the bds campaign also continue to repeat the lie the blood libel that it be the israeli defence forces who be responsible for the tragic loss of life at the al ahli hospital in gaza that be what we be deal with and be very grateful to the hon member for birmingham selly oak steve mccabe for make clear the horror that he and so many of we hold for the bds movement there be an argument that perhaps this bill be divisive and it be not want particularly by many voice in the jewish community there be some voice in the jewish community who have concern and we have listen to they but the representative body that speak for britain jewish community be unite in support this bill they include the board of deputies which contain representative of every jewish constituency jewish organisation and every jewish community be it secular or religious and the jewish leadership council which contain representative of every political and faith tradition within the jewish community we have hear reference make to the increase we have see it be horrific to think about it in antisemitic incident in recent week indeed the right hon member for barking dame margaret hodge make reference to the community security trust have be in contact with it this afternoon and it send this message bds have chilling impact on jews modern reminder of anti jewish boycotts it also serve to legitimise the shunning of jews from decent society and have be shun that half way house to all manner of more abusive and physical outcome so we respect the diversity of voice but when we have such unity from those who speak for the jewish community indeed the jewish community of the uk when they be so clear that this legislation be in the interest of community cohesion fight antisemitism and make the uk safe house for everyone we should treat their word with respect the point have be make that the specific mention in the bill of israel could perhaps in some case engender great degree of polarisation and antisemitism know that the people who make that argument make it sincerely but as my hon friend the member for brigg and goole andrew percy point out sometimes we just have to stand up for what be right if there be people who be provoke as result of that it be regrettable but we should not shy away from tell the truth we should not shy away from say that what have be go on with gaza genocidal campaign against the jewish people be something that we as country need to stand against when the bds campaign have in its leadership the leader of hamas we need to be clear about this evil and this menace that be not just my argument it be also the argument of the jewish community organisation that cite early include the jewish leadership council in its submission to the committee consider this bill it say the inclusion of clause recognise this unique nature of the bds campaign against israel it state its belief that if that provision be excise as one amendment seek to achieve the very purpose of the bill would be undermine such change would convert bill aim to prevent anti israel bds campaign from abuse our public body into tool to facilitate it it be debatable of course whether this be the right way forward the jewish leadership council be very clear that it be but simply ask after everything we have see in the past three week if this house be now to remove specific protection for the state of israel at this time what message would it send submit to every member of this house that we should listen to the jewish community and the clarity with which they speak thank the right hon gentleman for the tone he have adopt so far as it be important that we adopt the correct tone in this debate do he recognise the concern that not just israel be mention in the clause this be also about why the government have include the occupied palestinian territories and the golan heights that have also arouse some comment debate and criticism take the hon gentleman point and appreciate the concern that he articulate which be share by number of people but the way in which the bill be design make it clear that there be separation between israel the opt and the golan heights as the jewish leadership council point out in its evidence to the committee on which the hon gentleman serve with distinction this clause recognise this distinction it absolutely do and close loophole to ensure public body can not remain tool of the bds movement against israel it be also the case that by make that distinction the clause and the bill overall reserve to the uk government the role of maintain as we do our absolute commitment to two state solution as frame then the bill be absolutely not in breach of international law it enable the uk government to speak with one voice on behalf of the entire united kingdom in our determination to secure two state solution however distant that prospect may be at the moment be interested in clause which specifically state that the exception to any prohibition be israel the occupied palestinian territories or the occupied golan heights what be the distinction between israel and those two that mean that we can still hold the government of the day accountable for illegal settler occupation in those two occupy area the fact that they be list separately and individually affirm the absolutely principal purpose of treat they individually and separately be sorry but if opposition front bencher think it be appropriate to smile laugh and joke about this issue regret that if people disagree in principled fashion respect that but the key thing be that we know there be people who have attempt to use language relate to what happen in the occupy territory indeed the former attorney general my right hon and learn friend the member for northampton north sir michael ellis cite number of example of this specifically to seek to target people on the basis of their jewish identity and that be wrong there be another point if we accept as everybody who have speak today have apparently accept that the bds campaign be

amendment and that they have agree to our amendment in lieu of their amendment with regard to the levelling up and regeneration bill therefore no further proceeding on those bills will be necessary international rail services kent motion make and question propose that this house do now stephenson be grateful for the chance to bring to the house an issue that be of huge importance not just to my constituent in ashford but to many people across the whole county of kent and indeed beyond the withdrawal of the international service which use to stop at ashford and ebbsfleet but which be stop when the pandemic mean the temporary end of international travel and which have not subsequently be restore by eurostar know that my hon friend the minister will be aware of the successful history of the service which have be run from ashford since it have contribute significantly to economic growth in the area take advantage of the geographical proximity to the european mainland to drive economic development and particularly inward investment it also of course provide large new leisure market with people from across kent have easy access to disneyland paris and at other time of the year quick journey to the ski slope there be demonstrably huge potential for the kent station do my right hon friend agree that the international train run from ashford enhance connectivity boost tourism stimulate economic growth promote cultural exchange and have environmental benefit for the coastal town across kent and east sussex include beautiful hastings and rye my hon friend be completely right as she will have hear make the point that this be of great interest to people not just across kent but beyond certainly she be great champion for hastings and agree that the effect of high speed rail in this case international rail can spread prosperity and the opportunity that travel can bring far and wide from the station my right hon friend make the case very well about the opportunity for people in sussex and the coastal town but do he agree that that also apply to people in the north of kent and the south east london area as it be still much quick for they to access ashford international for those journey absolutely be glad that my hon friend have make that point because of course travel into central london for st pancras be often real pain for people from the outskirt of london and certainly for those from the more rural part of kent access to ashford where it be easy to drive and to get there by train and it be well connected make it much easy to intersect with the international service be glad to have his constituent add to mine and those of other colleague across kent as people who wish for eurostar to restore the service we have be through minor version of the current impasse before there be time in when eurostar withdraw the brussels service from ashford campaign over several year which be involve with alongside ashford borough council and kent county council and with the sympathetic support of ministers in the government at that time succeed in persuade eurostar that business base service allow sensibly time journey from ashford to brussels in the morning and back in the evening be viable that prove so successful that in weekend brussels service be add as well as new service to the south of france obviously accept that eurostar be private company and make its own commercial decision but the uk government have legitimate and important role in influence those decision not least in the specific case of ashford station in eurostar introduce new rolling stock that demand whole new signal system at ashford station to allow the new train to stop there that be fund at cost of million through the local growth fund in other word that be the uk taxpayer spending specifically so that eurostar could continue to service ashford so far the return on that for the taxpayer have be exactly zero by terrible irony of timing the work be complete at exactly the same time as the pandemic strike in the early month of and international service be suspend so no train have ever take advantage of that spending appreciate that million do not seem much in the context of the quantum of money that may not have be entirely prudently spend in recent year on the railway but the point be that this be not wasteful investment it be good investment that if utilise would provide service that passenger want and make well use of the exist railway infrastructure have spend that taxpayer money it be the government responsibility to see that it be well spend therefore hope and assume that the minister will back my call for the kent service to be resume eurostar current position have evolve not in helpful direction in september it say that no kent service would stop before in it say no service until in it say no service until my hon friend the member for dartford gareth johnson and have meet eurostar representative and have meet they on number of occasion with the relevant local authority in every one of those meeting would describe they as perfectly polite but completely obdurate eurostar be of course commercial company whose contract be not determine by the same kind of franchise or concession model that national service have its majority ownership be the french nationalise rail company sncf with small stake for the belgian state rail company and the other own by private sector company eurostar have now merge with the thalys group and it be undoubtedly true that the pandemic deal it very severe financial blow to survive that blow it take on large amount of commercial debt that it have to repay it say that it still have the long term ambition to grow its service but that for variety of reason it can not do so at the moment there be however two reason that make today discussion particularly timely because that low difficult period identify by eurostar be come to an end the first reason be reveal in its own press release last june about its late financial result it say we have turn the page on the covid crisis and be now move towards new chapter of build the new eurostar group its earning before interest taxis depreciation and amortisation ebitda in the jargon be record million clearly it be now generate cash because it repay million of the debt that it incur during the pandemic it be now evidently in position to expand if it want to the second reason it be timely to be have this discussion in public be the imminent arrival of competitor to eurostar in provide international service to the uk the evolyn consortium say that it have billion pound project to buy an initial train from alstom and intend to start service in at the moment it like eurostar be plan only capital city service but the advent of competition mean that both company will have to seek advantage and the free offer of station that be already build and rare to go be potentially great advantage to either of they if they have the gumption to take it obviously as we have hear in discussion with eurostar for long time station be useful only if there be passenger who want to use they and we know that there be have hear the argument that anyone in kent who want to travel to the continent will travel to st pancras and start there however as we have hear in this debate that argument do not wash with many people apart from the nonsense of have someone catch fast train to travel mile north west so that they can get on another fast train that travel south east under the channel we have to consider the expense of have to do that at the margin some people will be discourage from that we know how strong this feeling be because my constituent have organise petition along the line of what be say this evening in just few week more than people have sign it and many more be do so every day there be clearly ten of thousand of people in kent and many thousand more beyond kent who would prefer to travel from their local station and think it be incumbent on all of we to make that happen as soon as possible in the light of that want to ask the minister number of specific question the first of which be an overarch one give that eurostar profit be return and the government have put taxpayer money into the ashford signal so that ashford service can return to level what be the government do to support the return of service to the kent station the second relate to an environmental point there be many study show that international rail travel be more sustainable than air travel eurostar itself claim that the carbon footprint of one flight be the equivalent of that of eurostar journey as the government be look for way to meet their welcome net zero target by what be they do to expand the use of international rail as more sustainable form of transport especially as we know that there be significant capacity available both on the line and on the train path through the tunnel there be no capacity constraint in this part of the rail network so it would be good to use it as much as possible for the good of the environment be it not also the case that much of the electricity use on these train come from french nuclear power and so be some of the green power available yes indeed the rail network in our part of the world have be good at use the power that come from the interconnector my right hon friend be right to say that that add to the greenness of the travel and in particular the comparative advantage of international rail travel over international air travel my third question be about the new custom arrangement that the eu have devise and then delay note that the french government have so much confidence in these arrangement that they have insist they should not be implement before the paris olympics next summer but we must expect that the new ees entry exit system will eventually arrive and eurostar have argue that the need for more check and therefore more staff be one reason why it can not yet contemplate reopen ashford station so what be the government do to make sure that the ees system will not penalise rail traveller my fourth question be about the potential new entrant to the market appreciate that the proposal be in its early stage but assume that if it progress the uk government will need to give some authorisation for it to proceed and that therefore the government will need to be in detailed talk with the operator long before any service start run will the minister agree in those talk to put the case for the kent station not least as way of make the new operation more viable my fifth and final question be about the wide issue of cross channel traffic which the minister know be not only huge economic positive for east kent but far too often huge social negative as blockage at the port of dover or at the tunnel lead to motorway issue and at their bad the gradual coagulation of traffic flow through surprisingly large part of kent some of they quite long way from the coast do the minister agree that get more passenger on the train will help to relieve pressure at busy period on car traffic through the port of dover and eurotunnel as final thought of course appreciate that not all the lever for the decision be in the minister hand but know that my constituent and many other around kent and the wide south east would appreciate know that central government be on their side in the crusade to bring back the international rail service to kent thank my right hon friend the member for ashford damian green for secure the debate on this important issue which be very close to my heart be constituency neighbour to my hon friend the member for hastings and rye sally ann hart who make an intervention and my right hon friend be of course just across the border from in kent my right hon friend have work tirelessly in campaign on this matter on behalf of the people of ashford and the wide kent area and salute he for his work as mention as the member for constituency that be not too far away from his share my right hon friend disappointment that ebbsfleet and ashford station do not currently receive international service fully recognise the important benefit that high speed international rail service provide for the area and community they serve include for people and business in kent and its surround should state that be frequent user of the service have come across the coastline from east sussex to kent and would like to be able to do that again some month ago my right hon friend the member for ashford damian green and meet the chief executive of eurostar and to say that it be frustrating be an understatement it be frankly madness that we have international station at ebbsfleet and ashford but people can not travel from they internationally will my hon friend the minister do all he can through his department to ensure that international service be restore both at ashford and at ebbsfleet in my constituency can provide my hon friend with that assurance have real passion for this subject and be particularly keen to see those international station become international station again praise my right hon friend the member for ashford for his work on ashford station and praise my hon friend the member for dartford gareth johnson for his work on behalf of his constituent for the return of ebbsfleet station both member work incredibly hard and be keen to see that work reward high speed international rail service provide major benefit in term of the connection they provide and the fact that they be environmentally friendly link to our european neighbour as my right hon friend point out let give some context before the pandemic eurostar be carry record passenger number with more than million passenger per year and hold market share of around of journey between london and each of paris and brussels give the significant benefit and recognise that rail be currently significantly low carbon option compare with other mode of transport for international travel with emission as much as low on some route compare with air equivalent it be in our interest to ensure the long term sustainability of the service unfortunately as we know the travel industry be severely impact by face unprecedented challenge and the sector continue to manage and respond to the impact of that today eurostar passenger number collapse to of level for much of the pandemic and revenue be cut by around for month in eurostar therefore make difficult decision to cut service and consolidate its service offer that be an entirely commercial decision take by the operator as my right hon friend the member for ashford note eurostar be non franchised operator so it do not receive uk government subsidy during the pandemic the government work very closely with eurostar as we do with the travel industry more broadly to support it in access the cross economy support scheme for which it be eligible indeed recall that the transport committee when be wear my previous hat lean strongly into that particular issue and do its good to ensure that eurostar have that support that be why be now look for eurostar support in return as wear different hat the department engage extensively with eurostar throughout that period to consider the specific challenge face the company but the company ultimately secure financing on commercial term from its lender and shareholder too be very disappointed to see that despite strong recovery in demand for travel eurostar be yet to reinstate service from ebbsfleet and ashford since become rail minister have personally raise that with eurostar make it absolutely clear that be keen to see those service return as soon as it be possible and commercially viable for the company to do so agree with my right hon friend that there be some good argument for why that commercial rationale exist however recognise that it be an entirely commercial decision for eurostar give that international service operate on solely commercial basis my right hon friend raise the entry and exit system recognise that there be challenge at the border as he note the home office be the lead department on that but my department be support engagement with our european partner and portal include eurostar to help reduce the impact as much as possible indeed that be another matter that recall the transport committee raise as one of concern with certain date loom my right hon friend note that they have be move will certainly make the case for kent station when we have those discussion with our european partner as he ask of note my right hon friend important point concern the financial contribution from taxpayer and local partner to ensure that eurostar new train could serve the station recognise his disappointment give the year of work to enhance the station and the unfortunate timing in the light of the pandemic back his call for that investment to deliver return for uk taxpayer however thank to that investment ashford remain well place to accommodate any modern high speed train that may be use by eurostar or any new entrant seeking to compete with eurostar in future on that note it be important to highlight the prospect of great competition to eurostar in the future which could be beneficial for passenger in kent depend on commercial decision take by any new entrant as my right hon friend make clear at least one potential competitor have publicise its ambition to launch service to directly compete with eurostar in the come year have be clear that competition on the railway can deliver real benefit for passenger by provide great choice and low price it would also be an important step in improve the prospect of service return to kent station my right hon friend be absolutely right there be capacity on that line would dearly love to see another operator bring competition and stop at those kent station department official be engage regularly with infrastructure manager and european partner to discuss the potential for new service and route particularly to address the unique requirement of operate through the channel tunnel they also stand ready to work with and support potential new entrant through those challenge indeed just today be talk about open access and what we can do to bring more competitor on will ensure that that be not just domestic if have my way it will be international as well thank my right hon friend the member for ashford again for raise this important matter in the house also recognise the contribution and work of the other member who have speak my hon friend the members for old bexley and sidcup mr french and for hastings and rye and my right hon friend the member for scarborough and whitby sir robert goodwill like my right hon friend the member for ashford and all those who have speak be keen to see international service return to kent as soon as possible and when it be commercially viable my official and will work tirelessly on this matter and will continue to press for this change in my dealing with our industry partner question put and agree to house adjourn
