particularly to get kid into high and advanced level apprenticeship be sure that the hon gentleman will be delighted to learn that apprenticeship start be up by so far this year that be because apprenticeship be back by record investment of billion never before have government invest so much into high quality apprenticeship and achieve so much in spread opportunity across the country like

call the second question mr speaker would like to convey to the house his apology for his unavoidable absence from question this afternoon as he have to attend the commonwealth service in westminster abbey which be about to start at any minute now maintain schools funding what assessment her department have make of the impact of funding decision on maintain school since in school funding be billion next year it will be billion that be the high ever level in real term per pupil recent figure show that the bad impact school in luton north have endure more than million of real term cut since there be school roof with hole in bucket scatter across corridor collect rainwater and entire building hold up by scaffold those be the define image of year of conservative government year of budget cut and teaching staff expect to do more with less we need change child in luton north deserve well if the minister agree why will he not give child what they deserve on the condition of school building the hon lady will know that there be billion worth of capital for maintain and improve school building on the broad question about school funding she might have be allude be look for some visual recognition to figure put together by the national education union if so have to tell she that we believe those figure to be flawed in multiple respect include in assumption they make about the money and the number of child in school in previous year hope she will join in celebrate the record resourcing rightly go in to educate child welcome the record real term funding flow into our school but will my right hon friend join in look very carefully at the case for extend funding for tutoring it have raise attainment in particular for the most disadvantaged in many of our school and be see as great success story when it be introduce it be intend to be long term intervention may urge the minister to continue to look at that and ensure we find money in addition to the pupil premium to support that noble aim absolutely agree that tutoring be important in multiple context in particular in the year since the pandemic it have play an essential part will add that tutoring by undergraduate can help to introduce wide range of people to the potential of career in teaching want tutor to continue as my hon friend rightly mention part of the function of the pupil premium be to make such intervention and it can be spend on they teacher in frome recently reach out and tell that too few pupil be successful in their education health and care plan application without plan and the accompany support for child life chance they be diminish can the minister reassure my constituent that the government plan to reform the ehcp will still ensure that child receive care that be personalise to their need and not one size fit all approach to cut cost absolutely and wholeheartedly agree with the hon lady on the central importance of that support and how vital it be to have it there be of course many more ehcp than there be statement under the old system with more child receive support she will understand that can not comment on the individual case she mention but will mention the special educational need and disability and alternative provision improvement plan that we have in place welcome the substantial additional funding that have be give to maintain nursery school in my constituency but do the minister agree that it be vital for we to continue to increase funding for all barnet school as ever my right hon friend be great champion and advocate for barnet school and indeed for maintained nursery school which as she say play unique role in our system in carry out those particular function call the shadow minister last year the national audit office report that child be be teach in school need major rebuilding work on top of the problem cause by reinforce autoclaved aerate concrete construction issue be emerge daily with block and beam flooring high alumina cement and asbestos all long past their shelf life up in north tyneside and down to luton and beyond fourteen year of conservative government have leave child learn under prop and in portacabin and shed give that this government plan seem to be to leave it for the next labour government to sort out those problem can the minister at least inform we of the late estimate of the total school repair bill keep our school estate in the right condition for optimally educate child be of the foremost importance since we have allocate billion to keep school safe and operational pay tribute to everyone who have be involve in the most recent raac issue include the school and pupil who deal with it and my colleague who help to ensure that we reach this point all school have be tell what will happen next either they will receive remediation grant or they will be part of the school rebuilding programme send support what step she be take to improve support for child with special educational need and disability our send and alternative provision improvement plan publish last march include the development of new national standard to improve provision in mainstream setting for child with special educational need as for child require special school place last week we announce funding for an additional wave of special free school which come on top of the that we have open since and the whose opening have be approve visit school in my constituency virtually every week and see more and more of they struggle financially and in term of staff with the number of send pupil moreover too many staff member be have to go out and fetch child to bring they to school in the morning and need to have social worker base in their school this be not about individual school it be systemic problem what be the government do about it in cambridgeshire there have be increase in funding per head for special educational need since and special free school be in the pipeline along with two local authority special competition free school cambridgeshire be also part of our safety valve programme which help authority to run sustainable special educational need system wonder whether my hon friend might be able to help my constituent ella wakley who be disabled and travel to her college on the bus but her blue badge do not allow free transport for she and her assistant until am which be little late for the start of the school day do not know the specific of the case that my hon friend raise but if she write to will happily look at it call the shadow minister high quality early year education can be transformational for child with special educational need help to ensure that they be identify and support at the most important time for their development but last year few than one in five local authority in england report have enough childcare place for disabled child that be shameful failure be the minister confident that family with disabled child will be able to access the childcare to which they be entitle from april we be do two thing in this regard first we be review the special educational need inclusion fund as we roll out the new entitlement to ensure that it be work appropriately secondly we have provide contractor local authority have statutory duty to provide place for all child include those with special educational need and the contractor will work with local authority to ensure that be do pshe curriculum economic education if she will issue statutory guidance on teach economic education in school as part of the pshe curriculum it be essential that young people be equip to make important financial decision later in life my hon friend will recall our curriculum reform and the national curriculum for mathematic and secondary citizenship equip pupil with the essential knowledge understanding and practical skill need to manage their money the minister be absolutely right to suggest that good financial education help people to avoid debt and poverty and to build up saving cushion for rainy day prevention be undoubtedly well than cure yet while statutory guidance ensure that student learn about threat such as drug or unplanned pregnancy money and finance be more optional should they not be take as seriously as everything else agree with my hon friend there be relevant content in different part of the curriculum not only in mathematic which be statutory throughout key stage to but at secondary level in citizenship further element such as computing be particularly relevant to online fraud in relationship sex and health education some aspect of fraud be cover as be gamble but absolutely agree that it be important to keep these thing under review student cost of living support devolve administration what recent discussion she have have with her counterpart in the devolved administration on the potential merit of provide additional financial support to student in the context of increase in the cost of living the hon gentleman will know that high education be devolved matter and that each administration be responsible for determine the student finance arrangement that apply to student eligible for funding new datum reveal that in most area of england state school pupil who have receive free school meal have less than one in four chance of enter high education one reason for that be that poor student decide not to pursue that path because of the prospect of be saddle with huge debt which take decade to clear do the government believe that they should follow the scottish government example and abolish tuition fee so that education can be make accessible to all this government believe that we need to be fair not only to student but to taxpayer it be worth note that in england those from disadvantaged background be more likely to go to university than they be in we have put together substantial package to help student with the cost of living include million welfare support fund which we give to the office for student to ensure that student with difficulty be help call the shadow minister follow last year increase the government have announce paltry increase in maintenance loan this september with compound inflation rate of that amount to massive real term cut meanwhile the welsh government have announce increase even in scotland there will be special support loan for all student across the country student be be force into work multiple job to try to make end meet what have this government get against student be proud that we have record number of student go to university have already mention the fact that the disadvantaged be more likely to go to university than they be before will tell the hon gentleman what we be do to help student we have million welfare fund that we give to the ofs we have increase loan by we have freeze tuition fee family across the country have be give on average to help with energy bill and other bill we have give hundred of million of pound to the household support fund to support all family student know that they can have their loan reassess if their family income fall by and finally we have introduce degree apprenticeship so that student do not need to take out loan but can earn while they learn and get good skilled job at the end teacher and school support staff morale whether she be take step to help improve the morale of teacher and school support staff support teacher wellbee be crucial to our commitment to supportive culture in school and for encourage teacher retention that be why we co create the education staff wellbee charter with the education sector and we have invest over million in school leader mental health and wellbeing support be the truth not that retention be down recruitment be down and early retirement be up what be the minister go to do to boost the morale of teacher they say to would it be wonderful to have cabinet who have be through state sector education and send their child to state school think the hon gentleman need to do some research before he start ask question in parliament on recruitment and retention join he in stress the importance of retention which we be absolutely focused on include through our workload programme we have good set of scholarship and bursary for encourage entry and range of different route into teaching to get the full range of talent that can benefit our child and young people would my right hon friend agree that good and enthusiastic teacher be vital to ensure that we have good successful school and pupil what more can be do to assist school with discipline and truancy issue because it would obviously help teacher morale if they could have some more support my right hon friend be absolutely right about the importance of brilliant teacher think he might have some personal experience of that he be also right about the central importance of behaviour in relation to retention we hear back in survey that we need to improve far on this this be one of the reason that we have the network of behaviour hub so that school can learn one from another about what work well call the scottish national party spokesperson morale among teacher and support staff be affect by their pay and working condition and now the teacher be be threaten with minimum service level which would limit their fundamental right to strike surely the minister can recognise that this course of action will lower morale far and ultimately impact the recruitment and retention of teaching staff nobody be talk about take away the right to strike all that we be seek to do be balance that right which we absolutely recognise and protect with the right of child to have an education sen place essex what step she be take to increase the provision of special educational need place in essex be pleased to inform the house that two new special school open in essex last year with another in the pipeline we have also provide million of capital funding to essex over the last two year to create more place for child with special educational need or who require alternative provision last july stand here launch the campaign for new special need school in south essex in february this year work closely with essex county council which commend for its effort we be able to announce consultation to build brand new special need school in rayleigh for plus pupil through school for year to to open in the academic year it have go down very well locally but the one concern be that at the moment it be plus pupil and give the great demand for place lot of people would prefer something near be there any way perhaps with little help from the department that we might be able to achieve that too my right hon friend be run an excellent campaign and we be impressed with the speed with which essex have move to consultation can not pre empt the department decision but what we have hear so far suggest that very strong case will be put to the department we be also about to allocate the remain million of capital funding for special educational need school from which essex will of course benefit ofsted ratings what progress her department have make on ensure that more school achieve good and outstanding rating by ofsted under the last labour government only of school be rat good or outstanding let down generation of child thank to this conservative government that number now stand at nearly in the last year alone more child now attend good or outstanding school and be delighted that this now include the lord derby academy in knowsley which visit last week our plan to give every child world class education be work labour have no plan remember that it have twice stand on manifesto to abolish ofsted it be clear that every time labour get into power child education suffer nine out of of the school in my constituency be good or outstanding reflect this government commitment to high standard and the incredible hard work of the staff and the school leadership but special school have struggle to achieve the same in my constituency how be my right hon friend help they to get to where we want they to be where they can all be good or outstanding my right hon friend be absolutely right that basingstoke school have be transform over the past decade up from just rat good or outstanding under labour we have recently bring in two of our strong specialist multi academy trust to drive improvement in special school solent academies trust be now responsible for dove house school and chiltern way academy trust will shortly be take over three local underperforming special and alternative provision school two of which will receive significant capital investment from the department to support the education of vulnerable child apprenticeship levy trend what assessment she have make of trend in the number of level and apprenticeship start since the apprenticeship levy be introduce sixty five per cent of all apprenticeship start so far this year have be at level and with level remain the most popular level account for of all start over apprenticeship standard be at level and cover more than half of all apprenticeship can understand why the minister do not refer to the trend because he know that level apprenticeship be way down the government reform have see level apprenticeship start fall by two third since and the number of people employ on an apprenticeship with small and medium sized enterprise have fall by since the levy introduction the minister talk powerfully about apprenticeship but why do he think that young people be now half as likely to be on an sme apprenticeship than they be when the levy be introduce hugely respect the hon gentleman know he be bruiser but have be look forward to his question think he would celebrate the apprentice in chesterfield since may the apprentice at level and or the million investment in chesterfield report march vol correction if be he would be urge his party to stop its plan to destroy the apprenticeship levy which would halve the number of apprenticeship start overall it would be back to square one call the shadow minister it be not just that level and apprenticeship start have plummet by over since the levy be introduce but that to year old apprenticeship start be down by research by the sutton trust and the london school of economics far show that by the proportion of apprenticeship start by those from poor background have drop significantly opportunity for all our young people to earn and learn expand every year under labour be it not now painfully clear that the big barrier to opportunity be this tory government as always labour front benchers be obsess with quantity over quality we have transform the quality of apprenticeship seventy per cent of occupation be cover by over apprenticeship report march vol correction there have be increase since this time last year in the number of start and overall start be up by over the same period the crucial thing be achievement which be up by female stem start be up by start by people with disability be up by and start by people from ethnic minority be up to of start compare with in not only be we focus on quality over quantity we be improve the number of start and achievement too childcare provision what step she be take to increase childcare provision we be remove one of the big barrier for work parent by vastly increase the amount of free childcare that work family can access by we expect to spend more than billion every year on free hour in early education double what we be spend now to help work family with their childcare cost my constituent diane bennett who run small group of very popular local nursery tell how appreciative she be of the government plan for childcare and early education particularly the million of additional funding that have be secure clearly as she and other nursery provider look ahead she be concerned that although the government have clear plan there be no clear plan come from the opposition can my hon friend set her mind at rest my hon friend be right last week the chancellor announce that we will be increase rate until the end of for early year provider which be something they have ask for can not give my hon friend any reassurance about labour plan because it have no plan the shadow secretary of state say that childcare be her top priority yet she have no plan for it what do that say parent should be very worried about labour get into power both for the childcare on which they rely and for every other area of education family right across my constituency be find it increasingly hard to access affordable childcare locally from speak to two provider last week it be clear to that the current level and structure of free hour funding even with the government recent announcement be not go to go far enough to allow these provider to expand give the capacity and staffing cost that would entail what reassurance can the minister offer family in my area that finally the government be go to get on top of the childcare crisis we be face and make sure that family in my constituency will not have to go without we set our rate base on survey of more than provider in order to get those right last year we see increase in the number of staff in the sector and increase in the number of place we work with every local authority to make sure that they have sufficient place and be confident that the hon gentleman area will have that too gloucestershire county council care about our childcare business and listen to my call to make sure that monthly payment be go to childminder as we have hear the chancellor be put in another slug of million but local childminder be tell that thing such as the propose date of payment mean that they be still out of pocket and still can not pay their staff therefore all the work be not be feel on the ground will the minister meet gcc and to iron out some of these mechanical issue at local authority level so that everybody can benefit from what the government be do thank my hon friend for continue to champion this sector she be absolutely right about the importance of pay on monthly basis which we encourage all local authority to do we will be say more about that in the come week and will be happy to meet she to discuss this far the minister will be aware that private equity firm have be cause great damage in other part of the education sector such as child home and special school but we be now start to see this in childcare oakley capital have acquire lilliput nursery in hersham and elmbridge and have hike up price by staggering that be an additional per child per month which parent simply can not afford do he agree that it be quite wrong for private equity firm to be make these eye water profit on the back of hard work parent what be he go to do to stop this happening the hon lady be right to raise the issue of profiteer that we have see in some area of child care and social care we will be set out some step that we will be take on that shortly do not know the specific of the case she have just reference but again if she write to will be happy to look at it skelton primary school cleveland what progress her department have make on rebuild skelton primary school in cleveland skelton primary school be announce in the second round of the school rebuilding programme in july it be the second school in batch be deliver by the contractor tilbury douglas we therefore expect construction

this with they far acknowledge all that my right hon friend say can reassure he that the scope of work include all funding commit have be confirm on this new build however of course if it would be helpful to have meeting would be happy to do this degree level apprenticeship take up what step her department be take to encourage take up of degree level apprenticeship note that the labour front benchers do not mention the start on degree apprenticeship since their introduction in there be now more than employer design degree level apprenticeship available include in occupation such as doctor

which reach over school and college in vandyke upper school in leighton buzzard which visit last week tell every student about apprenticeship and have an excellent apprenticeship ambassador as the minister will know sadly not every school do this most teacher have be to university and they may not know about apprenticeship so what can we do to ensure that every school tell every student about

invest hundred of million of pound to increase hourly funding rate and the amount of dedicated additional send funding such as the disability access fund for all eligible child and fund the training of early year special educational need co ordinator to the surprise of no one who look at what the government be propose my inbox like those of many other mp be full of email from parent who can not get the free hour in april without pay for massive hike in their fee one group in particular that be struggle be parent of child with special educational need or disability that be entirely predictable because the government own impact assessment say explicitly that change the ratio could have negative impact on the provision of place for child with special educational need the minister stand at the dispatch box on january and pledge to that every parent who want the free hour for their eligible two year old would be able to get place can he restate that pledge today explicitly for parent of child who have special educational need and pledge that they will not have to pay high fee yes or no appreciate that it must be very frustrating for the hon lady who genuinely care about childcare to be in party that can not be bother to come up with plan for it and have have to ask someone else to write it one because it can not think of one on her specific issue as say we be work with every local authority to ensure that they have the place that they need for all child autism initial teacher train whether her department be take step to ensure that initial teacher training course include early identification of autism the department for education recently review the mandatory initial teacher train core content framework alongside the early career framework particular attention be give to the need of trainee and early career teacher when support pupil with special educational need that be very useful response for which be very grateful recently bring my ten minute rule bill to the house which be specifically about mandate autism training in the initial teacher training framework because we all know that early identification be vital if education staff all have autism training right from the start we could put in place system so that autistic child receive support very early on in their school career will the minister assure of the step that he have take to include autism training specifically in initial teacher training and meet again to discuss support my ten minute rule bill my hon friend be run strong campaign from september initial teacher training and the early career framework will contain significantly more content on support pupil with special educational need include autistic pupil we have commit million to the universal send services programme which have so far give training to more than professional regard autism awareness but be happy to meet my hon friend again topical questions if she will make statement on her departmental responsibility we be deliver the large ever expansion of childcare in england history which begin roll out in just three week time from april we do it before when we more than double the entitlement there have be under the previous labour government and be delighted to update the house that our late projection show that more than new fund place will be secure by early april we expect that number to grow in the month ahead save parent more than million in childcare cost april be just the first phase from september parent with child from the age of nine month until they start school will be able to benefit from that support only the conservatives have plan that hard work parent can rely on as they grow their family labour have no plan so why do it not support our to give family the certainty they deserve recently visit fairfield spencer academy in my broxtowe constituency where meet craig jones who be do good work with the junior adventures group lead provider of school age childcare during my visit observe staff provide crucial support to child beyond regular school hour however it be evident that that level of support be not consistent around the country and that fund for the school age childcare sector need reform welcome the million for the wraparound care sector but will my right hon friend the secretary of state commit to introduce universal funding model link to parent earning similar to that for the early year to ensure provider remain affordable and sustainable we be make wraparound childcare available for all parent who need it and we be support hard work parent to balance have family and successful career our million investment will help school develop exciting programme before and after school which will provide more flexibility for work parent be sure the minister for children families and wellbeing my hon friend the member for wantage david johnston will be happy to meet my hon friend to keep he update on progress neither the secretary of state nor any treasury minister meet representative of the early year sector in the month before last year budget announcement on childcare now with just three week to go parent provider and even the government own civil servant be sound the alarm more than seven in provider say they will not offer additional place and quarter say they be likely to close within year will the secretary of state now guarantee that all parent will be able to access the childcare place that she promise absolutely set that out in my topical statement we be work with every local authority to ensure the place be available be glad the hon lady mention childcare because it be yet another policy area that the labour party have no plan for we be deliver the large expansion of childcare in history so that work parent of child from the age of nine month to the start of school will get hour of childcare week the real question be what be labour plan nobody know because it do not have one it be clear that the conservatives be the only party with plan for work parent there be one way we can find out what the public think call general election last week we hear another promise from the chancellor for new funding mechanism for early year provider there be talk of hundred of million of pound more for the sector but strangely no news about where the promise million will actually come from there be nothing at all in the budget document will the secretary of state tell we today where the money be come from or be this yet another reckless unfunded pledge without plan from the conservatives there would be no childcare on the table if the labour party be in charge so urge all work parent to support the conservative party which have plan for they like everything we do the million will be fully fund it secure the rate in the future so that businesse up and down the country have the confidence to invest the labour party have absolutely no plan for childcare and for support work parent in this country my right hon friend the secretary of state have rightly champion childcare and early education congratulate she on the million in this year budget on top of the billion commit last year to the sector indicate dissent it be in the red book be happy to meet the hon lady to show she where it be urge the secretary of state to keep press on some of the education committee other recommendation include on extend family hub remove rate and vat from childcare provider and reform tax free childcare to drive take up this conservative government be back this country brilliant childcare provider as we roll out our historic childcare offer as my hon friend have point out that be on top of the roll out of universal service in family hub to give certainty to the early year sector we have confirm that average funding rate will increase over the next two financial year as he state the detail be in the red book give they the confidence to invest and expand only the conservatives have plan for hard work parent call the snp spokesman academic independence be central to function democracy so in light of the false accusation level at an academic on the board of uk research and innovation by

seniority and that do have well ring to it mean the hon member for huddersfield seniority in this place uk armed forces urgent question to ask the secretary of state for defence to make statement on the state of the uk armed force it be an honour to set out how our outstanding armed force be do incredible work around the world protect the uk and our ally that include operate on every single nato mission support ukraine against putin aggression and tackle houthi attack on shipping in the red sea we be spend record amount on defence that include an extra billion in cash term between and which be the large sustained increase since the end of the cold war the government fully recognise the grow security threat which be why we have set out our long term aspiration to invest of gdp on defence when fiscal and economic circumstance allow we be already spend more than of gdp on defence exceed our nato target we be deliver the capability that our force need significantly increase spending on defence equipment to billion over the next decade and introduce new procurement model to improve acquisition for the royal navy that include dreadnought astute and aukus submarine as well as fleet solid support ship type and type frigate for the army future soldier will deliver the large transformation in more than year re equip and re organise to be more deployable and lethal the raf will

today our defence command paper set out our plan to deliver credible war fighting force generate and employ to protect the nation and help it prosper now and in the year to come we will embody fully integrate approach to deterrence and defence include across all domain and across government by exploit all lever of state power and with ally and partner pay tribute to hms richmond action over the weekend defend shipping in the red sea against large scale houthi attack those be the demand that our armed force face as threat increase the defence secretary owe the public and parliament an explanation he say that we be move into pre war world and ahead of last week budget he write to the chancellor and state that we must take bold action in your budget to commit to defence spending increase to in it would re establish our leadership in europe but there be grow gap between the defence secretary rhetoric and the reality for our armed force who be charge with prepare for this new dangerous era in the budget there be no new money for defence nothing new for ukraine and nothing for gaza or the uk operation in the middle east bad both the treasury and the house of commons library confirm that the defence budget will be cut by billion in cash term in this next financial year the of gdp which the minister refer to be not mention once in the treasury red book the last time this country spend of gdp on defence be in under labour government while putin wag war in europe ministers be war with each other challenging defence policy in public the minister for security be on tv this morning call for now that be serious breakdown in collective ministerial responsibility but be most concerned about the serious state of the uk armed force what signal do it send to our adversary when our force have be hollow out and underfunde for the last year when the public accounts committee find the large ever fund deficit in the mod equipment plan when the british army have be cut to its small size since napoleon when force recruitment target have be miss each and every year for year and when satisfaction with service life have hit record low have one simple question for the minister where be the plan for well defend britain it be clear that our armed force can not afford another five year of conservative government be grateful to the right hon gentleman for his comment about hms richmond be sure that we all agree and pay tribute to our royal navy personnel who be there ultimately to defend not only themselves but freedom of navigation for the rest of the world we should recognise the importance of the role that they be undertake on behalf of our government the right hon gentleman talk about the funding for next year to be clear that will represent increase in real term and not the cut that he suggest if we spend the money that we expect it will amount to billion about of gdp which be traditionally how we measure our spending that be significantly above the just under in so it be significant increase as percentage of gdp the right hon gentleman also talk about recruitment which be an important issue my right hon friend the minister for defence people and families be do lot of work on that and as the right hon gentleman will be aware in january we see the high number of application to the army in six year more positive picture be develop recognise the importance of the mission we should not talk down our armed force when we expect people to apply and to want to be recruit into they note the range of comment about the and want to make several point the first be that the right hon gentleman say that we have not spend that percentage since labour be in power well something extraordinary happen at the end of their time in power they crash the economy we have full on banking crisis and letter be leave for our government say there be no money it be no surprise that we have to take difficult decision but despite that we have show our commitment to the armed force when he be chancellor of the exchequer the prime minister approve the large ever increase in defence spending since the cold war and there have be further money since then in the budget of course we be commit to when the circumstance allow for all the right hon gentleman bluster he have not even commit to match our current spending on defence let alone we challenge he on that at defence oral and he be not able to give any commitment whatever to spending the public know where we stand in the year ahead and when the economic allow we do not have clue where labour stand agree with the minister that we have extraordinarily capable armed force whose productivity be second to none however as be set out in ready for war our defence committee report they be extremely engaged globally and have great deal to do much of which be invaluable at the same time they be have to prepare for the pre war phase to which the defence secretary refer in that context do my hon friend agree that the timing of the target that be very welcome and very good first step need to be determine by the level of threat as priority expenditure rather than as economic condition allow do not think that we can commit to level of public expenditure or tax cut for example without be confident that the economy can support they in prudent fashion an entirely reasonable and rational approach however totally agree with my right hon friend the chair of the defence committee we all recognise that we be live in more dangerous world the secretary of state have allude to the threat we face not just in ukraine but in respect of other adversary around the world and totally understand why there be the wide debate on what we spend but we already have significant budget and we must ensure that it be spend well and deliver value for money that be why key priority for be reform of our procurement system so that we can ensure that our armed force can prioritise effectively ultimately it be the capability that we have now that will determine our ability to warfight call the snp spokesman congratulate the shadow defence secretary on secure the urgent question and join he and the minister in remember those on hms richmond on friday the public accounts committee find that the mod be increasingly reliant on the uk ally to protect our national interest nato membership deter hostility but the report warn such deterrence can only be effective if our armed forces be credible to paraphrase the report give that many of our ally face similar capability challenge be the ministry of defence develop mitigation for deal with the risk of allied support be curtail or withdraw if critically there be change of administration in washington come november to be fair to the hon gentleman he make an important point about the importance of alliance nato be fundamental to the defence of our country the wide western world and our ally beyond critically to put this in context when we talk about the state of the armed force which be what the urgent question be about and the alliance that he refer to let we remember that we have just launch steadfast defender which be one of the large ever nato exercise involve personnel of which almost be from the uk believe that we make up of the land force that be an extraordinary contribution by the uk we also offer our nuclear deterrent to nato we be support our ally we stand together under article and we should all do everything possible to support nato in its year may commend to anyone interested in the historical context report produce by the defence committee in july in call shift the goalposts defence expenditure and the pledge an update hc it show that for the last year of the cold war this country spend between and of gdp calculate in the same way we do today on defence do that not show both side of the house that we have an awful long way to go now that there be hot war in europe before we match what we use to do when there be cold war in europe my right hon friend put that eloquently and he speak with great passion and expertise on the cold war and our recent history as he know in the cold war era we have the working assumption that an invasion or certainly confrontation could be launch on the border in germany very quickly we have huge number of force deploy and give that threat we spend understandably high percentage of gdp on defence since then we think we have more peaceful era those illusion have be shatter by putin and we have all have to wake up to that that be why we have do so much to support ukraine and yes why we will do everything possible to support our armed force the secretary of state say he want to ensure that our entire defence ecosystem be ready to defend but here be the reality of our armed force under this government capability delay and shortfall stockpile shortage lose personnel woeful recruitment level billion black hole in finance and as of last week no real boost to the mod budget the secretary of state be fail be he when the hon lady talk about procurement and delay would have think she could at least recognise the support we have give to ukraine where we have procure an extraordinary amount of ordnance into the country to help ukrainians to defend themselves much of that have be at great pace not least from gift for example our whole range of munition and artillery shell have it not be this country role think we can safely say that russia would have be successful whether it be covid the war in ukraine or the middle east it be clear that our world be become more dangerous not less many of we in the house have be call for increase defence spending and for recognition of the symbiotic relationship between our economy and security that have be illustrate by what have be go on in the red sea that be why we need to spend more but how might we spend it will the minister consider defence review because ukraine continue to illustrate how the character of conflict be change on that note will he agree that the big international security threat be russia as it move to war footing we have do well to slide across billion of support but unless more be do the tide will turn in ukraine and that will change the economy and security of the whole continent my right hon friend as ever make some excellent point he be right to mention how we spend the money it be one thing to talk about gdp figure and spend but what be our priority as procurement minister and as set out in my recent statement on the integrate procurement model want much great use of datum particularly from the frontline in ukraine to inform our own defence industry so that we can bring forward at much great pace those technological innovation whether in uncrewed system or complex weapon that will truly help strengthen our defence as for review he will appreciate that be matter for the prime minister and the secretary of state for defence but he make an excellent point we have the small army since the napoleonic era so can press the minister on this be cut of billion in cash term announce in the budget last week hear this point about napoleon many time if it be the labour party position to significantly increase the size of the stand army that be massive financial commitment the hon gentleman need to have word with the shadow defence secretary and the shadow chancellor because as yet they have not once commit to current spending level let alone when the economic condition allow strongly support my hon friend powerful commitment to defence in general but be rather disappointed by his tepid promise about move to of gdp also find myself in the career wreck position of strongly agree with the shadow secretary of state for defence who put the argument extremely well the fact of the matter be that last week budget reduce both kind of defence expenditure by billion and we be not face any kind of move towards which no less figure than the former secretary of state for defence my right hon friend the member for wyre and preston north mr wallace publicly call for last week two serve ministers have say how disappointed they be by the budget by what possible arithmetic do the minister conclude we be in fact increase defence spending when every expert in the world say that we patently be not be grateful to my hon friend who always speak with such expertise on defence matter first on be tepid we have to be able to sustain that if it be one off the army the navy and the air force would not be able to plan accordingly it have to be an investment that we can sustain and thereby the economy of the country have to be able to sustain it forgive for sound like be still in my previous job at the treasury but the country have to be able to afford it and we need to be prudent in the commitment we make on public expenditure not least so that they be sustainable in the long term and not one off which would be the bad thing we could do the minister keep say we should not talk down our armed force but we be not the armed force be do splendid brilliant job what we be do be run down what the government be do which be not enough let we put it that way we have the great threat since the cold war we have war in ukraine the middle east in disarray and china increase its spending the real blame for the situation with defence lie with the prime minister and the chancellor do the minister think in these circumstance that most reasonable people would have think it okay not to put extra resource in the budget for defence when the prime minister be chancellor he oversee the big increase in spending since the cold war the current chancellor significantly increase defence spending in the previous budget for the year ahead we be not cut defence spending as say if the hon gentleman take the figure in totality it will rise by in real term if we spend what we expect to next year we will spend of gdp on defence around billion may make suggestion to my hon friend it be perfectly clear that the mod want to increase defence spending as do the opposition spokesperson the right hon member for wentworth and dearne john healey if we be to take his criticism at all seriously be the right question to ask whether we be spend enough to prevent war not to fight war how much more do we need to spend to be an effective deterrent which we do not appear to be at the moment as say it be important that we engage in the key capability question it be one thing to talk about spend more but what capability would we purchase and where be our shortcoming it must be new development at the heart of defence to have constant feedback loop of datum on integrate warfighting and what be happen in ukraine with the armed service and with industry so that we know what capability will make the difference to give one example we have see the extraordinary impact of uncrewed weapon in ukraine we have make assumption about technology in our equipment plan which be probably far more expensive than those option we need to look at this from warfighting point of view to support deterrence the important thing be to back our armed force that be why we have our spending commitment but it have to be balance against the ability of the economy to support it and sustain it in the long term the times recently illustrate that the british army will shrink in size to within the next two year due to the current recruitment and retention crisis our senior and close ally include the us have express their grave concern and even senior conservative have concede that our armed force have be hollow out since as threat to the uk increase why have the government shrunk our army to its small size since napoleon the hon gentleman talk about crisis in recruitment but as say january see the high number of application to join the army for six year that be an important and positive development on the size of the armed force we should talk about not just the number of soldier but the amount of accommodation to support they and the platform the weapon and the capability that be an extremely expensive undertaking if the hon gentleman think that that be the right thing to do he need to lobby his colleague on his own front bench because they have not commit to spend of gdp on defence let alone as former armed forces minister pay high tribute to his majesty armed force but not to his majesty treasury the red book the budget bible show clearly in table and that next year core defence budget have be cut by billion that be true it ill behove any government let alone one that purport to call themselves conservative to use one off payment to ukraine or overspend in the nuclear budget from the consolidated fund and pretend that they be part of the defence budget when everyone in this house know that they be not as the son of day veteran say to the government if not to the minister for whom have great regard more in anger than in sorrow that what they have do be deeply dishonourable and they should be ashamed of themselves my right hon friend be defence minister and respect his great passion about all thing relate to the armed force particularly because of his father when we spend on the nuclear deterrent or on support ukraine purchase weapon and provide ordnance ultimately to help defend ourselves that be legitimately describe as defence expenditure after all how else be we to pay for that and from which budget compare with last year there be real term increase of which if we spend what we expect will amount to billion and of gdp many citizen will be rightly concerned about the use of the phrase pre war world what require clarification be not simply the scale of the british military in year to come but where the armed force be currently deploy and what they be do be british serviceman fire weaponry in ukraine as suggest by german ministerial source be british force assist israel in its genocide through the provision of military intelligence know the answer to those question be fundamental to our security and indeed to our know whether the uk be uphold international law never mind it be basic democratic right and something that our citizen be entitle to know the hon gentleman know that we do not comment on speculation particularly on sensitive operational matter relate to the armed force and that be the right approach yes we have duty of candour but we also have to protect those serve on the frontline the fighting in ukraine prove that size matter the minister should reconstitute the territorial army which demonstrate that with economy quantity have quality all of its own my right hon friend have quality all of his own as show in how he put his question he make very good point we tend to talk about the regular army but we must remember our reserve they be incredibly important and we pay tribute to they ukraine have show that this country be able to make an extraordinary contribution this be speculate but it be likely that if it have not be for the contribution we make ukraine would not have be successful in repel the russians as far as it have do so there we have it president putin will be order his officer to stop sabre rattle with the west because the british be change their procurement rule the reality be that the minister can not fight the war he want to fight with the capability he have he will be present with the conflict that develop and we need the capability and resilience to meet threat that emerge what assessment have he make of the threat to the united kingdom and how will he meet those threat with the armed force he have the hon gentleman rather trite comment on procurement be total failure to understand how the military work he want to talk about the deterrent everything from our nuclear submarine right down to small arm be part of the procurement system they all have to be procure my priority be ensure that we have procurement system that be agile get equipment to the frontline as fast as possible and can engage with the late technological development think of laser and uncrewed system technology be move at an extraordinary pace we have use technology to support ukraine so far we have provide drone and will increase our support to around we be do everything possible to support ukraine all that be do through the procurement system if may say so highly effectively join my hon friend in commend the professionalism of our armed force and in point out that labour have not commit to an increase in defence spending but may remind he that the first duty of any government be to ensure that defence spending primarily reflect the threat rather than the ability to pay we have war in europe we have an increasingly belligerent russia chair the defence committee of the committee conservative back benchers be very much behind the idea that we need to increase defence spending what do the minister think it will take to increase defence spending first of all we have increase defence spending crucially the last spending review see the large allocation of spending to defence since the cold war yes we have set an aspiration of and the answer to when that will happen be when economic condition allow it would be imprudent to commit to such level of spending if we do not think it could be sustain the bad thing would be to have that spending for maybe one or two year and then have to go backwards because we do not think it be sustainable this be about balance affordability against commitment but we need to be absolutely clear that at over billion this be the most we have ever spend on defence there be an extraordinary effort in support of ukraine and we have highly capable armed force who be make an extraordinary contribution to nato include through the late nato exercise and will continue to do so do not want to make too much play of your early remark madam deputy speaker but be bear on the night the house be bomb and this chamber be burn out as have listen to the minister have be say to myself hope that he will recall this that he represent the party of winston churchill and margaret thatcher but now that the world be more dangerous than can recall it be in all my year we be not able to defend the country adequately say to member on both side of the house that this be wake up call we must act now pay respect to the hon gentleman longevity and seniority and to the fact that on the day he be bear the house be bomb during whichever war it be think it be the second world war he say that we be unable to defend ourselves and totally and utterly reject that claim if putin have succeed in his invasion of ukraine yes we would have be look at situation similar to that in the late but that invasion have not succeed the reason for that be the involvement of this government who take extraordinary step to train ukrainians provide vital munition such as next generation light anti tank weapon before the war start ensure that we be the first country to provide tank and encourage other nation to provide enormous amount of arm without that the world would be an even less safe place but accept that it be become more dangerous which be why we be support our armed force and why we be play such massive role in nato steadfast defender exercise the hon member for huddersfield mr sheerman refer to member on both side of the house be there not clear distinction between member on either side of the house namely that from the prime minister and the chancellor downward there be commitment and an agreement to defence spending amount to of gdp while in stark contrast labour members while suggest that they be government in wait be not prepared to commit themselves to or even to our current spending commitment there be unity on the conservative side and complete disunity on the other in my hon friend constituency which have the pleasure of visit recently there be many defence interest and he have hit the nail on the head we have hear all the theatric but the fact be that we have not clue what the opposition will spend on defence labour members have not even confirm that they will spend the exist let alone the conflict in ukraine be stark reminder of why we must take our defence incredibly seriously the minister have just say that the world be become more dangerous place do he therefore agree that his government decision to cut our uk troop to be irresponsible and will he commit himself to reverse those cut and ensure that the british army be the requisite size to defend the united kingdom and its ally as have say we have just commit of the land force personnel to the steadfast defender exercise nato be the key to the defence of this nation and indeed the whole continent in conventional term we should recognise the enormous contribution of our armed force and the fact that we have increase spending significantly however hear what colleague be say as do the secretary of state we have set out the case for but we want that to be sustainable so that the economy can afford it over the long term and that will be possible through growth and sensible measure on fiscal policy the minister concede early that funding for ukraine and the escalate nuclear cost be at the expense of restore the viability of our frontline readiness but deterrence be lot cheap than war surely our support for ukraine and the deterrent should be charge on the general fund rather than far hollow out our conventional armed force do not believe make that point about nuclear the right hon gentleman have say that these factor be at the expense of the frontline but nuclear be the frontline we have have the continuous at sea deterrent patrolling in defence of this country every year since as recall we have have it for long time and it be fundamental to our defence the idea that that be not frontline spending be extraordinary look at the figure for resource and capital departmental expenditure limit it look like there be billion cut for this coming year the office for budget responsibility say that defence spending will be flat as share of gdp with russia expenditure on its military at of its total economy why do the secretary of state accept the reduction from the chancellor and the prime minister have explain why we do not believe that there have be reduction we believe that there will be increase in real term the hon gentleman say that spending as percentage of gdp be flat point out that in it be under we believe that if we spend everything we expect to in the next financial year that will be which be significant increase be sure that the procurement minister be aware of survitec in my constituency which have provide equipment to the armed force for decade he will acknowledge that the last few year have teach we the importance of have secure uk supply chain and of get good job to the whole country through the power of procurement invite he to come and speak to survitec so that he can hear directly from the company about its frustration with the procurement process before be injure play football for parliament versus the army always use to enjoy play five side with the hon gentleman would be delighted to accept his invitation to visit because small and medium sized enterprise and business be absolutely critical as the minister for defence procurement and have run an sme believe that we have to have an environment that encourage investment in defence and support our domestic supply chain key part of that be exportability look forward to discuss these matter with the company that he mention the shocking state of army accommodation be big driver of the recruitment and retention challenge that we face so it will not come as surprise to hear that be yet again raise the issue of the shocking standard of accommodation at the chicksands base when catch up with serve personnel over pint or two at our local pub in shefford there be grow sense of resignation about the future of the base but there be real concern that its plan closure will mean that the situation go unadjusted and that really poor accommodation unit be not improve to do right by those personnel will the minister commit to revisit the government decision not to upgrade either of the two service basis in my constituency where hundred of bed fall into grade or we engage with this issue in the hon gentleman westminster hall debate on accommodation in which announce our plan for chicksand entirely accept that this be matter on which there should be engagement with the local community and that there will be range of view emphasise that we have put an extra million into accommodation which have allow we to deliver our winter plan highly effectively there have be massive increase in the number of property in the defence estate benefit from damp and mould package but also from new door and so on to deal with long stand issue in the estate and be keen to do more finally call jim shannon thank the minister for his answer to the question pose to he there can be no doubt that the government must do more to increase defence spending give that large portion of our defence budget have rightly be spend on assist ukraine however we must ensure that other issue be not leave behind unfortunately there be no mention in last week budget of an additional funding increase for our armed force will the minister increase our defence budget so that we can ensure that our action speak louder than word and so that promise be keep and our armed force can keep we safe as ever we have save the good till last think the hon gentleman have attend every urgent question or statement have ever be involve in and pay tribute to he for that and for the way that he represent his constituent in northern ireland particularly those who serve in the armed force they have always be huge part of our british military story have always pay tribute to they and the industry for example thales for their contribution last week have the pleasure of meet representative of brilliant sme from northern ireland that be support the royal air force have be clear that we have the large increase in defence spending since the cold war at the last spending review far funding in the budget thereafter and commitment to spend of gdp when the economy can support that gibraltar uk eu negotiations urgent question will the minister make statement on uk negotiation with the eu in respect of gibraltar the minister for europe the under secretary of state

government have agree cross their own negotiate red line as first set out to my committee in september this risk set dangerous precedent for the uk overseas territory and crown dependency allow foreign power to set the rule of our engagement and diminish the constitutionally entrust role that the uk play there be limited avenue for the people of gibraltar to hold the uk government to account and give the government apparent eagerness to agree legal text be concerned that what have be announce will not allow those who hold blue residency card to cross into spain relatively unhindered as they have do in the past schengen border control on gibraltar soil could mean that blue card holder become subject to the eu day rule and soon the eu entry exit system there be some serious question on sovereignty and defence will the government rule out agree to schengen border check on gibraltar soil cede uk control of gibraltar airport and align with eu rule what be the government do to ensure

believe in the right of the people of gibraltar to choose their own future as they have make clear and this must be the bedrock of any negotiation with spain which be equally close friend and ally of the uk it be also critical partner in nato and in many other respect so we hope and believe that an agreement can be reach to the mutual benefit of gibraltar spain the uk and the eu these negotiation

clarity and stability they need have few short question can the minister explain in little more detail where the negotiation be on some of the key issue in relation to the movement of good law enforcement and citizen right secondly can he give we little more detail on the europe minister visit to gibraltar today and indeed on any recent discussion he have have with spain and the eu on outstanding matter it would be helpful if the europe minister make statement on his return from gibraltar finally what support be the government give to gibraltar on nno contingency planning however

in the letter send to my hon friend the member for stone sir william cash the uk government and gibraltar have never work more closely together that be entirely right give the seriousness of and where we be in the negotiating process be delighted to hear the cross party outbreak of support for nation choose their own future as that be unusual in this place in recent year the uk have manage to trash its international reputation will the minister let we know how much brexit have cost gibraltar so far will he promise this house that the government will this time stick to their agreement the statement they make to the committee chair by the hon member for stone and those position that they hold and negotiate in the interest of the people of gibraltar and not in those of ideological power trip we continue to work hard in these negotiation as say we be work in good faith and to uphold sovereignty and to work towards future prosperity which be vital for the people of gibraltar and for the region more widely we be optimistic about those prospect but we be plan for all scenario will the minister assure this house that the uk government will not agree to any treaty that compromise uk sovereignty and will remain steadfast in their support for gibraltar there be large jewish community in gibraltar and significant antisemitism from the spanish government which have lead to recall of diplomatic personnel only three month ago do he agree that it be important that in our negotiation with the eu and anyone else the sovereignty of all of the people of gibraltar be respect absolutely agree that we need to respect that sovereignty stand shoulder to shoulder with my right hon and learn friend in say that antisemitism have no place in our society draw the house attention to my entry in the register of members financial interests agree with the minister that we can not compromise on the sovereignty issue that gibraltarians hold so close to their heart he be right to point out the practical and technical option in respect of the airport which also serve as raf gibraltar but will he outline more about the option he be think about the point make about practical and technical option be in relation to facilitate flight between gibraltar and the eu more widely the uk will only agree to term that the government of gibraltar be content with and will not agree to anything that

level playing field and the concept of an alignment of trade economic right and standard encompass that level playing field for the avoidance of doubt will he clarify that there be no conflict between support sovereignty and support alignment that might have lesson for other negotiation come forward in this field level play field provision be normal element of trade agreement with the eu or anyone else in line with what the uk agree with the eu under the trade and co operation agreement commitment should be bilateral and reciprocal not base on the rule of either party by my reckoning my hon friend have say no few than five time that the british government will not agree to anything that compromise british sovereignty however it be clear from the letter from the minister for europe my hon friend the member for aldershot leo docherty that traveller arrive in gibraltar will have to pass through schengen immigration arrangement how can it be the case that british traveller arrive in british territory will have to deliver their passport for inspection to foreign border official and that not be incompatible with british sovereignty we be seek mobility arrangement with the schengen area to facilitate flow at the gibraltar spain border the arrangement would remove check from the gibraltar spain border instead those arrive in gibraltar would pass through gibraltar immigration follow by schengen immigration interruption the exact detail of arrangement form part of the ongoing negotiation in line with the december political framework as default those travel to gibraltar would undergo both gibraltar immigration control and schengen entry check during my visit to gibraltar include recently with the excellent armed force parliamentary scheme appreciate not merely that gibraltar be an incredible place but also the firm commitment of gibraltarians to uphold their sovereignty what assessment have the minister make of the ongoing impact of the uncertainty on the economy of the rock what step be be take to catalyse growth in the region that be why we be take forward these negotiation which be about future prosperity and protect sovereignty that be fundamental and the government in gibraltar be keen to work with we on that they have say that they be work in good faith and feel that our relationship be strong than ever as the house will be aware goole be twin with gibraltar the minister look shocked be sure he realise that it be match make in heaven be in gibraltar on friday visit the parliament and meet the mayor carmen gomez the very clear message send to on this issue be the importance of resolution not least because of the large number of spanish worker who make their living in gibraltar that be point worth emphasise in the negotiation will the minister confirm that any arrangement will not make any difference to the right of british national to live and work in gibraltar do not know why look shocked because it be pretty obvious from my hon friend hard work that where goole lead the rest of the uk follow as say we be work hard on the border issue at the airport and more widely the aim be to reduce the friction that will take place thank the minister for his answer and the clear commitment that he have give we have always have great relationship with gibraltar be big supporter of that as be other in the chamber it be so important that our relationship be maintain with strength and pride as we be able to work well together with the minister ensure that all effort be make to continue our much value relationship with gibraltar and that we do all that we can to support it as british overseas territory with the same right as everywhere else recognise the hon gentleman commitment to gibraltar and that of most people in the chamber huge amount of work be do not least by mr speaker to foster the relationship which we be very proud of the hon gentleman can be assure that we will continue work in that way the good feedback that we receive today from the chief minister be that the government of gibraltar believe that they have good work relationship with we probably the good that we have have we will continue to work together in their interest on that basis what be my hon friend assessment of the joint declaration sign with the british overseas territory do it provide in his view the right basis to work with they more closely in future include gibraltar give the threat face by britain and her ally around the world do he agree that our overseas territory be more important than ever completely agree on the latter point no question the joint declaration set out more modern framework for our relationship with the overseas territory we will set out strategy for the overseas territory with the overseas territory over the month ahead then we will move on to partnership compact we need more modern relationship where the accountability be clear not just between the foreign commonwealth and development office and the overseas territory but across the whole width of whitehall member on both side of the house want to see that it be entirely appropriate in the world that we work in today have spend two and half year engage with gibraltar in the department for exit the european union and chair the joint ministerial council for the overseas territory in that process be very glad to hear the minister confirm that minister be in gibraltar talk to the chief minister directly do he agree that as well as reiterate our position on sovereignty it be important that we show respect for the view of the people of gibraltar both in their determination to remain british and in elect their own government we must continue as the chief minister say to work hand in glove with the chief minister and the government of gibraltar understood give his experience my hon friend know that these matter be very important very technical and have take time we absolutely need to work hand in glove and shoulder to shoulder with our friend in gibraltar to make further progress as we seem to be right now although we prepare for all eventuality listen carefully to what the minister say but fear that there be still many question to be answer around sovereignty which be ably raise by my hon friend the member for stone sir william cash and my right hon friend the member for clwyd west mr jones particularly regard what it mean for blue card holder on the rock when the agreement be make between the government will the minister ensure that the european scrutiny committee and the whole house have chance to scrutinise that agreement fully so that we can come to conclusion ourselves on those question one of the principal objective of the treaty be to provide for the fluid movement of all people in gibraltar across the border with spain and of course there will be scrutiny the chief minister say that he would be very willing to appear in front of the european scrutiny committee as will the minister for europe in the near future mortgage switch motion for leave to bring in bill standing order no beg to move that leave be give to bring in bill to make provision for the purpose of enable certain mortgage borrower to switch to new mortgage arrangement and for connected purpose let take this opportunity to thank the uk mortgage prisoners campaign group which have assist in bring this bill to the floor of the house specifically rachel neale and jill hulme who be in the special gallery be very grateful to they and to their team an estimated people across the uk include scot be deem to be mortgage prisoner think to be at risk of lose their home many have be stick on high street rate since the financial crisis of and have be unable to switch due to toughen borrowing criterion in january during session of prime minister question the prime minister assure that the uk government be aware of the difficult situation face mortgage prisoner and would be take action yet last week the chancellor fail to introduce measure to tackle the issue it be scandalous that yet again the spring budget have ignore the plight of ten of thousand of individual and family unfairly trap on crippling mortgage rate as the uk government sit on their hand have make billion from the sale of closed mortgage book mortgage prisoner face lose their home through no fault of their own one have to beg the question of this unfettered capitalism how many people have be make homeless since the financial crash and indeed how many have lose their life the bill that be introduce to parliament today aim to finally end the unfair year financial injustice and address the failure of successive conservative and labour governments let we not forget that for well over decade the uk government be the ultimate holder of the mortgage through uk asset resolution can imagine think that no government would do anything deliberately to harm the hundred of thousand of uk resident in that position and that sensible resolution would eventually be find sadly it be not purgatory before thing get well indeed they be to get bad in ukar sell tranche of book include some of my constituent mortgage to company call heliodor mortgages which have mention previously my constituent have never hear of it and with good reason it be not an entity that or anyone else in this house could borrow from it be vehicle that exist to service the exist northern rock mortgage although heliodor do operate in regulated market its ultimate owner topaz finance be not regulated entity and rely on third party administrator who be regulate by the financial conduct authority in order to comply with its regulation significantly as london school of economics report by kath scanlon et al point out the setting of standard variable rate mortgage be not regulated activity mean that business opportunity for morally ambivalent vulture fund such as topaz have be create and people our constituent be offer up as host for parasite despite never have fall behind on their payment our constituent find themselves subject to host of fee and other spurious admin charge incredibly the amount that some of my constituent owe rise by almost in couple of year with no additional lending offer they be push into negative equity as the amount they owe heliodor become great than the value of their property the cruell part of this sorry tale of modern britain be this one of my constituent be approach the end of the year term of their mortgage but as they be force into the interest only plan just few short year after they begin to make repayment they now risk lose the family home of quarter of century unless they can come up with the full amount owe to heliodor the aspect find most gall be the inversion of the principle of home ownership whereby people have end up pay what be essentially rent to vulture fund which almost certainly know it will be able to acquire the property at the end of the term topaz finance will have be lick its lip be sure at deal that basically guarantee that it will be pay twice first through the monthly payment that my constituent have be make and secondly when it sell their home from under they in at healthy profit over what it pick the property up for in the long tail of the era of neoliberal economic be still pernicious because there be confusion between concept such as taxpayer value and what any of we would think they actually mean to people like taxpayer value be not find in pauperise hundred of thousand of household nor be it to be find in scrap back every single penny that taxpayer see spend on ensure that the economy do not collapse overnight to this old fashioned social democrat government be not bank with shareholder that need to see the principal of its loan pay back in full it be an institution that be able to intervene in the economy at strategic moment that be an idea that think be slowly come back into fashion but wonder how many of our national asset have find their way into the paw of that type of offshore capital in the intervene year leave taxpayer with all of the cost none of the benefit and absolutely hee haw value that be why this bill be essential not only to hold this government to account but to shine light on the fiscal approach of the loyal opposition the bill seek to end eviction for mortgage prisoner let we do what we can to lift the burden that they have carry over the year know from read briefing that the government be concerned about what they call the moral hazard of act if these people have not already have their house repossess by they must necessarily have keep up with their repayment so there be strong case for say that the moral hazard lie in the other direction company have be deliberately string our constituent along it be surely also natural to put cap on the svrs be offer to mortgage prisoner especially give the general climate of mortgage instability our constituent have be cop with high interest rate for over decade and we gain nothing from push they far into debt of course there will be cost to the taxpayer in the abstract but this move will be an investment that pay itself back through the cascade of money into our local economy instead of into the pocket of offshore vulture fund be afraid that the day of balance sheet economic need to end finally the government owe it to mortgage prisoner to find way for they to help themselves out of this mess they should look into provide vehicle that allow our constituent who be mortgage prisoner to pivot back into the mainstream market the first suggestion of the report publish by the lse be that there should be free comprehensive financial advice for all victim that be what they be almost people who be victim should be contact individually to help they navigate their way out of the quagmire that they find themselves in as say it give no pleasure to conclude that it appear there be nothing we can do to make up for what uk mortgage prisoners call the extortionate interest rate severe financial restriction and mobility and mental physical issue cause by this government make scandal however that do not mean that we should not try question put and agree to order that martin docherty hughes alison thewliss liz saville roberts claire hanna stewart hosie ben lake amy callaghan sammy wilson john mcdonnell duncan baker and caroline lucas present the bill martin docherty hughes accordingly present the bill bill read the first time to be read second time on friday june and to be print bill way and means budget resolutions income tax charge debate resume order march question again propose that income tax be charge for the tax year and it be declare that it be expedient in the public interest that this resolution should have statutory effect under the provision of the provisional collection of taxes act since our economy like those across the globe have be challenge by pandemic war in ukraine and the spiral cost of energy in the aftermath of putin illegal invasion of ukraine we have see very difficult time for household up and down the country but despite the most challenging economic headwind in modern history since our growth have be high than every large european economy economic growth underpin job it underpin household budget and it underpin living standard have stabilise the public finance and deliver certainty to market my right hon friend the chancellor of the exchequer last week set out plan that will ensure more investment more job and well public service today will set out how the budget continue to support many of the sector be proud to represent at the department for culture media and sport particularly the creative industry which the chancellor last year identify as one of our five priority sector of growth the creative industry do not just enrich our life they enrich the nation finance and they be an economic powerhouse these industry be grow at twice the rate of the rest of the economy they be responsible for over million job and they be worth billion to our economy last year alone start by just recognise the uk world lead success in these industry netflix amazon prime apple and disney all want to expand their footprint here and to add make in britain label to their production barbie the high gross film of be make not in la but just down the road in leavesden which be delighted to visit recently with my hon friend the member for watford dean russell company such as warner bros be choose hertfordshire over hollywood and that production alone contribute million to our economy and support nearly job we have also see huge success in the indie film sector with film such as rye lane and scrapper this success be down to huge innate british talent hard work skill and creative excellence across the country but it have not happen by accident conservative government have be support and stimulate our creative industry with tax relief for over decade from film to animation video game and theatre these tax relief have help to attract significant global investment into the uk every year since we have introduce tax relief to support investment and create job tax relief that the labour party vote against every single time the secretary of state talk about number of production and studio all of which be in the south of england what support will the government give to ensure that we have post production and production facility in the north of england for instance by match mayor tracy brabin ambition to have studio in west yorkshire the government be support creativity across the country in june announce million which we know from experience will leverage million of investment for creative cluster across the uk only recently be at aviva studios in manchester the million invest in manchester be the big investment since the tate modern the hon member will have hear in the chancellor statement about the significant investment in teesside particularly in the creative industry but the tories have truly wreck the nation public finance under the conservatives debt have triple from trillion to almost trillion do the secretary of state agree that accord to respected independent statistic despite the chancellor budget household in slough and across our country will be bad off on average under the chancellor tax plan the chancellor tax plan be allow people across the country to benefit from around if they be an average earner and we know that every time the labour party leave office there be high unemployment last time the labour party be in government it leave note that say there be no money leave let tell the house what impact the conservative plan have deliver over the last decade as say there have be tax relief in every budget over the past year and every time they be vote down by the labour party the impact of that year on year investment be clear statistic show that more than million job in the creative industry have be create since there have be almost doubling of the economic value of creative industry to more than billion since with export up in that time recently publish figure confirm that the sector have grow by more than since the pandemic the conservative party be power one of our world lead industry the minister be talk about the state of the nation finance in and at that point we have national debt of trillion we now have national debt of trillion do she think that the conservatives have sort out the nation debt when it be now almost three time high than it be hope the hon gentleman be listen when the chancellor deliver his budget he highlight that debt will be reduce next year with the office for budget responsibility forecasting that we will meet our fiscal rule to have debt fall as share of the economy it merit record that the debt figure we be deal with come from billion bail out of the bank under gordon brown billion of quantitative easing billion of brexit relief billion of pandemic relief and billion of cost of live relief that be significant injection of money by this government and the previous one to help people through tough time my hon friend as always make an excellent point it be difficult to forget how this government and the prime minister when he be chancellor support the livelihood and economy of people up and down the country in the creative industry alone covid recovery fund of billion go to ensure that those industry continue to survive the international monetary fund and other say that that be the fast and most effective package come out of covid welcome what the government be do for the creative industry in northern ireland the northern ireland film sector have be grow leap and bound over the past few year the extra help that the government be put forward for creative industry in northern ireland will undoubtedly create more job and boost for the economy welcome what the secretary of state be put forward now that the northern ireland assembly be up and run again can contact be make with the relevant minister to see how we can grow the industry even more be delighted that the northern ireland executive be up and run and keen to continue engagement with they to ensure that we continue to boost the economy in northern ireland our creative industry be not just life enhance and entertaining and they be not just part of our personal and national identity they be an economic powerhouse that be dominate the world stage in the past year we have build on the huge success of the decade of investment that speak about with an industry lead sector vision that set out plan to unlock billion of growth million more job and pipeline of talent by both the chancellor and the prime minister recognise that the way we will extend our excellence long into the future be with sustained investment and commitment to those sector that be why the budget that the chancellor set out last week continue that support and build on that recognition with package of measure to cement our status as cultural superpower member should not just take my word for it the relief announce represent once in generation transformational change that will ensure britain remain the global capital of creativity accord to lord lloyd webber they include the most significant policy intervention since the accord to ben roberts the chief executive of the british film institute they be game change accord to james bond producer barbara broccoli those people be all correct there will be billion in additional tax relief for the creative industry over the next five year we have set permanent high rate of cultural tax relief of for tour and for non tour theatre production and gallery exhibition and of for all orchestra production there be new tax credit for uk independent film with budget of under million tax relief on business rate for film studio and an increase tax relief for the visual effect sector there be million for the national theatre to modernise its stage and new funding for an extension of the national film and television school the funding and tax break will unlock huge investment in our economy secure the long term future of some of our great cultural institution and help we build pipeline of talent for the future we be only five day on from the budget and the measure be pay dividend already later this year the filming of jurassic world will begin at sky elstree studio as sir william sargent chief executive of the visual effect company framestore say it be likely that our decision to remove the cap on what production can claim on visual effect have stop the visual effect for jurassic world from be make abroad that be our long term plan for growth and it be deliver growth within day of the budget however our ambition rightly stretch far beyond our world class creative industry at the last autumn statement the chancellor unveil growth measure which take together could raise business investment by around billion per year in decade time he have follow that up with budget design to deliver an economic gear shift for business across different industry from life science to manufacturing to ai there be over million of combined government and industry investment into cutting edge automotive and aerospace project there be grant of million of joint government and industry investment into the life science and up to million in the alan turing institute our national institute for ai and data science over the next five year there be strategic investment design to unlock growth and propel our economy forward these long term decision will place we at the vanguard of these pioneering industry of the future where we belong the government recognise how hard the last few year have be on people and family finance that be why the prime minister set five clear and unambiguous priority consistent with those of people across the country who have battle with the rise cost of living the prime minister the chancellor and the entire cabinet have be laser focus on those priority and we have make significant progress in deliver on they rise be very happy to give way the secretary of state speak about tax relief and long term decision but thank to this government we now have the high tax burden since the second world war will she confirm the office for national statistics figure show seven consecutive quarter of fall in gdp per capita since do she agree that that be the long period of stagnation since the the hon member make number of point on taxis we be stick with the plan which be to get taxis down we be do that by yet again reduce national insurance contribution there be reduction for million people and tax cut for million work people from april he mention the tax to gdp ratio where the uk tax system remain competitive we have low tax to gdp ratio than any other european country in the germany be at france be at and italy be at base on figure on tax cutting there have always be social contract in this country by which people pay national insurance until they become of pensionable age and then they do not pay national insurance therefore cut in national insurance do not help pensioner and in particular aspiring pensioner who have put something aside what would like to know from the secretary of state see alongside her the exchequer secretary to the treasury who say this change might take decade be what be the long term plan to protect pensioner national insurance can not just be abolish and replace with nothing it can only be replace with high tax from which pensioner do not benefit my right hon friend know that we want to reduce taxis on work people it be not right that they have double taxation he will also know about the importance of protect pensioner which be why throughout our time in government we have protect they with one of the key way of do that be through the triple lock will highlight the progress make on the five priority that the chancellor and the prime minister set out some time ago debt be fall in line with our fiscal rule inflation have halve and growth be full percentage point high than predict that have only be possible because of the decision take by this government such as put an average of back into the pocket of million worker in the space of four month there be furth to go and the budget will help we get there create more success story like our creative industry across our economy and across the entire united kingdom while the labour party snipe aimlessly and endlessly from the sideline we be target funding where it be need most while the labour party talk the economy and indeed the rest of the country down we be back work family and british business with tax cut and tax break while the labour party turn on its turn we be put our economy on track for new job new growth and new investment the conservative government have plan and that plan be work commend the budget to the house call the shadow health and social care secretary would have raise this as point of order madam deputy speaker but give that we be here before get right to the heart of the debate want to place on the record the revulsion that opposition members feel at frank hester conservative party donor who have give more than million to the party in the last year say of the right hon member for hackney north and stoke newington ms abbott that she make he want to hate all black woman and that she should be shoot that be utterly revolt racist and inciteful language which have no place in our politic and public life give the vast sum that he have give not just to the conservative party but to the prime minister if they have any integrity whatsoever they will give every single penny piece back and apologise to the right hon member for those appalling comment be sure that at some point in the debate those on the treasury bench will want to confirm both those thing turn to the budget the government have sum up what be obvious to everyone in britain year of conservative incompetence have break britain economy it be all there in black and white the economy be back in recession we have the high tax burden in year record tax raise parliament wage low today than in and household bad off than at the last election we have fall in living standard over an entire parliament for the first time in history from next month we have real term cut per person in nhs funding when the nhs be go through the bad crisis in its history what do this budget contribute to that appalling record we have million of low and middle income worker be drag into pay high tax and unprecedented level of low wage low skilled migration be damage the economy the government could have fix both problem today but do not that be not my conclusion but the word of the former home secretary and next leader of the conservative party the right hon and learn member for fareham suella braverman will the hon member give way be sure the hon member would like to leap to defend the current leader or his future leader which be it the shadow secretary of state underplay the strength of the british economy with record employment and an unemployment rate one third below the eu average put this to he the tax take be high than we on the conservative benches would like but the key reason be that in the pandemic it cost lot to make sure we leave nobody behind we have one of the most generous furlough scheme in the western world for example would he have do anything differently we have never doubt the challenge that the pandemic have place on the public finance or our public service but that do not explain the fundamental weakness of the british economy go into the pandemic or the fact that nhs waiting list be at record level before the pandemic nevertheless it be good to see the conservative party at least acknowledge that major crisis do have an impact on public finance thank my hon friend for give way and also thank the hon member for basildon and billericay mr baron for his intervention about what happen during the covid crisis do my hon friend agree that we would have have lot more money for our public finance for more doctor and nurse if the conservative government have not be busy hand out billion of pound worth of contract to their friend and chum that be one of the reason we need covid corruption commissioner interruption do my hon friend agree that the chancellor fail to announce covid corruption commissioner during his budget my hon friend be absolutely right and government members should not groan at he for raise problem they should be outrage at the misuse of public money they should be as appal as we be that in the midst of national crisis when so many people rush to danger or play their part in national response those business that shift from their normal activity to try to help genuinely do the right thing for the right reason there be other at the same time who seek to use the pandemic to make quick buck at our expense it be disgusting and the fact that so many billion of pound of personal protective equipment be waste much of it literally go up in smoke should exercise all of we voter can make their own judgment on why the conservative party be still so relaxed about that profligacy waste and fraud accept the point that the hon member for basildon and billericay mr baron make about the importance and impact of financial event because narrative be spin after the general election about the global financial crisis the conservative love to say it be all the fault of the last labour government but have bad news for they the former chancellor of the exchequer have well name he as there have be so many george osborne be talk recently in his excellent podcast about the late great alistair darling and he say in the financial crisis he be the chancellor of the exchequer who earn lot of trust with the way he handle that crisis of course it be politically expedient for the conservative party at the time to pretend that the economy be go through so many challenge because labour government have bail out the bank but when present with crisis you do the right thing we do the right thing then and we would do the right thing in the future when present with crisis as we expect this government to do in fact we engage with the government in good faith throughout that crisis we never imagine that people would use vip lane to rip off the british taxpayer that be why if she be the next chancellor of the exchequer my right hon friend the member for leeds west rachel reeves will go after those people to get that money back we do not doubt her determination to do so the budget be pitch as the tories last roll of the dice before the general election it be mean to be the one to bamboozle the opposition and wow the public but instead of start the campaign with bang they be go out with barely whimper it be mean to bring million of voter who have abandon the conservative party back into the tent instead it have drive the former deputy chairman of the conservative party out of the tent all together after year of conservative government conservative mp be leave because to quote the hon member for ashfield lee anderson you can get police officer to turn up to your house when it get burgle people be pull their own tooth out you can get gp appointment what damn indictment of the conservative party from man who this prime minister choose to elevate to one of the high office in that party the claw come out as soon as today defection be announce but they be not aim at the hon member for ashfield no conservative mp be beg he to come back they have tell channel news the fact rishi promote he to deputy chairman and tell you all you need to know about his judgment even conservative mp admit in private that the prime minister be too weak to run his own party let alone the country as lord lloyd webber might have write if he be script new musical for the conservative party they be past the point of no return and look to boris johnson say wish you be somehow here again have to give credit where it be due this be budget so bad that it have do what be previously unthinkable it have unite the war faction of the conservative party they be unite in agreement that it be disaster before the chancellor stand up the leader of what be leave of the scottish conservatives have already announce his opposition to it soon follow by the energy minister the hon member for west aberdeenshire and kincardine andrew bowie who exclaim his deep disappointment with his government own energy tax then the security minister the right hon member for tonbridge and malling tom tugendhat and foreign minister the right hon member for berwick upon tweed anne marie trevelyan write joint article oppose the chancellor lack of investment in defence the energy minister do not support the energy policy foreign and security ministers do not support the defence policy and even the chancellor say that he do not support the tax rise that he be impose on work people it beg the question be there anyone leave who believe in what this government be do government members should feel free to intervene and leap to the government defence but sadly they agree the chancellor name several member in his speech presumably on the basis that misery love company wonder if even the member who make their way on to the chancellor list of the damned will defend this government dismal record extend an invitation to they early today but they have not show up be sure that they be busy back in the office or in their constituency write leaflet extoll how great the budget be twenty five mp who will not be extoll how wonderful it be be the new conservatives the conservative mp who support that organisation say we can not pretend any long that the plan be work we need to change course urgently do my hon friend question as do whether those mp who want to change course urgently will vote for this budget if they will how can they possibly suggest that they be change course who know must confess do not even know who the new conservatives be there be so many war tribe and family involve every week it be level of reproduction that even the former prime minister boris johnson fail to match turn to the list of the damned who make their way into the chancellor budget speech the hon member for dudley north marco longhi be identify as push the government to give into the shadow chancellor call to cancel their plan rise in fuel duty where labour lead the tories follow wonder if he will defend his government make pensioner in dudley year bad off the hon member for truro and falmouth cherilyn mackrory be single out by the chancellor do she think her constituent earn year will forgive she for vote to pinch an extra from their pocket in tax rise rise she do she want to defend the chancellor and her fingerprint on the budget the hon gentleman seem to be take the wrong tone with my constituent be overly political with each other be not something we practice and he would know that if he speak to my labour opponent in truro and falmouth the chancellor single out because we have work very hard across cornwall to remove advantage for short term holiday let that be all be grateful to the hon lady for that intervention do not think that that alter the fact that there be people on the nhs waiting list in cornwall and the isles of scilly be sorry if she take issue with my tone but the simple truth be this however much the conservative party try to build the idea that politic can not change anything that there be no point in voting that we be all the same and that there will not be any change with change of government after the next general election politic do make difference and voting can change thing cite in evidence the fact that when labour leave office we have the short waiting time and the high patient satisfaction in the history of the nhs cite in evidence that if we have economic growth under this government at the rate we have growth under the previous labour government there would be billion extra to invest in our public service without have to raise taxis on anyone that be labour record it be record we be proud to defend conservative members can not defend their record they have no record do my hon friend agree that we have to have measure to improve and boost our economy be it not disappointing that there be nothing about commercial trial for pharmaceutical company in the budget on trial we have fall from fourth to in the world lose between and and year between and without those trial we will not only see lack of money but lack of improvement in cancer outcome strongly agree with my hon friend we should not be complacent about that because slip down international league table be not just miss opportunity but miss chance to save life improve outcome and generate income for our national health service everyone win when we have our national health service and life science sector work together in partnership to ensure we be develop the late treatment and technology in this country to ensure we be manufacture those treatment and technology in this country and to ensure patient get the benefit in this country should labour win the next general election have no doubt that she and will do great deal together to improve outcome particularly in relation to brain cancer which we be both passionate about not least because of the late great margaret mcdonagh who remain an inspiration to we all but also in so many other area where that kind of groundbreake science have the potential to improve our economy and save life rise will certainly give way to the former minister be grateful to the hon gentleman for give way be enjoy his knockabout speech but do he welcome the million package we put out last spring to reverse the covid damage to life science and more importantly do he respect the way that several of we have pursue this issue in non partisan way the sector need to know we be work together invite he to say that he intend to build on that legacy and continue to keep it as sector that go beyond politic certainly give the former minister this assurance where the government have have good idea and where the life science strategy be in the right place we do not intend to tear thing up just because there be conservative fingerprint indeed we welcome aspect of review the government have undertake particularly that conduct by lord and we welcome the government commitment to implement it in full but there be more to do remain frustrated that when talk to uk life science in particular start up and medtech entrepreneur they describe the nhs in pretty poor term as partner that culture and practice must change indicate assent can see the former minister nod emphatically even amidst this rowdy budget debate we have manage to achieve some consensus of course the hon gentleman be very welcome to join we on the labour benches should he wish to help we in the task the hon member for bassetlaw brendan clarke smith be another member who will be absolutely delighted to have his fingerprint on the budget how will he explain to his constituent get by on year that he be an architect of the budget that will leave they pay more in tax this year they will all walk through the lobby to raise taxis on work people but they will not defend their decision in the house it be no surprise that the conservatives be ashamed of what they have do to the country fred thomas labour candidate in plymouth moor view tell about izzy cioffi izzy leave the royal marines last year after eight year of service he have be work hard as telecom engineer in good job which few year ago would have enable he to get by and even put some money aside each month he want to train for commercial diving qualification but the cost of all his basic fuel food mortgage and energy bill have rise so much that he can not afford to put any money aside this be young man with no dependant in good job he should have his entire future before he but the state of the economy be hold he back from opportunity that be the cost of what people in the country be call rishi recession what about the conservatives record on non dom we know that conservative members do not support the abolition of non dom tax status because they have be tell we so for the past decade the howl of protest from the benches opposite be deafen from the moment labour first propose what be simple policy and principle that people who live and work in britain should pay their taxis here too the right hon and learn member for northampton north sir michael ellis say that it would be anti aspirational if only he have as much aspiration for our nhs and schoolchildren as he have for people avoid their taxis his constituent will remember that he fight for non dom not nurse in stark contrast labour candidate lucy rigby whose mum work in the nhs be commit to get the nhs in northampton back on its foot and fit for the future that be the choice that voter in northampton face the hon member for stoke on trent north jonathan gullis suggest that the money raise would drop year on year as non dom would leave the country why do he have so little faith in britain why do he think that the only reason people would want to live in this country be to avoid pay taxis if he can not see that stoke on trent have so much more go for it than non dom tax status suggest that his constituent might prefer an mp who have some pride in his city and some pride in his country and elect david williams at the general election during the election campaign when the conservatives be tour the broadcast studio to criticise labour plan we must never forget that the chancellor say that abolish the non dom tax status would not benefit the taxpayer the secretary of state for levelling up housing and communities say that it would lead to talent flight the health secretary say that it would put nurse at risk and put in jeopardy britain place as the film location for the barbie movie and the under secretary of state for health and social care the hon member for lewes maria caulfield say that it be as much use as an ashtray on motorbike official report february vol now each and every one of they be prepare to vote for labour plan the bright glow come from the red faced members opposite be blind we must never forget that they criticise our policy they criticise our costing they have adopt our policy and they have adopt our costing they do not have any credibility leave the fact that the conservatives have finally relent be further evidence that labour be win the battle of idea again today never again can the conservatives claim with straight face that labour do not have plan they would not have the first idea what to do if they do not have our plan to pinch in fact it seem to that the labour party have replace the institute of economic affairs as the conservatives most influential and favour think tank look at the impact that we be have on government policy labour nhs workforce plan nick labour plan to recruit dentist to the most under serve area nick labour plan for progressive ban on tobacco nick labour plan for windfall tax on oil and gas giant nick and now labour plan to abolish the non dom tax status nick if the conservatives be so desperate to see labour manifesto implement they should just call general election would not want my hon friend to miss out the consultation on ban water boss bonus which be also nick from we the list be inexhaustible be it not it be just one thing after another and then they have the audacity to say that labour do not have any plan if that be true why be they swoop in like magpie every five minute ready to pick the next cherry from labour tree it be just shame that the conservatives do not see the light early have they abolish non dom tax status when labour pledge to do so in million child could be enjoy free breakfast club today they could have fund an extra million nhs appointment and operation hundred more artificial intelligence enable scanner and million more urgent and emergency dental appointment the prime minister would have deliver on his pledge to cut waiting list if only he have listen to labour what stop he why be the prime minister so wed to the non dom tax status the hon gentleman have mention schoolchildren couple of time in pass it be hugely disappointing to that there be absolutely nothing in last week budget about school or college today theme be grow our economy which start in our classroom invest in education be an investment in this country economy and society for generation to come yet there be nothing for day to day spending even though school in my constituency and across the country be have to make cut every day shockingly the small print reveal that next year we will see real term cut of million in capital investment in school building while hundred of thousand of child learn in crumble classroom do he agree that the conservatives have no clue about grow the economy if they will not focus on child and young people agree with the hon member politic be about choice which be why we choose to end the tax break enjoy by private school which be attend by the in order to fund more teacher and education for the the conservatives have not nick that policy yet it could be any day now but it do say something about choice there be something else that find really gall when the government appoint sir kevan collins as their catch up commissioner they could not have find someone well to advise on education life chance and how to correct the obvious damage that have be do to child education as result of successive lockdown most of we in this house on both side feel that the lockdown be necessary give the scale of the virus but we ought collectively to acknowledge that there be consequence and debt to be repay to that generation when sir kevan collins publish his report which be commission by the government the prime minister decide that he could not do any more if the prime minister child attend state school and he understand the challenge that such school be face with recruiting teacher and provide the wide range of extra curricular opportunity that so many independent school offer wonder whether the prime minister would have make the same political choice or be it just for other people child that this prime minister and his government have low aspiration think it be fair to say that we know why the prime minister be so wed to the non dom tax status in fact the only way the chancellor could have upset his neighbour more be if he have raise taxis on helicopter ride and heated swimming pool too but at least the prime minister can now look the british people in the eye and honestly tell they that we be all in this together in fact we have to pity poor non dom they can not even look to their friend or indeed their husband in the conservative party to defend they any long nor can pensioner incidentally because million pensioner will see their taxis increase as result of this chancellor decision do not think that be right or just and do not think people will forget it come the general election turn to the prime minister and how he evaluate his own performance at wetherspoons in maltby last week he tell the public that at the start of this year we turn corner he be right at the start of this year the economy turn the corner from flatline and enter recession rishi recession be take heavy toll on work people labour candidate for rother valley jake richards tell about john from maltby who live just down the road from what be probably the first spoon the prime minister have ever be in john be veteran of our armed force he serve his country and now thank to the recklessness and incompetence of this government he can not make end meet that be the price that people be pay and it be why this country be cry out for change have crash the economy just two year ago the conservative party be at it again with billion unfunded tax plan can any conservative member explain how on earth they be go to pay for the abolition of national insurance this be big unfunded commitment than the kamikwasi budget of the right hon member for south west norfolk elizabeth truss mortgage payer be still pay the price for that grotesque act of economic self harm and the conservatives be at it again rise hope that the right hon member for gainsborough sir edward leigh can tell we why this be great knockabout stuff but would like to make serious comment on the whole national insurance thing with the retention of the triple lock and with fiscal drag more and more pensioner be be drag into pay tax understand that the labour party will support the cut in national insurance rather than in income tax so what be its long term plan the right hon member make right and fair point early about the cut to national insurance and what be happen to pensioner income at the moment but the government long term plan be totally unfunded they can not tell we how they will fund it or when it will be deliver by be happy to give way if anyone want to correct on that as be sure the whole country would like an explanation on this billion unfunded tax plan we can not have situation where once again the conservative party get away with an entirely unfunded gimmick we see where that lead our country before and labour will not play fast and loose with the public finance in the way that the conservatives it be no use laugh be amazed that conservative members still laugh when people mortgage be go up month after month they still have the audacity to laugh at their recklessness and not take responsibility for their mistake the hon gentleman invite an intervention to clarify his position on national insurance wonder whether rather than engage in this knockabout which be rather enjoy he be terribly good at it by the way he could answer the direct question from my right hon friend the member for gainsborough sir edward leigh if labour be go to support this change to national insurance how do the hon gentleman reconcile that support with what he have just say it be straightforward question it be that we have once again win the argument we have be argue for some time that taxis on work people be too high they have go up time and again under this conservative government and it be only because there be general election around the corner that they have suddenly discover heart and discover labour policy and raid our cabinet until now the conservatives have use work people as their first and last resort to raise money whenever we have talk about fair choice whether on non dom on the oil and gas giant on the carry profit loophole or on the tax exemption enjoy by private school we get howl of opposition from the conservatives tell we how difficult it be oh that will work it will raise the revenue it not fair it so harsh on all these people they never say that about the people on low and middle income who be be absolutely clobber they never say that about the people who lie awake at night worry about how they be go to pay their bill do the shopping and pay their rent or their mortgage pick the pocket of work people be the first and last result of this conservative government and it be only because there be an election around the corner and labour be chomp at their heel that they have finally discover the cost of living crisis my hon friend be right to pick up on this unfunded billion proposal to scrap national insurance just quick glance on the website show under the heading what national insurance be for that it be for basic state pension additional state pension new state pension new style jobseeker allowance contribution base employment and support allowance maternity allowance bereavement support payment if that billion be go how will all these be pay for my hon friend ask an excellent question and it be one that the government will have to answer because we be not have this double standard in politic if the labour party have announce unfunded commitment of this kind the conservatives would be the first to howl and complain and it would be the question confront every labour spokesperson on every broadcast platform and every national newspaper this be the question that should be level at the government because this be not just hypothetical recklessness we have see where the conservatives ideological recklessness lead our country through disastrous mini budget for which they have never apologise never take responsibility and apparently never learn the lesson it be disgrace if the money be not come from the source that my hon friend the member for denton and reddish andrew gwynne suggest in term of pension and support let we bear in mind the scale of billion it be quarter of the nhs budget be that where the money for abolish national insurance will come from the government would have to close hospital and sack nurse doctor and gps will these cut be evenly spread across the country or will they just shut down the nhs in the west midland and yorkshire leave the rest of the country untouched they be very welcome to tell we when this policy will be introduce how they will fund it and where the cut or the alternative tax rise will come from because we will hound they with these question every day of the general election campaign some of that billion could have be allocate to compensation payment for those affect by infected blood do the hon gentleman share my concern that the budget do not mention infected blood and that those who be impact feel very frustrated and very angry at the government delay in deal with the issue be grateful to the hon gentleman who bring to the next section of my speech infected blood be another crucial detail miss from the budget where be the compensation for the victim of the contaminated blood scandal the prime minister acknowledge that this be an appalling tragedy and he promise that he will speed up the award of compensation sir brian langstaff give final recommendation on compensation in april almost an entire year ago why can the prime minister act quickly to help the secretary of state for science innovation and technology with her legal fee but drag his foot when it come to help the poor victim of this scandal we should be in no doubt that the chancellor allocate no money and have not leave enough headroom in his budget to meet the level of compensation likely to be require so what be his plan be he go to break his fiscal rule or break his promise to the victim which be it it be not hypothetical question and think people would like an answer from the government on the contaminated blood scandal we have hear the warm word and we have hear the commitment in fact the prime minister say he be act speedily would love to see he in snail mode but this be serious people be die without compensation the government be now float the idea of an autumn general election bottle it on may general election be they seriously say that this will drag on into the autumn for new government to pick up the piece that be what it look like to and think it be shameful give everything the chancellor have say about this scandal and give his role as this country long serve secretary of state for health under this conservative government think it be real shame on he finally turn to the nhs in announce the productivity review the chancellor admit something that labour have be argue for some time that the conservatives have fail to reform our public service and that they have hike taxis on work people waste taxpayer money and deliver poor service in short under the conservatives we be pay more and get less now the chancellor want we to trust the arsonist to put out the fire they start the chancellor promise crackdown on agency spend for too long staffing agency have be able to rip off the nhs by charge extortionate hourly rate which cost billion of pound year and undermine staff work hard to deliver high quality care the tough new control on spend that we put in place will help the nhs improve continuity of care for patient and invest in the frontline while put an end to the day of unscrupulous company charge up to shift for doctor agree with every word he say but it be not from the budget speech it be from speech in nine year ago when he be health secretary what have change last year the nhs spend billion on agency for single doctor shift the taxpayer be get rip off bad than ever before because the chancellor refuse to train the doctor and nurse our nhs need just last year the conservatives pour an extra million into agency staff why because they have force nhs doctor and nurse out on the bad strike the nhs have ever see and the budget confirm that they have no plan to end this chaos the truth be that the prime minister would much rather blame poor performance on nhs staff than the abysmal failure of year of conservative government the chancellor promise new artificial intelligence technology for the nhs we will add that to the long list of labour plan that the government be adopt this be man who promise in that the nhs would go paperless four year later be not joke he say be quite relieved that most people seem to have forget that make that promise well the country have not forget that record it be and the nhs still run on pager fax machine and paper record the chancellor failure leave the nhs with the long waiting list and the low patient satisfaction in history now the butcher of the nhs be back and he want five more year to finish the job the hon member for loughborough jane hunt be name and sham by the chancellor as play role in draft the budget the question be where be the plan to cut nhs waiting list there be patient wait in leicestershire so why do she not ask the chancellor for something to help her constituent who need treatment today the last labour government deliver the short waiting time and high patient satisfaction in nhs history we do it through investment and reform we do it before and we will do it again at the next general election the question that people across britain will ask be after year of conservative government be they and their family well off be our public service well off in fact be anything work well today than it do year ago let help they out one institution be work well than at any point in the past year and that be the labour party it be the only party with plan to deliver britain out of the mess that the government have make it be the only party that have strong leader with united party behind he if the magpie on the conservative benches be look for more plan to adopt before their time run out they could adopt our planning reform to get britain build again our industrial strategy which see government and business work hand in hand to get our economy grow again our national wealth fund to harness investment in the green job of the future our plan to switch on gb energy in order to invest in our energy security our plan to insulate million home bring down household energy bill for good our plan to get britain back to work because we understand that we can build healthy economy only with healthy society and our plan to get million off nhs waiting list back in work and free to live their life to the full we will have million more appointment year at evening and weekend to cut waiting list we will double the number of ai enable scanner in our nhs to diagnose people fast we will have more urgent dental appointment year and reform the nhs dentistry contract we will have more mental health professional with community mental health hub in every community and mental health support in every primary and secondary school in the country that be what plan for growth look like it be plan for the nhs too that be what the budget would have look like if labour be in office and the shadow chancellor be sit in the treasury that be the change our country need it be time for general election so that we can put the british people out of their misery and have labour government who can give britain its future back rise before call the first speaker from the back benches inform the house that we have speaker in this debate so advise member to confine their speech to six or seven minute certainly to start with that would be extremely helpful in ensure that we get everyone in call sir bill wiggin thank you madam deputy speaker will keep this as brief as can this budget demonstrate the decision that the government have take since that have allow job to be create every day for year and there be self respect that people get with job the furlough scheme protect million of those job job creation and preservation mean that we do not need to take away money from public service to deliver tax cut to hard work people it also show that the conservatives can be trust with public money and will reverse high taxis on the individual while spend record amount on public service be take back control of our money the budget include billion for the nhs for which will help to cut waiting time visit hereford county hospital fortnight ago the chief executive proudly outline some of the hospital achievement include new diagnostic centre and planned training suite part of the transformation to improve staff training in hereford as well as ensure well outcome for patient it be not message of misery at all however the nhs should continue to focus on staff training more training place have be create at the university of worcester have highly train staff increase performance and reduce the need for agency staff which be the cost we should focus on perhaps the nhs need golden handcuff healthcare professional work in global market so the taxpayer who train new entrant ought to have some hope of payback post graduation and entrant should be discourage from relocate elsewhere such as canada speak of waiting list perhaps gps should be pay accord to the number of people they see the system be currently base on the number of patient on the book there be guideline for the amount of time the gp should spend with each patient but doctor understand that people sometimes need considerably long do not think recommend that they see only patient day be the way forward in herefordshire gps believe they could be pay accord to the number of people they see hope the minister will pilot such scheme to prove that waiting list can be cut by primary care activity although we will have to pay for that extra effort in the number of small boat arrival be less than the year before and there be less asylum application so the plan be work we should be think about reduce the cost of border enforcement and the cost of process asylum claim in leominster the talbot hotel be no long be use to house asylum seeker have write to the local authority state my support for the compulsory purchase of that hotel and the royal oak to boost local tourism we need to see our hotel fill with tourist who pay to visit we should look carefully at the issue of pay the french to stop the crossing we have pledge million to support that but when the rwanda scheme be under way it should deter crossing perhaps we will not need to pay the money to the french we must ensure that the safety of rwanda asylum and immigration bill be pass be dismay to learn that labour peer block the bill some migrant have die in the english channel since every day that go by be another day someone could die in the channel if the lords continue to block the bill the house should consider look at element of the human rights act wonder how their lordships will feel or indeed how asylum applicant will feel as migrant drown human right be not much use if you be dead so it be important that we deliver on the will of the people by stop the boat we do not need to leave the european court of human rights but we do need to say that we will no long allow illegal channel crosser to be eligible for asylum the echr can sle we out if it want but do not believe that it will just as it do not when we stop prisoner vote we need to protect innocent asylum seeker from be put at risk by people trafficker before more life be lose on agriculture and the environment english farmer be sore but not in the same way as welsh belgian dutch or french farmer or all the eu farmer who blockade eu building and burn bale on the motorway we need to support british farmer through tax break instead of grant the recent announcement of million grant for farming be welcome but tax break be more efficient and well tool for food production such grant do not allow farmer to buy the second hand machinery they want but tax break do we could save more money by merge the environment agency and natural england those organisation be responsible for great deal of pressure on the mental health of farmer we need to look at their scope and cut the number of suicide in agriculture in my constituency there have be six such suicide on average there be three suicide in the agricultural industry each week that be far too high so take the pressure off farmer would be tremendous step forward be delighted by the increase for pension to match the triple lock we need clever pension policy that cover not just old age but care we need to think about the way we pay the state pension and ensure that it be not tax we need to look at the furnished holiday let tax break too because holiday let cause great deal of unrest in the countryside we understand insurance pension care and funding but do not seem to be able to manage the whole lot when we put they together we need to do well as we get old to deliver on all our ambition to help our child to save money in case we need long term care and to deliver peace of mind to pensioner worry about those challenge on transport the government recent reallocation of fund from high speed have be resounding success it be an example of the government plan work in herefordshire alone we have receive million in additional funding for road resurfacing and million for local transport that funding have be reallocate from which people could be forgive for forget that vote against in this show how public fund can be use strategically to deliver public good without increase the tax burden have have my allocation of time the government have do great deal of good reverse the damage that covid do inflation the cost of living and national insurance be down only electricity supplier such as scottish power continue to prey on people hope ofgem will investigate that if we be united and stick together we can show that our plan be work and that there be bright future for we all be begin to wonder if some people in this place live on the same planet as the rest of we be they receive the same casework be their constituent face with the same problem have be an elect representative work in public service for nearly year and the situation be absolutely the bad have ever see people come into our surgery at the absolute end of their tether they can not cope anymore there be nowhere else they can turn so they come to their mp which sometimes take lot of courage we can not offer they any optimism there be no light at the end of the tunnel the budget be an opportunity for the chancellor to improve the cost of living crisis but he do not take that opportunity he do not see the problem that so many people be face the budget have come on the back of the damage of brexit year of austerity and last year horrific disastrous mini budget which far destroy the economy the chancellor look at the stat and think that it be good idea to talk about they he say oh look since the last forecast thing have get well of course they have get well since then the last forecast be in the aftermath of the total disaster of the mini budget by the way people who be in ministerial role at that time get severance payment they come in trash the economy and then leave with hefty in their pocket to spend it be completely shocking that we be in that situation member of the government party keep talk about tax the office for budget responsibility have say that tax as share of gdp be nearly at post war high the minister can say all she like about comparison with other country but near post war high be pretty damn indictment for party that be talk about how important it be to reduce tax interruption if the right hon member for beverley and holderness graham stuart want to intervene on he can do so but if he care very much about the tax system and try to make difference to people life he would ensure that local authority in england be not raise council tax by he would freeze council tax for people he will have look at the national insurance change and think to himself how do these change work they be well they give more money to people who make more money that would not have be my choice of priority scotland be not the highest tax part of the uk if we look at business rate council tax and all the different taxis that people pay and at our starter rate for the low earner it be incredibly helpful to live in scotland thing such as capital gain tax which the uk have decide to make change to have massive differential impact on different group of people people be less likely to benefit from the capital gain tax change if they be female or black or if they live outside london the uk government have the wrong priority they be do their very good to make thing well for the rich people and to ensure that inequality be far entrench people on the high wage get the most money back from the national insurance reduction and those on the low wage get the least money back which again fit with the conservative ethos the chancellor have be clear that the big loser from the budget be oil and gas let we say that that be on the basis of the conservatives really strong commitment to reduce climate change it be not by the way but let we say for moment that what they be do be about ensure that climate change target be meet and that we be get close to net zero in that case there would be see saw and balance they would be increase the tax on oil and gas and increase the investment in renewable which be incredibly important if we be to have tax raid on the north sea which impact on community such as mine in aberdeen that be heavily reliant on oil and gas job we need green investment such as long term funding decision on carbon capture usage and storage which would bring in billion of private investment the uk government however be for some reason possibly because it will be big pre election gimmick refuse to make those decision right now they be refuse to put in the billion year that we need to secure job in green future and to get that bonanza we have such huge potential in renewable technology and we be fail to get there because the uk government fail over and over again to put their money where their mouth be and make commitment in fact their mouth be in the wrong place on this as well now they be talk about cut the green crap they seem to have revert to type on that their investment be at the low level in the it be shocking that the uk government be refuse and fail to tackle the big issue of our time which be climate change the labour party have say that it will put in billion year to fund green investment and green technology that be the same amount as the scottish government be spend in scotland in the labour party think that that be enough money whereas scotland know that it be enough for scotland we need significantly more than that to get the investment that we need remember that all of this be reserve the scottish government be put money and support into this but it be reserve stuff the reality be that we have so much energy and potential in scotland but we do not have the full power that we need to take advantage of it to ensure well future for our child and our planet and secure the job that we continue to need the last autumn statement include real term nhs cut scotland none the less increase our spend on the nhs in real term tax cut and tax break be simply not investment budget that be heavily reliant on tax cut and tax break will not ensure that we have the public service we need melanie wilkes from the institute for public policy research say that the chancellor announcement represent unsustainable real term spend cut to already crumble public service with many have already see spending per person fall consistently during and after the austerity year the institute for fiscal studies say that the chancellor budget leave many public service face savage cut of billion year by last week statement do not provide single penny more for capital funding the barnett consequential that we will get from the health increase that the chancellor signal be less than we get in in year consequential last year the reality be that the big amount of money that the government have announce for the nhs be not only not worth the paper it be write on it be not nearly such big amount of money as the chancellor would like people to think it be narrow tax relief will not fix the systemic issue within some part of the creative sector over the past few year local authority have make billion in cut to art funding force by tory austerity and the reduction in funding for local authority if we want barbie or jurassic world to be film here that be all well and good but if we do not have the infrastructure and the grassroot funding to ensure that people can get excited energised and educate in the art we will have to import all the talent to do these job we will not have people train to do they unless the grassroot support and funding be there we have see that in football there have be massive increase in the number of female footballer who be perform particularly well the england team have do brilliantly that be because of the grassroot support that there have be and the funding increase for woman football that be brilliant but without that ecosystem we will never get those people perform at the high possible level make change to big flashy shiny thing be great but we need to back it up with an ecosystem in addition to the issue cause by cut in art funding there be no cut to the vat on ticket which be significant problem some festival have be cancel for already one more be announce the day before the budget if the government will not look at such thing as the vat on ticket which be significantly high than it be throughout europe we will continue to face such issue when the cost of living crisis be bite and people can not afford to see live music as often as they would like vat on ticket be just too high there be also no fix for migration in relation to the art and there be significant lack of relief apply to such thing as choir there be major issue in the creative sector some in the sector be very happy with the change and be glad that that be the case other part of the creative sector feel that they have be leave out particularly when it come to live music and the night time economy if the uk government be go to focus on the creative sector they need to do more to enable people to access the art and particularly live music today debate be about grow the economy the hon member for basildon and billericay mr baron mention that there be record employment and that that be positive be glad people be able to work but we have so many vacancy right now the lack of migration and the outward migration of lot of people who be work in care for example mean that the nhs be stress like never before have come out of covid with too many vacancy and have face repeat refusal by the uk government to increase pay people be really struggle can understand why people would not want to do those incredibly high stress job in our public sector ensure that our nhs be provide the good possible service the government need to do more to be clear that we be not just stand on the doorstep clapping for public sector and nhs worker but that we actually support they they must give public sector worker the money they deserve for do those incredibly hard job day in day out to keep we safe they must train people who can be take on and allow migration so that people can come and work in our nhs in scotland we have focus on wellbee our decision make process go through wellbee lens we do not just say right in our budget we be go to focus on gdp growth because that be the most important thing the most important thing be the wellbeing of our population we ensure that people be well off and mentally and physically happy as result of our decision making for example we ensure that our climate change target be meet so that their child and their child child have planet to grow up on we ensure they can afford to live that be why we have thing such as the scottish child payment free school meal for to baby box and free bus travel for do not know how many member remember be under and be totally frustrated at how much transport cost people be able to make their way around scotland or even just get to school or uni more cheaply than they could before because eligible disabled people and those age and above in scotland have free bus travel that make real difference to people live day in day out especially give that the cost of bus in aberdeen be something like day at the moment we have the child winter heating payment for household with the most severely disabled child our scrapping of the right to buy this will probably get some groan from conservative members have make the big difference to my constituency we can build new council house and we do not have to sell they at an discount when issue arise we have brand new shiny council house to put people in it be fabulous that there be social housing we still have social housing waiting list absolutely we do because we have be try to undo decade of issue result from the right to buy and the fact that we could not build more council house so many of my constituent and people up and down the uk be in desperate situation in many case people who previously be comfortable never have to worry have two car and be happy enough be struggle to pay their mortgage and council tax and to fund the daily necessity the uk government have absolutely fail to take account of that and to listen to people cry for help this budget do not have the right priority for the people of scotland and the uk it do not make their life well and improve their wellbeing but simply focus on some fiscal rule rise order as say before would prefer not to impose time limit if colleague can confine their remark to seven minute that would be terrifically helpful it be pleasure to follow the hon member for aberdeen north kirsty blackman because it give the opportunity gently to point out to she that she represent party that be preside over the part of the united kingdom with the high rate of personal taxation in the uk she do not seem to understand that we can address the cost of living pressure for those in work by cut taxis as the chancellor have just do for million people in this country cut the national insurance rate by next month on top of the cut this january will make material difference for family across the country in particular in south shropshire it set clear direction of travel for low rate of personal taxation in the future under the next conservative government will the right hon gentleman give way no be afraid have no time madam deputy speaker be be very strict those measure combine with the above inflation increase to threshold since mean that the average south shropshire worker now earn and in the next fiscal year will pay over less in personal taxis than they otherwise would have do have the government increase threshold only in line with inflation welcome what have be do also welcome the raising of the threshold and the halving of the rate at which high income child benefit be withdraw which mean that by april the chancellor will have end the unfairness for single earner family those who be over year old declare an interest comprise of south shropshire resident compare with nationally so pension income be of particular importance to my constituent thank to the fact that the triple lock have be maintain the full annual amount of the basic state pension be high in cash term than in the triple lock increase the state pension by this year and it will increase by further next month in addition the tax free personal allowance at remain high enough that pensioner receive only full basic or new state pension will not pay any tax on that income that be significant advance for pensioner on the legacy leave by the labour party my constituency be very rural and most people have to rely on car the extension of the fuel duty freeze will keep fuel cost low than they otherwise would have be and the freeze on alcohol duty and the extension of business rate relief will significantly help the hub of our community in rural area our pub as farmer be very pleased that the chancellor listen to call from farming organisation and the conservative environment network of which be member and address the anomalous disincentive under which agricultural property relief be not available for land enter into some natural capital land use scheme that be welcome correction in the remain moment have want to touch briefly on how the work of the environmental audit committee relate to the budget be very pleased that the government have commit to the sixth round of the contract for difference for renewable energy project get the large funding allocation to date more than billion be pleased to see the minister for energy security and net zero my right hon friend the member for beverley and holderness graham stuart in his place the government have clearly learn lesson from the previous round and have recognise that prevail market condition will inject commercial realism into the uk approach to this increasingly competitive global market although support for renewable energy production be welcome on the path to decarbonise the economy it can not happen in isolation it be clear from our committee current inquiry into enable sustainable electrification of the uk economy that electricity infrastructure include transmission distribution and storage will also have to increase materially to handle the increase generation capacity that will be require to meet the increase demand it be good to see that recognise in the budget which build on the energy system announcement last autumn to reform grid access since november more than gw of energy project have be offer early grid connection date accelerate and modernise the system to allow more renewable energy project to connect more quickly do not wish to pre empt the conclusion of our inquiry but the government be bring forward measure to remove barrier to infrastructure investment and be develop important guidance to encourage well community benefit for those affect turn to the other energy announcement be very pleased by the progress on the acquisition of nuclear energy site from hitachi both in the constituency of my hon friend the member for ynys môn virginia crosbie and in oldbury in south gloucestershire have write on behalf of our committee to raise concern about the pace of progress and in debate on the civil nuclear road map two week before the budget call on the government for progress on site selection hon member who be up early enough this morning will have hear the chair of great british nuclear simon bowen announce that great british nuclear now envisage take two small modular reactor project through to final investment decision in the next parliament which be welcome breakthrough finally welcome the further clarity on the carbon border adjustment mechanism first confirm in december which will be introduce from january our committee do significant amount in lay the groundwork for that policy which hope the minister might recognise by give date to which the industry can plan it will have the confidence to invest in decarbonisation effort it will know that carbon border adjustment mechanism will mean that less environmentally harmful product will be manufacture here and that we can reduce import so that the investment of uk manufacturer in decarbonise can not be undercut through weak environmental standard this be thoughtful prudent budget which will generate low taxation for individual over time and grow the economy under the conservatives after last wednesday budget be catch up in chaos at st pancras with most of the line north out of action whatever the real reason it be interesting to hear people around talk here we go again everything break that be reflection of so much that be happen in the country it reflect the experience of shock nhs waiting list previous progress on cancer survival rate be now slip that be appalling people be unable to get dentist as we hear at the health select committee and as the shadow health secretary my hon friend the member for ilford north wes streeting say in his storm critique of the government some people be resort to pull out their own tooth school be crumble in sheffield an estimate million be need for essential repair of our school but only million be available bus cost more while service decline youth service have be cut and knife crime be rise fail welfare system have create massive growth in food bank what we once think temporary phenomenon be now part of the welfare landscape and local government in particular have be starve of fund over the past year sheffield city council have lose around half of its funding from central government in real term total of billion equivalent to million less for this year budget alone last wednesday budget the last we all hope of die administration be chance to begin to repair break britain but the chancellor miss it he ignore the crisis across our public service he also ignore public opinion which put those service before tax cut these be not decision make in the public interest like so many decision over the past year they be make to manage the war faction inside his party regardless of the damage to our economy the chancellor like to make claim about growth rate use convenient snapshot of statistic but if we compare the last quarter for which figure have be publish quarter of with four year early we can forget those claim about lead the accord to the house of commons library uk growth for that quarter be well below that in the eurozone and well behind japan canada and the us the national institute of economic and social research put the uk annual growth rate at around since roughly half the rate see under most of the last labour government the shadow chancellor my right hon friend the member for leeds west rachel reeves be therefore right to focus on growth there be no benefit in increasingly tax an ever diminish cake but it be interesting to hear the secretary of state the right hon and learn member for south east cambridgeshire lucy frazer who be no long in her place boast that uk tax as percentage of gdp be well behind most of europe and behind half of the which it be however she be at odd with her chancellor he be look admiringly at the us where tax as percentage of gdp be far low at it be reflection of the flaw in the chancellor think that there be no evidence from the us that it be that tax yield that have drive growth if there be lesson to be learn from the states it be probably from biden inflation reduction act in addition tax in the us do not cover much of the spending that it do in the uk americans might have more money in their pocket but they have to spend it on service that be fund by tax here from refuse collection to health the us spend much more on health than we do of gdp compare with here there be space to increase revenue in the budget but not to increase taxis on work people indeed this budget leave those who could least afford it as tax loser accord to the resolution foundation worker earn below just under the average earning in south yorkshire will be up to year worse off because of the combine impact since last august of the national insurance change which the chancellor like to talk about and the threshold change which he like to ignore instead the chancellor give capital gain tax handout to those sell second and third property his tax cut hit those struggle most with the cost of living crisis but they leave unprotected government departments bad off less money for education less for local government and less for most departments there be not enough for the nhs to pay its staff the wage that they deserve there be choice we could have have budget that focus on public service and investment in growth we could have have one that use the opportunity to raise taxis from those who could afford it beyond simple game playing on non dom this budget do not do those thing it fail the country as this government have for year it show again why it be time for change and time for general election commend the government for this budget which think be more radical than first meet the eye say that as someone who be probably make their last budget speech as some of my right hon and hon friend know after year shall be step down at the next general election however be pleased that the budget incorporate number of idea that many conservative members and to be fair few opposition members have be campaign on for number of year individual measure that be confirm be welcome include the state pension go up by this year the minimum wage go up by and national insurance contribution come down by another which together with january cut will add to the average salary those be all good measure particularly the minimum wage go up as much as it have help the low pay be not only the right thing to do but the fair thing to do and over the long term it might also encourage business to invest more if we want high tech high wage high growth economy that be one of the measure that have to be core to the policy let we be clear there be no doubt that taxis be high than we would like raise that issue with the prime minister at prime minister question only last month but commend he for the support that he oversee during the pandemic we be respond to once in generation pandemic and make sure that we have one of the most generous furlough scheme and covid support package anywhere in the world be the right thing to do as my hon friend the member for north herefordshire sir bill wiggin say it protect over million job do not think any government in their right mind would have walk away from that commitment and it enable we to bounce back quick when it come to the economic recovery be also pleased to hear about the british isa alongside other measure to encourage great domestic investment in british equity we should remember that the uk stock market be the gateway to financial service in this country which contribute something like of gross domestic product that should not be underestimate some of we write to the chancellor about this in advance of the budget and be pleased to see that measure be forthcoming in particular the emphasis on pension fund to examine their support of uk equity in recent decade our pension fund have divest themselves of uk equity by almost it have now get to point at which we need to encourage great investment in the great british company of the future not only will this boost growth and employment but it should encourage these firm to remain in the uk rather than go abroad it should also slow down the worryingly large number of british firm be buy by foreign investor at knock down price especially when these firm contribute directly to our strategic industry include those essential for our security and defence would briefly suggest that the budget be radical in that think it represent shift in thinking possibly on both side of the house in itself the national insurance contribution cut be welcome have always believe that national insurance be tax on job and that be why defy my own party whip to vote against our previous attempt not attempt but policy to increase national insurance contribution however there have be marked shift in the tax burden in not just this budget but the previous budget away from worker to most other form of income include saving and pension and that be where its radicalism lie previously government of both side have use national insurance increase to help fund public service include the nhs personally very much welcome this shift unemployment be social evil that corrode society and we should remember that although we have record employment and an unemployment rate one third below the eu average there should be no complacency national insurance cut will far make work pay and could be self funding if something like couple of hundred thousand more people come into work would briefly like to raise the ongoing issue of the cost disclosure regime for investment company otherwise know as investment trust which be hinder investment in key sector draw the house attention to my entry in the register of members financial interests for those who do not know investment company otherwise know as investment trust be like shell or glaxo but instead of run oil or sell clothe and food they actually manage investment they be quite important to the uk economy nearly of all ftse company be investment trust and four of the ftse company be investment trust however because of quirk in eu retain law uk investment trust be have to roll up their corporate and investment management cost when disclose cost figure on the european mifid market in financial instrument directive template feed use by the industry this double accounting make investment trust look very expensive it do not happen in other country and the cost that other company in other jurisdiction put on the emt feed or their equivalent be zero investor be shy away from investment company discount be widen and no new money be go into sector such as renewable energy and infrastructure previously sector investment trust raise ten of billion of pound for these valuable sector even bad company be have to buy back their own share withdraw investment from those industry this be nonsense investment company have long and proud track record of help investor to channel money into much need sector be close ended and because their share be trade not the asset the share price already reflect the company cost in my view there should be no costing at all the financial conduct authority have go as far as it believe it can without change in the law we have have conversation with the government with the chancellor and the economic secretary and draft statutory instrument be before we the consultation response have see over industry stakeholder and investment house call for investment trust to be exclude as constituent composite investment which would solve the problem another si be on the way and discussion be ongoing finally in the other place baroness altmann baroness bowles and other be support private member bill call the alternative investment fund designation bill which receive good cross party support on second reading on march hope the government will support it reader of the times this morning will have see the letter that baroness altmann baroness bowles and large number of investment company professional have write set out our continued concern at this situation recommend visit to the website which set out the issue in great detail hope the government be listen there be ongoing conversation and know there be those on the front bench such as my hon friend the member for arundel and south downs andrew griffith who have also participate in try to resolve this issue it need to be resolve quickly but as say these discussion be ongoing and be look forward to hear some positive news in his budget speech the chancellor say he want to recognise the contribution of our creative industry and the tourism that come from orchestra museum gallery and theatre it be welcome that the budget make permanent the tax relief they can claim however this budget come at time when fund for our art and culture sector be widely see to be in crisis local authority be the big funder of art and culture but year of cut from conservative lead government mean that the funding previously spend on support orchestra to work in community invest in grassroots music venue or strengthen the pipeline of talent into the music industry have fall by since the local government association report that more than third of local authority be say that they need to make cost saving on art and culture to balance the book that balancing of the book have become ever hard at time of increase need for social care child service and support for homelessness the decline of support for music be most worrying in music education where music and art subject be be squeeze out for pupil in state school there have be drop in the number of music teacher drop in the number of hour music be teach drop in the take up of music subject at gcse and level and drop in funding in state school just of state school student receive sustained music tuition compare with half of child at independent school which still believe in music education music hub have vital role in provide high quality music education provide it to of school in england yet the funding for music hub have decline in real term over the last decade their financial viability will come under even further threat in september if the government end their funding of the teacher pension scheme for the thousand of music teacher engage by music hub this have only be extend to august so there be great deal of uncertainty by not address this issue and by bring about the decline of music education in state school the government risk lose music teacher future musician and the audience of the future they also fail to offer child access to an activity with many benefit for their academic social and emotional development there be further challenge for the music industry for musician look to tour overseas the government failure to negotiate touring agreement with the eu have have devastating impact on pay and career progression particularly for develop artist add to that we have failing at his majesty revenue and customs in issue form on time and that be cause long delay and financial penalty for uk musician who tour europe it be not acceptable that tour musician be now wait up to year to be pay due to hmrc failing musician hop to play close to home in one of england brilliant music venue or one of our festival may now find few option over grassroot music venue be lose in accord to the music venue trust and festival have already be force to postpone or cancel this year music event be important for the visitor economy uk music estimate that over million music tourist come to the uk every year and they spend billion while they be here the music venue trust report that every spend on live music ticket be worth to the area local economy grassroots venue be where many musician learn their trade the bath music venue moles help to launch the career of ed sheeran oasis and radiohead but it be one of the of grassroot music venue that close their door last year the budget miss many opportunity for the government to help the music industry and ministers have fail to address the issue have raise today my right hon and learn friend the leader of the opposition say it be short sighted and frankly immoral to allow art and culture to become the domain of few privileged pupil britain be world leader in music and film but we be hold back mass of potential because the conservatives creativity crisis be shut kid out fourteen year of conservative government undervalue culture and music have create that creativity crisis and be delighted that labour mission be to break down the barrier to opportunity in music in the art labour former culture secretary lord smith of finsbury say that he believe his role from to be about all the thing that for ordinary people make life worth live if elect labour will unleash generation of creativity so that every child get access to creative subject not just the privileged few and welcome that it be always pleasure to follow the hon member for worsley and eccles south barbara keeley be also entertain by the speech by the hon member for ilford north wes streeting partly because as ever he have some good line but mostly because in very long and indignant speech excoriate the budget he try hard to disguise the fact that on its central proposal the cut in national insurance he and the labour party will be in support of it so feel that some of that indignation may have be touch performative be happy to observe that the chancellor have pass his first test often feel that chancellor like doctor should start with the old medical rubric first do no harm that may seem low bar but we have all see budgets that fail to get over it this one have and for that we should all be grateful indeed go much far than that slightly grudging praise because be generally very positive about the measure in the budget there be one or two element that wish have be add to the chancellor statement but in general praise he for his navigational skill in some choppy water the evidence be there from the obr that the economy be turn corner it make the point that inflation have recede more quickly than it expect which strengthen near term growth prospect and should enable fast recovery in living standard many people in this country have experience tough few year but we can see the path to recovery and we be take the first step along it and not just in the short term the imf be forecast that we will have the high growth of the big european economy over the next five year include germany and france it be important to recognise that when so many people have vested interest in rush around and claim we be all doom in an era when political and economic debate have become partisan or borderline hysterical it be time to be calm and realistic the uk economy will start grow again in the inflation rate will come down to reasonable level and interest rate should fall as result business will be more inclined to invest and consumer more inclined to spend that be all good for the economy the day to day life of million of family and the general wellbeing of our society in the run up to the budget in spirit of helpfulness publish an article with my hon friend the members for boston and skegness matt warman and for wimbledon stephen hammond which set out what such an approach would mean in practice our main taxation ask as one nation conservative be that any tax cut be aim at ordinary hard work people be glad that the chancellor take the same view and concentrate the cut on national insurance our other more long term ask be that we should set out on the road of simplify the tax system with the ultimate aim of tax all income at the same rate regardless of its source be it earning benefit or dividend that will of course be very long journey but there be an indication that the chancellor be think about that the idea to eventually remove the separate income tax that we call national insurance be good indication that the direction of travel be correct it have take many decade for the tax system to become as absurdly complicated as it be so it will take year if not decade to make it significantly well move in that direction be really important streamlined regime would have the dual benefit of reduce red tape and incentive to avoid tax such regime would be demonstrably fair and more progressive and would reduce in work poverty nigel lawson use to have the admirable aim of abolish tax in every budget it will take some time before the public finance be in shape to allow that to happen again but even small step in the right direction be good sign welcome one specific package of measure namely the help for the creative industry set out by my right hon and learn friend the secretary of state for culture media and sport at the start of the debate the culture media and sport committee have be assiduous in try to persuade the treasury to recognise the economic importance of the creative industry on top of their obvious cultural significance and be glad that the chancellor be listen hope that the right hon gentleman will also acknowledge that there have be cross party support for the tax relief across the year they be originally introduce by the labour party and be expand by the government contrary to what the minister say early there have never be vote on any of the individual tax relief be grateful to the hon gentleman for that point and be glad that this be another budget measure on which there can be cross party consensus that feed into my general point that there be thing that the government be do that should receive support from the opposition benches the day after so much british success at the oscars be the right time to welcome measure that will help to maintain the extraordinary success of this country in make film and high end tv programme that be see around the world that success which will no doubt be help by the extension to tax relief announce in the budget have mean full production schedule in many studio around the country declare constituency interest because in ashford we be in the early stage of build new studio complex help by level up fund want the industry to thrive in year to come when those studio be occupy also declare cultural interest because want british independent film as well as hollywood blockbuster and series make for streaming service the enhance tax credit for british independent film with budget of under million hit exactly the spot in the market that film maker tell the committee be in need of help that well aim subsidy will hope ensure future success along the line of that enjoy recently by one life as say be overwhelmingly positive about the budget but wish to enter two caveat about issue that hope can be address in future budget the first be about help rural community that want to decarbonise their heating four million people live in oil heated home in rural community and be off the gas grid they want to do their bit for the environment but they be disincentivise from adopt renewable liquid fuel those fuel have low carbon emission but be tax while fossil fuel heating oil be not scrap the tax on renewable liquid fuel in the budget would have reduce their cost and make they viable alternative to fossil fuel hope that in future budgets my right hon friend the chancellor will look to do that my second caveat be about the vexed issue of tax free shopping the abolition of vat free shopping when other big eu country allow it clearly set the uk at disadvantage the treasury have argue that vat free shopping would cost the exchequer billion of pound but other economist argue that the knock on effect of great tourism would more than make up for that hope that discussion continue about which set of economist be right so that we can move to more rational system that help our tourism industry put aside those caveat we should be grateful to the chancellor for produce sensible pragmatic and positive budget the economy be recover it do not need shock treatment and it certainly do not need the unfunded commitment make by labour members even when they be try so hard not to succumb to their basic impulse to tax and spend the economy need continue steady hand to nurture the recovery and under this chancellor be confident that it will continue to improve rise order speech be begin to become little elastic if that continue we will have to have six minute time limit it be pleasure to follow the right hon member for ashford damian green who always bring sense of togetherness to these debate although obviously he say that he support the budget he do so in his non partisan way always enjoy listen to his contribution however the budget that the right hon gentleman paint picture of be very different from the one that my constituent react to they be leave with an overwhelming sense of be that it to be fair when look over at tory mp after the chancellor sit down that be pretty much the expression on the face of the majority of the parliamentary conservative party it would probably be unfair to name this friend from the government benches but as we be walk back to portcullis house he say to thank perhaps hansard will insert an anglo saxon be mention in the chancellor roll call of doom that probably mean stand some chance of come back after the election he be only half joke the chancellor think he be do the right thing in give roll call of the name of all the conservative members with marginal constituency but all that do be highlight to opposition members just what good job the labour candidate be do in those constituency after year of conservative rule we have have the very dreg of the barrel in this budget the everyday experience of people outside the palace of westminster be quite different from the impression give by government members in three day of budget debate the reality be that taxis be still up mortgage for many be up bill be up and price be up the government response be budget with crumb for work people that do nothing to fundamentally tackle the challenge face our economy one would think that this be the budget of country in its halcyon day rather than country now in recession have the chancellor fall victim to the warning of the prime minister who appoint he and sign up to the anti growth coalition far from pursue growth the chancellor have deliver the bad parliament on record for living standard as confirm by the office for budget responsibility give with one hand but take more with the other the conservative claim to be party of low taxis but thank to the rate freeze they will have create million new taxpayer by the budget be adorn with the white flag of surrender from government who have simply give up on the country and be now look in on themselves the chancellor suggestion of one day abolish national insurance an unfunded tax cut of billion leave gap hole in the public finance we know it and they know it that be nothing more than gimmick otherwise money for the list of thing on that national insurance pay for which rattle off early not least the state pension would have to be find from other source transfer that list to income tax raise vat or both would mean taxis up otherwise there would be savage cut to public finance for one think that the chancellor be appoint to clean up the mess create by his predecessor not to follow his lead there be no quick win there be difficult decision to be take and it will take time to undo the damage to our economy yet the utterly reckless national insurance proposal show that there be fundamental lack of seriousness at the heart of government they simply do not get the scale of the chaos that they have create nowhere be that more patently obvious than in the dire situation face local government section notice be become frighteningly commonplace and leader from across the political divide be unite in their call for help but help come there none rather we have last minute turn and more sticking plaster strain to hold together an already break system the issue be far from just be about the odd move to fortnightly bin collection it be about local authority with serious statutory duty for child service and adult social care be force to cut down to the bone and in some case into the bare bone the government say that local government can find more money by cut woke job or find other area of waste but after year of financial decimation there be very little if any waste in local government local authority be struggle my local authority finance have be decimate stockport budget be down by million year tameside be down by million manchester budget be down by million these be ginormous amount of money the result be ever deepen social and economic inequality the area that be already struggle be the one suffer the most those who need support be have the ladder pull from beneath they that be the hallmark of government who far from bring our country together have seek to play divide and rule at every turn after year of conservative government our country be less equal less productive and less fair and work people be pay the price from the chancellor tone last week we might think that be record he be proud of rather than one of which he should be utterly ashamed so low have the government party sink that no long be they cry foul about labour not have plan instead they be steal our homework and pass it off as their own the british people deserve more than cheap copy job they deserve the real thing and it be about time they get the opportunity to vote for it it be time for this era of chaos to come to an end let we have general election now give this country the labour government the fresh start it so desperately need it be time for britain to get her future back it be pleasure to follow the hon member for denton and reddish andrew gwynne despite what he say about government member have their shout out from the chancellor last week be very proud to have have mine will come to why in moment the chancellor mention not only but my constituency neighbour to my knowledge labour care so little for st austell and newquay that it have yet to select candidate the hon gentleman trope about marginal constituency be somewhat off the mark start by thank the chancellor for his budget statement last week many policy in it will help fulfil the promise that have make to my constituent in truro and falmouth there be announcement that will make real difference on the ground in deliver well home low cost of living and high skilled job for the future everything that cornish members of parliament have time and again seek to deliver for local people the abolition of the tax regime for furnished holiday letting be what get my shout out for last week as we emerge from covid hold surgery in st agnes one of my constituency village in couple of hour have see people every single one of whom be be evict or have their rent hike to an unaffordable level and have to leave their property that illustrate to that the cornish property market have become unworkable not just because of covid although covid amplify the effect and that we absolutely need to rebalance it have take three or four year of hard work by conservative constituency mp work with departments across government to start to reach the balance that we need it start with the department for levelling up housing and communities introduce the register of holiday let and the need for planning permission for change of use from family home to holiday let and last week it culminate with another tool in the box the furnished holiday letting tax regime neither of those would work alone but together they start to change the direction of travel for landlord in cornwall we be not demonise those landlord we be just try to reset the balance and to re engage they in think about let for the long term to family in cornwall that be important because all our constituent need somewhere to live but that be become untenable have village call portloe that have property in it and of they be second home or holiday let one child live in that village hope the whole house agree that it be unacceptable that in winter the light be off and nobody be home and that we have get to do something about it thank to the government cornish conservative mps and like minded mps from around the country we be start to see difference would like to whistle stop through another few highlight from the budget in the secretary of state opening remark she mention the creative art which be hugely important to cornwall there be business in the creative art in cornwall and we also have falmouth university and the university of exeter in penryn in my constituency in particular falmouth university be first in the uk and second in europe for game development all of those thing be vital to the cornish economy and to the uk economy and be pleased that the government will invest heavily in tax relief to encourage that important industry apprenticeship be also vital to all the emerge and re emerge industry in cornwall the cornwall marine network for example have create more than apprenticeship and job secure million of investment and generate more than million for the cornish economy it include company such as pendennis shipbuilding and incidentally be try to be part of the supply chain for float offshore wind for the celtic sea and have put in for the float offshore wind manufacture investment scheme it would be remiss of not to take every opportunity when speak in this place to remind ministers that they need to invest in the celtic sea for the whole of the south west region and look carefully at flowmis submission critical mineral lithium in particular but also tin and other metal be vital for the future of renewable in the united kingdom all emerge industry rely heavily on apprenticeship and be get their apprentice from cornwall college and from truro and penwith college among other apprenticeship scheme be vital for these emerge industry and give hope to cornish child who for year have think they could not possibly go on in life unless they leave cornwall and go to university now they can use the ucas system to look for apprenticeship at the same level as university course they can stay in cornwall do fantastic course and go on to brilliant quality career in cornwall we have life science phytome for example be spearhead the evolution of plant base medicine of course we have also get our traditional industry of fishing and farming in fishing every one job at sea be reliant on more on land that be job in cornwall that rely on fishing in farming we have not just traditional farming of course we be protect our farmer in that but agritech we have fantastic company call bennamann that specialise in methane capture it clean it process it and upgrade it to generate well than net zero gas to power the farming industry it would be remiss of not to mention the chancellor announcement of million for maternity service across the country for which be utterly grateful as the chairman of the all party parliamentary group on baby loss think that be fantastic again it be something that have be call for pay tribute to our maternity service at treliske hospital in truro which visit last week with donna ockenden to show off if could how well our maternity team be do it be buck the national trend with waiting list to come to be midwife in cornwall there be no vacancy that be testament to the hard work that have be do to make that team one of the good in the whole country today we be talk about grow the economy think lot of our constituent stop listen when they hear that phrase as it sound far too removed from their daily life in which they have be struggle with the cost of living crisis sky high housing cost and unsafe street we be all aware of the devastating impact of youth violence in as new mp lose several young constituent to knife crime in quick succession their death have huge effect not only on their friend and family but on the community as whole that drive to set up the cross party youth violence commission of which the home secretary be member along with the hon member for glasgow south west chris stephens hope that hon member present will remember our work from the very start the commission push for public health approach to tackle youth violence which mean draw on knowledge from wide range of policy area to create multidisciplinary approach pioneer work be do in scotland when the first violence reduction unit be found in glasgow by strathclyde police under labour government its mission be to identify understand and address the underlie cause of violence the commission interim report publish in call for the adoption of the public health approach oversee by network of similar violence reduction unit the right hon member for bromsgrove sir sajid javid who be home secretary at the time endorse that course of action and other regional violence reduction unit be establish two year later the commission march report welcome the government commitment to further support and resource for violence reduction unit last wednesday the chancellor announce funding which be so important to be precise million over three year from with his state intention that it should be use to upscale exist violence reduction unit and expand the model across the country one of the commission core concern have always be the long term funding of violence reduction unit we all know that that can be difficult in politic as government of different colour come and go and priority change violence reduction unit can not fulfil their potential and do all the thing they want when they do not know how much more money will be come in beyond the next few year the commission view have always be that they need to have year funding settlement also question how the million will be spend give that the funding allocation for total around million just million year both to upscale exist vru and to expand the network do not seem sufficient would appreciate further clarification on that time be incredibly hard we all know that but we will grow our economy by ensure that as many people as possible be economically active and that must include our young people we owe it to they to show that we be serious about invest in their future when prepare the report the commission take evidence from huge range of people the root cause of youth violence and indeed the solution do not begin and end with the home office and violence reduction unit if we want our young people to grow up and play an active role in the economy we need to invest in they from the very start that mean invest in child centre school youth service decent housing youth employment and tackle poverty as well as increase the number of police officer on our street and rebuild community relationship stress that as policymaker we need to engage with young people and by that mean not only listen to they but act on their concern and recommendation only then can we truly understand their need and work with they to ensure that every single young person in this country have bright future it be pleasure to follow the hon member for lewisham deptford vicky foxcroft in this budget debate on grow the economy my constituent like many across the uk continue to face significant financial pressure but there be real sense we be turn corner as inflation and energy bill fall wage rise and mortgage rate begin to come down cost of living pressure will be far ease now that the chancellor be in position to again cut national insurance contribution for million work people combine with the cut at the autumn statement the average worker will be well off and have the low effective personal tax rate since the raising of the threshold for the high income child benefit charge will also mean that many hard work parent can keep more of the money they earn meanwhile pensioner will see an increase to the state pension which relative to earning be already at the high it have be for year alongside that the significant increase to the national living wage to working age benefit and to the local housing allowance will all be important in the vale of clwyd so far so good but that be until be afraid we take account of the decision of labour and plaid politician on devolve matter in wales as we know well for every spend by the uk government in england the welsh government receive in barnett consequential the budget result in an additional million for the welsh government in addition to an exist record settlement from the treasury even so denbighshire county council have find it necessary to hike council tax by while cut frontline service include library and education for too long north wales have bear the brunt of poor prioritisation by the welsh government whether that be million on the flounder cardiff airport million and rise on the unwanted mph speed limit or million on increase the number of politician in cardiff bay all this waste have real consequence for those dependent on high quality and value for money public service increasingly we see disparity that disadvantage my constituent for example the government be rightly extend the retail hospitality and leisure relief in england in this budget while the welsh government be increase the burden on small business by reduce their level of relief from to just disappointingly that mean that the rate bill for an independent pub with rateable value of will be in england but in wales the freeze on alcohol duty will be welcome in the hospitality sector and the freeze on fuel duty for the consecutive year will also be welcome in my semi rural constituency as will the increase in the vat registration threshold for small business spend on the nhs be over third high in real term than in and the uk be now rank sixth out of the oecd country on health spending as percentage of gdp however outcome need to improve so very much welcome the near billion announce in the budget to address productivity and service pressure in england it be however matter of deep regret that the failing devolve nhs service in north wales be unlikely to see the corresponding improvement that they desperately need it be time to be little more positive and one of the thing have find most satisfying over the past four year have be the increase attention that north wales have receive from the uk government since the election of strong team of conservative mps denbighshire be receive ten of million of pound of level up funding for various project across the county include in rhyl prestatyn denbigh ruthin and llangollen wrexham glan conwy and the conwy valley gwynedd slate landscape and holyhead be also receive support that support have be supplement by the community renewal fund and the community ownership fund which in denbighshire have give support to the salusbury arms in tremeirchion the llandyrnog shop the sun inn in eryrys and the llangollen museum we also have the benefit of the share prosperity fund which amount to million in denbighshire alone million investment zone in north east wales million freeport on anglesey the north wales growth deal fund for grassroots sport and the commitment of at least billion to electrify the north wales mainline that theme of support for north wales which far exceed what be ever receive via the former european union structural fund continue in this budget the government long term plan for town be expand at the budget to include rhyl that provide the town with million of additional endowment style funding to invest over year empower it to develop plan for the long term not just for the end of the financial year it be timely news that theatr clwyd will receive million which will allow it to complete its regeneration work fully the theatre base in mold benefit many of my constituent it be cultural hub for the region and be pleased not only to host its reception at parliament few week ago but to welcome the art minister lord parkinson for tour of the construction site last week the announcement for theatr clwyd be join by the welcome news that venue cymru in llandudno will receive million in funding we also hear at the budget about million agrifood launchpad which will provide research and development funding to support business in mid and north wales to deliver economic growth through innovative project and to take advantage of new opportunity emerge in agritech finally be delighted that the government have reach agreement on multimillion deal with hitachi to purchase the wylfa site on anglesey bring the prospect of major investment in nuclear energy project on the site step close conclude with thank to the chancellor and thank that the government recognise the value and priority of we in north wales long may that continue when the chancellor be hand the key to no in autumn he be present by his supporter on the government benches as safe pair of hand who could be trust to salvage the public finance from the wreckage of the tory car crash mini budget some month later anyone who still harbour belief that either he or his party could be trust with this nation finance will have be thoroughly disabused of that by budget that put the short term interest of his party before the long term need of the country the late figure from the office for national statistics expose the scale of the economic challenge we face the uk be in the depth of the most prolonged period of economic stagnation since the with gdp per capita have fall over the past seven quarter for the first time in history living standard be set to fall over the lifetime of parliament once again britain resemble the sick man of europe beset by chronic level of under investment and the second slow growth of any economy the chancellor have learn nothing at all from the past year of tory economic failure he still cling to the debunk fantasy that if more money be put in the pocket of the most well off it will as if by magic trickle down to everyone else he still refuse to recognise the reality that if we want to grow the economy we need to invest if we be serious about secure sustain long term economic growth we should begin by support the income of britain real wealth creator work class household who have be hit hard of all by the cost of living crisis that mean put more money in the pocket of the low earner through target measure such as increase universal credit and scrap the two child benefit limit that money will then flow into our local economy and high street instead the chancellor have deliver tax cut that the institute for fiscal studies have estimate will disproportionately benefit high earner while threaten to blow hole in the balance sheet with furth billion in unfunded tax cut as result of the blanket cut to national insurance we as member of parliament on an annual salary of will be year well off meanwhile someone in my constituency earn just will be leave bad off than before as result of the freeze to income tax threshold if the chancellor believe that this budget will stave off the electoral oblivion his party face in the loom general election he be sorely mistaken he have grossly misread the public mood polling by ipsos and yougov show that even with the uk tax burden at its high rate in year voter overwhelmingly prioritise high spending on public service over tax cut in birkenhead where the average person be nearly bad off in real term than when labour be last in power resident see their local nhs service at break point their local council which have have its central government grant cut by more than since be teeter from crisis to crisis year on year yet not single additional penny be commit in last week budget to spend on health education or social security the british public understand what this government do not we can not cut our way to growth they remember how the tories ideologically drive austerity programme derail the tentative but promising economic recovery secure by the last labour government in the wake of the financial crisis drag down economic growth year on year and lead to the bad decade for economic growth since the industrial revolution they recognise that far from austerity ii what britain need now be to invest in its crumble infrastructure and overstretch and underfunde public service must issue word of warning to my friend on the opposition front bench the shadow chancellor my right hon friend the member for leeds west rachel reeves have be clear about the dire economic situation that labour government will inherit if labour win the next general election that be an indisputable fact but the language that we have hear from the shadow chancellor and the shadow chief secretary to the treasury my hon friend the member for bristol north west darren jones in recent day that we have maxe out the credit card and there be no magic money tree will ring hollow in the ear of many of my constituent who have see the profit of the super rich and big corporation soar during the pandemic and the cost of living crisis at the expense of their own standard of living they remain unconvinced that public service reform alone be enough to deliver the quality public service that they deserve despite outward appearance britain remain wealthy country but that wealth be more unequally distribute than ever fear that unless my party be prepared to revisit its opposition to wealth tax and to commit itself to genuine progressive tax reform labour will never be able to accomplish any of what it set out to do or what million of voter believe that it must do it be pleasure to follow the hon member for birkenhead mick whitley because he speak straightforwardly about what the real labour party think that we should have wealth tax in this country and more money spend on benefit which will hit those who work hard it be class warfare again from the labour party hit middle britain that be why rise in support of the budget because it be another step in the right direction towards help hard work people towards low taxis and towards our conservative principle that people can well spend their money they earn it and they deserve to spend it for the average worker million work people will now receive tax cut of around base on cut from to less than six month ago and now cut from to that be total ni cut of third it be great news and warmly welcome it but it come as part of wide package it be important that other point be not lose in that excellent news which be delighted the labour party will vote for when the division come tomorrow we be cut taxis for the self employ and for sme by make sure that ni be cut for the self employ and the vat registration threshold be increase that be great news we have go far too we have make sure that family be reward again in our tax and benefit system family be the bedrock of our country they be the key to bright future the high income child benefit charge be be amend with an average uplift for those affected family which be major step in the right direction warmly welcome it have discuss it with my hon friend the financial secretary to the treasury in the past to make sure that family get fair deal the most impactful change be one that do not come in just yet the collection of household information because that will allow family to get an even fair deal in the year ahead hope that the chancellor will deliver upon that transferable allowance for all married couple would cost billion in treasury speak but would reduce poverty by with the poor family get the great benefit one in household would see their net income rise by more than in the short run it be possible to target that even far perhaps only at parent with child under which would cost billion or even small scheme to opt out from the free childcare that this government be offer that would address the unfairness that the tax system create where couple earn with two child can pay over more as single earner than if both adult earn each our tax cut be good news and they go beyond those personal taxis be delighted that the treasury and the obr have accept the existence of the laffer curve on capital gain tax that be great first step and hope that they will see it work and go far and apply it to other taxis in the year ahead cut from to to encourage more supply in the housing market for first time buyer and for second stepper be great thing though urge my hon friend on the treasury bench to think far at the next fiscal event about scrap or at least cut stamp duty land tax that could get our housing market move particularly by help downsizer and second stepper also urge ministers to look again at inheritance tax because abolish it would grow the economy encourage more people to stay in work for long and boost receipt to the exchequer the proof of that be sweden where inheritance tax have raise roughly the same proportion as it do in this country less than of all revenue to the treasury sweden abolish inheritance tax in in move that enjoy cross party support the result be boom in entrepreneurship economic growth and tax revenue that the tax have previously suppress it create surge in asset be transfer not just to family member it be invest in business moribund capital be be use for innovative reason and productive purpose family business become more entrepreneurial too it be win win contrary to some briefing from the treasury ahead of this budget by abolish inheritance tax or at least cut it significantly overall tax revenue can go up the proof be there any action on inheritance tax be non inflationary which make it safe choice as we continue to battle inflation want to turn to grow the economy we need to build more road some railway and some home investment be go into road and encourage the government to go far and to streamline the planning process to make it more possible the tunnel need to happen the which keep bang on about need to happen the low thames crossing for which million have be spend on planning fee need to happen these be the key to unlock future economic growth across the country it be clear that for every pound spend on building road the return be many time over to the exchequer in the year ahead we also need to boost housing supply in our city because that be where we get the big economic return from build home huge amount of brownfield site be ready to be unlocked and be delighted to see that the package announce could unlock at least home that be great start more than million can be build in london alone on brownfield site there be further investment in transport infrastructure in cambridge to unlock growth there the last few year have not be easy for the british economy we have face the legacy of covid the war in ukraine and conflict in the middle east those challenge have be tough but we have make good progress and we be turn corner the inflation that rise around the world have now more than halve the economy have perform well than forecast mortgage rate that rise around the world be start to come down and debt be on track to fall as share of the economy too the job be not do and this show the real choice that we face our plan to reward work and grow the economy or back to square one with labour government or anyone else who will back they up and put they in with high taxis low growth and few job in our economy for our hard work people the theme of today debate be grow the economy so want to touch on the feedback have have in north shropshire about some of the issue hold our economy back as member will know it be rural part of the world about of the area and about of the business be agricultural so it be little disappointing not to hear any mention of farming or rural britain in the chancellor statement last week farmer have have really tough time high input cost the wet winter on record which be cause huge challenge and reduction in farm payment support this year despite conservative manifesto promise in to retain the level of support on the new scheme call on the government to ensure that support be maintain at the same level and that environmental scheme be easy to access the current process of pay out money up front really be not work for people who do not have cash in the bank at the moment they be find it increasingly difficult to access finance not least because of the demise of the local high street speak to someone last week who build stone path to stop soil wash off his field into the road it benefit everybody but because of the timing of the payment he will have to not get his grant or incentive and take up the path and sell the stone frankly that be insane we need to focus on ensure farmer can access support so they can do the work they need to do for the environment and stay in business through this very difficult period public transport be one of the big factor hold back the rural economy market drayton in my constituency have only one bus service young people find it very difficult to access the education and skill they need to grow our economy in the future and to access job opportunity elsewhere in the county and beyond into staffordshire it be hold they back and hold the town back the whole of shropshire have only one bus service run on sunday that be how much we be struggle for public transport encourage the government to consider how quickly investment in public transport might pay back the cancellation of see think only million go to shropshire there be no sustained investment in public transport the shortage of people to work in our business be one of the big issue hold they back some business be ship people in by minibus from elsewhere because they be struggle to recruit the people they need ensure that people be able to move about be an important part of grow the rural economy train station be part of that last year we receive the welcome news that oswestry would be reconnecte to gobowen by train but that project seem to have stall so would welcome confirmation that it will progress we know it be fully fund under the restore your railway fund but we need to make progress now we also have issue around drive test centre people who be dependent on car have to travel long distance to find drive test centre they be spend lot more on learn to drive and that be hold back young people in our area urge the government to have another look at the importance of public transport in rural area to get our economy properly fire up have speak lot recently about mobile connectivity and digital investment in rural area the shared rural network be welcome step forward but it be not roll out as fast as we would like and we be not see the benefit we want to see only of rural business have stable connection accord to the all party parliamentary group for rural business and the rural powerhouse of which be member we need improvement at pace to get good business into the countryside and enable work from home so that people want to invest not just in place where it be expensive to get an office but in place where it might be more cost effective get people into job possibly work from home at high level company that might work in the countryside if there be good connectivity would help to revitalise our high street keep young people in the area keep our school open and drive growth in the rural economy where we need it encourage the government to look at my campaigning on the share rural network and to encourage business to share their equipment and allow rural roam to kickstart growth in rural area on health one of the big issue in shropshire be the lack of recruitment in the health service we have number of specific issue we have hospital in special measure where it have be for year we have appal accident and emergency waiting time and we be in dental desert it be very difficult to register with an nhs dentist do not think there be any nhs dentist take on new patient in north shropshire we need the workforce plan to come to fruition for example dentist from overseas be already here ready to take the overseas registration exam but there be lengthy delay to that process the association of dental groups say that just of those dentist would provide an extra appointment year we could get people to the dentist and get rural service fire people would want to live and stay in our area if they be able to get the service they expect in an urban area sort out the rural workforce be essential not only for the economy but for the healthcare of the people who live in the beautiful part of the world call home number of colleague touch on the important issue of local government funding in shropshire of the budget be spend on social care which leave only to deal with the highway and all the other economic regeneration work we would like the council to do the highway be in an appalling state and we be start to lose the facility such as whitchurch civic centre that bring people into the high street such place house library registration office indoor market performance space and so on all the thing that bring people into the high street and get the local economy fire the council say that it can not afford the interest require to rebuild the civic centre which have problem with reinforce autoclaved aerate concrete it be important we sort out local government financing because if we want the people who know what fire the local economy and know what investment be need to drive growth we really need to get that sort out urge the government to reconsider the fair funding formula and ensure that council be fund base on the cost of deliver their service and not just on the need for the service they deliver have use up my time so will conclude rural britain make up about of britain it have huge potential but it be unproductive to get the economy grow we need to support our farmer invest in essential infrastructure and ensure our local government can invest in our area the ice on the cake for darlington in last week budget have to be the million of long term investment the chancellor announce build on the million that darlington have already secure under the town fund programme those fund have already develop the ingenium centre at darlington college help fund the saving of and development of the northern echo building which will house adult learning and skill and restore many historic shop frontage all of which will help to grow the economy of darlington all that build on the more than billion that darlington have receive since be elect in which have see my town flourish like never before the budget build on that and the future be now bright for darlington thank to the long term transformational investment the government be provide the amazing darlington economic campus be now home to more than civil servant thank to the decision of my right hon friend the prime minister as recent study have show it be contribute in excess of million per year to our local economy it level up opportunity grow our local economy and restore pride in our town it would be remiss of not to repeat my request that the permanent home for dec once it be build in brunswick street be name after our town hero william mcmullen that be campaign will continue to pursue in the budget we have cut taxis for work people with further reduction in national insurance contribution from to we be reward hard work give the average earner tax cut of over we also see welcome cut in national insurance for the self employ which have long campaign for clear example that it be the conservative party which believe in enterprise and be on the side of the self employ long term goal of single tax on income end double taxation be one that fully support like many throughout the house and indeed throughout darlington look forward to raise glass in support of the freeze on alcohol duty recently lead the darlington perfect pint campaign competition in which more than of my constituent vote for their favourite pub darlington have pub which be central part of our community we all know the strain and pressure that our hospitality industry have face over the last few year so the freeze be extremely welcome and it build on the already massive support provide by hospitality rate reduction let now move from pint to petrol know all driver will be relieve that the cut in fuel duty continue and that the freeze on the fuel duty escalator continue for the consecutive year this government understand that car be key to our constituent daily life and know that all those who rely on car and van for their job will particularly welcome the news on that note will continue to campaign to stop sainsbury asda and morrisons rip off the driver of darlington and end the outrageous price that my constituent be be charge which be far more expensive than even the petrol on nearby motorway and indeed be significantly high than those in nearby town where the competition from an independent retailer keep they in check this rip off must end and will continue to fight for fairness for darlington driver after much campaigning be glad to hear the announcement of new duty on vape that along with the ban on disposable vape will help to ensure that vape be for adult want to give up smoking rather than be the pocket money price alternative to sweet for our kid that be cause so much harm the fact that the government be take such action as part of large package of pledge in this area be very welcome but we must not underestimate the exploitation of child by criminal gang who groom they with high harm vape as an entry into other activity of county line nature this tax be only one of many method that we must use to protect our child healthy economy mean that we can invest the money that be need for our nhs the billion support for the nhs and new billion productivity plan will help to cut waiting time and will ensure that all receive the support and care that they need pay tribute to the amazing darlington memorial hospital and to all the nhs staff in darlington who be always there for we will continue to work closely with the hospital gp surgery and our integrate care board to ensure that money be be invest well and care be of the high standard and to use my voice in this place to bang the drum when more money be need hope that some of this extra funding for the nhs will be use sensibly by the icb in fulfil its statutory duty to commission palliative care for our hospice in that connection refer the house to my entry in the register of members financial interests as we approach the anniversary of the railway hope that darlington might benefit from some of the million make available for local culture project darlington lay the track for our railway and inspire the world to follow we have fantastic plan to celebrate that momentous anniversary in but as the transport secretary know we need further investment of at least million to restore and rejuvenate north road station on the route of the original stockton and darlington railway line be also back the campaign by the friends of the stockton darlington railway to save heighington station ahead of it be such travesty that the old railway station in the world just over the border of my constituency and in that of my hon friend the member for sedgefield paul howell have be abandon and hope that across government everything possible can be do to resolve the situation while the eye of the railway world be upon we pay tribute to the exchequer secretary to the treasury the hon member for grantham and stamford gareth davies who be sit on the front bench for his repeat visit to darlington he have visit the thermal insulation contractors association with and he recently have the pleasure rare pleasure for any treasury minister of open brand new branch of building society in this instance darlington building society this budget back work back the nhs back level up and will help to grow our economy and be proud to back it it be always instructive and interesting to listen to the hon member for darlington peter gibson and the right hon member for north east hampshire mr jayawardena as they paint the wonderful rosy picture that so many in this country do not see or feel those people like be wonder who this budget be for there be nothing for the million people include million child who be live in poverty in the uk there be nothing for social care which be on its knee there be nothing for education at time when one in five teaching assistant post be unfilled and the government have miss their overall teacher recruitment target for more than three year there be nothing for social security at time when poverty and homelessness be rise destitution have increase by since and rough sleeping have rise by in the last year alone there be nothing for council that have already see their budget cut by since austerity begin in with more than report to be on the brink of collapse while our collective campaign to save the household support fund have secure further six month of that vital funding it be hollow victory stick plaster over gap wound the chancellor be also able to announce further cut in essential service such as those provide by local council and to the criminal justice system those cut amount to billion polling by ipsos show that of people would prefer the government to tax more and increase public spending while only want they to reduce taxis and spend less on public service so ask again who be this budget really for cut from national insurance contribution amount to saving of year for member of parliament but only for nurse who be just start out spend increase for healthcare and education do not come close to what be need for our public service after the challenge of and year of brutal austerity the government would need to pledge billion to fix school that be literally crumble but this budget cut planned investment spending by massive billion up to in short last week the chancellor schedule return to that brutal austerity with the timer switch set for an impact after the next election last week visit three school in my constituency and see the magnificent effort of the teaching team to not just educate but keep family afloat in my community give the government absolute failure to do that those visit bring home to the dire situation that child face they deserve government who will invest in their future not double down on austerity owe to political choice that will surely destroy their future across the uk food insecurity have double since the start of affect an estimate million adult and million child one in three people in my great city of liverpool be now food insecure the sign of deepen hardship be there to see in every part of the uk and in all our community with long and long queue at food bank and item such as baby formula and cheese under lock and key in supermarket worker in nearly every industry be take strike action as last resort because work do not pay and do not meet rise cost such as those of food nurse educator firefighter postal worker rail staff and civil servant be use food bank what have we become and where be the political vision to fix the crisis of poverty and inequality that be destroy the very fabric of the nation at the national theatre stone throw from here the magnificent actor michael sheen be play the lead role in the play nye about the life of the visionary labour politician who champion the fight against inequality all his life and found our nhs how desperately the country need political giant like aneurin bevan to create vision to transform the future of the million who do not see one under this government government still wed to fail economic model that be destroy our community inequality have be hardwire into this country through the political choice of austerity the late health inequality research conduct by sir michael marmot find that during the peak year of austerity between and more than million people die early than they would have if they have live in the area where the rich of the population reside and about excess death be directly attributable to the impact of austerity frankly the argument against return to austerity be unarguable the people of this country can not and should not pay the price for the continuation of the tory and coalition government fail economic ideology in this failing appal and wretched government budget community such as the one that represent will not and can not take any more the endemic problem face britain in the be often compare to those of year ago as be the case in the our be time of great economic uncertainty at home and abroad now as then faith have be lose in the dominant prevail economic model in the rise inflation industrial strife and stop go economic cycle lead many to question keynesian economic thinking the blairite model of welfare capitalism which embrace the false promise of globalisation and be personify these day by the hon member for ilford north wes streeting and other lose all credibility after the financial crisis of in fact there be many key difference between the economic context of the and that of today the britain of the be beset by an atmosphere of constant crisis there be the three day week and the winter of discontent the number of day lose to industrial action in the last couple of year bear no relation to the dark day of blackout and rubbish pile up on the street however although our problem be superficially less severe socioeconomic problem run deep the and be time of great social mobility and rise living standard but the harsh reality be that living standard have stall since the financial crisis the resolution foundation estimate that real wage will be just high in than in that compare with increase in the year before that perhaps most troubling of all although the see rise in new economic thinking that for time reverse what many have see as irreversible decline much of our politic today be stick in the new labour paradigm offer the same policy formula that be discredit the good part of year ago there be no well example of that than mass migration which begin under mr blair and have continue ever since fifty year ago serious thought be give to how britain could lift itself from its economic malaise many of our economic ill be correctly diagnose and successfully deal with but though every election since and most notably the brexit referendum demonstrate the public appetite for radically new approach it often seem that the liberal political establishment can not see what the people it represent know so well the malaise go far deeply and the relief offer by the usual treasury medicine of loose fiscal policy be just not enough nor be the assumption from shadowy body such as the office for budget responsibility and the migration advisory committee that any growth be good growth it be welcome that the chancellor recognise that when he speak about per capita growth rather than growth as whole in his budget speech as auden might have put it our time be an age of anxiety deeply ingrained and destructive uncertainty prevent many people from come close to reach their potential or from even think beyond their day to day existence grow proportion of people on low income live in the least secure private rent sector be employ in unskilled work on unfair term and pay for electricity and gas on prepay meter as an adviser at the citizens advice bureau tell one journalist each of these problem compound the other your income not stable your work not stable your housing not stable everything build on sand surely we know that foundation of certainty be necessary to build social solidarity additionally heartless bank have abandon community so many people find themselves drive into the arm of payday loan company with exorbitant interest rate or even loan shark the consequent economic insecurity result in many drop out of the economy altogether an extraordinary million people claim some form of out of work benefit although the impact of covid have increase that figure growth in the disparity between officially register unemployment and actual level of economic inactivity be long term trend the inevitable result have be the breakdown of family in hollow out community which be why the chancellor change to the taxation of child benefit should be welcome across the house all the evidence demonstrate that married parent be much more likely to stay together than cohabit one child raise in unstable family suffer from bad health be more likely to be exclude from school and be more likely to join gang or end up not in education employment or training the right hon gentleman be all for family stay together what impact do he think raise the minimum visa threshold will have it be vital that we support stable family and acknowledge that stable family come in different form be simply quote the fact stable marriage give child the good chance and the government be right to emphasise family they should now emphasise marriage too to great degree to be fair the chancellor say that the government will review the policy far with view to make additional change along the line that have describe over time few people have choose to become member of club or group to volunteer to attend church or to engage in any form of community activity unsurprisingly there be strong link between the strength of social fabric and inequality area with the strong community tend to be very rural place such as my constituency in lincolnshire or area in london wealthy commuter belt in the south of england or the wealthy part of scotland macroeconomic solution to our problem must be accompany by an equally strong macro societal approach focus on the root cause of social breakdown and inequality for state support be stick plaster not cure whereas the success of supply reform enable the thatcher government of the to reduce government spending to less than of gdp by sluggish economic growth since the financial crisis have mean that the government share of gdp be now more than overall government spending be high than at any time since the second world war critically the chancellor recognise that by begin the process of cut tax we need to give people back more of the money they earn when we do so we will build social responsibility over time and enjoy great social solidarity that be why warmly welcome too the chancellor focus on skill apprenticeship and technical education must be at the heart of our education system as have argue throughout my time in parliament and they must be fully integrate into an economic strategy that support the creation of highly skilled work the era of cheap money and unsustainable profit have do great damage to our economic base british pension fund and insurance company once own of the ftse now they own just far too much of the saving generate by hard work british people be invest abroad or go towards unproductive end as such the measure introduce by the chancellor be welcome but they can only be see as the beginning of the long overdue process of support productive investment in uk business economic and macro societal policy should be design to ensure that business practice work in harmony with the good aspect of human nature not against they it should tie economic profit to ethical and social purpose risk must be closely link to profit and the government must do more to incentivise mutual ownership and profit share model co operative economic order would reinforce social solidarity an economy must work for everyone not just handful of people at the top which be why rather than glamorise faceless global conglomerate we must back british business particularly the self employ as the chancellor do in the budget and small and medium sized enterprise we need more introspective economy short supply line more domestic manufacturing and british job for british worker it be through fraternal economic in which the nobility of labour be recognise and reward and which reinforce our reciprocal communal obligation that by contrast with the flimsy ephemera of globalisation we can seed substantial economic resilience and spawn social renewal rise after mr perkins will impose time limit of six minute in order to ensure that we can accommodate all member still wait to speak this budget demonstrate that this be government that exist for one reason and one reason only if they do not exist the conservative party would have to face general election the only thing that the five family all agree on be that the one thing they hate more than face the tough choice that their disastrous legacy have leave this country be face the harsh verdict of the british people and so the government limp on endlessly joylessly hopelessly and without any sense that they have clue how to tackle the kind of issue face our country that see at my constituency surgery every week of the year this be budget that self evidently fail to rise to the challenge that year of tory government have leave our nation face crumble public service grow social problem and bleak fiscal forecast be the damn but unsurprise legacy of waste year this be government who have fail by every measure they come to power say that they be go to cut the nation debt my hon friend the member for rhondda sir chris bryant know british history far well than do but the early example of uk debt that could find be under king william iii back in the late century it take the collective government of the next year to raise cumulative debt of trillion this government in useless year have increase that debt from trillion to trillion this be government that for all their failure on public service tell we that they exist to reduce the nation debt it be not just the national debt that be rise people be bad off real gdp per capita will be low at the end of this year than it be at the start of this parliament real pay have go up just week over year of conservative government under the year of labour government real wage rise by week office for budget responsibility figure show that within this budget for every extra that work people pay in tax under the tories plan they will get only back as result of the combine national insurance cut the idea that this budget be on the side of work people be simply untrue under this tory government work do not pay it be interesting to spend moment of my day today listen to the hon member for ashfield lee anderson this be man who just two month ago be deputy chairman of the conservative party he say that under this government the cost of living be out of hand that people could not get gp appointment that there be no control on migration that there be crime on our street that people could not get police officer to burglary and that they be pull their own tooth out for the lack of dentist have to say that there be not much wrong with that analysis come from someone who be the deputy chairman of the conservative party just couple of month ago but there be so much more that we could say see the disastrous decision that my own conservative council in derbyshire be make have no time for the leadership of the conservative council see the huge impact on parent whose child be wait for special need assessment or be unable to get support with special need teach assistant in school see the state of our road which be simply unfit to be drive on see people who be wait for social care assessment meet gentleman just today who be at the end of his tether try to get support for his wife who be in terrible state but for all the failure of tory derbyshire county council we have to come back and look at this government funding of local government because council right up and down the country be experience the same whether they be labour conservative or liberal they be all say that council funding be out of control we also see the impact on nhs waiting time with the long waiting time in our history we see food bank usage become commonplace and we see rise child poverty every time go to school hear that the school have child turn up unable to learn because of hunger this government be so out of idea that at the same time they be claim that labour do not have plan they be steal labour policy in whole raft of area whether it be the non dom announcement our plan on dentistry our plan on the nhs workforce or the current consultation on water boss bonus the thing that all those policy have in common be that they have be attack by the tories and then steal by the tories it be clear that this government have neither the ambition nor the courage to tackle the issue face our country our economy need growth but our country also need shot in the arm from government with commitment to tackle poverty and the cause of failure that have go unchecked under this government no more country where people die on an nhs waiting list wait for the treatment that could have save they no more country where the train do not run and the road be not fit to drive on no more country where the place someone be bear be the big determinant of their chance in life change be come and it can not come moment too soon very much welcome this budget which be testament to the prime minister the chancellor and the compassionate and economically prudent conservative approach that have define our tenure since the backdrop we must remember be that the economy face devastation because of the last labour government include massive deficit and the startling admission from the depart labour chief secretary to the treasury that there be no money the conservatives come in and address the challenge lower the deficit ensure that more people be in work and create sound foundation for the economy that financial stability allow the cameron government to stabilise the economy mean that when we be face with the unprecedented challenge of the pandemic the johnson government be able to spend the billion need to save people the economy and job during that unprecedented time that include the life save vaccine roll out and the furlough scheme launch by the prime minister when he be chancellor which protect million job and the economy in recent year those challenge have be compound by the war in ukraine through sound finance the chancellor have be able to mobilise billion to support people with their energy cost which rise astronomically due to russia invasion of ukraine very much welcome the fact that the government have again act to support people with the challenge that they face and that they have stick to their plan to reduce inflation which have fall from to the extension of target support in the budget unequivocally reconfirm that this government be on their side be pleased that the pension triple lock continue to be maintain under conservative government reaffirm our commitment to security and dignity for those who have work hard all through their life know that people up and down the land will also welcome another vital conservative principle in action reward hard work and allow people to keep more of what they earn to spend in the way that they need the further national insurance cut be therefore welcome shot in the arm for million work people and put together with the autumn statement measure it will benefit the average worker by over year hugely welcome the support for family through the change to the high income child benefit charge and end the unfairness for single earner family likewise know that my rural constituent will welcome the freeze in fuel duty because car transport be lifeline for connectivity to the place where they live and work be absolutely delighted that cumbria transport and connectivity will be transform by the government decision last week finally to approve the dualling of the this will be lifeline connect community people business and the economy right across the north most importantly it will save people life by improve the safety on that very dangerous piece of road have campaign on this for many year and pay tribute to all the constituent and campaigner who have work hard on it as well as the department for transport national highways and indeed my predecessor rory stewart who know give lot of time and attention to it pay tribute to he for that our region be bless with beautiful and thriving landscape and dedicated hospitality and tourism economy and this will be help by the upgrade the support measure in the budget will help the people in those sector as well very much support the announcement in the budget of tax relief to support our independent film make sector that have be welcome by the oscar win director christopher nolan it will be such shot in the arm for the uk creative art industry tourism hotspot have experience at first hand the impact of holiday let and the pricing out of individual from home in their own community so it be important that the chancellor be address this by tackle the furnished holiday home loophole that be something have campaign for passionately very much welcome the support in the budget for public service on top of the long term workforce plan there be billion for nhs reform next year and new billion productivity plan also welcome the government measure to tackle vaping which be scourge on our young people we have hear about the economic effect of food security and how hard our farmer work to support it we need to make sure that we protect the sector which will partly be about biosecurity urge the government to consider funding in full the refurbishment of the animal and plant health agency down in weybridge surrey as it be so important to our food security our animal health and welfare and our public health and welfare there have be too much negativity about britain and our economy we have lot to be optimistic about and we should be very proud of our country of our achievement and of what lie ahead it be the conservative party sound economic and financial management that will keep that go last week budget demonstrate to many the result of almost year of tory economic failure taxis be rise price be still go up in the shop mortgage be high and we have the high tax burden in year what record it have become clear that household in merthyr tydfil and rhymney and across the country will be bad off on average under this prime minister tax plan which give they for every take from they accord to obr figure the obr confirm that this will be the bad parliament on record for living standard and the only parliament on record in which living standard have fall as we have hear real pay have go up by just week over year of conservative government whereas in the previous year under labour government wage rise by week we know that the tories play fast and loose with the nation finance the disastrous mini budget demonstrate just how detached they be but the chancellor now plan to abolish national insurance contribution the billion of unfunded tax cut will leave gap black hole in the public finance how many more risk will the tories take with the nation finance and what will it do to the people and community represent this be not good budget for family who be already struggle after year of tory government family across merthyr tydfil and rhymney be already struggle to make end meet food price be high than they be two year ago utility bill be high and people be experience high mortgage as result of the tories mini budget of speak to my local food bank and regularly hear about the grow scale of need which be record that should utterly shame this government in merthyr tydfil and rhymney alone more than emergency food parcel be provide between april and september increase compare with five year ago of those more than emergency food parcel be provide to child increase compare with five year ago pay tribute to the staff and volunteer who give so selflessly at the merthyr cynon food bank the rhymney valley food bank and the taff bargoed food bank as well as at the many food pantry and charity help our community but it be desperately cruel and sad that so many family in my area and across the country have to rely on food bank in the world fifth rich country in be disappointed that the government do not include anything in the budget on the loan charge scandal that be affect my constituent and many thousand of people across the country the way in which hmrc have deal with this issue have cause unbelievable hardship distress and anxiety for large number of the people we serve ordinary people up and down the country be be ask for unrealistic payment which be cause huge financial hardship bankruptcy and bad such as the risk of lose their home and an increase risk of suicide there be real concern that this be another scandal where the government ignore the alarm bell and cry for help so urge they to revisit it to ensure fair and more effective approach from hmrc as the current approach be extremely tough on those catch up in the scheme but weak on the architect of those scheme as have be suggest by the loan charge and taxpayer fairness all party parliamentary group of which be member the tax burden should not fall solely on the individual user of the scheme but should be share by the employer the agency and ideally and appropriately the operator and promoter of the scheme on that basis the government should change course and announce fair approach we must remember the human impact of the loan charge as we know and as touch on early hmrc have confirm that there have be suicide and suicide attempt by people face the loan charge that should be enough reason to stop this cruel and retrospective policy urge the government to accept that there be something deeply wrong with their current approach to the loan charge scheme finally we have to ask just how many plan for growth the tories have have think that at the last count it be over the last year and we be now in recession the tories have clearly run out of idea and run out of time we have have five tory prime ministers and seven chancellor our community can not survive another five week of the tories let alone five year they simply can not be trust with our economy our community be bad off after year of conservative government it be time for the british people to have their say and to decide how they feel after year of tory failure the general election can not come soon enough so my message to the prime minister be to get on and call it it be great pleasure to follow the hon member for merthyr tydfil and rhymney gerald jones not least to inject little context into this afternoon debate the truth be that this country be reel but it be not reel from year of tory cut it be reel from the most extraordinary period of economic shock that this country have ever see remind opposition members that the city crash in cost we billion in quantitative easing under the then right hon member for kirkcaldy and cowdenbeath brexit cost we billion in qe the pandemic cost we billion and the support that the government put in place to help hard press family with the energy crisis follow the war in ukraine cost billion this country have be through perfect storm of unprecedented once in year or year event with which we be all struggle welcome this budget will say something about the cost of live relief for rural area such as mid norfolk and something about growth and how we can get this country out of the huge risk of stagflation arise from the sequence of event that have just describe in global race for science and technology investment we have to move fast and be bold to unlock that investment the pandemic and the ukraine war have be unprecedented shock particularly to the rural economy unbelievable cost of live inflation have hit rural area particularly hard how much hard the treasury calculate that the differential cost impact be about hard in rural area because of high transport cost high heating cost high dependence on agriculture food processing and high energy industry low income marginality and rurality very high proportion of retire pensioner on fix income and rural council that have be structurally underfunde for decade by whitehall that do not understand rural area we put up with it for year during an era of cheap energy but high energy cost have hit our public service our charity our business and our household hard be very grateful for the support that the chancellor have provide but will continue to make the case that rural area deserve more support and more targeted support for very particular set of rural problem in this budget welcome the fuel duty freeze the household support fund the cost of childcare relief the child benefit measure the alcohol duty freeze the national insurance cut worth for the average worker include the self employ the sme recovery loan scheme the sme vat threshold move and the pension triple lock be fix at which be four time the forecast rate of inflation this be chancellor do everything he possibly can to help the most vulnerable and the most deserving in our society in norfolk particularly welcome the investment in new special free school for child with special educational need and disability that cause be close to my heart the accelerated east west rail delivery that be crucial to unlock our region potential and the sport facility in rural mid norfolk there be good news in very tough budget most of all welcome the chancellor measure to support growth in the innovation economy include the billion for the nhs in addition to the billion productivity plan that will unlock an extra billion accord to the nhs there be funding for the faraday discovery fellowship this country low earth orbit leadership the expert advisory group on tax relief the million for the alan turing institute the million for our life science research charity the million for the agrifood launchpad and the million for the cambridge cluster that be investment in the long term growth of tomorrow on which we all depend in order to get out of this extraordinary year triple whammy of crisis that this country have go through opposition member do not seem to understand that we can not tax our way to prosperity and we can not spend our way to it interruption know they do not want to hear it but it be the truth for prosperity we need to do two big thing the first of which be reform our public sector to tackle the productivity crisis properly be proud to say that this government in the year have be here have increase health spending by third but we can not see that outcome on the ground that be because the healthcare system be structurally gear it be not any one party fault in way that say if you deliver more for less we give you less from the treasury we punish innovation and we reward inefficiency and that have to change welcome quite lot that the shadow health secretary have say about reform it the real key however be growth as have consistently argue for year we have to do more to support innovation lead growth as that be the only form of growth that drive up productivity create new industry and drive global inward investment with stubborn debt and the risk from all of the shock that have outline still with we that be more urgent than ever we will never get out of this crisis by short term house price boom short term consumer boom and boom in the city we have to do it by attract private sector investment into the high growth sector of life science agritech bioengineere clean tech fusion energy semiconductor robotic tidal energy satellite manufacturing and quantum computing we be powerhouse in science and research but we be not yet powerhouse in attract the global billion into those sector and turn they into solution around the world that innovation be the key both to private sector recovery and of course to public sector reform particularly in health which be the big public service drive the structural deficit we need to introduce much fast wave of innovation in artificial intelligence and all sort of digital health with early prevention and well diagnosis in that way we can reduce the appalling problem of pour money in and get less out on the ground time be very short mr deputy speaker but want just to my time be up but let conclude by say that order as the hon gentleman say time be up be terribly sorry call sir chris bryant warmly support the measure in the budget to help the creative industry but simply say to the government that it do not work without guarantee creative education for every child in all our school it do not work if kid in the rhondda do not get an equal opportunity to think of job in the creative industry along with anybody else in this country and it simply do not work if minister constantly deride creative industry and humanity degree we can not have one thing without the other there be thing that feel desperately sad about there be nothing in the budget for the people of the rhondda most of the change to taxation and to child benefit will benefit people who earn far far more than the average in the rhondda be sorry but have to say to the hon member for mid norfolk george freeman that it be the conservative party that be tax more it be give with one hand and take twice as much away with the other it take particular skill to have the high tax take for year rise every year of the chancellor forecast and the big fall in living standard and the prospect of swinge cut in public service still to come want to talk about growth because it have be anaemic for all year the conservatives have be in charge if we want growth first we have to take the whole nation with we fail to level up simply be not an option which be why feel so angry about the preposterous levelling up process use by this government they make level up competition between local authority worse they make the poor local authority in the land which be already strap for cash compete with one another for tiny scrap of cash the government side step any proper assessment of need in many case intentionally ignore deprivation index when consider where cash should go thus the prime minister wealthy constituency get million and last week million of levelling up fund go to canary wharf the government dole out cash to constituency on the notorious tory mp at risk register with million here and million there it be shameless it be degrade for mps and it be utterly corrupt few than one in five project grant levelling up cash through the tories town fund have be complete even though the whole point be that these have to be ready project that could be complete by the end of the relevant financial year that work out at only of project that take on to the rhondda tunnel as at least four cabinet ministers and more than dozen junior ministers have tell to put in levelling up bid for it but every time meet minister to discuss it they get move sometimes they get move before get to meet they sometimes wonder whether they get move because be go to meet they first we be tell we could bid in round but then we be tell we could not we be then tell what about round then we be tell there be not go to be round because the government have already allocate the cash to guess what conservative constituency then be tell that we should put together special bespoke bid of our own last week be tell by minister that they have give up on level up that be basically the message we have get this be no way to run whelk stall secondly we can not achieve growth in the uk economy unless we have fully function nhs significant number of the nearly million people on the waiting list it be million before covid be desperate to get back to work but they be wait for the surgery or treatment that make that possible let give the house an instance of that in be ask by the right hon member for bromsgrove sir sajid javid the then health secretary to co chair programme board to set national strategy for acquire brain injury know that official have try their good but yet again the ministers have keep on change be now on my fourth and every deadline get push back so we still do not have national strategy if we could get proper neurorehabilitation for everyone who have brain injury in the uk about million people we could give more people with brain injury back real quality of life and we could get more people with brain injury into work earn money rather than rely on the state sadly the department tell there be not even money to pay for establish how many people be live with brain injury let alone put together impactful strategy that be false economy in the end thirdly growth in our country depend on national infrastructure that work every time train be cancel or delay someone waste another couple of hour and our economy become just little bit less productive how on earth do the country that invent the telephone the television and the worldwide web end up spend million of pound every year on legacy it system just to keep the show on the road why be it only now that the government be put money into digitise the nhs properly why be wi fi on our train so completely hopeless why can the french do it well than we why have vast tract of our country be trap in mobile phone notspot it be shameful legacy but that be the legacy of this government the right hon member for chelsea and fulham greg hands say the voter should just judge they on their record yes suspect that people will in the word write on the wall at belshazzar feast thou art weigh in the balance and find want welcome this budget it continue the prime minister and the chancellor clear plan to get the economy back on track follow the twin global shock of the pandemic and putin illegal invasion of opposition member do not like to hear it they can chunter from sedentary position but those be fact through target tax cut both for business and individual this budget will put more money back into the pocket of hard work family and people in southend and leigh on sea and set our country back on course for growth we should remember two fact about this conservative government record we have create the right economic environment to create job every day of this government and in the last two year when people have be suffer because of the cost of living crisis the government have give on average in help this government create job but do not forget people when they need help will use my time to talk about the thing that benefit southend southend be city of entrepreneur successful large and small business borough plating and keymed unique and interesting shop fabulous seafront hostelry adventure island and year of the fishing industry be proud to stand up for those business in this place all of they will benefit to less or great extent from this budget be delighted that the chancellor listen to and other colleague regard the need to reform the vat threshold to make life easy for small business which be the engine of our local economy in southend west the reform will take thousand of business across the region out of pay vat make it easy for southend sme to grow create more job and ultimately more income for the exchequer and well public service similarly welcome the news we be freeze alcohol duty benefit pub restaurant club and venue across the east of england take with our action at the autumn statement to extend the business rate relief for retail hospitality and leisure until as well as freeze the small business multiplier this be another welcome win for our tourism and hospitality sector in southend and leigh on sea

benefit the vast majority of resident in southend and leigh on sea work hard they work full time and they own their own house they deserve to keep as much of their own money as possible fundamental conservative principle welcome the fact that in this budget the government be again cut national insurance for million work people combine with the cut make in the last autumn statement the average work person in southend west and leigh earn year will keep an additional next year hard work family in southend with two earner on the average income will be well off next year because of this budget

on an average wage will be well off by on top of the brilliant work they do cut crime across our city also welcome the announcement that the chancellor be once again continue the freeze on fuel duty and maintain the reduction introduce last year some of southend household have at least one car and of my constituent drive to work member on the government benches help our hard work motorist and white van man in stark contrast with the labour mayor of london who fleece motorist whenever he can the family be the cornerstone of our society the conservative party will always support hard work family for whom child benefit be often lifeline be delighted that almost half million family will benefit from the change to the high income child benefit charge with family no long pay it at all from april the high income child benefit charge threshold will be raise to with the top of the taper at which it be withdraw rise to that mean that half million family include thousand of hard work family across southend west will save an average of year we be also the party that respect our elderly and our senior citizen when my child be young and take they to music lesson we be tell to always tell they three positive thing before tell they anything negative have say three positive thing but while be pleased we protect the triple lock the freezing of income tax threshold mean many pensioner be now pay increase tax ask the chancellor to look again at that issue and to ensure that at the next fiscal event our pensioner do not miss out on further tax cut this budget be huge disappointment nothing the chancellor say last week change the reality face my constituent in stretford and urmston their taxis be still rise their weekly shop be still more expensive and their mortgage remain sky high this be the price of year of economic failure the high tax burden in year and the only parliament on record in which living standard have fall it come just week after we learn that the prime minister who promise we growth have in fact lead we into recession thankfully the leader of the opposition set out an alternative in his response to the budget that grasp fundamental truth the only path to grow our economy be to get britain build again and that start with build the home that we need despite that there be next to nothing in the budget to reverse stall house building nothing to tackle the affordability crisis and nothing to help renter the sad truth be that none of that be surprise why would we expect plan reform to stimulate economic growth from party that ditch house building target to satisfy tory back benchers with an estimate billion of economic activity lose as result why would we expect support for renter from party that still have not ban no fault eviction some five year on from first promise to do so why would we expect the action that we need on homelessness when the government have allow it to soar on their watch with more than child now live in temporary accommodation if we need reminder of what happen when we strip local government of funding fail to build social housing and let poverty spiral we get it last week with the tragic news that child die between and with temporary accommodation cite as contributory factor to their death the moral case for tackle our housing crisis be clear but give the theme of today debate will talk about the economic case which be also overwhelming as policy exchange have say our chronic shortage of housing be key reason for our stagnant economic growth supply not meet demand have generate problem after problem for our economy with weak spending power for the average family who have see an increase in the amount of their income go on housing cost supply not meet demand be the cause of all of this an unbalanced lending environment in which bank credit be suck into high mortgage and away from more productive area of our economy and the vast cost of homelessness and unaffordable housing both to the state and to the people affect who be deny the support that they need to unleash their potential all of that be before we get on to the economic distortion cause by our broken housing market with of household wealth belong to old generation while the young generation see their earning disappear into sky high rent and elevated mortgage rate directly link to the decision make by this tory government this budget fail to grasp the nettle on housing why be there next to nothing on our antiquated planning rule which allow the minority who enjoy the security of home of their own to deny that same right to the many thousand stick on housing waiting list why be there nothing on reform of the green belt which in my constituency include former oil site far from green and pleasant land why under our current planning system be the need of tory back benchers the artificially construct green belt and other factor consider more sacred by the government than the precious principle that each generation should do well than the last labour have different set of priority our commitment to reform planning rule reintroduce house building target build on the part of the green belt that be in fact far from green and restore social housing as part of our effort to build million home will be key driver in our mission to achieve the fast growth in the just think what that ambition will mean for our economy accord to oxford economics for every new home build more than job will be create and tax revenue could rise by as much as billion year but ambition be in short supply in this budget it be another opportunity waste by this government but thankfully their opportunity be run out it be time for change it be time to build the home we need it be time to build for growth it be time for labour government after pandemic and an unprecedented energy price hike cause by putin illegal war what the chancellor have achieve be remarkable through careful stewardship he have enable whole new set of opportunity over the next five year for further tax cut investment and sustain economic growth tough decision when they be need make investment commitment and tax cut possible now the only way spending and tax cut can be achieve sustainably be to achieve real growth in the economy the false growth of the reckless bubble economy that we see under gordon brown end in an almighty bust of financial crisis and unemployment we should not forget that the self inflict reckless boom and bust that we get from labour add much more to public sector net debt than the combination of an energy crisis and an unavoidable pandemic that cost the taxpayer billion there be very tell debt to gdp graph on page of the red book of course it be only because conservative economic policy return we to path of fall debt before the pandemic hit that that be affordable the only time the previous labour government reduce debt be when they initially stick to conservative spending plan before turn on the tap couple of year later create false growth and an all too real and deep recession stoke on trent lose some of the large pottery on earth as result of labour mismanagement and self inflict crisis in contrast under the conservatives the gross value add of the ceramic sector have double in real term we must not jeopardise that with an emission trading scheme that threaten similar damage to labour climate change levy from which ceramic be rightly exempt by george osborne we should not offshore the ceramics industry emission and skilled job to country with bad environmental standard but that be exactly what happen when taxis and regulation be too onerous here hope the government will seriously consider exempt the ceramics industry from the ets there be good news in the budget for local advanced manufacturing include progress towards small modular reactor which stand to benefit company in the supply chain of the world lead engineering firm in stoke on trent be confident that the opportunity for further tax cut and investment in the year ahead open by this budget will be realise by re elect conservative government we need spend commitment on capital infrastructure project particularly in transport the tax cut give welcome relief to hard press work people who have be shoulder the burden of price rise and mortgage cost for more than long enough we have exceed expectation in north staffordshire by secure the government commitment to fund the reopening of both meir station and the stoke to leek line when labour be last in power it close local station at etruria barlaston and wedgwood what contrast we be just month away from be able to put shovel in the ground to reopen station at meir on the crewe to derby line be determined that we will also get station to serve the south west of stoke on trent and north staffordshire around barlaston or trentham when the work and pensions secretary recently visit stoke on trent say that well transport mean great access to skilled job the new rail station improvement to junction of the and upgrade of the corridor be possible only thank to the cancellation of phase of additionally million for stoke on trent and staffordshire be be reprioritise to fill pothole tackle congestion at junction in place such as meir and blythe bridge invest in new paving for our high street secure more preventive road maintenance and provide more bus priority measure build on the million we have already secure through the bus service improvement plan also new alternative provision free school be announce in the budget that will help ease the huge local pressure on ap and special educational need and disability school place across stoke on trent ensure that more child receive the appropriate place for their need and reduce pressure on mainstream provision only solid growth will sustainably support more people into employment just as it will support more investment in our infrastructure and vital public service be delighted with the focus on tackle long term unemployment and on increase labour force participation reward work and make it pay as for invest in important public service the chancellor be rightly tackle the issue with his billion digital transformation of the nhs alongside the extra billion of funding for our frontline nhs hope that investment will bolster more preventive and community base nhs service it be vital that in town such as longton we deliver fully on the new integrate care hub which would bring all nhs service together under one roof finally want to mention my private member bill to improve our high street which be progress through committee this week it be vital that we support the rejuvenation of our high street and help attract new us so particularly welcome the increase in the vat registration threshold which take it to that be welcome by staffordshire chamber of commerce in conclusion we can stick with the plan that be work sensibly pay down debt invest wisely and cut taxis for family and business when that be affordable or we can do what the labour party with its non existent plan have do since it take control of stoke on trent city council throw everything up in the air and roll back important investment project and ambition for our city while put up taxis to pay for its mistake it be usually the monday of budget debate on which the detail start to unravel but just as with the selective amnesia that take hold in september and october this budget sort of unravelled as soon as the chancellor sit down that be not because of the enthusiasm of his delivery he sound very much like bored train announcer but because of the three disgraceful omission from the budget we in this parliament know that there be at least three issue that this parliament should deal with before it end the first of course be the infected blood scandal and compensation the second be the post office scandal and compensation for those catch up in that and the third as we will discover in debate tomorrow be bear woman those be three big ticket expenditure item of compensation that will have to be deliver if this parliament do that it might well be know as the justice parliament but the people catch up in those three issue be angry that billion of unfunded tax cut have be give away probably at their expense they believe because there be no mention of those injustice and how to correct they it be no wonder that so many furious people catch up in those scandal have react to the budget in the way they have today debate have be dominate by two world the government world describe by member on the conservative benches and the real world describe by hon member on the opposition benches notice that not one government member mention the fact that the tax gap for those who should pay corporation tax have increase over the past couple of year there may well be reason for that let we explore one of they perhaps if the government give the same funding to the operation in his majesty revenue and customs that be responsible for go after the wealthy as they do to those deal with social security fraud and employ the same number of people to do both the corporation tax gap would not be increase but would have reduce however the main and fundamental difference between member on the opposition benches and those on the government benches be that the latter do not understand what be happen in the country people look at their energy bill and see the energy company profit skyrocket they look at bank profit and they notice that their bank branch be close and that their mortgage be increase they look at the ramping up of insurance premium and the insurance company profit increase then they see that the cost of food in supermarket be go up to an astronomical level and so be the supermarket profit these vast profit have not reduce price it be suppose to be the great conservative party theory that if company make vast profit price will reduce but that have not happen in this cost of living crisis that be why believe as my hon friend do that we really need to start look at an excess profit tax until we do people out there will feel that the government be treat they as fool it be time for the company make these vast profit to start pay their fair share we have hear from government members that work have to pay that be fascinating come from the government as an employer the simple fact be that ten of thousand of worker employ by the state by for example the department for work and pensions or hmrc believe that their employer the government be minimum wage employer because the only time they get an increase in their pay be when the so call national living wage increase it be unsustainable when those work for the state to administer and deliver social security benefit be on pay that be so low that they receive those same social security benefit and that be fact that no government member can deny if the government really want serious conversation about make work pay perhaps they can review their public sector pay policy public sector pay be not burden on the state or the taxpayer when the government pay proper wage people spend they in the private sector economy if the government really want to grow the economy they could start by pay their worker well what we see last week be budget with no vision no plan for get we to net zero no plan to drive investment in renewable and low emission technology no plan to boost the roll out of electric vehicle and no plan for retrofit home the british people deserve well than that the windfall tax on oil and gas profit that the government extend by one year until will raise an additional billion accord to the chancellor as the tax introduce in may raise billion in its first year think what those billion could do if they be properly direct towards our net zero goal the fund from the windfall tax could be ringfence for renewable energy fix our grid green skill training and secure the well pay job of the future our green transition but they just disappear into treasury black hole when will the government end the absurd practice of subsidy for industrial scale wood burn we hear nothing about this in the budget last week drax power station burn wood pellet import from north america to produce energy it have have subsidy of billion of taxpayer money and it be consider renewable energy power station drax depend on government subsidy for its support when drax be coal power plant it emit million tonne of carbon in drax now burn wood emit million tonne of carbon drax be the uk big emitter of the fund that subsidise drax could be redirect to fund genuinely green and renewable technology but under this government these fund be fuel the climate crisis my hon friend the member for worsley and eccles south barbara keeley give an excellent speech include on the crisis in live music venue support the tax credit for the film industry the video game industry and orchestra why be there not tax credit for live music venue we labour members have vision for britain of green sustainable energy future and we have plan to deliver it labour will introduce proper windfall tax on the massive profit of oil and gas company in government labour will go far than the conservatives and raise the windfall tax on oil and gas profit from to until labour government will create new national wealth fund with billion to be invest in the job that can rebuild britain industrial strength we will crowd in private investment in our port gigafactorie and hydrogen and protect our steel industry which the government have allow to fail labour will create great british energy new publicly own energy company that will champion green energy to give we real energy independence great british energy will invest in and deliver project in partnership with the private sector with our commitment to an ambitious billion capitalisation of great british energy we will invest in clean home grow power which will cut britain energy bill great british energy will invest in lead edge clean energy technology such as float offshore wind hydrogen and tidal labour be committed to clean power by and will pioneer offshore tidal by fast tracking at least gw of capacity more than double our onshore wind capacity to gw more than triple solar power to gw and quadruple offshore wind our ambition be for gw we will also double the government target on green hydrogen so that there be gw particularly for use in the steel industry labour british job bonus plan will boost new clean energy job clean energy developer will be reward with british job bonus if they invest in good job and supply chain here at home labour will allocate fund of up to million start in to invest in those industry and it will guarantee new job in those industry the government steal number of labour policy last week so perhaps they will think about those one as well they have clearly miss an opportunity to create our energy transition after year of conservative failure on climate change labour be ready to invest in britain clean energy future we be ready to make britain world leader on climate change drive investment in renewable and low emission technology transform our energy sector to lower our power bill and create good clean energy job for britain future it be pleasure to follow my hon friend the member for leeds north west alex sobel give my maiden speech in the budget debate this time last year so be feel little reflective and reminiscent and have find myself reflect on the past year and on what have change in what state do we find the economy year on supermarket price be still rise living standard be fall the tax burden be at record high and there be still no real sign of interest rate come down to where they be before the tory mini budget tank the economy but one thing have change the chancellor and the prime minister have manage to put the country into recession at time when every other economy in the except one be grow the conservative party have fall asleep at the wheel and the uk economy be get small as result have the uk economy grow at the average rate of oecd nation over the past decade it would be billion large today that would have contribute an additional billion in tax revenue to invest in our public service let we be clear the economic issue we face today be the result of year of mismanagement of the country finance the government be out of idea and fast run out of time the economic reality that we face in britain today be pale and weak imitation of the sunny upland promise by the conservative party at every election since britain have always be country where we be proud to pay our taxis we understand that by contribute from what we earn we fund the public service that we all rely on road school the nhs so with taxis at their high since the war britain public service must be the envy of the world right sadly not they be creak at the seam time and again hear from constituent how hard it be to get an appointment with doctor or register with dentist school budget have be strip to the bone and teacher be have to fund pen and pencil from their own pocket our road be litter with pothole many route in west lancashire be border on dangerous give the state they have be leave in taxis be at record high and public service be on their knee the national debt have treble since the government be give work people raw deal the state of our economy be not an accident but choice conservative chancellors choose to impose austerity on public service and to let the covid fraudster get away with billion of taxpayer money it be conservative chancellor who rush through the kamikwasi budget crash the economy those be choice that the conservative party make know that work people would foot the bill be glad that the chancellor decide to draw inspiration from the labour benches scrap the non dom status be choice that we on this side can get behind but why have it take so long the shadow chancellor have be call for non dom to pay their fair share for two year that be billion that the chancellor have leave on the billion that could have be fund our school hospital and road and use to relieve the pressure on household bill face with the bad poll rating on record the chancellor be so desperate to cut national insurance that he have introduce policy on non dom that he have consistently argue against since get his job he have even promise to abolish national insurance altogether but that leave billion unfunded hole in the economy work people be still bad off for every the chancellor give with one hand he take with the other the average family will be bad off under his plan it get bad someone with mortgage in tory britain in will have hundred of pound add to their bill this summer we be set to see even more mortgage get even high at the end of their term there be nothing in the budget for parent the elderly or first time buyer in fact be not sure what the budget have for anyone there be certainly nothing for the loan charge or infected blood scandal not much at all other than gimmick and unfunded promise whether at by election or in the polling it be the labour party that voter be choose to trust with the economy it be about time the government give they chance to decide it be time for general election it be disappointing to see the government again attempt to pull the wool over the eye of my constituent in somerton and frome go into the budget the public be clear they desperately want the crisis affect our public service to be prioritise but once again the government have neglect to address it the office for budget responsibility state that public spending per head have fall by in the past three year the budget do nothing to rectify that and nothing to provide an immediate fix for our nhs in fact the extra billion only avert real term cut and be not an increase on this year spending by the end of million people in the uk be economically inactive for health more since before the covid pandemic if we want to grow the economy we need to fix the nhs but once again the government refuse to do that my constituent in somerton have be unable to see dentist for over four year that be simply not good enough but it be no surprise give that there be near decline in the number of dentist in somerset between and currently there be just one dentist in somerset for almost patient leave many people without access to care and in dental agony the issue be also prevalent in lewes where the dentist crisis have become so severe that the ringmer dental practice will be offer only private treatment the practice blame chronic lack of investment in nhs dentistry this be disgrace with the tax burden already at its high since the second world war through unfair tory stealth taxis the liberal democrats would seek to properly fund our public service in fair way we would reverse the conservative tax cut for the big bank which could generate billion over five year we would also put proper windfall tax on oil and gas giant generate furth billion over five year the chancellor promise growth in public spending totally fail to recognise the pressure that the country be face the budget be so short sighted agree with the former liberal democrat leader and business secretary vince cable who say that the budget leave booby trap as it fail to recognise the pressure that an age population will place on our public service like many rural county somerset have an age population and the average age in somerton and frome be year spiral financial pressure on adult social care be ever increase that have be constantly and loudly raise by leader in local government yet the government have fail once again to recognise and understand that two care home one locally in frome in my constituency and the other just outside have recently warn that they may have to close due to significant financial pressure potentially leave nearly vulnerable and elderly resident displace those care home provide an essential service if they close resident will have nowhere to go locally it should not have to be like this why be we leave our elderly with such pressure at time when the system should be there to look after and care for they ultimately it be clear that the chancellor and the prime minister have provide budget that do not offer people security in the public service they rely on the system be break the situation be not sustainable the government have squeeze service dry and merely pay lip service to those who rely on they hope that the prime minister do not bottle it like his chancellor but call may election so that my constituent get the change of government they deserve mr deputy speaker the budget be an opportunity for government to demonstrate their priority and what we see yesterday be conservative government content to oversee the manage decline of the report march vol it be nearly year since say those word about the chancellor last spring budget what have change quite simply nothing the chancellor fail to announce anything that will significantly improve the life of people live in luton south and bedfordshire his budget just lift the lid on year of tory economic failure conservative government in their end day bereft of idea lack in vision consume by their own internal strife we be head for this be the only parliament on record in which people will be on average bad off at the end than they be at the start that should make government member feel ashamed take issue with the chancellor state that the conservatives bring down taxis as the uk have its high tax burden in year and it will rise in every year of the budget forecast period all in all what the budget actually mean for my constituent be that each household be now bad off under the conservatives tax plan for every give in tax cut have be take give with one hand and take more with the other the conservatives follow that up by say they have plan to abolish national insurance contribution altogether an unfunded pledge cost the taxpayer gigantic billion the reality be that the conservatives can not be trust to run britain public service be be run down local government be on its knee and work people be battle the cost of living crisis try to make end meet community like mine in luton and bedfordshire know that that be not just the story come out of the budget it be the continue story of the conservative party dismantle our community and wreck our economy over the past year for they it be always party first country second the big issue that my constituent contact about be the lack of affordable housing to rent and council housing waiting list yet in this budget the chancellor have wind down the scheme for extra funding for the delivery of social housing and end the policy of let local authority keep of revenue from the sale of council home to help they build more that will heap further pressure on our already overstretch underfunded local authority and it will do little to help family live in overcrowded poor quality insecure housing as say in my budget speech year ago the budget represent huge opportunity to break from year of stagnation and unlock britain potential but that opportunity be well and truly ignore may sound like broken record but the reality be that we have broken government who simply be not up to the challenge it be our job in this place to advocate for policy that enable our constituent to live good fulfil life that mean good job secure home safe street quality public service and thriving economy the conservatives have fail on all count enough be enough people in luton and bedfordshire need change in government instead of the chaos and recklessness under the conservatives labour be ready to fight for the living standard of work people and to deliver sustainable plan for growth we will rebuild our ability to make do and sell more here in britain so that we be less expose to global shock we will strengthen the power available to local community to regenerate their high street and town centre our plan also back british business through new industrial strategy to maximise britain strength in the life science the digital creative and financial industry clean power and the automotive sector that be the bright future that luton bedfordshire and britain deserve it be time to quit the uncertainty and call general election now will touch first on art funding as member of parliament who have number of art institution base in my glasgow central constituency gently welcome the theatre orchestra museum and gallery exhibition tax relief the royal scottish national orchestra have say that the relief ensure the rsno remain committed to serve scotland community concert hall and school however that come in wide context as the musicians union have point out of cut to the art over many year it have talk about the impact of decade of austerity general secretary naomi pohl say that she fear frankly we be stuff if labour government do not put money into the art there need to be some change to ensure that our music and art venue can continue the rsno have do huge amount to diversify what it do it be involve in make music for motion picture as well as fill concert hall in the city of glasgow and other place besides it have ask that the uk government consider proposal to exempt employer in the cultural sector from national insurance which would encourage company to bring worker often use on freelance basis into employment that be particularly important give how many freelancer particularly female freelancer be exclude from support during covid leave that for minister to consider will ministers go far on vat to encourage people back out to enjoy cultural event and bring life back to our city and town centre music ticket have vat on they be real inhibitor to that this budget should have be moment to bridge the funding gap for our public service which they so desperately need instead the budget appear more concerned with set trap for future labour government the conservative party be once again bring its own naked political interest into government and we be all leave pay the cost it be money for canary wharf not the calton or cowcaddens or kinning park the concern raise by organisation such as the child poverty action group should not be ignore the stark reality be that there be little in the budget to address the crisis condition be experience by child and family live in poverty the chancellor claim that the government do not pass their bill on to the next generation ring particularly hollow when million child live in poverty in the uk today who do he think will be this next generation the decision take in this budget risk leave legacy of million of young people live with the scar and the real harm of grow up in poverty hunger poor educational outcome the health risk associate with cold and damp home and stagnant economic growth lead to few opportunity the glasgow centre for population health have comment particularly movingly on this lose year of austerity and its impact on public health it say that it could take another year just to get we back to where we be in opportunity have be lose for so many people as result call on the government yet again as do at every budget to scrap the two child limit on universal credit at the moment family be affect by the policy which be life limit and damaging it be make it more difficult for large family to put food on the table and it be drive they to almost impossible choice the government must scrap it equally shameful be that the labour party will not scrap it either those young people be be condemn to life live in poverty that be not good enough and the government should do well they could bring in the equivalent of the scottish child payment which be now per child per week for eligible family it be help to keep those family out of the food bank and protect the life chance of those child they could increase the healthy start benefit to the level of good start food so that family do not have to go to food bank to get infant formula as they could afford those thing if they require they there be serious gendere impact of the government policy the women budget group have highlight the regressive nature of cut to national insurance the cut disproportionately affect lone mother and couple with child single man will receive around more than lone mother and couple without child will receive more than more per year than family half the benefit go to the wealthy household and only to the poor yet again the government cut taxis for tory voter on the back of the people who can afford it the very least be warp there need to be lot more support for public service and infrastructure great cost of live measure and just transition the obr point out that there be no real growth in departmental spending per person over the next five year this tory government be commit to that and labour be committed to copy and paste that policy scotland deserve well than this break break westminster government we want well than uk that have be declare the world second most miserable country behind uzbekistan with of respondent distress or struggle at the bad in scotland we think of what we could have ireland with its budget surplus and norway with its oil fund scotland deserve much well than this we deserve independence unsurprisingly jim shannon be the last back bench contributor we have bit more time so be not put on time limit know the hon member will not abuse my generosity could any member who have participate in the debate start to make their way to the chamber for the wind up thank you mr deputy speaker will not tax the patience or endurance of my fellow member and my contribution will be the same length as other it be real pleasure to speak in this debate on the spring budget deliver by the chancellor last week it be important that we be here individually and collectively to speak on this issue and must ensure that all my constituent feel support financially my office have receive large amount of email letter and phone call about how so many people be struggle especially over the last couple of month that have be echo by member on both side of the chamber but particularly on the opposition benches and think we really understand our constituent would also like to thank the chancellor as these decision be not easy to take but regardless of that there be need that must be meet be very pleased to hear about the step take to move in the right direction on the child benefit threshold member include the minister will be aware that last year introduce minute rule bill which call for threshold to be determine by household income instead of individual income there be many on both side of the chamber who hold similar opinion it be good news that the chancellor and the government recognise that the bill aim to highlight the unfairness of the current threshold whereby single income home earn or above would not receive an entitlement but dual income home earn each would be in receipt of the payment that be real anomaly and be very pleased that the chancellor the government and other with the power to change the legislation have do so it be no secret that be very passionate about this issue have raise it on numerous occasion over the past few year while this be welcome news look to the minister for further clarity on the household income level in term of inflation the increase to the low threshold be positive but if working class family do not notice the difference in line with inflation they be ultimately still go to struggle perhaps the minister could provide we with some clarity on that many have express gratitude at the decision to cut national insurance at the start of the new tax year be go to give slightly different opinion base on correspondence from my constituent emphasise that in line with the rate of inflation it be about ensure the benefit of the cut be truly feel for instance one hon member say that the cut would not help the elderly because they do not pay national insurance at pension age have also speak to many health professional who have openly say that on the basis that our nhs and so on would be properly fund they would not mind continue to pay the current rate of national insurance give the lack of funding in our nhs there be many who would be willing to pay just that little bit extra to get more efficient local service perhaps that be something the minister could consider know there be consensus among many in the chamber that national insurance contribution should be cut or stop but think they could be use for something well my position would be to retain they as they be perhaps the minister could look at that and ascertain how much well off our constituent could be another issue relate to the million people live in oil heated home in rural community such as my constituency who want to do their bit for the environment most people speak to whatever their class in society want to do something for the environment but they be be disincentivise from adopt renewable liquid fuel currently renewable liquid fuel that have low carbon emission be tax while fossil fuel heating oil be not scrap the tax on renewable liquid fuel in the budget would have reduce their cost and make they viable alternative to use fossil fuel that again be perhaps an anomaly in the chancellor speech and one that need to be address the government can still ensure that off grid household can decarbonise in an affordable manner by deliver the renewable liquid heating fuel obligation consultation assurance be give by ministers during the report stage of the energy bill that the government would move to consultation in the next few month that be over six month ago figure that few month be less than six month therefore suggest that we should have some indication of what be happen perhaps the minister could explain why this be miss opportunity in the spring budget will he also provide assurance on when the rlhfo consultation will be publicise and we will have an idea about what exactly it will mean these decision be never easy to take and we be grateful for the effort make however my party the democratic unionist party and be strong voice for all family but in particular working class family why be that it be because most of we on the opposition benches there will be some on the other side of the house never have very much for most of their life when speak for my constituent who be work class speak on the basis of knowledge and genuine interest the working class family in my constituency hope to reap the benefit of these decision and want that to happen but there be much to be do to enable it to happen hope that the minister and his department can provide the answer to the query that have be pose today let we make real change not just for my constituent in strangford but for all family in this great united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland there be much to welcome in the budget but there be some point that need clarification call the shadow secretary of state for culture media and sport to open the wind up speech it be always pleasure to follow the hon member for strangford jim shannon this evening will be tell positive economic story one that be about commercial growth and success alongside community benefit strong story of what labour do in power in partnership with the private sector but let say first that there can be no avoid the catastrophe that be this budget and indeed this government for the people of bristol and for the whole country record low for living standard gdp per capita low since the prime minister take office debt triple nothing in the budget will change any of that as we have hear from member include my hon friend the members for sheffield central paul blomfield for denton and reddish andrew gwynne for birkenhead mick whitley for lewisham deptford vicky foxcroft for liverpool west derby ian byrne for chesterfield mr perkins for merthyr tydfil and rhymney gerald jones for stretford and urmston andrew western for west lancashire ashley dalton and for luton south rachel hopkins everything be break work people be struggle under the cost of living crisis public service be in turmoil crime be make our street unsafe housing cost be high mortgage be rise and homelessness be increase as direct result of government action my constituent our constituent be live through this experience rise rent and soar food price because of the shamble that be this government their failure to take responsibility almost beggar belief have we not lose nearly two decade of wage growth the average worker would have be well off in than in not accord to

have highlight the importance of music venue and thank they for that culture and sport bring we joy and they bring we together culture sport and medium also have significant contribution to make to the health and economic growth of our great nation have see that when campaign for and visit labour candidate keir cozens in great yarmouth heidi alexander and will stone in swindon jayne kirkham in truro and falmouth and josh fenton glynn in calder valley labour parliamentary candidate have show around their cultural and sporting organisation they really get this they be already champion in their community simon opher in stroud catherine fookes in monmouthshire rachel blake in westminster and claire hazelgrove in filton and bradley stoke as well as so many other have talk to with passion and knowledge about what they see as the detrimental effect of year of tory rule government cut to play field local venue local charity and youth service can not wait to see those candidate in this place stand up for their community on this side of the house we know that culture medium and sport be economic powerhouse if they be give true champion as all our candidate would be these industry can still soar higher for example the creative industry be already worth billion to our economy they be major employer support million job across the uk the edinburgh fringe be worth about billion to scotland the english premier league and its club contribute billion to the uk economy in and account for broadcast export of billion in to say nothing of its soft power abroad our public service broadcaster the bbc channel itv and channel invest billion in new uk base content in despite cut from the conservative party the video game industry in dundee have bring with it increase in productivity in the city imagine that or even just fraction of it across this country what we could do the major sporting event support by uk sport in generate million in direct economic impact the uk win medal at those event which include the first ever blind football world championship for woman film making in northern ireland pump million directly into the regional economy between and basketball in the uk be already experience unprecedented growth the british basketball league have see increase in viewership and sell out arena audiovisual medium in cardiff have an annual turnover of over million across more than firm and it be to cardiff that want to take we today with story in jane tranter and julie gardner launch bad wolf which visit last week get to step inside the tardis which be really cool the prelude to this story be decision take in by those same woman while work at the bbc jane and julie take the decision to produce the newly reboot doctor who in cardiff which change wales cardiff university researcher have pinpoint that decision as the moment when south wales creative cluster shift to world recognise excellence it pave the way for the first purpose build drama studio in wales and bbc broadcasting hub in cardiff with multiple uk and international creative company choose to base themselves in south wales but be give away the ending to the story in year after the decision about doctor who julie and jane set out to start their own company they want it to be base in wales because they know the place trust the crew and know that traditional investor do not have the same level of trust private investment be usually contingent on company be base close to traditional production centre such as london or los angeles but they be commit to wales because it make good business sense and because they see an opportunity to be transformational for community julie and jane could create job opportunity that span generation and give south wales local economy that it could be proud of and rely on for the first time since the mine close so they partner with wales labour government to set up in cardiff poetically they use the site of defunct factory that previously manufacture glass tube for television wales labour government and bad wolf then build on their partnership to create wolf studios wales the aim be to expand welsh production capacity to help continue to achieve cinematic production value on television budget which they have most definitely achieve they ensure that production be consistent across the year offer job security and career development across career in the five year between and bad wolf spend million in wales and generate million of gross value add for the welsh economy in that five year period the company employ people in some of the highest pay job in the country it have sustainability and circular economy principle at the heart of its business broaden access to career in the creative industry through its training programme with screen alliance wales bad wolf have be magnet for many kind of company from special effect to logistic and of local supplier have feel confident to relocate or locate to south wales because it be there bad wolf have also bring joy to million of we doctor who discovery of witches industry and his dark materials be all down to that incredible team but the labour government in wales play pivotal role the reason tell this story in some detail be because that be what we could do across the country with real champion and partnership between labour government the private sector and creative people people make art government do not but what the welsh labour government do in this case be to support an environment where creative people and business could thrive and in do so they bring job and economic development to wales that mean bring the tardis the city of cittàgazze the sonic screwdriver and canary wharf into the heart of south wales great thing start with story whether they be dream up or play out on the pitch great drama be unsurpassable one of our key strength in this country instead of fluctuate between ignore denigrate and occasionally recognise our world lead cultural and sporting institution as the conservatives do labour government would celebrate they labour government would work in partnership with they to support their growth and the great job that that growth would bring we want british fashion theatre sport architecture journalism gaming and publish to enjoy decade of national renewal and growth so that they can do even more for british worker and audience the government try to make this look like giveaway budget for the creative industry but continuation of what already exist glad as be to see they and one off capital injection be not panacea they do not make up for the last year and they do not come close to make up for soar energy bill and high inflation uncertainty instability and economic mismanagement have make the uk less attractive for investment the government treat art culture sport medium and the creative industry with disdain and there be no well illustration of this than the fact that there have be secretary of state for culture media and sport in year that be the high turnover of any cabinet level post which for this government be really say something the now chancellor be the only one who make it over the two year mark and the right hon member for chippenham michelle donelan do not even make it to six month another secretary of state be the former member for mid bedfordshire who after make frankly wild statement disappear and leave the next two postholder to try to roll back her decision her irresponsible decision to sell off channel be stop but she fracture the relationship between government and the creative industry and it will take so much long to heal than it do to break the government have consistently fail to recognise and realise the growth potential of the creative industry and of sport they have prevaricate over bring forward the football governance bill which have be lose down the back of the governmental sofa thereby fail to put football fan first and support the beautiful game on their watch local journalism have decline reduce the ability of our medium sometimes to call we out but always to scrutinise we and their half hearte attempt to protect creator in change technological landscape have largely disintegrate in tolerate this litany of failure the conservatives and the prime minister be fail to grasp the opportunity for growth part of that growth will involve harness the power of ai and other new technology labour believe in both human centre creativity and the potential of ai to unlock new frontier copyright and intellectual property right be how we protect the raw material of the creative industry creative output and imagination and we will support maintain and promote the uk strong copyright regime include in trade deal with other country while the conservatives be in power the cultural life of this country get hollow out because elitism do not bother they but as my hon friend have say there be no reason why young person bear in the poor part of this country should be any less capable or have any less potential than those bear in the rich part the investment that jane and julie make in bad wolf be follow up with time investment teaching and engagement with young people to show they that there be exciting well pay job on their doorstep and beyond and to make they feel part of this today my right hon and learn friend the member for holborn and st pancras keir starmer show that we will put this into practice at school with subject such as music art sport and drama which help to build confidence communication skill critical thinking problem solving and teamwork creativity and physical activity be not optional they be essential they bring we joy and it be joy that make life worth live everyone everywhere should be able to share in that joy and labour government will foster decade of national renewal with art sport and creativity at its heart together we will paint perform play sail swim film sing run dance design and write new more prosperous and more joyous story for britain it be my pleasure to close the second full day of debate on this year spring budget this be budget for long term growth and today we have hear number of excellent speech about the importance of growth in our economy despite multiple forecaster suggest that growth would be historically poor our economy grow last year and will grow this year and every year until the end of the next period that be because we be recover from the global pandemic shock of recent year far well than anyone expect inflation be down to and be on track to hit the target by the end of mortgage rate have come down from their peak real wage be rise and the imf have already predict that we will grow fast than germany france and italy in the next five year recognise that we be live through level of geopolitical uncertainty and risk that for many of we be unprecedented in our lifetime as my right hon friend the member for ashford damian green say we be navigate choppy water as we seek to balance optimism with uncertainty we seek to pave path towards responsible sustainable growth that will support family and firm in every part of this country to that end this budget have three key objective to reward work to grow the economy and to improve public sector productivity these objective work together because high growth mean more opportunity more prosperity and more funding for public service that be why we be cut national insurance contribution again for work people because simple fair tax system must be at the heart of our economy as my right hon friend the member for north east hampshire mr jayawardena have consistently champion it will mean more money in people pocket more revenue for business and more growth in our economy just as importantly it will send clear and unequivocal message that work must always pay this be fundamental conservative value as be our support for family my right hon friend the member for south holland and the deepings sir john hayes make powerful speech about the importance of the institution of the family which be something on which he and have consistently agree we have hear many comment about specific industry today and this budget contain suite of measure across sector and industry to keep our economy grow the hon member for mitcham and morden dame siobhain mcdonagh who be sadly not in her place mention life science and can tell she that build on the million of funding announce for the life science manufacturing sector in last year autumn statement in this budget we have announce million of joint government and industry investment from exist fund the chancellor announce in the budget speech that astrazeneca intend to invest million in cambridge and liverpool to boost our life science sector and to support the innovation so brilliantly champion by my hon friend the member for mid norfolk george freeman several members recognise the support for the creative industry there be one thing that we do well than almost any other country and that be make film and television from pride and prejudice to paddington our creative industry make we soft power superpower but they be also key driver of economic growth that support more than million job domestically that be why we have announce film studio business rate relief to reduce bill by some tax credit for uk independent film and more funding for the national film and television school this government will also make the current tax relief for theatre museum and gallery exhibition and orchestra permanent from april no other country provide tax relief for orchestra museum and gallery as we do this be budget for the performance sector and we be subject to characteristic minute performance by the shadow health secretary who be sadly no long in his place sometimes people talk too much but say too little in minute he fail to mention that in wales where labour be in charge of the nhs people be almost twice as likely to be wait for treatment as they be in nhs england this conservative budget be deliver billion extra for the nhs and invest billion to unlock billion of productivity gain investment be go into place such as the constituency of my hon friend the member for north herefordshire sir bill wiggin who give brilliant speech about the diagnostic centre at hereford county hospital and into maternity service as champion consistently by my hon friend the member for truro and falmouth cherilyn mackrory my lincolnshire neighbour my right hon friend the member for south holland and the deepings ask how we be support pensioner as my right hon friend the member for ludlow philip dunne point out we be do that through the triple lock which we introduce several year ago the state pension will increase by in april and be high than it be in as my hon friend the member for basildon and billericay mr baron highlight we be take action to boost pension return through the mansion house compact and series of other capital market reform my hon friend the member for southend west anna firth give an excellent speech about support small business and rightly highlight the chancellor decision to increase vat threshold from to my hon friend the member for penrith and the border dr hudson highlight the importance of the rural economy and speak comprehensively about the damage the labour party do to our economy up to would genuinely like to congratulate all member from across the house on their contribution this evening but particularly appreciate the brass neck wind up from the official opposition let we never forget that in labour leave office with few people in work more debt to pay off and deficit ballooning out of control let we contrast that with the uk in where despite have to deal with the bad pandemic in year the bad war in mainland europe since and the high energy spike since the this year we will have inflation back to target unemployment at record low wage rise taxis on work fall million more people on payroll since million few people pay any income tax at all the fast decarbonisation in the the high state pension we have ever see and total departmental spending up in cash term this parliament the last thing this country need now be five year hard labour for it be the conservatives who will push people up who want to succeed not pull they down when they do succeed who believe in the dignity of work which well deliver prosperity and who know that growth can not and should not solely come from the floor of this house of commons but instead should come from the thermal insulation factory floor of darlington and the ceramics factory floor of stoke on trent the worker and business will drive our growth this be budget for they and commend it to the house order that the debate be now wood debate to be resume tomorrow business without debate business of the house ordered that notice of amendment new clauses and new schedule to be move in committee in respect of the national insurance contributions reduction in rates no bill may be accept by the clerks at the table before it have be read second time mike wood joint committee on human rights ordered that david simmonds be discharge from the joint committee on human rights and miss sarah dines be bill wiggin on behalf of the committee of selection treasury ordered that emma hardy be discharge from the treasury committee and samantha dixon be bill wiggin on behalf of the committee of selection zero total allowable catch pollack motion make and question propose that this house do now wood be grateful for the opportunity to bring this debate to the house the subject might be consider fairly niche but it be incredibly important to many people in my constituency and across cornwall it be suggest my opening line should be never mind the pollack here the adjournment debate but of course could not possibly say that begin by thank the minister be grateful to he for respond to the debate he have be willing to engage and meet with colleague who have seek to raise concern about the issue over many week thank he for his engagement hope it will not end now as he have be work with we to find solution to the challenge he be aware that the decision to have zero total allowable catch for pollack which be make in december and take effect from january be damage the livelihood of many fisherman in cornwall it be estimate that upwards of boat that either operate out of or land their catch in mevagissey newquay and fowey in my constituency rely on pollack catch for significant amount of their income as have be report by the medium the hunkin family have say that they stand to lose around this year alone from the decision to have zero quota for pollack which represent about two third of their total revenue in fact the issue affect fishery across cornwall in the constituency of my hon friend the member for north cornwall scott mann boat would operate from padstow and port isaac and in the constituency of my hon friend the member for south east cornwall mrs murray boat would operate from looe polperro and in the far west newlyn the decision be have serious impact although pollack be catch from many port around the uk the decision have have disproportionate impact on the inshore fishing fleet that operate out of cornwall we all accept that the recommendation by the international council for the exploration of the seas that pollack should have zero quota put ministers and official from the department for environment food and rural affairs in an incredibly difficult position after that recommendation be make it would have be very difficult for the uk not to go along with it we all acknowledge that however as result of that decision many fisherman have their ability to make living take away overnight to put that in perspective the tonne of pollack quota that be available to vessel operate from cornish port represent loss of million to the cornish economy that loss impact not only fisherman but supply chain business that serve and support the fishing industry the harbourmaster at mevagissey andrew trevarton have estimate that the loss of pollack quota will result in loss of of mevagissey harbour income and there be no prospect of an easy way to replace that income it be difficult to overstate how important have thriving operate fishing port at mevagissey be to the economy of that village it attract about visitor every year largely because it be living operate fishing port not museum but thriving part of the fishing industry in cornwall commend the hon gentleman for secure the debate speak to he beforehand as he rightly say issue with pollack fishing seem to be more prevalent in the south west in northern ireland we do not have the same concern despite that allow certain fish to be catch only as bycatch be impact the livelihood of local fisherman do he agree that if these issue start to arise far afield than the south west for example in fishing port in northern ireland and the minister tonight decide to assist the hon gentleman the same grant and opportunity should extend to all area of the united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland the case that be make be on very specific issue the impact on specific part of our fishing industry of the removal of the pollack quota at such short notice we all want thriving fishing sector right across the united kingdom we want fisherman and business that support the sector to thrive and be profitable right across the uk we need policy that enable that to happen but what we face in cornwall and other part of the south west be very specific it relate to the short timeframe in which vessel and fisherman must adapt because the quota go from tonne to zero virtually overnight congratulate my constituency neighbour on secure tonight much need adjournment debate one fisherman say to that it be as though his right leg have be amputate and he must now get through the rest of the year on crutch until we can find way through this situation do my hon friend agree that all the option that we have be offer so far mean only displacement to different specie and way of catch fish and will therefore not be of any help to the long term prospect of the fishing industry in cornwall be grateful to my hon friend and neighbour for make the very next point that be go to come to one of the suggestion that have be make to the fisherman who have be affect by the decision be that they can switch to target other specie that be simple to say but not that simple to do partly because of the lack of time there be no lead up to the decision there be literally two week notice to switch to catch other specie fisherman need different equipment and for much of it there be lead time of several month before it can be deliver as my hon friend say switch to different specie simply displace the catch of other vessel the vessel that work hard target that other specie will then have to reduce their catch and perhaps look for something else which will also have knock on effect while appreciate the sentiment that these fisherman need to catch something else it really be not that simple certainly it be unrealistic to expect that to happen when they have have such short timeframe in which to adjust there be real concern and question about the datum on which the decision be make it be accept that pollack stock be diminish and quota be be reduce for some time but what shock the industry be the decision to go suddenly from tonne to zero at once when previously quota have drop by few hundred tonne year as we understand it the data have largely be gather from the catch of trawler but it be well understand that the main place where pollack can be find and catch be on reef and wreck where trawler can not fish there be real question about the accuracy of the datum that have be use to make the recommendation and whether it be base on the reality of the stock of pollack that be available the fisherman have speak to be incredibly frustrated some be even angry because for several year they have be say to the marine management organisation we be concerned about pollack stock and therefore we would like an increase in the minimum catch size an increase in the mesh size for the net or closed season for one or two month year to protect the stock so we do have to take this drastic action motion lapse standing order no motion make and question propose that this house do now wood when those fisherman put that to the mmo it say oh there no need for that we be not concerned we do think those measure be necessary but it look like the fisherman be right all along because if these measure have be bring in gradually over the past few year we may have have sustainable quota for pollack without this sudden drop to zero know the minister have be look at way to support those who have be affect severely by this decision welcome the step he have take the work he have be do and the measure he have bring forward through the fishery and seafood scheme to expedite application from those who have be affect by the reduction in pollack stock to help they diversify that be very welcome but will he clarify the letter send out on february which say the scheme will be available to all those affect by the reduction in pollack quota include netter the press release that go out later that day seem to suggest it be only available to handliner and boat under metre if the minister could clarify exactly who the expedite fass be available to that would be welcome can do that while my hon friend be on his foot be try to establish priority list so boat under metre and handliner will be prioritise over boat over meter and those that be net that do not mean those boat be exclude it just mean that we will prioritise the other be very grateful to the minister it be very helpful to have that clarification the centre for environment fisheries and aquaculture science will call it cefa which be lot easy to say be work with fisherman to gather accurate datum about the current stock of pollack which will hopefully inform future decision pay fisherman who have lose their catch due to this decision to gather datum be very welcome but we should acknowledge that the scheme will assist only relatively small number of vessel both scheme be welcome but they do not go far enough and will not help anywhere near the number of boat that have be affect or mitigate the loss that be be experience we need to focus on two thing first we must help and support now those who have be so badly affect by this decision and protect their livelihood in the immediate future from the loss of income that they experience virtually overnight with no time to prepare secondly we should lay out pathway to return pollack quota sustainably as quickly as possible urge the minister to prioritise work with the specialised committee on fishery where understand that the uk and the eu will be discuss pollack as priority topic later this month this be the first chance to review the datum and make request of ices for refinement of the science and management particularly of recreational fisher as the minister know that be real concern of many commercial fisherman there seem to be no restriction or regulation around recreational fisher when it come to pollack those fisherman want to see the uk engage robustly and confidently as the independent seafaring nation that we be and to make the most of that opportunity also understand that the cornish fish producers organisation have meeting with defra and cefa later this month ahead of the scf meeting hope the minister and his official will take that opportunity to really listen to the concern of our fishing representative and understand the impact that this decision be have and to work with they to find way forward what we need be urgent help now fisherman have lose major part of their income overnight through no fault of their own they have ongoing business cost mortgage to pay and family to support and it be unrealistic to expect they to adjust at such short notice they really need some help now urge the minister to continue to do all he can to find way of get help to those fisherman as soon as we can and to work with fisherman in cornwall and elsewhere towards see pollack quota return as soon as possible so we can have sustainable fishery for pollack go forward thank the minister again for all he have be do look forward to his response to this debate and will continue to work with he and colleague to find solution to these challenge to help the fisherman represent and to ensure they have viable future pay tribute to my hon friend the member for st austell and newquay steve double not only for tonight debate but for the work he continue to do to support his constituent also put on record my recognition of the effort of my hon friend the members for truro and falmouth cherilyn mackrory and for south east cornwall mrs murray who have be equally tenacious in their pursuit of support for their constituent to begin with the scientific advice back in june the international council for the exploration of the seas provide advice that the total allowable catch for pollack in western water for should be set at zero tonne for the first time this follow benchmark for pollack process whereby assessment method for stock be review and well available method be select that benchmark lead to change in the assessment from data limit method which be mostly reliant on landing datum only to category assessment that include fishery survey datum the recent benchmark suggest that the stock go below safe biological limit in the ices advice receive in june be the well available scientific advice and be the basis on which defra negotiate eu uk bycatch tac of tonne that bycatch tac aim to avoid choke other healthy fishery in the south west where pollack be catch however it do not allow vessel to target pollack recognise the difficulty that that be cause particularly for those who predominantly target pollack and have do for some time in addition to secure the bycatch of pollack my department have be work hard to find way to assist and support those most affected while of course keep the long term sustainability of the fishery in mind with that in mind on february we announce the reopening of the fishery and seafood scheme which be provide up to million in funding to support project in variety of area include health and safety processing and importantly business diversification we be also expedite fass application for hand and pole line fisher on under metre vessel bring the application processing time down from eight week to four week that will mean that we will be able to get support to the most affected the quick in addition on february announce that affected fisherman will have the opportunity to take part in new scientific study lead by the centre for environment fisheries and aquaculture science this study will see collaboration between scientist and fisherman to increase our understanding of the stock structure of pollack fisher will be engage in the project to collect generic sample from around pollack receive payment for initial training and participation they will still be able to sell at market the pollack they have catch as part of that study application along with detailed eligibility criterion will be open as soon as possible encourage the most affected pollack fisher to apply for that study welcome the minister announcement on february but do he see the comment make by andy read in fishing news where he ask very salient question could this not all have be predict and could it not have be do early we do of course continue to monitor fish stock and we do follow ices advice it be fair criticism that we have see decline in pollack over many year over the last year but certainly the ices advice continue to recognise that pollack could be catch until last june when we be force into the position where we have to take action be truly sorry for the impact that be have on the fisherman who have rely on that stock we want to follow that advice to the good of our ability to try to recover that stock want fisherman to be able to catch pollack in those water so we do need to manage it in the most responsible way possible genuinely thank the minister for his continued engagement on this which really be very much appreciated he may like to know that follow his announcement couple of week ago on the scheme he be present write to the chancellor to ask he for bit more in the budget not in the budget we have just have but in the budget to help the minister with scheme he might have we really do need some financial support for these guy now it really be critical once again pay tribute to my hon friend for her tenacious pursuit of support for her constituent will turn to the long term outlook for pollack which be important we will work with the eu on the long term management of pollack via the specialised committee on fishery to drive towards an improved stock assessment on which ices can base future advice want to see recovery of this important pollack fishery and believe the measure describe will help support that sector through very challenging time my hon friend the member for st austell and newquay mention recreational fishing which know have cause some frustration with social medium post almost taunt the commercial fisherman there be an active recreational pollack fishery and although the evidence base be limited the recreational catch be likely to represent large component of the total pollack catch clearly give the zero catch advice there be need to explore the potential to reduce pressure on the stock through management of the recreational fishery as this be jointly manage stock with the eu the uk have commit to take forward work on this issue with the specialised committee on fishery as matter of urgency in we will work closely with relevant stakeholder throughout this process my official have start discussion with the recreational sector and we be look to take this work forward as soon as we can in closing again thank my hon friend for raise this important topic pollack be key stock and it be crucial to the south west community the government will do all we can to support the industry to improve the stock science and to drive the stock towards long term sustainable management which be of course in the interest of everyone particularly the committed fisher of the south west of england should make it clear to my hon friend that this be not the end of the discussion seek to have with colleague my door be very much open to further discussion to see how we may be able to assist and look forward to work with he to support his constituent as he seek to do question put and agree to house adjourn
