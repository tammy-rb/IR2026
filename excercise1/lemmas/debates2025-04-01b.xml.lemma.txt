settlement in the west bank israeli settlement be illegal under international law and harm the prospect of two state solution on march the un security council make clear that we oppose any attempt to expand settlement in the west bank have be very clear with israeli ministers that they must clamp down on settler violence and end settler expansion on saturday night the israeli government announce the approval of an expand road network in the corridor of the west bank with the stated aim of support the development of illegal israeli settlement in the area that area be critical to the territorial integrity of future palestinian state previously unified international pressure have restrain the israeli government so can the foreign secretary say how the government be work with their ally to exert maximum influence on israel in this matter be grateful to my hon friend for his question condemn categorically the development of settlement that be illegal under international law settlement do not offer security to israel or to palestinians also condemn call to annex the west bank which would lead only to violence and jeopardise prospect for palestinian state be clear with israeli counterpart that settlement expansion must stop we will continue to work with our partner to ensure prospect for palestinian state we have hear secretary of state after secretary of state condemn the increase in settlement and settler violence in the west bank over the last or year and it have make not the slight bit of difference to their expansion when will the foreign secretary accept that the only thing that the israelis will respond to we should not forget that these settlement be sponsor by the israeli state be action when can we expect more sanction particularly on violent settler and their organisation when can we expect full trade ban on settlement produce in particular will the secretary of state consider proscribe those settler organisation that be perpetrate terrorism on an innocent palestinian population be grateful to the right hon gentleman it be important that there be cross party position and successive ministers of both political party have condemn expansion and condemn violence we continue to work with partner across europe and beyond on these issue do not say that it be easy he will know that announce sanction back in october and we continue to keep these issue under review but the culture of impunity for those engage in violence be intolerable remember just few month ago sit with bedouins who have experience that violence and be be subject to that expansion it be horrendous that be why in both the un and our dialogue with the israeli government we be clear that that harm the prospect of peace and security for israel it do not further its ambition the scene come out of palestine recently have be nothing short of shocking hundred have be kill in settler violence in the west bank the brutal torture of palestinians in israeli custody be commonplace and the collapse of the ceasefire mean that the devastation and human suffering in gaza have simply continue will the secretary of state confirm whether his department have receive any evidence show that international law have be violate will he share such evidence and his assessment openly my hon friend be right to raise this issue she will know that in sober and measure way the government have to make our own decision on the export licensing regime which be put in place by the last government and we assess that there be clear risk of breach of international humanitarian law therefore we have suspend arm that could be use in gaza that be decision that minister have make from this dispatch box under different government early this year visit the west bank with colleague in the chamber as part of parliamentary delegation where see the awful israeli illegal violence in hebron and susya we run into two israeli settler who clearly want we off the area that they have burn down will the foreign secretary go far than he have in condemn that violence by agree to full sanction and an embargo on all israeli illegal settlement owe to the position of the city of london that could have profound impact and stop the violence should make it clear that settlement good do not benefit from any free trade arrangement that we have with israel obviously on october

lift the world poor out of poverty have long be at the heart of the fcdo mission reset in the social contract around development aid be clearly need what consideration have the minister give to shape development policy that explicitly address the upstream determinant of mass migration agree with much of what my hon friend have say our development effort as the foreign secretary have say have never just be about the aid budget peace and security effective governance access to private investment remittance flow efficient tax system and access to trade opportunity be all essential foundation for development that require we to mobilise the full force of different resource and expertise across government our business and in university science and beyond do the minister agree that rather than be use to meet in donor refugee cost the official development assistance budget should prioritise tackle extreme poverty it be now year since the oecd development assistance committee mid term review which show that the uk have only make good progress on two of the recommendation since the peer review what progress have the fcdo make over the last month in well meet the committee guidance the hon lady ask about important matter around spend on in donor refugee cost thank to the measure take by the home secretary to reduce the asylum backlog and work towards exit costly asylum hotel we expect overall oda spending on asylum to have be low in than in there will always be some unpredictability but we expect the action to continue reduce in donor refugee cost in this parliament official development assistance infectious diseases what assessment he have make of the potential impact of plan reduction to the official development assistance budget on effort to tackle infectious disease thank the right hon gentleman for his question decision on how oda will be use will be consider as part of the ongoing spending review reduce the overall size of the budget will necessarily have an impact on the scale and shape of our work can say however that our important work and support for gavi be immunise million child and save up to million life and our billion pledge to the global fund for be support prevention and treatment for hiv tuberculosis and malaria and will help to save over million life agree with the minister on what he just say but gavi say that the change policy will mean that million few child will be immunise which mean that over five year will die how on earth do he live with himself with that policy with the great of respect the right hon gentleman will know my record on these important issue have advocate for they over many year in this place and outside do not accept his characterisation decision have not yet be take they be be take as part of the spending review he will know that the uk be one of the large donor to gavi we have commit billion in the current strategic period up to and that will make an important impact on child life around the world gavi be create very much with the uk as drive force it be one of the proud achievement of the previous labour government it have immunise almost billion people in the world and not only be it save life but it be important for job and work here in the uk in our fantastic life science sector will the minister give commitment that we will continue to be lead force in gavi at the replenishment in june the foreign secretary have be discuss these important issue with the health and social care secretary my hon friend be right to point out the important role of gavi as well as our role in that the decision will be set out in due course but hear what she and indeed other hon and right hon member be say on this important issue call the shadow minister it be very clear from ministers answer that we still have no indication about which programme and where will be affect by the plan reduction to oda and from when exactly the cut will be effective we be tell to wait for the spending review but many organisation include those tackle infectious disease be leave to face uncertainty and to work at risk will the minister tell we what instruction have be issue to his department humanitarian aid programme about what they be expect to do between now and the spending review in june we clearly have difficult decision to make but the fcdo be not pause all oda programming and not create cliff edge in this year we be focus on ensure that every pound will be spend in the most impactful way in the new context that be very difficult decision as the prime minister the foreign secretary and have set out we will set out the detail in due course but we be listen closely to member in this house and indeed to the many partner and stakeholder we work with on these important issue west papua

deadly place in the world to be an aid worker more than aid worker have be kill in the conflict restore the ceasefire remain the good chance to see hostage release allow surge of humanitarian aid and bring this bloodshed to an end it be clear from the chamber this morning that we all despair at the recent breakdown of the ceasefire agreement the resumption of hostility and the blockade of aid into gaza we now have warning of an unprecedented humanitarian disaster in the gaza strip which be hard to imagine after what we have already see there the minister mention the conversation that have be have with israel first can he assure that we be make it clear that the only way we will achieve last peace be through two state solution which will not achieve by subject people to such hardship secondly what conversation be ongoing with ally about restore aid drop directly into gaza can confirm that we say regularly to our israeli counterpart and indeed to all other in the region that the only route out of these horror be two state solution an outcome that provide for the safety security and dignity of both people we be talk with our partner about what might be do to try to ensure aid

equivalent of everyone in bedfordshire vote for mps who have no chance of go through the voting lobby do the minister agree that that be particularly strange anomaly this be not matter for we the united states be sovereign democratic nation and the issue of voting right in the district of columbia be matter for the united states in the interest of self determination will the foreign secretary

the write statement this issue really matter as doctor who be take on overtime or who work privately rely on these statement to be able to track their contribution and avoid excessive tax bill accord to dr sharma from the bma there no doubt that without up to date information doctor will be pre emptively reduce or turn down extra work to avoid additional pension bill that they might not even be due the statutory deadline for the statement be as we hear october in february ministers confirm that be outstanding and that the majority would be issue by the end of february by march however the backlog have actually grow to can the minister explain how two legal deadline have be miss will the government be follow up with the regulator to ensure that this do not happen again do the government have confidence in the nhs business services authority with the secretary of state abolish nhs england what do this mean for the future of this vital organisation we all want to see waiting list fall but as one newspaper put it today labour pledge to slash nhs waiting list be be sabotage by litany of administrative error pension delay and punitive tax rule urge the government to take swift action as outline in my response and in the write ministerial statement we have take action we be make aware of some of these problem when we come into office in july and we have push the nhs business services authority to move fast than it would have do under the hon gentleman government so that action be happen quick than it would have do before we do have faith in the nhs business services authority to get on with this and ensure that there be no financial detriment in line with the timetable outline yesterday and as have far make clear today madam deputy speaker the hon gentleman could have ask more about waiting list which have fall for the last five month in row he could have ask about the million more appointment that have be provide to deliver for patient seven month early he could have ask about the hundred more gps who be now work in the health service or the impact of cancel the strike on service for people or the record funding in fact last week in the chamber he speak on behalf of the national pharmacy association this week he could have congratulate the minister for care who be sit next to on the agreement to produce more pharmacy service we be make improvement to the nhs every day the darzi report report not only the breadth but the depth of the decline that we inherit we be resolve that and fix the fundamental of the nhs thank the minister for come to the house and give her response we all know the issue she be talk about when she mention the state of the nhs that we inherit and echo that with the issue hear about from patient and staff at princess alexandra hospital in harlow on pension can she outline what the government have do to mitigate the delay in the process it be important that people have confidence in the pension system that be why we take action in july on come into office to understand the depth of the problem that occur under the previous government this be complicated issue which be why we want to be clear with people that there will be no financial detriment to they we will continue to work with employer and trade union to ensure that the issue be resolve as quickly as possible in line with the timeline have outline call the liberal democrat spokesperson the delay will be deeply worrying and will make financial planning very difficult for those affect all of whom be people who have dedicate their working life to support the nhs and tirelessly save life nhs worker and their family be be leave in the dark by government delay and may as result miss out on use their full allowance which be unacceptable they deserve well the revise delivery plan prioritise member base on their likelihood of face financial detriment so clearly some financial detriment be expect for those who be impact can the minister estimate what the likely financial detriment be of miss the statutory deadline or how much compensation as she just mention be likely to be pay can she tell we why the nhs business services authority have fail to meet the deadline in response to write question from my hon friend the member for st albans daisy cooper the minister say that there be people work on it will she confirm whether that be likely to be sufficient to ensure that future deadline be meet thank the hon lady for her question do not have to hand the exact number of people work on this but will make sure that respond to she on that point in writing we be ensure that individual do not face detriment as result of these delay the nhs cost claim back compensation scheme provide resource for direct financial loss incur by the nhs pension scheme member impact by the mccloud remedy include professional service fee and certain hmrc interest charge that may arise as outline in my statement hmrc have also confirm that self assessment late filing penalty will be waive on appeal in certain circumstance where member receive delay pension saving statement as consequence of the implementation of the mccloud remedy do the minister agree that it be important that the affected member receive those statement to allow informed decision make the government have work to minimise financial detriment to those affect but this issue be part of the mess we have be clear up we have have record investment into pharmacy and more gps and we have cut waiting list and stop the junior doctor strike we be on the road to recovery my hon friend be absolutely right that we be on the road to recovery and that of course be what the opposition can not stand this be complicated issue as they well know as say we inherit this complication in july when we be make well aware of it the conservatives could have do more about it while they be in government but it be yet another issue on which they have let people down this time it be staff we will ensure that we remedy that the timeline be available in the write ministerial statement that issue yesterday we will continue to work with trade union and employer to ensure that people understand as my hon friend say it be important that people do understand their own personal position call the chair of the health and social care committee have to say that be none the wiser about what exactly have happen if we be to ensure that this will not happen again that these deadline will be meet we need to know how we get into this position it may well be the fault of the previous government will this government commit to full review of exactly how we get here so that we can ensure that the publish deadline be meet this time the chair of the health and social care committee make good point as she so often do about what go on previously this be an issue from the mccloud judgment that run across many departments it be problem under previous government start with the coalition government know that the public accounts committee on which serve and the treasury committee have look at the matter over time the department will certainly co operate with any inquiry and investigate what happen across government be happy to get back to the hon lady on that point this issue appear to be yet another example of the hangover leave by the previous conservative government do the minister agree that part of get the nhs back on its foot include clean up this mess and cut waiting list which have already drop for five month in row my hon friend make absolutely the right point as have say lord darzi have helpfully outline the breadth of the mess that we inherit back in july and it make for stark reading we have still not have an apology from the conservative party so be happy to take an intervention now if anybody decide to provide one in these issue we be see the depth of the destruction that the conservatives have cause widely across government we will continue to fix that on behalf of the british people declare my interest as practise doctor and public sector pensioner who have be through the mccloud process do the minister understand that we will not improve productivity in the nhs as far as doctor be concerned if they continue to retire routinely in their in their prime they do so because their accountant tell they that they would be foolish not to give the fiscal environment and the structure of the nhs pension scheme understand that point obviously it be source of much discussion the change come about during the pandemic to encourage people to return to work and it be complex issue we want to continue to use the skill of doctor at all stage of their career and we shall continue to work with they the british medical association and other to make sure that there be no detriment to their return to service in the nhs declare an interest as member of the nhs pension scheme can the minister confirm that this issue arise only because the previous government carry out their nhs pension reform in way that be find to be age discriminatory more widely do she agree that give nhs staff the term and condition and the reward and recognition that they deserve also require prompt action each year on agree the nhs pay award which the conservative party routinely fail to do when in government my hon friend make an excellent point on our commitment to staff to be clear on their term and condition and our commitment to honour that reward that be why we act promptly when we come into office we have issue statement and provide answer to parliamentary question to make sure that people be clear about the system and that we be transparent it take rather long time to train doctor up to six year so it be good job that the previous government have the opportunity to train more doctor will the minister look at one aspect of concern which be that if doctor start reduce their overtime hour because of fiscal aspect it will hamper the opportunity to get more patient treat and to shorten the length of waiting list as say in response to the right hon member for south west wiltshire dr murrison we understand that and we will continue to work with all staff in the nhs to make sure that we deliver on our commitment to reduce waiting list which be leave at shocking level by the previous government have constituent who be suffer both financial and emotional distress as result of these circumstance write to the nhs business services authority and it take four month to get response in write question to the government have ask how might make representation about my constituent be affect by financial distress the response that receive from ministers simply say that nhsbsa have all the evidence that it need and there be no need for anyone to provide extra evidence there be very real risk that some people who be affect by this be suffer financial distress but have not be identify by nhsbsa for those people can the minister please outline what mechanism we as member can use to make those people know to nhsbsa so that they can access their pension choice early be sorry to hear about the emotional and financial distress of the hon lady constituent if there be gap be happy to go back to the nhsbsa on her behalf and make sure that update the house do the minister have full confidence in the chair of the nhs business services authority as say in my statement we have confidence in the business authority to undertake the action that have outline thank the minister for her answer to the question waiting list be clearly beyond the pale if the government be able to address the remedial pension saving statement we might be in well position to entice our doctor to take on additional hour will the minister confirm that this be government priority and that there be an understanding that function nhs require straightforward path to work overtime and payment at every level one of our major priority be ensure that the entire nhs workforce be do the work that they be train and commit to do so that they can get down those waiting list and deliver an nhs that be fit for the future the staff as lord darzi have outline have feel very severely the detriment cause by the previous government they be work under really difficult condition and we want to make sure that through the year plan and the nhs long term workforce plan we offer they hope so that they be ready to deliver the service that they have be train to deliver thank the minister for her response this afternoon will allow moment for the front benchers to swap over adoption and special guardianship support fund urgent question to ask the secretary of state to make statement on whether the adoption and special guardianship support fund

member would like to share any more information regard the year old and the family experience of lack of support would welcome he to do so thank the minister for her answer to the urgent question no one can doubt her compassion or understanding give the way she have answer be mindful of the fact that child be our future as grandfather of six understand only too well what it mean to have they there but child be leave in limbo throughout every region of the united kingdom and to get to the point where there be no confirmation of whether essential therapy can continue be terribly disheartening to say the least these child feel abandon how will the minister ensure that the lack of decision and the hesitation will not add to their sense of abandonment congratulate the hon member on be grandfather of six and hear the concern he have raise share those concern and the government will continue to work to ensure that the support service be in place for all child who need it include those who be involve with this funding thank the minister for her answer this afternoon will allow few moment for the front benchers to swap over sentencing council guidelines with your permission madam deputy speaker will make statement on sentencing in england and wales as the house will be aware new guideline from the sentencing council on pre sentence report have come under scrutiny in recent week specifically on whether an offender faith or the colour of their skin should be factor in their use this be question of huge import whether we all stand equal before the law that be an ideal that have underpin justice in this country for century and an ancient right that each of we in this house have responsibility to uphold the new guideline on the use of pre sentence report be due to come into force from today but in recent week have have constructive talk with the sentencing council and be grateful to its chair lord justice william davis for that engagement as result be pleased to tell the house that the guideline have be put on pause while parliament rightly have its say it be important to first understand how we get into this position under the previous government the sentencing council propose change to its imposition of community and custodial sentence guideline which be concern with whether judge should make community or custodial order when sentence an offender and the threshold for these disposal when the court be decide whether the community order threshold be meet or the custody threshold be meet they be require by law to obtain pre sentence report unless they consider it unnecessary to do so these report provide more information to the court help to provide great understanding of the background and context of the offend behaviour they be tool at the disposal of judge the guideline provide further guidance to court on how to approach the decision whether to request pre sentence report in this instance they help they to determine what sentence might well be hand down in general should be clear welcome the use of pre sentence report in the last few month have create capacity within the probation service to ensure that it have more time for vital work such as this but the new guidance if it come into force would encourage judge to request they for some cohort of offender and not other specifically it note that it would normally be consider necessary to request pre sentence report for ethnic cultural or faith minority it be important to be clear about the impact that pre sentence report be likely to have in this instance it be more likely to discourage judge from send an offender to jail it be this that create the perception of differential treatment before the law and risk undermine public confidence in the justice system repeat theme of my engagement with the sentencing council over the guideline have be the intention behind they it be attempt to address very real inequality that exist in our justice system inequality that be evident in the sentence that offender receive it be unclear why this happen as the sentencing council acknowledge there be no doubt that more must be do to understand the problem we face and to address it some measure be already take place across our justice system to make it more representative of the public that it serve such that it can deliver outcome in which we can all have confidence and note that the proportion of ethnic minority within the judiciary have rise from just year ago to today while change can feel slow and must accelerate my view be that despite the noble intention behind these guideline in attempt to address inequality in our justice system they sacrifice too much they raise serious question of policy in the pursuit of equality of outcome for different religion and race should we treat they differently before the eye of the law and move so far away from an ideal that have underpin justice in this country for century on this be clear all must be equal before the law know there will be disagreement in this house with regard to the correct policy to pursue there have be as have note difference of opinion among the opposition expect that the shadow secretary of state for justice the right hon member for newark robert jenrick who oppose these guideline and the now shadow transport secretary the hon member for orpington gareth bacon who welcome they while in office have be have some robust conversation in recent day doubt however that there be any disagreement that this be question of policy how the state address systemic and complex issue be clearly the domain of policymaker it be right that question like these be discuss and debate here it be right that the public can hold we to account for the decision we take and that they can ultimately reward or punish we at the ballot box the role of judge be entirely different they be concerned not with how policy be make but how it be apply the independence of our judge to make those determination be fundamental to our justice system over century they have build reputation for fairness make they world renowned and respected they be the embodiment of the rule of law in our country to play that role they must be able to make decision on the fact without any outside influence they must know they have the government behind they protect they as they do that vital work when swear my oath as lord chancellor make solemn pledge to protect and defend the independence of the judiciary and always will but to do so it be essential that the boundary between what be policy and what be judicial decision making be clear for that reason the government will today introduce the sentencing guidelines pre sentence reports bill it be tightly focused bill it do not interfere with the vital work of the council provide guidance to judge on how to sentence offender it address the issue of when pre sentence report should be order the bill adopt target approach it do not prevent council guidance from advise in general term that pre sentence report should be request when judge need more information about an offender personal circumstance it will remain the case for example that where an offender be victim of domestic abuse judge can consider it in decide whether to order pre sentence report but it prohibit the council from make guideline about pre sentence report with specific reference to the offender personal characteristic such as their race religion or belief or cultural background the bill will not affect the court exist duty to obtain pre sentence report in appropriate case nor do it change court precedent around they like the recent case of thompson in which the court of appeal note the importance of obtain pre sentence report in case involve pregnant woman or woman who have recently give birth like the case of meanley where the court refer to the importance of pre sentence report in serious case involve young defendant or like the case of kurmekaj where the court emphasise the defendant traumatic upbringing vulnerability and the fact they have be victim of modern slavery as reason why pre sentence report should be order judge will continue to request pre sentence report in case where they ordinarily would for example those involve pregnant woman or young people accept that the bill will however raise wide question about the role of the sentencing council the council do important work bring great consistency to judicial decision making but we be here discuss question of policy difficult disputed and uncertain one at that if the government can not determine national policy on the question of equality of treatment before the law we have uncover democratic deficit the bill expose that question but do not address it the proper role of the sentencing council and the process for make guideline of this type must be consider far and will do so in the come month it be right that this question be consider in great depth and should further legislation be require shall propose it as part of the upcoming sentencing bill the sentencing council although only year old hold an important position within the firmament of our justice system and any change must be make carefully and with due consideration be sure they will be discuss more in this house in the month ahead the government will today introduce the sentencing guidelines pre sentence reports bill the issue it contain be of great consequence because the path to more equal society can only be pave by equality before the law again thank the sentencing council for put pause on its guideline while parliament have its say believe that we must reverse they and reassert that no race or religion should receive preferential treatment before the law the bill we will introduce today will achieve that and commend this statement to the house the lord chancellor must be live in parallel universe if she be give herself pat on the back today the truth be she have completely lose control of the justice system she sit on her hand for week and take seven day to gather her thought and put her view in write to the sentencing council her incompetence take this down to the wire magistrate and judge be update by the press office of the sentencing council only at midday that the guideline due to come into force have in effect be suspend that raise the very real prospect that magistrate and judge sit from am this morning be unaware of this chaotic last minute change and sentence people under guideline that the justice secretary herself have concede be two tier but it get bad in that very email to thousand of judge and magistrate send just minute ago the sentencing council state we remain of the view that the guideline be necessary and appropriate confusion reign they be be tell one thing by the lord chancellor and another by the sentencing council who really be in charge here yet again the justice secretary have be humiliate and undermine by activist judge seek to undermine the will of this place our parliament her authority have be shred she be be treat as two tier second tier justice secretary this situation be entirely preventable if the justice secretary have simply put party politic to one side and back our bill week ago to restore accountability and empower she to actually control justice policy but the labour party block it if the prime minister have be trick into sit at the front of the dockland light railway think that he be in charge as his chief of staff mock he for the other day the lord chancellor have choose to sit there in the passenger seat allow the judiciary to take charge she decide to be undecided resolve to be irresolute all powerful to be impotent even after this complete shamble the lord chancellor will not even re establish ministerial oversight we be tell via frantic press briefing that her bill which we have not even see yet will surgically remove these two tier sentencing guideline that do not tackle the root cause of the problem at all which be an activist legal quango that hold view completely divergent to the public to parliament and now we be tell to the government unless she follow the formula of the bill produce by conservative mp we will be back here time and again to unwind the next piece of madness come out of the council take the sentencing council immigration guideline that water down sentence for immigration offence below the month threshold for automatic deportation if publish it will mean hundred of illegal migrant and foreign national offender will avoid deportation every single year it will blow hole in border security it even water down the maximum life sentence for people smuggler that be legislate for just under year ago it completely disregard parliamentary sovereignty at our last exchange the justice secretary say there would be no two tier justice on her watch well there it be and it be bad than that on january her own department not the sentencing council publish guidance order the prioritisation of bail for ethnic minority and transgender people continue practice introduce under gordon brown contrary to the misinformation peddle by her press office the department produce new guidance on pre sentencing report that have be in force for month which state that probation officer should consider the culture of an offender and whether they have suffer intergenerational trauma from historical event well that be cultural relativism which violate the rule of law and put the british public at risk this time nobody be to blame other than she it be her department it be black and white it be two tier justice have some question will the justice secretary reassure the house that nobody be sentence this morning under guideline that she concede be two tier can she honestly say at the dispatch box that she have confidence in the head of the sentencing council lord justice davis give that he have bring it into total disrepute yes or no if she can be she aware that he take to the airwave yesterday in an astonishing departure from the expect standard of judicial conduct to advocate for abolish short sentence especially for hyper prolific offender effectively instruct low court to follow suit it be time for he to go and if she will not sack he for that what will it take do the justice secretary have confidence in johanna robinson another member of the sentencing council who take moral objection to border control and describe the illegal migration act as appal lastly will the justice secretary change the guidance that her own department be produce and which have create two tier probation service or be it once again on her watch two tier justice under two tier keir dear dear dear it seem that the right hon gentleman amnesia be as bad as ever whole year appear to have disappear entirely from his memory he talk about parliamentary sovereignty but when his party be in government and he be secretary of state or minister he appear never to know what on earth parliamentary sovereignty be or how to exercise power think the right hon gentleman be rather distressed that my approach have lead to pause in the guideline that will introduce bill that will deal with the offend bit of this guideline and that will consider the wide role and power of the sentencing council ahead of the sentencing bill later this year understand that it must be very disappointing for he that he have be expose as someone who be all talk and no action and that get the job do can see that that annoy he greatly perhaps the right hon gentleman would like to begin by apologise to the country as often invite he to do when we have our exchange across the dispatch box in year he never appear to discover any of the thing that he now discuss regularly from the opposition benches he do nothing about those matter when he be member of the government that run the country perhaps that be the problem the conservatives never really run the country they give up on the job he never roll up his sleeve and put in the hard work to get the job do that be why we inherit prison on the brink of collapse and why be now unwind all the mistake that his party make and the guidance that he and his party welcome the right hon gentleman do not tell what discussion he have have with the shadow transport secretary the hon member for orpington gareth bacon before the conservatives explain why they be so het up about thing now they should explain why they welcome those thing when they be in office there be no answer to those question do not believe that there be many question in that diatribe from the shadow justice secretary on sentencing the pause in the guideline be communicate that be matter for the sentencing council will of course engage with the judiciary to ensure that all be understand regard the pause nothing have change in relation to the ordering of pre sentencing report by judge in all the circumstance in which they would ordinarily do so the guideline be what have be pause and it will now not come into effect until parliament have have its say the right hon gentleman reference two individual that be the difference between and he do not make it personal just focus on the job and get the job do call the mother of the house realise that this be not popular view in the house but the justice secretary will be aware that some of we be astonish that she think our judge be so weak minded as to be affect by what be guideline in relation to how they sentence black and brown defendant the justice secretary will be aware that report after report and repeat statistical analysis have demonstrate what some of we consider to be unfairness in relation to black and brown people and the criminal justice system she will also be aware that the reason the sentencing council be make statutory independent body be to avoid even the appearance of ministerial interference in sentencing this be not the united states our political and judicial system be entirely separate can she explain why she be so triumphant about not just interfere in sentencing but pass piece of legislation to cut across what the sentencing council be say thank my right hon friend for her question at least she ask some proper question she say that her view on the policy might be an unpopular one but this be the place where view on policy popular or unpopular can and should be debate that be at the heart of my disagreement with the sentencing council on the guideline think that the matter that my right hon friend raise in relation to race and the disparity in the criminal justice system be the proper preserve of politician the answer to how we deal with those issue will be policy answer and it be for the government the opposition and other member to debate that policy answer and pursue it through parliament that be why reject entirely the suggestion that anything have do impinge upon the independence of the judiciary or call into question the separation of power in this country the sentencing council be itself creature of statute it be only year old it be entirely proper for politician government minister the lord chancellor to assert that there be boundary between that which be policy and matter for parliament and that which be judicial practice and consistency in judicial case have seek to reassert that boundary look forward to work with member with differ view from across the house in consider the wide role and power of the sentencing council as have say will return to those matter in the come month call the liberal democrat spokesperson there be only one group in this house that lose control of our justice system the decimated former government on the opposition benches overcrowded prison reoffende through the roof victim wait for justice what disgrace that disgrace continue today through the downplaying of the impact of intergenerational trauma of which child abuse be form by the shadow justice secretary thank the lord chancellor for engage with on this issue in advance of her statement our criminal justice system ability to take someone freedom away be one of the most humbling power that it hold which be why sentencing decision must include all available information pre sentence report be critical part of that process she mention pregnant woman survivor of domestic abuse and survivor of modern slavery as important example of where that be consider however because everybody have context the liberal democrats believe that such report should consistently be make available whenever anyone liberty be at stake we will therefore scrutinise the legislation through that lens of equality before the law it be rich of the conservatives to complain about inequality in our justice system when it be they who preside over state of affair in which someone from one our country most deprive area be time more likely to be in prison than someone from the least deprived someone who look like be four time more likely to be stop and search than other and people with special educational need represent half the prison population compare to fifth of the general population will the justice secretary outline how she will fairly tackle those disparity to restore confidence in the justice system which be so shattered by the conservative party thank the liberal democrat spokesman for his question he be right as say in my statement pre sentence report be an incredibly vital tool for judge in fact the requirement be that they should ask for pre sentence report unless the court consider it unnecessary to do so there be strong push towards obtain pre sentence report in the vast majority of case the probation service that inherit from the previous administration have struggle under increase workload it be service that the conservative party privatise and then partly renationalised our probation service officer who do vital work every single day have be through the mill have be make change to the focus of the probation service in the last few month to pivot its work to focus on high and medium risk offender and free up probation capacity so that more time can be spend do vital work such as the preparation of pre sentence report will carry on work with the probation service to ensure it be ready to do what be ask of it to very high and consistent standard which know will be important to all members have already announce extra probation officer in the financial year that have just pass and another in the come financial year probation remain vital to the preparation of pre sentence report and we will ensure it be in position to meet the ask that be make of it on the hon gentleman wide point about disparity across the criminal justice system thank he for the spirit in which he have engage with on those matter have the same concern as he but believe we should understand what the late datum be show we that be why have ask for review of all the current datum and we should test any solution we come up with they be policy solution so they would have to be debate and pass in this house and politician be ultimately responsible at the ballot box for the choice they make but those solution have to work they have to yield change in these disparity that be what want to test in my engagement with the sentencing council on this particular guideline it have accept that the cause of the disparity be unclear and no one be sure whether the change to pre sentence report would make difference anyway be not willing to sacrifice public confidence in the criminal justice system or chip away at the idea of equality before the law for solution that be appropriate for debate in this place and that we be not even sure would work look forward to work with the hon gentleman closely in the come week and month on these issue call the chair of the justice committee the sentencing council be judicial body whose president be the lady chief justice and whose chair be distinguished court of appeal judge its function be previously execute by the court of appeal it be fully independent but be link to parliament not least because the justice committee be statutory consultee for all its guideline include those under discussion today its judicial leadership independence and democratic accountability be its strength and primary reason it be hold in high esteem in the criminal justice system will the lord chancellor reassure that those attribute will remain integral to the council whatever change be propose in the current legislation sentence review and sentence bill thank the chair of the select committee for his question of course respect the independence of the judiciary think be very clear in my statement and the remark have make that not only stand behind that principle but have take an oath that fulfil and consider my duty to do so where consider to be in disagreement with the sentencing council be that this be properly an area of policy rather than mere tool for the consistency of judicial practice when it come to sentencing that be the point of principle on which we have disagreement and it be why will be consider further review of the wide role and power of the sentencing council simply repeat to my hon friend that ensure that creature of statute be operate in the way that be intend when that statute be put in place be the proper preserve of politician and parliament hope we can all agree on that thank the lord chancellor for her rather belate statement particularly welcome her observation that recent event have uncover democratic deficit be she not concerned that it be the shadow justice secretary my right hon friend the member for newark robert jenrick who uncover this deficit and not herself her ministerial team or her department it be my right hon friend who first raise the issue of two tier sentencing guideline in this chamber on march four week ago could the lord chancellor tell we why she have wait until the eve of their introduction to bring forward her emergency legislation if the hon gentleman be concerned about the guideline and what be bring to his attention when perhaps people in his party should not have wave they through before the general election and welcome they as the shadow transport secretary do notice that none of they be engage on the substance of that point be the one who be deal with the democratic deficit they have year in power and do nothing about it and now they just carp from the sideline do the lord chancellor agree that the previous government be consult on and indeed welcome the sentencing council new guideline and therefore it be totally unfair of conservative members to accuse this government of have two tier system do she agree that it be yet another example of this government have to clear up the previous government mess my hon friend be right many conservative members appear to have very loose relationship with their own track record the lord chancellor be right that equality before the law lie at the heart of popular respect for justice however must say to she that it be not this house that endanger the separation of power but judicial activist as my right hon friend the member for newark robert jenrick have make palpably clear who be more interested in make law than apply they will she as my right hon friend request let this house know whether she retain faith in the sentencing council and its member or whether like she believe that have be expose they should now do the honest and right thing and resign have already say that be not interested in make personal attack on anybody have disagreement on point of principle with member of the sentencing council about what be the proper preserve of policy and what be the proper role they should play we have try to resolve it they have agree to pause their guideline we will move forward constructively will not stand back and let people attack the independence of the judiciary have swear solemn oath will fulfil that oath we be very lucky in this country to have the sort of legal system that we do and judiciary that be hold in high regard these be public servant of the high order it be easy for politician to attack on matter of policy or politic they do not like but as have just show if politician or parliamentarian disagree with something we have the power to change it the juridification of law should worry we all and we should make sure that primacy remain with this house the lord chancellor have take an important step towards that today what be worrying be that for year no action be take by the conservative party do my right hon friend believe that that be because of incompetence or just lack of understanding of what it mean for the country who can say suggest ask any of the conservative members here whether they have an answer to that but they appear to still wish to live on another planet and never reckon with their own track record in government black people in wales be the most over represent ethnic group in prison in follow by those from mixed background and people belong to an asian ethnic group that over representation be bad in wales than in england pre sentencing report can help we to understand why people of black and minority ethnic background be more likely to be send to prison even if she disagree with the method surely the secretary of state agree that action be necessary to tackle evidence inequality within the criminal justice system so what solution be she bring forward the proper role of pre sentence report be to give judge who be about to pass down sentence vital information about the context of that offender for example whether there have be domestic abuse their age and other vital factor relevant to the offend behaviour so that the judge can make decision about the good sentence to pass the pre sentence report be not about set right any other wrong that exist however legitimate they be that be not the point of the pre sentence report but about give the sentencer in every single individual case the information that they need such as whether woman be pregnant or have recently give birth as the court of appeal uphold recently those circumstance should be properly understand by judge the position in law be that pre sentence report should be seek by judge in all case unless the court consider it unnecessary to do so that cover the majority of case where pre sentence report should be seek but we should not confuse the proper role of what the pre sentence report be there to do to the extent that there be over representation see they too over of my constituent be non white and as the right hon lady can see be from an ethnic minority background myself and be also from faith minority see those disparity they be lived reality of my own life but be not prepared to sacrifice the principle of equality before the law to put those disparity right wish to be more curious than anybody else have be in previous year about what lie behind those disparity and about what be the proper lever that have to be pull to put they right we often discuss judicial diversity but be not sure that increase in diversity have necessarily lead to change in what the underlie data show clearly there be more go on any solution that politician come up with have to be test in the house because they be properly the domain of policy and parliament may congratulate my right hon friend on victory over the sentencing council on the fundamental principle of equality before the law the independence of the sentencing council do not entitle its member to go over its boundary into the area of policy and politic into which they have stray that be such fundamental issue that have make those fundamental error of judgment those member of the sentencing council should no long be able to carry on in the job whether it be by their own decision or that of the secretary of state in fairness to the sentencing council it seek view from the previous government and be tell that the government welcome its finding both in the consultation and the guideline the sentencing council do not do anything wrong in the process that it follow invite it to consider that there have be change of government and change of policy since it begin work on the guideline and ask it to consider reopen the consultation be disappoint that it choose not to do so but be not interested in make this personal debate about individual be grateful to the sentencing council for pause the guideline which have not come into effect all our previous arrangement in relation to pre sentence report remain in place as say be consider the wide role and power of the sentencing council and will return to the house with further proposal in due course the cherished idea of equal treatment before the law be fundamental to my constituent understanding of british justice so why do the justice secretary not act immediately to stop the imposition of two tier sentencing rather than the last minute scramble we see yesterday in her statement today she say the proportion of ethnic minority within the judiciary have rise from just year ago to today to what extent do she consider that that simply reflect wide demographic change rather than discrimination in the judiciary on diversity in the judiciary there have be consensus in this house on that point lot of effort have go into encouraging application from people who may want to consider leave private practice and become judge which have start to have an effect have institution that be more representative of the country that they represent be an important principle hope that there be cross party consensus that it be important for parliament to look at least little bit like the people that it seek to represent however be not sure whether an increase in the diversity of judge be necessarily go to be the fix for the disparity issue that we see in the criminal justice system that be why have ask for review of what the current datum be tell we to tease out whether there be relationship between those two thing if there be not then we will need to think more carefully about the other policy lever that might be need think those be proper matter for this house to discuss on the hon lady broad point about the sentencing council use power that have never be use before in the year of the sentencing council existence to ask it to think again have do everything the proper way ask it to think again and engage with the sentencing council at the end of last week it tell that it be go to stick with and publish the guideline and that it would come into force today april which be why say would legislate bring forward bill which have be publish today and thankfully the sentencing council have choose to pause the guideline until parliament have have its say have do everything exactly as should have do instead of rush to rhetoric which do not believe solve anything pregnant woman and new mother be at high risk in custody they be seven time more likely to experience stillbirth and at least two baby death have take place in recent year among other important measure the sentencing council have issue guidance on the use of prison sentence for pregnant woman and new mother which be suppose to come into effect today any delay to that risk cause untold preventable harm be relieved that the lord chancellor have commit to protect that guidance but how quickly will it be implement because woman can not wait any long can offer my hon friend immediate reassurance the bill that we have publish today be very targeted bill on the ability of the sentencing council to bring forward guideline relate only to pre sentence report and personal characteristic it be very tightly focused bill and nothing in that bill affect any court of appeal precedent and there be already strong court of appeal precedent on the desirability of court obtain pre sentence report before it pass sentence in case involve pregnant woman and woman who have recently give birth more widely on the issue of policy relate to woman in the criminal justice system hope my hon friend will welcome the fact that have set up the woman justice board specifically to look at the need of female offender across the whole criminal justice system be determine it be position of policy for this government that we will send few woman to prison and ultimately have few woman prison that be properly matter for policy be sure it will be contest in this house but that be the realm of politic parliament and ultimately the ballot box welcome the news today that the sentencing council have last minute change of heart on pre sentencing report to go back to the question raise by my hon friend the member for bridgwater sir ashley fox why do it take the effort of the shadow justice secretary to get the lord chancellor to have change of heart on that important matter we do not get an answer on that before do answer the question it do not whatever their ethnic background my constituent in rochdale be unite in support the ancient british principle of equality under the law welcome what the justice secretary have produce today in stark contrast to the opposition who welcome the previous attempt at two tier justice do she agree with that pre sentence report should be available for all offender and should never be link to ethnicity culture or faith my hon friend be right wish to see the wide possible use of pre sentencing report it be my job to ensure that the probation service be in position to provide pre sentencing report whenever they be require by the court and that court have confidence in the report that they be get will ensure that that be the case have the lady chief justice be rebuke for the impertinence of her letter to the prime minister follow prime minister question on february when he perfectly properly question another absurd judicial decision no have very positive conversation with the lady chief justice she have an important constitutional function and obligation as do our conversation be collaborative and constructive on that matter the government make their view clear that the exchange at prime minister question turn on question of policy which be the proper realm of politician and ultimately parliament thank the justice secretary for her decisive action on this issue and note that this government be not duck political decision farm they out to quangos like the last lot do with body like nhs england or blame the blob for crash the economy when it be liz truss mini budget that do that do the justice secretary agree that politic and policy be the domain of this house and its ministers and can she reassure that this government will continue to make sure that we in this house can make the decision that the public expect we to make my hon friend be right the business of government be difficult and require lot of effort the contrast between this government approach and the approach take by the tory party over its year in government be stark we be get on with the job while the sentencing council guideline do not apply in northern ireland do the lord chancellor accept that controversial change in england such as reduced likelihood of custodial sentence for certain group risk undermine confidence in the justice system across the entire uk can she outline what step she be take to ensure fairness and consistency in sentencing across all jurisdiction regardless of ethnicity culture or faith in wales these be reserved matter and the guideline would impact only on england and wales there be devolve arrangement here as well which do not propose to upend in any way but be always happy to have constructive conversation with colleague in scotland northern ireland and wales on any such matter in the end we be uk system even where some matter be devolve and really appreciate and value that collaboration join colleague in pay tribute to the lord chancellor for her decisive leadership and for the thoughtful way in which she have answer question today laughter welcome as will my constituent in pendle and clitheroe her confirmation that equality before the law will remain and look forward to see the bill that she propose can see the tories rail against the justice system that they leave we but we on the government benches really be mad about it we have backlog of crown court case there be no prison place leave and neighbourhood policing be hollow out be it any wonder that voter so comprehensively reject the tories think the country have its say on year of the tories in charge to be honest give their legacy in the criminal justice system would not take the same approach but be not surprised that they be laugh the only other thing they could do be to cry why do the lord chancellor propose to take only very narrow power in respect of the two tier pre sentencing report rather than general power give that other guideline and draft guideline include for immigration offence be far below the level agree to by this parliament the sentencing council be ignore policy determine by this house what more evidence do she need to act and to act now on the immigration guideline will correct something that the shadow justice secretary say early nothing in that guideline prevent the deportation of any foreign national offender and this government have be get on with the job have deport more than foreign national our record on foreign national offender be one of increase in removal this year compare with the same period last year want to ensure that the guideline do not come into effect and that be why publish the target bill have acknowledge that there be debate to be have about the wide role and power of the sentencing council which will return to in the week and month ahead the sentencing council be create in april month later the conservatives come to power if as so many on the conservative benches seem to think the sentencing council be shadowy revolutionary group of activist judge dangerously undermine the british way of life why on earth do they not do anything about it agree with that think they agree with that now interesting do the lord chancellor agree that this episode show that our constitution be work parliament be sovereign and if parliament seek to change this guidance under this government it will my hon friend be exactly right at no point have anybody on the conservative benches show any humility or try to answer the question of why they do nothing about it as say the case of amnesia from which the shadow justice secretary be suffer seem to be as bad as ever certainly welcome the fact that the sentencing council have be force to back down on its woke proposal as the new legislation progress can the lord chancellor assure the house that there will be no dilution of the robust principle of the separation of power and the independence of our judiciary and that the right approach will continue to be that parliament set the maximum sentence for any criminal offence and our judge decide on case by case basis what the sentence should be the hon and learn gentleman be absolutely right it be for parliament to set the overall sentencing framework but every single judge have to see the case in front of they and make their own decision as make very clear in my statement will always defend the independence of our judiciary they do vital work and be crucial part of the separation of power everything that have seek to do give this recent episode have be to respect that separation of power and assert what we properly consider to be the realm of policy politician and parliament and what be the realm of the judge thank the lord chancellor for her statement do she agree that we should all hold closely the ideal of equality before the law and that the big cause of two tier justice be the mess that the conservative party make of our probation service be grateful to my hon friend because he give an opportunity at the conclusion of my statement to support the probation service in all of the tory party terrible legacy in the criminal justice system include prison on the point of collapse what it do to the probation service be unconscionable this government be put thing right have already make change to the probation service and will ensure that it be on the strong possible footing go into the future thank the lord chancellor for her statement foreign influence registration scheme with permission madam deputy speaker will make statement on the foreign influence registration scheme firs be fundamental component of the national security act which be response to the evolve threat of hostile activity from state target the uk part to of the act come into force in december and have be transformative for our operational partner with six charge already bring against those conduct activity for or on behalf of foreign state act in the uk further five individual involve in those case have be charge with other offence firs provide crucial additional power to protect our democracy economy and society it do three thing provide transparency on foreign state influence in the uk give the police and critical new disruptive tool with criminal offence for those who fail to comply and deter those who seek to harm the uk they will face choice to either tell the government about their action or face arrest and imprisonment give the benefit of the scheme can tell the house that firs will go live on july the political influence tier of the scheme which apply to all state will allow the uk to be well inform about the nature scale and extent of foreign influence in the uk political system it will strengthen our resilience against covert foreign influence the political tier require the registration of arrangement to carry out political influence activity in the uk at the direction of any foreign power in most case registration under this tier will be make available on public register for the first time member of this house will now be able to check whether anyone who seek to influence they be do so at the direction of foreign power move that be sure will be welcome right across this house the enhanced tier of the scheme have be specifically design to shed light on activity direct by foreign power or entity whose activity pose threat to the safety and interest of the uk it enable the government to specify those foreign power that pose the great threat to our society to ensure transparency over much broad range of activity than just the political tier it will provide an important tool for the detection and disruption of harmful activity against our country last month set out our intention to specify iran under this tier of the scheme can announce today that we will also specify russia under the scheme russia present an acute threat to uk national security in recent year its hostile act have range from the use of deadly nerve agent in salisbury to espionage arson and cyber attack include the targeting of uk parliamentarian through spear phishe campaign clearly russia illegal invasion of ukraine have also highlight its intent to undermine european and global security to ensure we be respond to the whole of state threat that russia pose the government intend to specify the head of state of russia and its government agency and authority which will include its armed force intelligence service and police force as well as its parliament and judiciary we also intend to specify several political party that be control by russia include the united russia party this mean that any person either an individual or an entity such as company that carry out activity as part of any arrangement with those russian entity will have to register with firs should any of these foreign power control entity such as political party carry out activity in the uk directly they would also have to register with firs hope it will be clear what powerful tool this be it be clear that firs have the potential to provide great protection for our security our democracy and our economy but we must get the implementation right in support of the scheme the government have today lay before parliament draft regulation specify russia and iran introduce new exemption from the scheme and make provision for the publication of information both this house and the other place will have the opportunity to consider and debate these regulation under the affirmative procedure the government have also lay further set of regulation relate to the collection and disclosure of information under the scheme to support the consideration of the regulation and to assist potential registrant and other to well understand their responsibility under the scheme the

government will work closely with the relevant sector include academia and business to ensure that they understand their obligation take together this package will ensure strong compliance with the scheme from day one there will also be three month grace period to register exist arrangement know that right hon and hon member on both side of the chamber recognise the challenge pose to the uk by foreign interference and hope that all member can support these further step to keep our country safe of course as with all national security issue we must stay agile and as have say firs will be keep under review any new announcement will be make to the house in the usual way it be our duty to defend the safety and interest of the uk that be why we be commence firs it be why we be introduce great protection for our democracy and it be why we be clamp down on the threat from state that conduct hostile activity in and against the uk commend this statement to the house call the shadow home secretary start by thank the security minister for advance sight of his statement which he provide with his customary professionalism and courtesy we on the conservative benches welcome the commencement of the firs regime legislate for in the last parliament and pay tribute to my right hon friend the members for witham priti patel for braintree mr cleverly for tonbridge tom tugendhat and for east hampshire damian hinds and my right hon and learn friend the member for fareham and waterlooville suella braverman for their work in bring that legislation forward also welcome the announcement that iran and now russia will be include on the enhance list mean that all activity undertake in the uk by those country or those act for those country must be register however will address the bulk of my remark to the elephant in the room which the security minister do not mention at all in his statement china director general ken mccallum say in july almost three year ago the most game change challenge we face come from the chinese communist party it covertly apply pressure across the globe in october he add we have see sustained campaign of chinese espionage on an epic scale in january the director of the fbi christopher wray say that china be the define threat of our generation as such have very simple question for the security minister this afternoon he have plenty to say about iran and russia quite rightly but why be he silent on china we know that china engage in industrial scale espionage seek to steal technology from government university and industry it repress chinese citizen in this country and have seek to infiltrate our political system in expose that china seek to infiltrate this very parliament via its agent christine lee it have set up undeclared and illegal police station in the uk and in december last year it place bounty on the head of three hong kong dissident live in the uk would like to ask again question that be not answer last time why have the chinese ambassador not be summon to explain that there be no question in my mind that china should be in the enhance tier of firs and it be an astonishing omission that it have not be list as such already why be the government silent on this issue in the past government have prioritise economic growth in their relation with china but we now know lot more about how china operate than we do or year ago we know what it be up to be the truth not that in their desperation to get economic growth go after the chancellor rather unfortunate autumn budget the government seem to be prioritise economic link over national security when it come to china imagine that be why the government appear to be intend to grant planning permission to china for its super embassy which we all know will be base for espionage activity the minister have rightly speak about the threat pose by iran and russia he be right to take action and we support he in do so however and the fbi have both warn about the epic threat pose by china so will he please answer this simple question will he place china in the enhance tier to begin on what hope will be point of consensus be grateful to the shadow home secretary for the gratitude he express in general term for the progression of this scheme certainly hope that there be cross party agreement about the importance of this new tool and be very grateful for his support be also grateful for the work do by the previous government on the development and subsequent implementation of the national security act before turn to the question that the shadow home secretary pose just say to he that we be try through the use of firs and other mean and mechanism to ensure that the uk be as hard target as possible and to make it the most challenging operate environment for those who would do we harm the government take these matter incredibly seriously and hope he would acknowledge that we have progress the process of firs at pace despite some accusation from one or two opposition members that that be not the case hope that the shadow home secretary would acknowledge that the main geographical focus today be on russia we cover iran number of week ago but in addition to the other remark have make about firs the focus have be on russia he do not have very much to say about russia but welcome he welcome the fact that we have specify russia on the enhance tier for reason that completely understand the shadow home secretary ask about china he will recall the remark make to this house on march where be very clear that country will be consider separately and decision will be take by this government base on the evidence say then as say again now that will not speculate on which country may or may not be specify in future that be the right way to proceed and hope he understand that hope that the shadow home secretary recognise that the government with the wide strategy we be pursue on china be take consistent long term and strategic approach to manage the uk relationship with china do not agree this will come as no surprise to he with how he characterise the nature of the relationship with that country the government policy be clear we will co operate where we can compete where we need to and challenge where we must include on issue of national security welcome the minister statement and his trademark constructive and authoritative tone often it be frontline police officer who deal with the consequence of aggressive action by hostile state on britain street specifically welcome the minister announcement that training on state threat activity will be offer by counter terrorism police to all territorial police force can he provide further update on the roll out of that training my hon friend make an important point often where the rubber hit the road be the incredibly important work do by police officer on the beat and pay tribute to they and their service it be important that we ensure as government that all police force be ensure that those police officer out and about in the course of their duty get the training they require to be able to identify and appropriately respond to matter that may constitute either transnational repression or state direct activity can give she an assurance that we be work with police force to ensure that that training be take place at pace along with the policing minister my right hon friend the member for kingston upon hull north and cottingham dame diana johnson be liaise with chief constable and police and crime commissioner to ensure that that work be under way that will provide valuable tool for those police our street ensure that they have the requisite skill training knowledge and experience should they encounter the kind of issue we be discuss today call the liberal democrat spokesperson thank the minister as always for advance sight of his statement we on the lib dem benches welcome the further implementation by the government of the foreign influence registration scheme but find myself in the rather unusual position of agree with lot of what the shadow home secretary have say very dangerous territory last year parliament intelligence and security committee issue the excoriate china report which say that the government do not have clear strategy on china and have not devote sufficient resource to tackle the threat it pose will therefore ask the minister some new question that the shadow home secretary do not will the minister confirm whether the government have plan to generate human right and democracy report to conduct the audit on china that they have promise and to ensure that china be fully consider in the strategic defence review as have be mention many be severely concern by the propose chinese mega embassy for which the government have indicate their support do the minister believe that the building of this embassy will encourage the chinese communist party to carry on its attempt to subvert our democracy what conversation have the minister have with colleague across government about block this plan and make protect our democracy key national security priority can the minister say more about how the political influence tier will be administer how do we ensure that every relevant foreign individual sign up to the register it be right if there be top tier of the scheme that russia and iran be on it but will the government now go far by proscribe the irgc as terrorist organisation finally the liberal democrats have long call for reform to funding to prevent foreign interference and to increase transparency in political donation what plan do the government have to close loophole that allow opaque and potentially corrupt funding of political party enable foreign and dark money to influence british politic the hon lady ask number of question and will endeavour to respond to all of they but if do not will certainly come back to she outside of the chamber she ask number of question about ongoing activity across government and she reference the china audit as well as the strategic defence review know she would acknowledge that those matter be not within the bailiwick of the home office but sit with the foreign commonwealth and development office and the ministry of defence can give she categoric assurance that we address these matter across government and we work closely as different department she will know that the prime minister make an announcement just recently about the publication of national security strategy the prime minister have commit to publish the national security strategy in advance of the nato summit in june that document be be work on across government and it will provide hope some of the answer to the question that the hon lady have rightly raise the hon lady ask about the embassy say to she and to all member across the house that national security have be our core priority throughout that process which be why the home secretary and the foreign secretary jointly submit write representation to the planning inspectorate to reflect those consideration hope she will understand that be limited in what can say not least because final decision on the case will be make in due course by the deputy prime minister act in her capacity as secretary of state for housing communities and local government it will be do in an independent quasi judicial role so be unable for legal reason to say anything far on that particular matter at this moment the hon lady helpfully ask about the political influence tier which will strengthen the resilience of our democratic institution against covert foreign influence it will require those in arrangement with foreign power who conduct or arrange for other to conduct political influence activity in the uk to register those activity within day most registration make under the political influence tier will be include on public register and be sure she will recognise the transparency associate with that the hon lady also ask about proscribe the irgc she will remember because she respond to it the statement make on iran last month during which confirm that the government have ask mr jonathan hall to conduct an independent review into the legislative framework around proscription he be make good progress with that work and hope we will be able to update the house far in the near future finally the hon lady ask about funding and she will have see the comment from the electoral commission in the past day or two there be separate electoral law specifically relate to funding but we look carefully at these issue and we be work across government not least with the work lead on through the defend democracy taskforce work with colleague in the ministry for housing communities and local government and in other departments thank the minister for his statement which be of real significance give the increase external threat that our country face give those threat from hostile state actor it be more important than ever that we take effective action to protect our critical national infrastructure from cyber attack and ransomware attack can the minister update we on the plan announce in the king speech for new bill on cyber resilience and the other action be take to improve our protection in this area my hon friend have raise an important point albeit one that be not often the source of much debate this government take our critical national infrastructure extremely seriously and we work with all colleague in all departments not least those in the cabinet office can assure my hon friend that we in the government be absolutely committed to use all our lever to disrupt cyber threat to that critical national infrastructure and we welcome the plan announce today by the department for science innovation and technology to introduce cyber security and resilience bill we work closely with the department on these matter and we know that that important bill will help the uk digital economy to be one of the most secure in the world give we the power to protect our service our supply chain and our citizen which be the first and most important job of any government it be good to hear the minister confirm that the scheme will be keep under review two definitional matter will certainly need to be keep under review first what count as be at the direction of foreign power or specify entity and secondly in respect of the political tier what be the extent of the definition of political influence up until now we have tend to think in term of influence over election parliamentarian or government decision but give the continue development of technology and new medium we can also see the potential for more direct action direct to the public which could conceivably have very high impact effect will the minister keep both those matter under review it be good to see the right hon gentleman in his place there be relatively small band of former security ministers leave in the house and think he be the only one in the chamber at present always appreciate his constructive sensible and reasonable contribution he be absolutely right definition do matter and we have take long time to think very carefully about how good to do this in order to ensure that we define it in the most effective and appropriate way as he will recall from my opening remark we have publish today regulation and guidance provide substantial detail but look forward to discuss these matter far when we debate they through the affirmative procedure and hope very much that the right hon gentleman will contribute to that process border security be national security what step be the minister take along with other home office ministers to strengthen the enforcement of the uk immigration law against those who seek to promote hostile state threat here in britain my right hon friend be right border security be national security she will know that the border security asylum and immigration bill have now complete its committee stage and she and other members will have note that yesterday the prime minister and the home secretary host an organise immigration summit in london which be attend by countless international partner and be very constructive and worthwhile gathering she will also know of the important work that be now be do by the border security commander who be work closely with our international ally we be make good progress with these matter which we take extremely seriously and although we will have more to do be pleased with the progress that we have make to date two of the four ugly totalitarian sister have be include in the list so far and trust that china and north korea will both be add to the enhance tier in the fullness of time but will the minister take back to the government the message that the house be concerned about the building of the big chinese communist embassy in western europe in fact the big embassy in london it be not clear why the government need to call it in on security ground give that the local authority want to refuse permission completely will the minister also explain the differential between the penalty that people will face when expose for act on behalf of foreign power if they have register and the penalty that they will face if they have not register the right hon gentleman speak with great experience and authority on these matter and know he will agree that the implementation of firs give we critical capability that we have not have previously it also provide very clear choice for those who be consider whether they want to engage in this kind of nefarious activity or not they can declare their activity to the government and that be what we want they to do but if they do not they will face arrest and imprisonment over protract period that will provide significant deterrent that we do not currently possess and hope that the right hon gentleman and other will welcome it as for the right hon gentleman point about the embassy know he will understand that be very limited in respect of what can say the shadow home secretary be shake his head be very limited for legal reason because process be under way and if say anything to undermine that process there will be significant consequence however the right hon gentleman have make his point constructively so let think about whether there be some mechanism whereby perhaps on privy council basis there can be briefing in which we discuss these matter in way that be not subject to the scrutiny that the house will rightly bring as have say be very limited in term of what can say but recognise the right hon gentleman concern and will look into whether there be way in which we can discuss it in another forum while align myself with the concern express by the shadow home secretary be happy to take the minister at his word in the last decade the previous government badly misjudge vladimir putin aim regard the united kingdom and his exploitation of our naivety so that the current government do not make the same mistake with the communist party in china will the minister commit himself to release full unredacted russia report and an audit and report on the activity of the conservative friends of russia or as they be more recently term the westminster russia forum think be grateful to the hon gentleman for his question although would probably need to consider it for while long to make an authoritative judgment on whether be grateful to he or not the government position certainly on the publication of the report be clear but be happy to discuss it with he far mindful of the comment that he make about previous government can give he an absolute assurance of how seriously we take these matter with russia and other country understand why he mention china and understand why other member have mention it as well hope he understand that the focus today be on russia as the focus last month be on iran but be happy to discuss these matter far with he and his liberal democrat colleague on the subject of the political tier can the minister say how domestic politician might be affect those who have foreign interlocutor as well as those who be simply involve by virtue of all party parliamentary group as for the enhance tier while appreciate that he be reluctant to be draw on specific can he say whether the scope of what he have in mind might include foreign jurisdiction with state intention to annex the territory of european neighbour and commonwealth partner be always grateful to the right hon gentleman for his question with great respect to he will not go into the specific of his second point because be particularly keen not to do so but let respond to his important question about parliamentarian hopefully he along with other member on both side of the house and in the other place will welcome the fact that for the first time collectively we will be able to see and check whether those who be seek to influence behaviour or activity in this place be do so at the behest of foreign state we be not able to do that at present the fact that we will be able to do it in the future represent significant step forward and hope everyone will recognise that on the point about the political influence tier let reiterate what say previously this will require the registration of activity carry out at the direction of foreign power that seek to influence member of this house that will help protect the integrity of parliament by ensure that we be all informed of any attempt to influence we where foreign power be drive the influence where parliamentarian be name on registration as potential target of influence and the registration be to be publish the firs case management team will be in contact with that parliamentarian this be good and positive step forward for parliamentarian and hope that will be recognise across the house welcome the statement from the minister but if the government be so concerned and rightly so about malign foreign interference with national security what do he make of the statement from the trump administration that tariff decision will be contingent on judicial decision in the uk or of the letter send from the white house to us embassy in europe last week order foreign company with us contract to obey trump executive order not to promote diversity equality and inclusion and would those company require firs registration be reluctant to get into the specific of the way in which particular arrangement may work as that be not entirely helpful however hear what the hon member have say will consider it far and will come back to he with consider response although welcome the government invoke and activation of the firs scheme like curate egg it be good but there be miss bit the elephant in the room and it be very big elephant be what my right hon friend the member for croydon south chris philp and other conservative members have say which be the missing bit about china the fact be that china be behind all this we know that china be involve in support russia in the war that be name in this report it be also behind iran and the work it have do in destabilise gaza and so on and it be behind north korea therefore the question for we be if it be show that china be danger and threat to we internationally be that the case internally we know that the united front work department report directly to president xi it be make up of thousand of organisation that set out to disrupt life here in the uk and it enter into organisation that have influence we know that it have put bounty of million hong kong dollar on the head of people here who have flee tyranny in china we know that the illegal police station still exist that have be drag in hong kong dissident we know they have make attack on dissident in manchester physically and brutally attack they we know that china have spy involve inside the house of commons and outside it as well we know that slave labour exist in the net zero array and the wind farm we be put up and we say nothing about that in fact we vote to continue with slave labour last time around the truth be that we have real problem because china be at the epicentre of everything to disrupt democracy and freedom why be china not in the statement today always appreciate the contribution make by the right hon gentleman as have explain to the house in addition to announcement about firs in more general sense the focus today have fundamentally be on russia the house will have hear the comment he have make and hope he will accept that this government take these matter incredibly seriously hope he have hear the remark that make both early and in my previous statement in response to the threat from iran about how we will consider country on an individual basis and take evidence base decision about how good to proceed be sorry that will not be able to speculate on which country may be specify in the future but hope the right hon gentleman will accept that the announcement we have make offer real value in three particular area there be the point about transparency and he will have note the point on the political tier about require all country to register he will also have note the point about disruption and the point about deterrence this policy will introduce difficult choice for those who be seek to influence the uk in way that have not previously be the case that be the right way to proceed but as say we keep these matter under very close review be always happy to discuss they outwith this chamber should he wish to do so thank the minister for his statement point of order on point of order madam deputy speaker very worrying medium report have emerge overnight that the iranian regime may be contemplate military strike on our base on diego garcia for instance the telegraph have report senior iranian official say military commander have be ask to target the joint uk us base which sit on britain chagos islands in an attempt to deter donald trump from strike iran moreover in the last hour or so with foreign office question conveniently out of the way there be emerge medium report that the government may have come to so call deal with mauritius over the future of the chagos island themselves if that be true the uk parliament have yet again be keep in the dark about the future of what be still today british sovereign territory and vital strategic installation madam deputy speaker may ask if you or indeed mr speaker have be give any indication that the government intend to come to this house to make statement tonight or at the very late tomorrow about first an imply military threat to the chagos island and secondly legal and diplomatic threat to the chagos island which be and should remain fundamentally british be grateful to the right hon gentleman for give notice of his point of order of course the chamber have just be hear statement that be in part about threat pose by iran to the united kingdom and its interest however can inform he that the chair have not receive any notification of statement on the specific matter he raise he will know that those on the treasury bench have be listen to his point carefully as an experienced member of this house he will also be consider other way in which he can make sure that this matter be raise bills present sentencing guidelines pre sentence reports bill presentation and first reading standing order no secretary shabana mahmood support by the prime minister secretary angela rayner secretary yvette cooper and secretary peter kyle present bill to make provision about sentence guideline in relation to pre sentence report bill read the first time to be read second time tomorrow and to be print bill with explanatory note bill en street works penalty for utility companies bill presentation and first reading standing order no daisy cooper present bill to make provision for the daily issuance of fixed penalty notices against utility company which have commit certain offence under the new roads and street works act to require the minimum amount of any such penalty to be equal to the cost associate with the issuance of the relate fixed penalty notice and for connected purpose bill read the first time to be read second time on friday july and to be print bill transport duty to cooperate motion for leave to bring in bill standing order no beg to move that leave be give to bring in bill to provide for duty on transport authority and other specify person to cooperate to reduce transport disruption and to ensure the effective operation of transport network to provide for reporting requirement in connection with that duty to require the publication of assessment of expect transport disruption result from maintenance construction and other work relate to transport infrastructure and ancillary service and for connected purpose as the member of parliament for runnymede and weybridge my mission be to keep they move we rely on our transport network to get to work school or college and doctor appointment or just to see friend and family whether by road rail or even air we be dependent on our transport network discussion about critical infrastructure often focus on big apparently unprecedented event such as the recent power failure at heathrow but even the small road be critical infrastructure if someone can not leave their house because of an engineering diversion route we all welcome work to improve our road and transport network and we of course recognise that this may cause some disruption we understand that there will be temporary disruption for unexpected emergency work such as power cut or gas leak however all too often our transport infrastructure in runnymede and weybridge be bring to halt due to multiple plan work happen at the same time or plan utility work cause recurrent disruption through multiple provider gas electricity water broadband dig up the same road over and over again disruption should be avoid and minimise by authority and provider talk to each other and co ordinating work ensure co ordination when road and rail work take place be the purpose of my bill sadly in runnymede and weybridge we have load of example where co ordination have not take place despite repeat assurance that authority do co ordinate and discuss issue regularly we have have full closure coincide with mainline rail engineering work despite reassurance otherwise road in some area of chertsey have be repeatedly dig up often under the guise of urgent work from gas to water to electricity perhaps most infuriatingly authority or utility sometimes do not adequately staff work or leave they unattended mean that when the signal fail at painshill roundabout and separately in weybridge it take hour to resolve because the right equipment and staff be not on site to fix the problem we understand and expect there to be some disruption but believe well planning and co ordination can prevent and avoid much of what we have see locally surrey county council have be work hard to address issue on our local road network thank the council and in particular councillor jonathan hulley for his leadership and work on this issue surrey have establish new taskforce to drive well co ordination and communication of work across our road network surrey along with national highways and six major utility provider have call on the department for transport to make change to system and process to reduce the negative impact of emergency utility work across the county it have call for change to digital service use to manage highway work in england to enable prior notice of urgent work where possible improve communication and co ordination surrey have also call for among other thing mandatory onsite signage for emergency work to explain delay the lead agency to improve information for road user and of course requirement for swift completion of work to reduce disruption and support economic productivity fully support the proposal which could resolve many local issue but they alone can not achieve the co ordination require across network to address all the issue have highlight that be why be bring forward the bill call for statutory duty to co ordinate under the duty national highways could not have inform that it be unaware of the impact excess train on the chertsey branch line would have on level crossing and the local road network on the same weekend as motorway closure because it would have be require to communicate co ordinate and assess the likely impact of its action under the duty network rail would not have be able to inform that while it usually do communicate with other authority on this occasion it forget combine with the work undertake by surrey county council under the duty utility company would not have be able to place repeat and unannounced work alongside major diversion route with impunity when utility company dig up the road they would need to check if anything else need to be fix at the same time our transport link be the lifeblood of our community and our economy in national highways estimate that total delay on its network alone cost billion each year add to that the cost of delay on local road network hour miss from work good stick in transit and the value of address the issue be clear if not just for the benefit to our community but to the uk economy as whole ask the government and colleague across the house to support the bill and the work of colleague in surrey to address these issue and to ensure our national transport infrastructure operate effectively and efficiently for all let we keep runnymede and weybridge move question put and agree to order that dr ben spencer rebecca paul and gregory stafford present the bill dr ben spencer accordingly present the bill bill read the first time to be read second time on friday april and to be print bill product regulation and metrology bill lords second read the reasoned amendment in the name of andrew griffith have be select beg to move that the bill be now read second time will the secretary of state give way laughter of course why not when do weight and measure become metrology be this use of newspeak deliberate to cover an orwellian attempt to cloak this huge grab for power and to what end be grateful for that intervention very early on in proceeding can not provide definitive answer to the right hon gentleman on the naming of the bill but promise that will find out and put it to he in writing but he will know that the bill be believe originally plan by the previous government because of the need to repatriate power to the united kingdom as result of our exit from the european union it be something we need in our toolkit so far from be orwellian it be pragmatic practical proposal look forward to now make the case for it in more detail the primary mission of this government and the drive force of my department be strong economic growth not just growth that look good on paper but growth that be see and be feel on our high street in our town and city and in the community we serve growth that reverse year of stagnation with all the negative consequence we all feel during that time to do that we need an economy in which shop and small business can compete on more level playing field with online marketplace and the big tech giant we need an economy that promote investment and innovation but at the same time ensure consumer and business have real modern protection that be why the product regulation and metrology bill be small but hugely important piece of legislation one that will far cement the uk status as world leader in product regulation and safety my right hon friend be give an important introduction to the bill do he agree that international alignment in the standard we be discuss on scientific matter be essential for the smooth operation of modern advanced manufacturing be hugely grateful to my hon friend for that intervention believe be correct in say that he be not only metrologist but the first metrologist elect to parliament put no heavy expectation on his speech today but we be all look forward to it with interest my hon friend be right that there be area where we will choose to work with international standard and there will be area where we choose to diverge but that decision be make possible only by have the power to begin with no decision will be make in this bill if it become an act of parliament as to how we will do that however without it we would not have the toolkit to make those decision the essence of these propose law be that we be take back control for the house of commons and parliament to make these kind of decision the secretary of state will be aware from the second reading debate in the lords that number of what shall gently refer to as eurosceptic peer have express concern that the bill be form of dynamic alignment with the european union and that far from take back control over which standard be involve and which guideline be necessary we will be abdicate control in favour of whatever the european union decide can he set our mind at rest over those concern be sure he would not wish to be divert along such dead end route be extremely grateful to the right hon gentleman for that intervention he always bring wisdom to these debate can absolutely give he the assurance that the bill make no decision as to how we should use these power the reason we be bring it forward today be the same reason the previous conservative government first propose bill of this kind have leave the european union we need the power to properly regulate these product in this way without this legislation we would not necessarily have the ability to do that on that specific point far to the remark of my right hon friend the member for new forest east sir julian lewis that presumably mean that the government will press for recognition of uk standard where they prevail and where we think we be do the job well there will absolutely be occasion where we can learn from other and other occasion where they can learn from we be that the government intention will the secretary of state make that clear now be more than happy to make that clear we see that in number of area it be the case across the whole field of regulation let we look at ai which be topical right now we have choose different regulatory path in the uk from the european union which be to our economic advantage be very confident in the approach that we be take be sure that when get to the provision of the bill and in particular when it come to weight and measure the whole house will be unite in be able to say that we believe that traditional british standard be particularly important to we say again however that have the power to set standard in itself make no decision as to how these power be use we can all clearly recognise the need to repatriate these power to our own statute book rise be go to make little progress but can not resist the right hon gentleman just want to raise small point when be do some work on this matter for previous government look at what we could do with our regulation and standard on leave the eu it become apparent that the uk be behind only america and china globally in set standard for the rest of the world to what degree be the secretary of state planning to enhance that rather than return to any european usage of standard when we already dominate the field the right hon gentleman will have hear say just now that our intention be to cement the uk status as world leader in product regulation and safety be sure we would all recognise the tremendous benefit for both consumer and business that come from be jurisdiction whose consumer protection be widely recognise and where people have confidence that the good and service they buy will be to the high standard possible where we see gap in our provision because of the substantial change that have occur with our leave the european union we would surely want to fill those gap so that we be in position to continue our success in this area the minister give the house the assurance that the idea be not to take we back to eu law or to have eu law impose on the united kingdom and yet the bill heavily reference eu law how do he explain that can explain it very clearly colleague who be interested in this legislation will have follow the proceeding in the other place and the discussion on this area put the case very straightforwardly we do not have the ability without this bill to regulate product standard in whole range of area there be some case where there will be strong consumer or business demand for alignment with other jurisdiction there will also be case where we wish to diverge because we see that as be in our economic interest however we surely all accept that we can not have position where we do not have the ability to regulate key product and in particular product that have come from the new technology that be available and the opportunity that come from that once again say politely to anyone on the opposition benches who be not quite reassure that the previous conservative government be plan similar bill to fill this exact gap in the statute book would like to make two point first this house can do what it want it do not need this bill to regulate anything to say that be do simply be not true secondly on the question of whether the bill will lead to dynamic realignment with the eu can the secretary of state explain what clause be for it seem to that it could be use to dynamically realign with eu regulation rise will give way to the right hon member wish to give the secretary of state time to read the clause he owe now madam deputy speaker the key thing be that we must not use eu standard as the default the hon member for blackley and middleton south graham stringer be right that we have the authority to make our own standard and we often do so very well but the risk be that where we have not yet do that the eu standard will become the default position the minister can make it crystal clear to we today that that be not the case as ever be particularly grateful to the right hon member for his courtesy to my hon friend the member for blackley and middleton south graham stringer say that clause say product regulation may provide that product requirement be to be treat as meet if it clearly say may and if again say that there will be time when it be in our economic interest to have close relationship with the product standard in for instance the european union or another jurisdiction there will also be time when it be not that will be our choice think we would all recognise the absence of power without this bill the right hon gentleman make reference to the ability of this house to make regulation we can of course do so by primary legislation there be parliamentarian who say that the use of delegate power carry risk of abuse by the executive which be not something the opposition could ever support official report taxation cross border trade public bill committee february the secretary of state should agree with that because it be he who say it that be obviously part of very wise set of remark that make from the dispatch box but yes we must recognise that say again because the bill have be through the other place that change have be make as result of that feedback we have remove number of henry viii power we have introduce consultation requirement we have provide for additional affirmative resolution procedure and we have say that we will publish code of conduct that set out the statutory and non statutory control to ensure that regulation be proportionate evidence base and develop through consultation because of the process that we have be through we have respond to the kind of concern that be wisely articulate in relation to primary legislation perhaps it will be of use to the house if say little about that journey and the work of the other place in this regard wish to thank in particular my ministerial colleague lord leong for his great effort in take the bill through the other place also thank the many members and committees of the other house for their assistance in create what believe be strong and effective legislation legislation that will benefit million of uk business ten of million of consumer and of course all those who enjoy pint or two at the pub on pint give way on that point the minister be right to praise the house of lords for make sure that the great british pint be in this bill as an exclusion from the metrology regulation however this will not satisfy the metric martyr the minister will remember that the ability to sell in imperial measure be big issue few year ago why be it that there be an elaborate schedule to the product regulation but not to metrology and why in particular be food generically not include in the exemption from what the minister propose to do we would say with confidence that there be never danger to the pint but because of the concern that be raise in the other place and perhaps by some colleague here be more than happy to have make the change to assure everyone present and everyone watch that the pint will be defend and secure in the bill have to say that have receive no entreaty from business that they wish to sell in imperial measurement however if the right hon gentleman believe that there be an absence of provision in the bill he can write to and shall write back to he and hopefully be able to reassure he think he may be misplace in think that that be principal issue for uk business as all hon member know the digital age in which we live have create significant growth opportunity the consumer and technology landscape that we have today be almost unrecognisable from those we have or year ago so the product that we buy and the way in which we buy they be evolve rapidly that mean that the relevant rule and regulation must adapt too if we be to protect consumer and business especially small firm that be essential as we have examine in some detail product regulation and metrology be policy area that have largely be repatriate from the eu follow our withdrawal in since then the uk government have simply not have the necessary power to continue regulate these area effectively we have bring forward this legislation so that we can respond to anticipate change in the global regulatory landscape that be why to be frank be somewhat bemused by the reason amendment table today the bill will ensure that the uk be well place to address modern day safety issue it give we the power to well regulate item such as potentially dangerous baby sleep product and toy it will enable we to reduce burden on business and keep up with technological development for example by update the outdoor noise regulation in great britain it will align testing method across the uk which be overwhelmingly support in our recent call for evidence and it will protect the public from noise pollution from product like lawn mower and power generator have only closely scrutinise the bill today so be just bring myself up to date on this it appear to give the secretary of state the power to ban any product he wish for whatever reason we make law in this place not for when we be deal with minister of the moral calibre of the right hon gentleman but on the basis that we might have someone who lack such quality that be who we legislate for be it true that this bill would give the secretary of state the power to ban literally any product and that all that would have to be do be to notify this house be grateful to the right hon gentleman for his concern and his regard believe that if we be of the view that product be danger to the public the right hon gentleman would expect as secretary of state in my department to take action if he be concerned about provision in the bill he can look to the change that have be make it have be through an extensive scrutiny process in the other place particularly in relation to the power and delegate power give to the secretary of state think he recognise the case we be make for the safety of the public indeed it be why opposition member themselves recognise the need for bill of this kind the bill will help to create level playing field between the high street and online marketplace critically we be able to protect consumer by reduce the number of unsafe and non comply good that be sell online this could include ask site to verify third party seller before allow they to list their good or to have product safety reporting function for customer on their site one example be scooter and bike which like many product be reliant on lithium ion battery these battery have be attribute as the cause of number of fire in recent year both in household and on public transport while we know that the vast majority of product be safe in recent year we have see some good mis sell by minority of unscrupulous manufacturer and seller as result low standard high risk product have be able to enter the uk market some people have pay for this with their home and in some case their life think we would all recognise that that be unconscionable want to pay tribute to the family of sofia duarte sofia tragically die when bicycle that have be convert into an bike burst into flame the bike lithium battery pack fail cause fire on new year day know that the whole house will join in recognise the bravery and courage of sofia family in campaign for change in memory of their daughter and in fight for well regulation of bike along with the battery and charger associate with they also thank the london fire brigade for its campaigning on this issue in recent year it have be on the frontline see at first hand the devastation that have be work by some of these product this bill be about keep the public safe the office for product safety and standards have take action in this area already it have issue withdrawal notice on eight online marketplace two manufacturer and seller this have remove two dangerous model of bike battery from sale and be glad that the legislation we be discuss today will allow we to consider further step on enforcement have campaign for great regulation of bicycle which have get away with kill individual not to mention bike want to pick the secretary of state up on particular point do not disagree with he on the need for regulation and it should have be do some time ago so we be as one on that however still do not think that he have quite answer the question pose by the hon member for blackley and middleton south graham stringer and by my right hon friend the member for beverley and holderness graham stuart just now why do we need to have wide sweep bill like this if we could do it already in the house by vote if we have powerful enough argument to say to both houses this must be do then they will see it through very quickly by the power of persuasion but they would have the right to vote on it and to disagree the bill take that right away and achieve the same result but only by way of diktat from whoever be in power and by the way agree with what the secretary of state say in opposition be sorry that we have not convince the right hon gentleman but be certain that the government need power in this area we need to be able to respond to fast move change in technology and regulation the public would expect as secretary of state as well as my department and the government to have these power to keep they safe perhaps we have not convince he at this stage but he can look at proceeding in the other place and in committee rise will give way one more time before we come to the amendment that be make in the lords be genuinely grateful to the right hon gentleman he say that he have fail to persuade opposition members in this place but do he accept that he have also fail to persuade the delegated powers and regulatory reform committee in the other place that committee which be chair by labour say last month we remain of the view that the delegation to ministers of law make power in this bill involve legislative power shift to an unacceptable extent from the legislature to the executive why do he think the committee remain against his view find that when political party go into opposition all of sudden they seem less keen on the government have decisive power to take action in whole range of area we have listen carefully to the criticism from the delegated powers and regulatory reform committee and significant change have be make to the legislation which be happy to take the hon member through they relate to the number of henry viii power the consultation requirement and the additional affirmative resolution procedure we be always seek feedback will now go through some of the other amendment that be make in the other place rise the question always have for the right hon gentleman be be it go to be good will give way one more time it will be brief forget the delegated powers and regulatory reform committee what about the secretary of state colleague lord leong he say in the house of lords that he do not think the bill be right in what way do it need to be improve will the secretary of state look carefully at the extent of these power even from this short debate it be clear how wide range and over the top they be on second reading we have bill that be even strong than the one that start in the other house once again thank all our colleague in the other place for their constructive feedback and contribution to the debate will not go through every change that have be make but will mention some aspect of the bill that have be strengthen first we have amend the bill to ensure that there be more parliamentary scrutiny and we have provide for statutory consultation requirement to ensure that regulation be inform by those who would be impact by they there will also be that additional use of the affirmative procedure for regulation stem from the bill secondly the bill now include requirement for as the secretary of state to publish statement set out how my department expect to identify and assess high risk product finally contrary to previous suggestion from the conservative party the great british pint will clearly not be affect by this legislation whether that be ale cider or indeed milk we do not believe that the bill in its original form pose any threat to the pint but we do not want to run the risk of colleague think that my reassurance be small beer so we accept an amendment table in the other place that will give the pint statutory protection that mean madam deputy speaker that in few week time when hope you will confirm to the house that the bill have receive royal assent we will all be able to raise pint protect under statute to the bill do inquire about whether be allow to bring pint with to the chamber to illustrate the point but that be apparently not in order only the chancellor have that ability give the week be have perhaps we will look at that at later date to summarise this legislation will finally enable the government to properly regulate in area where we have be unable to do so post brexit it will also give we the tool we need to well regulate modern day consumer product the bill will help to create fair environment for high street shop and small business support our growth mission and provide well protection for million of consumer for all those reason commend the bill to the house call the shadow secretary of state beg to move an amendment to leave out from that to the end of the question and add this house decline to give second reading to the product regulation and metrology bill lords because it will provide for regulatory alignment with the european union and it have be condemn three time by the house of lords delegated powers and regulatory reform committee as skeleton bill which provide without justification inappropriately wide power for ministers to re write the regulatory regime for product safety and the weight and measure of good by regulation too often when the public think of parliament they think of out of touch power and bad law the bill be the archetype of everything that be wrong with westminster there should be an unwritten rule in this postcode never trust bill with convoluted name this bill be no exception although it profess to simplify our regulatory framework the reality be that this be an eu trojan horse of bill which will sabotage our brexit freedom undermine the integrity of the united kingdom disrespect parliament befuddle british business with uncertainty and take we back to be brussels rule taker all from party that vote time to overturn the will of the british people will the hon member give way will not but before get into will say something nice about the right hon gentleman in minute before get into detail let welcome the government turn on their plan to scrap the great british pint let we hope that that be the first of many when raise that on february labour members describe it as conspiracy theory the hon member for st albans daisy cooper say it be scaremongere and the exchequer secretary to the treasury the hon member for ealing north james murray say that an amendment be no more need than law to say that the sun must rise in the morning official report february vol the truth be that the government be catch red handed try to ditch our british pint by this back door bill have the opposition not fight back the power to crush the british pint would have rest on the whim of minister pen welcome though that turn be let we not ignore the fact that the labour government want to give themselves the power in the first place rise rise will give way to the hon member for birmingham northfield laurence turner thank the shadow minister for give way and hope he will also give way to my right hon friend on the front bench will he tell the house what possible motive he think labour government would have for scrap the pint the labour motive be all too plain to see this be labour party that vote time to reject the will of the british people lead by the prime minister who seek second referendum to overturn that will accept that the hon member for birmingham northfield be not in the house at the time but he might want to spend some time with his colleague in the tea room and hear precisely what happen will the hon member give way no will make some progress the anti pub anti hospitality agenda go far beyond this bill the job tax the threshold change the attack on seasonal and flexible working the more than double of business rate the war on pub banter and the garden smoking ban be all from this government our hospitality industry the secretary of state be smirk deserve infinitely well than this from this government will the hon member give way be happy to give way if the right hon gentleman talk about what he will do to repeal the employment rights bill the hon member be senior member of the previous government and play well know role in the mini budget as well as number of other thing that that government do will he confirm that they be plan exactly the same piece of legislation because of an absence in the statute book once again the secretary of state have fail to engage on the key issue which be that british it be not funny british business be bleed out business confidence be at record low unemployment be rise and all the government have to talk about be the past not what they be currently deliver my hon friend be ask just now whether the previous government be likely to have introduce this legislation may set the record straight have we do so the secretary of state would have vote against it my right hon friend have great wisdom on these matter will the hon member give way let move on the big flaw of many in this bill be that as the hon member for blackley and middleton south graham stringer and my right hon friend the member for beverley and holderness graham stuart have both identify it hand over too much power with too little accountability there be real need to consider the balance between primary and secondary legislation which in recent year have weigh too heavily in favour of delegate power excessive reliance on delegate power henry viii clause or skeleton legislation such as this bill upset the proper balance between parliament and the executive those be not my word but those of the attorney general they be take from speech that he make in october while in government about the importance of restore parliamentary sovereignty no one who consider that speech could fail to agree the lords delegate powers and regulatory reform committee have slam the bill not once not twice but three time include after the government change be make to put this into context the wide power contain in this page bill will allow ministers unilaterally to amend product safety regulation impose obligation on online marketplace meddle with standard for weight and measure or entirely align british regulatory standard with the european union pose threat to the integrity of the uk internal market it be page of the most egregious whitehall overreach do my hon friend agree that this be yet another hammer blow to british business we have have the labour government introduce billion of tax with the employer national insurance contribution billion of cost with worker right and never end increase in energy bill as they drive forward on their net zero fantasy now they will be able to change regulation more or less on whim whenever they feel like it destroy certainty and confidence for british business my right hon friend make serious and important point take the secretary of state in good faith when he say that he desire for his government to grow the economy every government should and believe that this government should as well but he must recognise that every single action he take will take we far away from that goal by pile on the red tape and increase the level of tax the regulatory jeopardy in this bill will do the same by simply make it impossible to know what product regulation will look like how can any business plan for the future when the power offer up by the bill introduce such prospect of unpredictable regulatory change do the hon gentleman not agree that someone sit at home watch this will be worry by the argument that it be more important to stick to some anti eu dogma than it be to protect their child from dangerous product or to keep dangerous electric bike off the market and regulate for their safety with the very good will in the world think the hon lady can do great deal well than that as hon member have say this house can legislate if there be dangerous product bring those use case here and believe that across the house we will legislate rapidly to protect our constituent safety however our constituent do not send we here to pass page bill full of skeleton power to give the secretary of state an unlimited ability to regulate without have to consult this place the challenge for many of we who be here during the previous parliament when the hon member be in office and have the power to diverge be that we watch what happen and we see the cost to british business that be why the previous government decide in the end to abandon the british charter mark be it not would he care to tell the house how much proceed with his plan would have cost british business it be billion in case he do not know british business need to hear that we get it they do not want more paperwork they want less be genuinely intrigue and shall sit here and listen to the hon lady speech later on do she want divergence do she want we to use our brexit freedom or do she seek to go back to be rule taker and converge we have not hear compelling argument from the secretary of state today as to why these power should be grant it be right that we in this house adopt the precautionary principle and if the secretary of state or the minister in wind up can give we some more compelling use case be sure we would consider that this be all very important there have be some merriment about the pint but in the novel nineteen eighty four by george orwell the hero go into pub and somebody there lament the fact that the despotic regime have just abolish the pint and force people to drink litre the road to serfdom be pave by many step such as this by the way when be minister for consumer affair many year ago we regularly ban thing we do not need this bill my right hon friend make the perfect point that this be precisely what the road to serfdom look like whether it be serfdom to an individual minister at moment in time or serfdom to an unelected brussels bureaucratic elite why would we give up the power of this house the reason why we be send here and the ability to hold the government to account the hon member describe the bill as trojan horse it be more like trojan donkey do he agree that clause be particular problem because it appear to take european union regulation as the baseline for determine safety to many of we the assumption that european union regulation should be the starting point for any safety regulation that we might want to make seem somewhat bizarre the right hon gentleman be exactly right and we can contrast the number of reference to the european union throughout the bill with for example our big single country trading partner the united states want to directly answer the point make by the right hon member for south west wiltshire dr murrison and provide clarification that have just seek clause be not about alignment it be about recognition we already recognise certain eu product requirement on mutual recognition basis and where it be of benefit to do so that be what the clause allow rather than take european standard as the basis for our own and align with they it enable that where it be recognise that we have the interest can write to he in detail if he wish on behalf of my right hon friend the member for south west wiltshire dr murrison thank the secretary of state for intervene it be important that we legislate with full understanding of what the law say but the point still stand on the overweighting of reference to eu standard versus comparable standard from the united states and commonwealth friend of this great nation on that note the point be the one make to the secretary of state where as the impact assessment suggest regulation be move at pace the secretary of state repeat that we will default to european set of standard that be the problem and that be certainly imply in the bill impact assessment seek the secretary of state assurance that that will not happen if it do not happen will there be no rule or regulation how will that work in practice we be have the proper debate through these intervention that perhaps we should have have when the secretary of state be introduce the bill that illustrate the point about put vast amount of ambiguity even if it be well intentione into the law and how thing will operate and for reason of which we know not if there be instance of for example scooter catch fire in people hall this house have the ability to legislate and legislate fast where necessary against those particular harm at that particular moment in time my right hon friend with his many year of experience in this house understand that point and think that be what he be say although opposition members will perhaps deliberately choose to believe that the word and assurance give be ambiguous do the hon member accept that even government members in the house of lords believe there be an ambiguity that need to be clear up one comment be the question of dynamic alignment with the eu remain unanswered yet ever more topical official report house of lords march vol the hon member make exactly the right point this be blank cheque bill and trojan horse bill it be simply not clear under this secretary of state or any secretary of state in the future once these power have be cede by this place how they will be implement there be real asymmetry in the constant litany of reference to the european union value trading partner of our but only one value trading partner of our as hope the secretary of state be about to reveal over the come day tomorrow we understand that tariff will be impose by the united states on british exporter if that be the case that would be the bad failure of trade policy for generation it be business job and our economy that will all pay the price the chancellor emergency budget will not have last single week because she make no provision for the imposition of tariff if that be indeed what be to come it be frankly outrageous that the government have fail to make statement about where we be despite the prime minister official spokesman brief the lobby and the business and trade secretary himself find time this morning to conduct round of medium interview if the secretary of state would like to comment on the progress of us talk will happily give way this be little off topic for second reading but the hon gentleman could have just listen to the today programme this morning he would have hear articulate those concern we be engage with our us counterpart more so than any other country in those negotiation he will know that will not share the content or detail of those talk the policy originate with the president of the united states and we be respond to and engage with it the hon gentleman will understand that it come from the mandate and the agenda of the us administration order remind the secretary of state and the shadow secretary of state that we be debate the second reading of the product regulation and metrology bill and not necessarily tariff of course madam deputy speaker be near conclusion in any case however do think that the issue of product safety the rule and regulation that govern our economy as the secretary of state himself say be intrinsically link with trade mutual recognition and grow the economy by remove trade friction and barrier rather than erect they and subject business to the tyranny of simply not understand the corpus of rule and regulation my hon friend be make powerful speech do he like hope that the liberal democrats despite their hobby horse love of the eu do not allow the eu flavouring of the bill to blind they to the frankly illiberal executive enhance legislature diminish aspect of the bill if they genuinely aspire to be his majesty opposition they will join we this evening in vote against second reading my right hon friend make an important point hope as the secretary of state slightly allude to in his remark about the ability of country to make its own rule and regulation that we will soon be back in the house with government statement at which we can celebrate the mother of all brexit benefit secure the ability to conduct our own trade look forward to hear from the liberal democrats exactly how much they welcome that ability on behalf of their constituent although can not speak immediately for all liberal democrats it puzzle we that the official opposition do not seem to recognise that if they have legislate properly when we leave the european union this legislation would not be necessary do they not accept any responsibility for where we be today we will not accept any lesson from the liberal democrats about what it take to brexit successfully and go back to be an independent nation but if that be what the hon lady will speak about look forward to hear it to conclude the bill be flawed in so many way with the good will in the world ministers should not be propose it particularly give their failure so far to protect we from us tariff it be bad bill from government who be already fail it be travesty for anyone who care about respect for parliamentary democracy and the role of this house versus ministers it be as say trojan horse bill that will sabotage our brexit freedom and take we back to be an eu rule taker which the british people have long put behind we urge the house to back our reason amendment and end this terrible bill welcome this essential and timely bill which upgrade our product safety regulation and metrology word that admit have to look up but it do not take much to understand it framework deliver much need boost to protection for consumer and ensure that every company in the uk whether they operate online or on our high street uphold the high product safety and quality standard that work people in this country deserve and that have be absent for too long whether it be faulty carbon monoxide alarm dangerous child toy or the issue of spontaneously combust bike and scooter which have be raise with by my constituent in worsley and eccles example of hazardous product be on sale be far too common clearly there be an urgent need to raise the bar on consumer product safety in this country the bill achieve that aim establish modern safety regime that will enable company to operate safely while account for the post brexit regulatory landscape in an increasingly turbulent international trading environment it be imperative that the government update the uk product regulation however since our exit from the eu the government have not have the necessary power to meet the challenge present by the fast move global product safety standard environment that have leave british consumer vulnerable to fall behind with regard to protection be interested in the hon gentleman argument have be in this house for little while have sit on both side of the house and have be in government have never come across government who have fail to get regulation through when they feel it be necessary to do so but it go through with debate we can not just impose regulation because we think it be right there have to be some measure of whether it be balance and whether it work and that be normally do by this house why give it to the government alone if the system we have in place be work we would not be here debate this and we would not see these shoddy product on sale or these fire the only explanation be either that the system do not work or the last government fail in their duty to the people of this country as be say this have leave british consumer vulnerable to fall behind with regard to protection in rapidly emerge area of product safety that need reaction for example those relate to new technology such as ai and lithium ion battery therefore support the bill provision to enable the government to meet the fast move challenge of the day in these area be interested that my hon friend mention ai there be three major system around the world be propose for artificial intelligence regulation those in china the eu and the united states if we have to make choice for our own framework which might be different from those for the safety of people in industry why should that not be do on the floor of this house rather than through delegate regulation it be one of the most important issue that will face we in the come year welcome my hon friend intervention will happily admit to the house that be not an expert on ai do however recognise that the fast develop nature of ai as it relate to consumer safety and product regulation require rapid response which be potentially not necessarily suit to full debate on the floor of the house can the hon gentleman give single instance of government at any time in the past decade not be able to take action on seriously risky product can not think of one can think of several for example the lack of regulation around the bike and scooter on our street that be cause fire we be in fast move environment and we be create framework that will future proof our system want to help my hon friend out because he be not here when the previous government introduce the retained eu law revocation and reform bill which delete more than law and use statutory instrument to replace they the right hon member for beverley and holderness graham stuart who be minister at the time be nod his head as if that process be acceptable he be now challenge colleague who be not here at the time by say that somehow it be not acceptable now but it be acceptable then my hon friend be right to be concern and slightly sceptical about the opposition sudden agreement that statutory instrument be perhaps not the good way forward be grateful to my hon friend for that intervention we be deal with regulatory black hole that be leave behind and the absence of framework be let down the consumer and people of this be about to say that be sure we would all agree on that but that be potentially stretch in this debate and in this chamber hope that we do agree that consumer should be able to buy product online without worry about their safety and that product standard should not be bypass or compromise on any platform digital or otherwise however research by the office for product safety and standards find that in of product for sale on online marketplace between and fail to meet safety standard which underline the need for the bill we can not allow company to circumvent essential safety standard present public health risk just because they sell their product online however the bill be not just about safety critical though that be it be also about ensure fairness we simply can not continue with product safety regime that enable online marketplace to undercut brick and mortar retailer or that allow rogue trader to out compete responsible retailer with unsafe low quality product that be unfair on consumer reputable manufacturer and the small high street business that must compete with the online giant with online sale already make up over quarter of total retail sale in we must level that play field now provide our high street with long overdue boost to their competitiveness the hon gentleman make fair point about product regulation but be the issue that he be highlight not actually about enforcement have no issue with legislate for product regulation safety standard but they already exist in fact he say that there be product that do not meet the safety standard so we know that those standard exist the issue that he highlight be purely around enforcement which this bill do nothing to address disagree that the issue be purely around enforcement obviously there be element of enforcement but separate out one part of package regulatory framework that will future proof we from other issue be not coherent argument to conclude it be vital that we create product safety regulatory and metrology framework that protect consumer encourage fair competition and meet the change picture internationally this bill deliver that framework and look forward to support it far in this house call the liberal democrat spokesperson declare an interest have spend year in the toy industry and in another life have be the chair and the president of the british toy hobby association it be wonderful job the second good job the good job be be the first ever liberal democrat mp for wokingham and the last doubt that very much nearly decade since the brexit referendum this house be still grapple with what it mean to be outside of the european union away from the big headline about trade deal and newly erect border the technical nitty gritty of product safety and metrology be ever more important now that we must decide what we want our policy to be in this area our original framework derive from eu law must now keep up with fast evolve technology and consumer behaviour technological change in the century may have create new opportunity but they have also leave we expose to new risk such as ai battery hazard and bike fire our online marketplace and the complex digital commerce that facilitate they have reduce barrier to small and medium sized enterprise share their product across the uk and the world but the internet be still wild west in many way leave small business and consumer expose that be why the liberal democrats welcome aspect of this bill we fully understand and support the need to update the regulatory framework for the uk marketplace to give business and consumer confidence in their product we welcome in principle the power in the bill to put new responsibility on online marketplace throughout the supply chain and we support enhance consumer protection for product that pose safety risk the product regulation fall in scope of this bill will have an impact on our country trade policy and the liberal democrats be clear when it come to trade we believe the government must pull the most powerful and readily available lever at their disposal to kickstart economic growth by urgently launch negotiation for new uk eu custom union that would create job boost our public finance and reverse much of the damage inflict on our economy by the previous conservative government terrible trade deal with europe take this opportunity to urge the government to move in that direction and to commit that as part of these trade negotiation they will use the provision in the bill to facilitate new custom union which could have such transformative effect on our economy be really grateful to the hon gentleman for engage with the issue about product safety and consumer protection in the bill and he be make serious speech in relation to they first on the point of the custom union which be skilfully weave into his speech that would preclude we from reach any arrangement with the united states india the gulf state or other country for my money if we wish to be part of something without say in how it would affect our trade policy that would be very difficult position to take will come back to the reference make by conservative mps who often feel like they be fight the old last war they can not get past it order first gently suggest to the secretary of state that he be mean to be make an intervention secondly we be quite definitely debate the second reading of the product regulation and metrology bill not customs union perhaps the secretary of state will conclude his remark will madam deputy speaker in relation to the number of reference make to the eu in this bill the eu be explicitly reference simply because uk product regulation be derive from lot of eu regulation we have to reference that when look to the future particularly when we recognise some of those european standard but it be wrong to simply look at those reference and try to make they out to be something they be not thank you for your intervention secretary of state you be right he be right sorry the secretary of state be right when he talk about we need to keep up with eu regulation we definitely need to do that despite the potential in this bill unfortunately it contain very little actual policy it rely far too heavily on secondary legislation which limit opportunity for parliamentary scrutiny and provide little clarity on what the government actually intend to do with the power they be give themselves the bill hurl we into hokey cokey trade policy in which at ministers political whim we can stick ourselves into align with the eu just as easily as we can throw ourselves out of it all over again if another government decide they want to do that it will also hurt business confidence because the underlie regulation of our country can be easily alter without the appropriate level of scrutiny from parliament take step back from the issue of eu alignment this principle can apply across any of the area that this bill seek to regulate it be develop opaque mechanism on which the government expect we to trust they to do well however government members must contend with the fact that they will not be there forever all the potentially positive thing they could do with this legislation could be reverse or make bad by different government it be at this point that must recognise the excellent work of the liberal democrat peer for example lib dem lord introduce an amendment that protect the use of the unique british pint measurement ensure that the bill could not prevent or restrict its use for beer cider or milk in the iconic pint bottle liberal democrat peer press the government to introduce strong protection against lithium ion battery and liberal democrat peer also ensure that the government include an important amendment that require the secretary of state to publish statement set out how the government expect to identify and assess product safety risk before legislation be lay put simply this will ensure great scrutiny of regulation that be design to make product safe despite those improvement the bill be still ultimately skeleton framework that shift legislative authority from parliament to the executive without the necessary level of scrutiny many great ministers agree with that skeleton bills be the wrong way to deliver legislation in fact in mere two year ago one shadow minister state that such bills be not model example of how parliament would like to see legislation bring forward and that we should be minimise the use of delegate power where report january vol agree with that then shadow minister the hon member for ellesmere port and bromborough justin madders who be now sit next to the secretary of state who have bring forward today bill be sorry that he do not agree with himself any more also note the assurance that the government give to my liberal democrat colleague in the other place that process for edit statutory instrument will be bring forward we will be push for detail of that pre legislative consultation as the bill progress through the commons any government will say that they be act in our good interest but all of the thing that this bill could do such as enhance consumer safety reduce trade barrier and build an economy fit for the future could be undo at the stroke of pen that be pen that parliament should hold not ministers the use of hazardous chemical flame retardant in domestic furniture have be criticise by the association of master upholsterers and soft furnishers and in environmental audit committee report because those chemical have be show to cause more toxic smoke increase the production of carbon monoxide and hydrogen cyanide and increase the prevalence of health condition include developmental disorder breathe difficulty and reproductive disorder as this bill would provide the government with more power to act on that issue do my hon friend agree that ministers should outline how the government plan to address the danger associate with cfr agree with my hon friend and hope that ministers will address her question if they hear it the bill make it possible for the government to use those new power and that would be good place for they to start the minister in the other place state that this government be not look to reduce consumer protection however what measure in this bill make sure that parliamentary scrutiny can not be bypass to weaken those protection the skeletal nature of the bill also make clear what be miss the very heart of our change economy be nowhere to be see will the hon gentleman give way can just carry on bit thank online marketplace be rapidly expand in number and popularity compete with high street across the nation but unfortunately there be no level playing field on which those two competitor can battle it out for consumer cash that be what the bill should be address because our high street and our small business must contend with regulation that online marketplace be not equally liable to that be not level playing field for example unsafe product be flood online marketplace study by which reveal that of toy purchase from amazon ebay aliexpress and temu be illegal due to choking and strangulation hazard another study from the british toy and hobby association find that of toy from online marketplace be unsafe with also illegal due to miss warning do we want that situation to continue note that the hon member have describe many of these toy as illegal in other word the law be there already this bill be therefore not necessary to deal with child choke on toy and all the other thing he have outline the law be already there the question be do we actually implement the law the law need to be tighten up we definitely need to be take lot more interest in the unsafe product that online company be sell do we want to allow unsafe toy to be sell to our precious child by some faceless online operation through an online market be sure the answer be no but the bill as it be write fail to address that the problem be not just limit to toy but extend to heater phone charger and battery the government have signal an ambition to bring online marketplace liability in line with more traditional model of retail but an ambition can be easily reverse by different government without parliamentary oversight without the measure be explicitly put into the bill consumer and the high street be not receive the guarantee they deserve this be serious issue for child and personal safety and we therefore need explicit guarantee of minimum duty for online marketplace in the bill what be the minister view on whether duty to notify consumer who have be sell unsafe or illegal product should be place on online marketplace such duty could enhance consumer right to seek refund of the purchase price will requirement to verify the identity and activity of seller be establish if it be yes to any of those question the minister should do the right thing and amend the bill so that those guarantee be enshrine in primary legislation could go on the bill require tight definition of an online marketplace to ensure that there be no loophole for platform to avoid appropriate regulation that be especially the case for platform that do not exist solely as an online marketplace such as tiktok shop and facebook marketplace finally the bill do not make explicit reference to bike scooter or lithium ion battery safety despite safety be one of the explicit aim of the bill bike and scooter battery fire pose uniquely high risk to consumer with the london fire brigade estimate that it attend fire incident cause by one of these device once every two day there need to be strong regulation on these thing can the minister explain why they be not include in the bill my constituent would be forgive for think that the clock have turn back so will focus on the issue that they have ask to raise which be not political in the slight but relate to safety agree with my right hon friend the secretary of state that while this be small bill it be very important it be of great interest to my constituent especially the member of torphichen community council in my constituency who ask to speak in this debate they back the electrical safety first campaign and they speak to about the danger of fire cause by lithium ion battery in scooter and bike and in everyday product the lithium ion battery safety campaign be call for strong measure include improve enforcement effort particularly online disposal guidance at the point of sale and measure to ensure safe charging hope that the ministers who be present will give strong consideration to those suggestion in due course lithium ion battery be integral to many modern device that most of we have in our home from scooter to laptop but widespread use have expose significant safety concern largely owe to the lack of oversight battery have be link to numerous fire incident and pose serious risk of injury or bad thermal runaway be dangerous phenomenon battery cell overheat and catch fire release toxic gas and often cause extensive damage by their very nature scooter be often leave in town centre walkway and communal area in flat and hallway put other member of the public at risk in the event of thermal runaway as we have hear in london bike and scooter fire occur as often as once every two day worse still be aware of domestic incident in my constituency include one in which sadly family lose their home and all their belonging as result of an scooter fire the bill introduce welcome step to deal with those risk create landscape to address the danger associate with product that be so widely use the mandate on safety standard for the storage use and disposal of lithium ion battery will help to mitigate the danger associate with thermal runaway also welcome the new power to monitor compliance and enforce regulation effectively it be critical that only safe and reliable product reach the market and reach our home such measure be essential to prevent incident and protect people from serious harm such as that which affect my constituent there be much in the bill that have be long await at local level and be glad that the government be respond to people concern in timely and stringent manner the danger pose by poorly maintain or unsafely store lithium ion battery be too great to be ignore be it the hon lady understanding that the exist regulation on lithium ion battery be insufficient there be british standard and there be environmental and disposal regulation there be swathe of regulation relate to lithium ion battery but if there be failure to enforce they that should not give ministers carte blanche to decide on whim what product in this area or any other should be available for sale in the uk without any recourse to parliament do not think that we want to rerun the argument relate to brexit which be what this debate have largely be about so far the bill have clearly be introduce to address gap that have leave consumer expose to great harm the prominence of online marketplace be an establish trend in our society we all know from the pandemic how important essential and sometimes non essential online purchase can be to our daily life they have become commonplace and that trend be only set to continue by the end of the decade online purchase will be worth billion nevertheless many product be poorly regulate faulty and too often dangerous whether it be the carbon monoxide alarm that do not work that have be use to kit out cheaply renovate student flat the faulty chainsaw attachment use by neighbour or the faulty scooter sitting in back garden these faulty product have come about because the pace of change online have be poorly match by regulation we be now in situation where regulation in the online world do not match the protection in the real world quite simply if product be too dangerous or fail the standard for those sell in shop it should not be available in online marketplace as society we need to be protect in our increase reliance on and use of the digital world otherwise the lack of online protection will have yet more devastating real life impact will the hon lady give way be about to conclude this bill be welcome step to alter the regulatory landscape more importantly it will ensure basic product safety and well oversight of product such as lithium battery the bill will reduce the risk associate with thermal runaway and protect our community from potential harm as online marketplace continue to expand it be essential to extend these regulation to the digital realm to respond to the evolve challenge of modern technology and safeguard public safety have deep concern about this orwellian bill because of what it do not explicitly say and its ambiguity regard eu dynamic realignment the henry viii power the bill give ministers will have serious consequence for business consumer and our ability to trade but do so with little detail on how they intend to use such power let first turn to regulatory alignment as you may recall madam deputy speaker spend much time take the retained eu law revocation and reform act through as whip and believe passionately that that act be vital to take back control for parliamentary sovereignty and in free business to compete by shed unnecessary eu regulation directive and red tape so will say plainly that this bill will lead to regulatory alignment with the eu through the back door invite the minister to confirm from the dispatch box that this bill and the power it give ministers will not be use by this government for dynamic alignment with eu regulation doubt that any such categoric reassurance be likely to be forthcoming but await with bated breath and hopeful heart that it be so will the hon lady give way let make some progress and then will give way the government have always claim that they would not return we to the single market and the custom union and many believe they be always healthy sceptic but be willing to be prove wrong however my fear be that this bill will lead to back door eu regulatory alignment and whether that be deliberate or unintentional matter not we have our democratic instruction from the british people and we must honour they now want to talk about competition will the hon lady give way on regulatory alignment let make some progress it be on the point the hon lady be move away from well be now on competition would the hon member like to make comment about that no this be on the last point order this be turn into debate in itself it be very clear that the member do not want to take an intervention right now mr snell but she may do so later now want to talk about competition will the hon lady give way on point about competition will give way on point about competition persistence sometimes pay off madam deputy speaker genuinely want to pick up the point the hon lady be make about competition in relation to alignment in the ceramics sector the food contact material regulation set by the european union be essential to enable the export of the product we create and make they be product regulation for safety but she seem to be suggest that any regulatory alignment be bad thing be that her party message about alignment for the purpose of export that should take back to the thousand of worker in stoke on trent with export we can apply any kind of regulation we want to maximise our market advantage from leave the eu we could apply statutory framework for japan or any country we want to ensure we can export our product the point of leave the eu be so that we could remain globally competitive and so that we could choose to adopt any regulatory framework we want if that market enable we to export our product support our business and help to grow our economy would support that but nothing of that be mention in the bill if it mention realignment with market value in relation to japan so we could export thing to japan or to other market would be interested in look at the bill holistically but not once be any country or trade grouping mention except the eu that give pause and it make wonder whether this be an attempt to achieve backdoor realignment with eu regulatory framework without the scrutiny of parliament do the hon lady also accept that the bill be not necessary to promote export if company want to export its product to japan or timbuktu it will have to align with the regulation that exist in those country anyway it do not need government bill and far bad it do not need minister to have the power to make regulation without come to this place agree completely with the right hon gentleman will leave it there because that be an excellent point this be about free trade and expand our global reach by make money grow our economy and allow everyone to benefit from tax base that grow because our business can export freely be very supportive of that if the bill in any way address the concern have raise would be happy to support it but it be vague and do not give we the insight we need into the kind of alignment that be intend that vagueness present challenge that be mention repeatedly in the other place in this house we must address the bill challenge with similar rigour it may look quite harmless on the outside but under the surface it will deliver profound change and threaten our ability to scrutinise these regulatory change in the other place the noble lord sandhurst describe it as henry viii bill par excellence official report house of lords november vol we would do well to heed those word where be the policy framework under which ministers will decide to use these power on parliamentary sovereignty or ministers decision to use the power there be no such framework thank the hon lady for give way as fellow member of the procedure committee do enjoy good procedural debate but wonder whether she will get to the meat of the bill at any point will we be talk about brexit bogeyman or will we be talk about consumer safety represent those we be here to represent look after their interest and make they safe the bill be legislative blank sheet of paper for ministers to fill with whatever legislation they feel like the lords delegate powers and regulatory reform committee state that the bill signify an exceptional shift in power from parliament to the executive and entail the government in effect ask parliament to pass primary legislation which be so insubstantial that it leave the real operation of the legislation to be decide by ministers say to member right across this house heed those word if we do not stay alert to legislation that look so harmless yet confer such power on ministers we be fail in our role as legislator be my hon friend aware of any other piece of legislation on which the dprrc in the other place have report three time with exactly the same conclusion my hon friend make an excellent point be not aware of any other legislation that have receive the same recommendation three time that represent substantial warning the bill either deliberately or unintentionally will lead to realignment with the eu and once again leave our country beholden to other decision on regulatory standard it will hamper our business in this fast change world make they less agile and less competitive and make we poor as nation it give ministers too much power fact that in this house should always be pause for thought no matter who govern urge the government to think again it be pleasure to take part in this debate hope to offer course correction from the opposition attempt to fight many thing today not least the concept of geography and what be in the interest of british business in this debate we be watch the last gasp of the brexit delusion that have fall on hard contact with the paperwork reality that be what this piece of legislation be about it be about make it easy for british business who have be harm by the previous government approach to their basic need this be not about free trade what come about as result of brexit be not free trade but mountain and mountain of paperwork want to focus on that in my speech but can not let go of what the hon member for beaconsfield joy morrissey say she be as she say whip on the retained eu law revocation and reform act my goodness welcome sinner that repenteth in that act the government be go to rip up more than piece of legislation overnight without any parliamentary scrutiny simply because they have the word europe in they that include thing like airline regulation because of course what we need be our own separate regulation so that plane would have to take different course in mid air that be the brexit benefit under the previous government watch more than statutory instrument be lay before the house as direct result of retain eu law welcome opposition party commitment to parliamentary scrutiny but simply say that some of we on that bill committee try to offer argument about the importance of parliamentary involvement in such decision and they fall on deaf ear will come on to that now that opposition members have suddenly discover that statutory instrument might not always be the good way to look at such thing hope they will be able to focus on what really matter here because british business need we to do that british business need we to clear up the mess create by the previous administration and their approach to brexit that be what this legislation do it be common sense politic will the hon lady give way will if the right hon gentleman can tell which of those statutory instrument he now regret force through this house the hon lady be make an interesting point the key point with that carry over of eu law be that all the regulation have already be debate and have already go through parliament all we be do be replace like with like with this bill the government be introduce huge henry viii power to create brand new legislation perhaps around production regulation but on who know what else who know what impact it will have and on which country that be the difference we be remove parliamentary scrutiny rather than just carry over old eu law into current uk law there be so many thing to unpack there not least the right hon gentleman recognition that our previous regulation as part of the european union be perhaps not that bad with rule on bicycle safety for example perhaps it be pretty sensible to say that if something be safe in the uk our colleague in europe might also be look at it and we could share the burden of work out good regulation that be not what happen with the retain eu law act or with divergence and it do sound like he need to look at divergence thankfully have some statistic for he know he will be delighted to hear they before we move on let just say this opposition members have not speak for british business today although accept that the liberal democrat spokesman the hon member for wokingham clive jones do try and recognise his expertise in toy manufacturing he will recognise that we be talk about thousand of british business that be affect by regulation what rule will those business have to follow to be able to sell in market that make their business sustainable some of business in this country will be affect by this legislation not because there be new rule but because if we start to diverge from exist regulation they will face choice do they continue to follow european legislation so that they can sell into large market or do they try to follow uk legislation eu legislation and maybe japanese legislation as well with all the paperwork that come with that rise will give way to the right hon gentleman can see that if do not he will have heart attack be grateful to the hon lady but shall survive give the time that she have spend in this house be surprised that like some new member she may have be take in by the government wording the bill give ministers such blanket power sure they can align more with eu regulation as she desire equally another government or minister could go the opposite way and do all the damage she be talk about needlessly differ from europe purely out of ideology and the house would have no say in it surely the hon lady must be more like the hon member for blackley and middleton south graham stringer and share with her colleague the need to restrict ministers power try in vain to make exactly such argument to the right hon member when he be minister tell that european legislation be not good enough for this country interruption now ask he to let finish my speech because want common sense in this legislation as think minister do we need to stand up to those who puff and spout about europe as though somehow it be bad thing to make it possible for british business to trade with our near neighbour post brexit for the avoidance of doubt this be not an argument about rejoin the european union rise will if may continue with my speech but shall take an intervention bit later our colleague in northern ireland know the practical consequence of divergence the obsession with the concept that somehow we have always to be different which be somehow believe to be sovereignty they will know what the not for eu label mean they will know too the impact that that have have on they and their colleague neil johnston director of the northern ireland retail consortium recently tell the northern ireland affairs committee about just that he describe how supplier have to have separate print run for labelling and how the requirement in shop for poster and edge of shelf labelling be massively burdensome for small business we end up with sausage roll that we can not take across the border between castlederg and castlefin simply because of the way that the previous government undertake brexit wonder whether the member have read the schedule to the bill agri food product be not cover hope the right hon member can understand that my point be about divergence about what happen when we try to ask business to run two different regulatory regime out of mistaken ideology that somehow we can not find way forward that be what this piece of legislation will do the hon member for beaconsfield want to tell we that british business be well off as result of the brexit freedom well the number and statistic tell we the exact opposite be talk about not just the fall in gdp or the fall in trade that be predict but the thousand of of they which have give up export to the european union because of the additional paperwork and the additional regulatory regime be so pleased to have eventually get through to the hon lady she hear the minister at the dispatch box say that this be not about dynamic realignment be right in understanding that her view of this legislation be that it be about eu dynamic realignment the hon member be completely wrong hope that he will give chance to make my speech before get too excited about the word europe he should try to understand what we be talk about here which be british business and the regulatory certainty that they need from their government my goodness if we think how tory hard brexit have hit british business we should also consider how it have hit small business which simply could not afford to comply with multiple regulatory regime we do know that we live in uncertain time and that the threat of tariff will kill what little business our firm might have leave as the obr point out to we last week if global trade dispute escalate to include percentage point rise in tariff between the usa and the rest of the world it will reduce gdp by peak of and reduce our current surplus in that environment we owe it to british business to talk common sense and to talk about what they actually want which be reduction in the brexit red tape that they have have to deal with we have be here before on the practical insanity that brexit generate there be the obsession with blue passport which come at the expense of be able to trade and keep business go we have also be here before with the previous government which be why all those conservative members who be here before need to hang their head in shame at some of the argument that they be make about this the previous government want we to have our own uk charter mark they want british business to run two separate charter mark arrangement undertaking testing requirement for both the ukca and the european ce to allow business to be able to sell in both market be cost business hundred of thousand of pound the cost could go as high as per product range be actually quote from the previous government own impact assessment of the legislation and be happy to send that document to the hon member for broadland and fakenham jerome mayhew who be chuntere from the opposition benches uk conformity assessment mark cover good worth billion it be little wonder that after four year and believe the hon member for broadland and fakenham might have be on that very committee when it happen those obsess with the brexit freedom be hit with cold hard reality and have to climb down and say that british company that have meet european standard have also meet the british charter mark they have to roll over the charter mark because if they have not their own impact assessment would have show that it cost british business up to billion in the decade that be the brexit bonus of which opposition members be so proud billion of extra cost to british business because they be try to fill in two form at once to sell the same item to different set of consumer the bill be about so much more than just kitemarking we need to be clear that it do not mean that we have automatic access to the eu market it mean that british business can see what the regulatory landscape might look like ahead of they that be very important in these uncertain time it also prevent the uk become dumping ground for good that be no long consider safe in the european union certainly believe that my constituent need to be confident that we will not be flood with cheap good that be bad for they it also do not mean that we have to align automatically and hope that answer the question from the hon member for broadland and fakenham be not here argue for automatic alignment after all there be example of where we have take different approach the vaping legislation be something that conservative members oppose but it put we ahead of european product legislation the bill have protection for the british pint the lords write those in it be also clear that choose not to participate do not mean that uk consumer be not affect we see that with mobile phone charging cable even though we be too small market to influence apple the european union act together make apple stop sell we multiple cable as somebody who be carry around multiple piece of equipment be very grateful for that we may also want to look at example where we might learn from our colleague right now the european union have be take the lead on carcinogenic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon basically what be in synthetic football pitch our kid right now in the united kingdom play on pitch that have dangerous chemical in they but our european colleague kid be not play on those when we talk about alignment sometimes we be talk about share good practice on how to make our kid safe the consumer regulation product safety that we be talk about suspect that be why the previous government in the end with all their obsession with brexit freedom and with all the power they have do not diverge very much indeed under their watch there be only five case of active diversion there be case of passive divergence where basically they do not update regulation for all the huffing and puffing when face with the cold hard reality of have different regulatory regime for good in this country from those of our next door neighbour where we might also want to sell the previous government take the well approach they do not look to make british business try to double up on their paperwork indeed where we have diverge there be clearly problem be store up anybody watch the court case about sandeel know what be come down the line this government be not go to mess british business around in the way that the previous government do with their huffing and puff about whether previous government in other country be friend or foe we need to make trade work british business need less paperwork that mean be clear about where we will diverge where we will align why that make difference and what that mean for product standard think we agree across the house that we want high standard that be deliver not by be not european or pro european but by look at what the regulatory regime be that be why it matter that we have pause some of the current proposal of divergence on new recycling label regime on the not for eu labelling and on the new check on agrifood import we be look at what work for british business so that we can make it easy for they to trade that be why want to speak in this debate what we need to do in the bill hope the minister will be open to this be be clear about the direction of travel and the proper right way and point for parliament to be part of that process if we be go to diverge we should be clear why that would be in the british interest and how we as parliament will have that conversation where we have information we should update our constituent who might have business with product that take to month to develop they need to know the regulatory regime for example of the toy they want to make and which market they can sell into that be why it matter that we have parliamentary scrutiny welcome sinner who repenteth about the value of that but do not want to see british business face with the idea of we have to consult on absolutely everything do not have an erratic fear of the europeans somehow hold we back if they help we ensure that our kid be not play football on pitch that have carcinogenic chemical on they that be common sense british politic and that be what the bill need to deliver regulatory uncertainty undermine economic growth if economic growth be our primary ambition we need to reduce the amount of time we ask british business to be part of consultation because they need to have confidence about where regulation be go that be why it matter that we say we be not go to start diverge for the sake of it but only because we can see there be national interest in it will finish on this point it matter to so many of our growth ambition that construction material be also cover under the bill construction cost be due to rise much far here than in the european union many of we who want our hospital rebuild and house building to happen know that if we spend our time give uncertainty to british business about which way the regulation will go we will not get the investment that we want the cold hard reality of business decision making be that they do not want to invest on risk my question to the minister be how can we give british business certainty about the direction of travel and ensure that we have the right consultation and engagement process for parliament so that where there be point where we would diverge like we do on vaping we can do that too it be not an either or frankly we have to get over the idea that if something be european it be somehow take we back nine year after we vote to leave the european union and six year after the legislation to do that what the eu be do still affect our british business we have choice in this house we can continue to peddle fantasy be sorry that the shadow secretary of state be no long in his place he seem not even to know about the capitulation that his government must have make in his eye over the charter mark but we owe it to british business who be be hammer by tory brexit and face economic uncertainty not to add to the pile of paperwork in their in tray as the opposition would hope that when the minister set out that direction of travel he will be open to idea about how we can secure that british business may have stop listen to opposition members but they will listen to we if we get this right there be three fundamental point to be make about the bill and will make they more briefly than the previous speaker the hon member for walthamstow ms creasy although be delighted to follow she first there be constitutional issue at the heart of the legislation about the power of this house and this parliament and the power of the executive the bill create permissive power for the executive to introduce by regulation through statutory instrument all kind of measure those who have be in the house for long time and perhaps those of we who have be in the house for rather short time will know what that mean in practice brief debate in room upstairs that will take few minute or perhaps little long it will be thinly populated and the measure will be give scant scrutiny the executive should be hold to account on the floor of the house or by committee design for the purpose that bring to my second point about the bill we once have european scrutiny committee whose task be to look closely at all kind of thing that emanate from the european union the hon lady who speak immediately before describe those of we in the house who be sceptical about the european union as not be rational she say these be irrational fear about the european union be that to be true she would probably have point but actually our fear be entirely rational we know what emanate from the european union during our membership and it be endless bureaucracy acknowledge that it be often gold plat here but none the less it be every kind of rule and regulation some of which be entirely superfluous to our need because they be introduce on pan european basis learn long ago that power be well exercise when it be exercise close to its effect when decision be make they need to be sensitive to the difference they make to those affect by they one of the reason be passionate supporter of brexit be that want power to return to the place where it have its effect fear therefore entirely rationally that if the default position as result of the bill be that we end up with european regulation it will not be sensitive to its effect but instead will be decide upon far from where the business that it affect be locate so give the second issue be about how the measure be scrutinise invite the government to reinvent some kind of european scrutiny committee or similar perhaps we can call it regulatory scrutiny committee perhaps it may be body that allow the full consideration of each of the measure that the government introduce under this umbrella bill to ensure the house be happy with they and feel they be appropriate and have be tailor in the right way that might be an amendment that the government will accept give that the secretary of state say he be open minded about improve the legislation during its passage the third problem that this bill have at its heart be the assumption about harmonisation that term be often use and one should always be terribly fearful when it be because it usually not about create harmony but about accept control from elsewhere worry that that process will snuff out some of the measure that might more usefully be adopt by government and impose on business and other blunt measure that be insensitive to the particularity that prevail in our country do not say that be with intent as it seem to that the secretary of state make clear it be not his intention but just fear that it will the regulatory impact assessment and the explanatory note that we already have seem to imply that they say and the secretary of state repeat this in his opening remark that there be all kind of change new rule new regulation and new restriction happen at pace that require the attention of government and that pace be so great that it be hard for the government to keep up my fear be therefore that they will adopt very broad measure rather than one that be sufficiently tailor and sufficiently refine to meet domestic need with that constitutional problem of the balance between the executive and parliament with that lack of scrutiny and oversight that come from not have body that can look at these thing on one by one basis and with that tendency to produce broad brush measure emanating from the european union as imply both in the bill and in support document have grave doubt about this legislation it be true that we should regulate where necessary of course it be right in the public interest that we do so however we must always do so with care because when that regulation become burdensome when it frustrate innovation and when it temper the ability to produce good that meet popular demand rather than become helpful to either customer or those that supply they it inhibit the very thing that support those business and aid those customer simply invite the minister when he sum up to re emphasise that the government believe as do in light touch regulation and in regulation that only apply when there have be appropriate discussion with those affect by it that there will be proper dialogue between business and business representative before new measure be introduce and that all that be introduce will have the character that have set out tailor specific and in the british interest our role in this place be to defend the national interest know that kind of heady internationalism permeate particular part of this chamber look to my left towards the liberal democrats but have always think that it be more important to stand up for the british people to represent my constituent to the good of my ability and to be as describe early sensitive to the particularity of the locale that represent and the country that love be that too much to ask of member of this house so do not regard my fear about this bill as irrational contrary to the hon member for walthamstow assertion they be deeply rooted in rational fear of the bad this bill could bring good regulation be basically the immune system of our nation and it be often unseen when regulation be work well and have the desire effect we rarely see it happen because it be keep we safe and protect we from those harm that we outsource to the government to keep watch over for we it be take the necessary step and measure to make sure that we be safe the thing we buy be safe the interaction we have in our community be safe and our child be safe that regulation be protection essentially and this bill give the scope and the agility for the government any government to respond quickly and in timely manner to new and emerge potential threat that regulation be require to protect we from worry when government of any colour include unfortunately that of my own party of late seek to suggest that regulation be inherently bad thing an inhibitor of growth or the heavy hand of the state stop the illustrious bound of enterprise because it often be not often it be about level playing field it be about create the circumstance where competitor in stoke on trent have as much opportunity to compete with their competitor around the country or around the world in way that we understand to be fair balanced and proportionate to this bill set we on course where we be able to do that there be some area where product regulation and the safety that come with it be lack if the house will indulge would like once again to talk about ceramic and the ceramic industry because believe that the product regulatory framework and the exist protection for ceramic in term of the quality of good that be purchase and also the protection of the level playing field could benefit hugely from action that the government could take through the power in the bill we have discuss online drop ship platform many time in this house these be website that bulk buy thing and sell they into the uk often at fraction of the price that people could buy they for in this country and often fake and forge the identity and brand of british company without any consideration for what people be actually buy be show great example by company in staffordshire dunoon ceramic which make very particular style of ceramic mug the mug cost about to make and they retail at about sometimes up to an online drop ship website be sell fake version with the same artwork and the same make in the united kingdom sticker and backstamp on the base into the uk for about we have no idea whether that product be meet the materials and articles in contact with food england regulations that it be require in this country to meet in order to be consider safe we have no idea of the level of lead or cadmium in the paint no idea what the glaze be make of no idea where the clay have come from and no idea of the condition under which it be make but it be sell into the uk thousand at time undercut the british company for clarity have no idea whether the product be defective but it could have be thereby put people at risk the hon gentleman may not know this but collect ceramic by the way so be extremely interested in they he be right that we should support and indeed revere the british ceramic industry but many law already prevent the kind of counterfeiting he describe and other law prevent illegal substance from be use and sell in the manufacture of good there be lot of exist statute that protect consumer from the kind of practice he describe the right hon gentleman be correct that there be exist protection for some of the thing have mention that if enforce properly could take those product off the market but the enforcement of many of our regulatory framework in this country be quite weak fund for most enforcement agency across this country be not to make party political point reduce under the last government hope this government will reconsider that because regulation be only ever as good as the enforcement regime sit behind it would the hon member accept that if ministers get up at in the morning and work until at night introduce regulation on the basis of this bill every day but there be no enforcement or the enforcement be as weak as he say it be on pottery we would be no well off do not think anybody would disagree with the right hon gentleman assessment that if there be no enforcement of regulation there be no benefit but we be not say in the bill that there should be less enforcement the bill produce framework in which the government can take action to respond to create the good regulation necessary will freely admit that what have to come with that be the enforcement arrangement to ensure those new regulation be enforce properly penalty to deter people seek to circumvent the regulation and the proper resourcing of enforcement agency so they be equip to take action against those people and company seek to circumvent the law without that fully accept that regulation for the sake of regulation be no good any more than regulation be cut or diverge for the sake of divergence and reduction be any good it come down to enforcement to go back to the comment of the right hon member for south holland and the deepings sir john hayes there be one area in this bill where government action could bring in new product protection regulation that would have huge impact on the ceramic industry that be around the backstamp on the bottom of piece of ceramic or pottery as an avid collector he will be aware of the importance of those backstamp in this country if we turn over any plate cup or anything make from good quality british ceramic we will normally find the word make in england and the pottery name underneath it consumer then know they be buy premium piece of british manufacture ceramic that have be make to suitable product standard that we accept in stoke on trent be one of the good in the world it be perfectly plausible as have be do with some of the fakery to replicate that phrase when it be not true the other challenge we have be company that import thing into the united kingdom augment the wording of that particular backstamp to suggest it have be make in the uk when it have not it may have be bisque fire overseas import and then decorate and glaze in the uk but it will normally have company name the word england and the date upon which that historic brand be establish it give consumer the idea that they be buy piece of british make ceramic that would therefore be protect by the normal product regulation when in fact it be not there be the potential for the minister to use the new power in the bill to produce new regulation that say anything produce in the uk that be consider to be ceramic have to have proper mark on the base that demonstrate where it be make and where it have come from and to demonstrate that it be make in the uk if company be not make it in the uk they become prohibit from put the word england or make in the uk on it be extremely grateful to the hon gentleman for give way second time it be very generous of he think that we should jointly sponsor bill madam deputy speaker the hon gentleman and not you and although we would love for you to be involve he and could jointly sponsor make in britain bill that would do exactly what he describe be not sure that this piece of legislation be necessary to do that for we have that power in this house as it stand let we get little crown print on egg again let we have make in britain print on everything and let we go back to foreign make which be formerly widely use would love to see foreign make stamp on import good then people would not buy they be very sorry to disappoint the right hon gentleman but and number of my colleague have already present the ceramics country of origin marking bill he be more than welcome to support it should it ever be give its second reading however because of the nature of this place and the way private members bills work be realistic about the fact that if we be to see that regulatory protection for british ceramic it will have to come through different mechanism the mechanism in this bill which allow the government to make those protective arrangement through secondary legislation could increase the protection of british ceramic my final point be about level playing field for export take the point that the right hon member for east antrim sammy wilson make after have intervene on the hon member for beaconsfield joy morrissey about our regulatory regime and where we want to export the bulk of the ceramic make in my constituency be export to the eu we could diverge from the eu food contact material regulation and have secondary system in this country but all that would do be create separate set of regulatory regime for small company with small margin require they to make product twice we simply could not stand that burden before get attack for be one of those horrible remainer urge member to check my voting record during the to parliament there be time when stick with what we know the european regulation absolutely make sense we should control that but it make sense to align ourselves where we should support the bill hope that the minister will as one of his first action with his new power consider my point about ceramic if he do not perhaps he would like to support my ceramics country of origin marking bill rise order if colleague speak for too long other will be disappoint so unofficially let we try to keep our speech to under minute anyone listen to the debate would think that it be all about save child from choke on toy building not burn down because of defective battery in bicycle save life safe product and even the internal market and safeguard the northern ireland economy but it be not about any of that it be nice to dress it up like that and suppose use that kind of language be helpful to make the bill relevant to constituent but the bill be nothing to do with that time and again member have speak about those kind of issue battery catch fire defective toy and so on but they can and have be deal with already in law indeed we have even hear member talk about illegal product be sell so we do not need some minister to change the law we need someone to ensure that the law in place be enforce we already have mechanism to make thing illegal so if there be gap in the law we can just use that mechanism let we not obscure what the debate be all about it be not about gap and the need to safeguard people it be all about the bill agenda which be to give ministers additional power the public see government with majority of over who have be able to drive through legislation that have frustrate and anger they whether it be take money off pensioner for winter fuel or the legislation that be drive through last week to meet the net zero agenda which fail to prevent we from buy solar product from china that be make by slave labour could go through all the other thing that have make people angry but government with majority of over now want to take on additional power to allow minister to avoid have to come to this house to ensure product safety have no doubt that the real reason minister wish to retain that power be that the government have already set their mind on reset our relation with europe they know it be unpopular with many of their supporter they do not want to have constant scrutiny in this house on weekly or monthly basis of new regulation that align we with europe so it be far well to give ministers the power to do that quietly without consultation or vote in this house as number of member have say the bill give ministers the power to do that indeed some of the government own supporter in the house of lords make the point that the bill contain the potential for dynamic alignment the government have be ambiguous about whether the power will be use to do that but be fairly sure that be the main reason there be little enough opportunity for this house to look at and challenge legislation but believe it be wrong for bill to allow ministers under the cover of darkness to take we back into arrangement that we have escape from member have mention northern ireland we know the impact of the eu general product safety regulation already because they apply in northern ireland business in the rest of the united kingdom that want to sell their product in northern ireland will have to have agent in northern ireland the eu make these law to try to tie other country and company to its regulation suspect the excuse the government will use for pursue dynamic alignment will be we do it for the good of business in gb as well as northern ireland because if we align to eu rule we escape some of the restriction on trade that the eu have impose but why do we leave the eu in the first place and why do many business support leave the eu first the eu introduce costly regulation that do not even need to apply to many business because they never trade with the eu but they still have to adjust their product to meet the regulation which incur cost be listen with intent to the right hon gentleman contribution it may be that the government be more innocent than he suggest and that there be not this hide agenda he be describe but in the word of northern irishman lewis of all tyranny tyranny sincerely exercise for the good of its victim may be the most oppressive even if there be not hidden agenda in the end in the name of the victim the customer this will end up be regulatory bureaucratic and costly the potential be there and it have be put in the bill suspect that clause have be include in the bill to give that opportunity if not now then at some future time the other reason why business have oppose the implementation of eu regulation and the other danger of dynamic alignment be that many of the law and regulation make in europe that we may be align ourselves with only get there in the first place because powerful lobby group lobby the european commission to get regulation impose those regulation may well suit one particular industry or even powerful firm within that industry but they do not necessarily benefit all of business some have say of the bill oh this will give certainty to business but it may well give business additional cost give what have happen in northern ireland and the way that our market with the rest of the uk have be disrupt some may think that would welcome the measure but do not welcome they for two reason first as point out to the hon member for walthamstow ms creasy many of the restriction be on good that be not even include in the bill as the schedule exclude they secondly even if this problem be solve it do not deal with the issue we know that because northern ireland be subject to the eu single market area of law as the hon and learn member for north antrim jim allister keep remind we on an almost weekly basis the issue be that we have allow the united kingdom to be divide by the deal that be do with europe when the previous government be in power warn that this would happen and that northern ireland would be the foot in the door believe that that will be use as one of the argument for this legislation the dup will oppose the legislation because we believe it be not in the interest of the united kingdom and do not address the problem that be face in northern ireland order think it be remiss that the speech by the right hon member for south holland and the deepings sir john hayes do not have literary person in it but he manage to get lewis into his intervention as the secretary of state say early believe be the first metrologist to be elect to this house in history so it give great pleasure to rise to debate the bill take the liberty of check hansard and until the secretary of state use the word early be the only member to have ever use the word metrologist in the house of commons be proud to be here today and prouder still that the labour government have bring forward bill feature metrology in the first year of our new government most of the debate have focus on the product regulation in the bill but give my background will focus on the metrology prior to my election to this place be at the university of nottingham where be active in research in metrology for advanced manufacturing begin with my phd continue through several more year as research fellow and latterly as senior research fellow however like most people have know in my life when begin my phd have absolutely no idea what metrology be indeed be sure several colleague in the chamber do not know what it be before today and fear some still do not so would like to provide an explanation of the nature of my science and explain why contrary to popular assumption it have nothing to do with cloud interruption please forgive my terrible pun the international standard vocabulaire international de métrologie formally define metrology as the science of measurement and its application note that metrology include all theoretical and practical aspect of measurement whatever the measurement uncertainty and field of application it be not the branch of science concern with the process and phenomenon of the atmosphere especially as means of forecast the weather which be of course meteorology something have explain almost every day of my professional career metrology broadly encompass the various field of research that seek to develop the science and technology of measurement be that measurement of any of the seven base quantity from the système international the si or any of the unit derive from those base quantity the seven base quantity be of course length mass time electric current thermodynamic temperature amount of substance and luminous intensity the great physicist lord kelvin once express to measure be to know he also say if you can not measure it you can not improve it those sentiment be rarely more applicable than in the advanced manufacturing industry where we be interested both in ensure that manufactured component meet the dimensional specification lay out by its designer and in constantly improve on exist product metrology be science that fundamentally underpin all other science without tool that allow we to measure and know we can not gain any understanding of the world around we nor can we improve on it in the fundamental scientific pursuit of understand our universe we be most often concerned with the metre the first of the si base unit the metre be define formally by take the fix numerical value of the speed of light in vacuum to be when express in the unit of metre per second and where the second be define in term of the caesium frequency in fact that definition change very recently it come into force in the metre be more simply describe by its old definition which be simply the distance travel by light in vacuum in time interval in second of one divide by the speed of light in my opinion the metre be one of the most beautiful creation in science it be define by light itself and it be creation that allow we in turn to create everything in our world at the start of this debate the right hon member for new forest west sir desmond swayne ask the house when weight and measure become metrology the answer to that question be several thousand year before the common era behind every great scientific advancement in history there have be metrologist behind the pyramid there be the first standardise unit of measurement the royal cubit define as the length of the pharaoh forearm as measure from the tip of his forefinger to the base of his elbow the cubit be technology so advanced that it allow the ancient egyptians to position the building block of the pyramid with an accuracy almost equal to modern method thousand of year later there remain speculation on whether they be in fact build by alien because of how incredible an achievement that be they be of course build not by alien but by metrologist at the start of this debate as fellow scientist wonder what the difference be between mensuration and metrology when be an undergraduate we do not use the word seem to be new word perhaps my hon friend can enlighten the chamber certainly it be not new word as far as be concern believe it be bring into common parlance in the victorian era will move on to some more example there be the james webb space telescope something more modern than the pyramid it take image of our universe more than billion light year away that be deep more brilliant and more beautiful than anything we have ever see behind that there be the construction of metre mirror flat to within just few tenth of billionth of metre from its high top to its small valley if we be to expand the size of the metre mirror to the size of the earth the distance from the high mountain to the deep valley would be of the order of the height of my hip behind the discovery of gravitational wave there be series of interferometer kilometre in size which can detect signal from noise at level consider unachievable throughout human history until the past year or so and which be capable of listen to the collision of black hole across spacetime hesitate to interrupt the hon gentleman because he be make wonderful contribution to our affair which be indicative of the beauty of science about which we hear too little before he rush hurtle one might say into the future can he say word about the peculiarly british measurement that inform my childhood mean thing such as peck perch rod and bushel for each of those be root in the way that he describe be grateful to the right hon gentleman for his intervention and be happy to explain those particular form of measurement be not in common use any more but of course many right hon and hon member of this house will have grow up with they broadly the one that be still in use be define in the modern parlance but it be important to remember that the modern metric system account for all of those heritage measurement the common inch for example be formally define as mm and while apologise to member across the house it be important for to let they know that the pint be formally define as ml those heritage measurement and indeed the entire imperial system be now reference on to the metric system define very simply the imperial system be the metric system there be no reason why we should not use those historical measurement where they be useful they be perfectly valid but they be formally define with reference to the modern metric system will talk more about this shortly metrology lie at the heart of everything we know from telescope to speed camera and from knee replacement to jet engine every single thing make by human hand be design first construct second and then check by metrologist to ensure it meet its specification if we can not know it we can not improve it however ensure that part meet their specification be not simple as each measurement dimensional or otherwise have an associate measurement uncertainty that be non negative parameter characterise the dispersion of the quantity value be attribute to the thing be measure base on the information use estimation of measurement uncertainty be complex procedure one that form much of my career prior to come to this place and be usually perform in line with the guide to the expression of uncertainty in measurement uncertainty estimation be generally perform by make measurement that be traceable to the definition of the si metre when we be concern with the metre again the vocabulaire international de métrologie define traceability as property of measurement result whereby the result can be relate to reference through document unbroken chain of calibration each contribute to the overall measurement uncertainty traceable measurement allow for the successful estimation of uncertainty and be generally base requirement for the verification of manufacture good traceability be consider by the international community to be the only mean by which evidence can be provide towards give product fulfil the requirement set out by its designer to provide an example let we consider length measurement make between two face of manufactured part such as rubik cube imagine that be hold rubik cube could not possibly have bring prop madam deputy speaker the length between two face could be measure by calliper that calliper would be calibrate use measurement artifact most commonly metal cuboid call gauge block that gauge block would in turn be calibrate by more accurate instrument which itself be calibrate use more accurate gauge block that more accurate gauge block would then be calibrate with reference to an optical interferometer use laser source that laser source be finally calibrate against the iodine stabilise laser that be use to realise the definition of the metre so traceability be establish from the shop floor measurement all the way up to the definition of the metre by an unbroken chain of calibration it feel impertinent to intervene because my hon friend be give hugely passionate speech about subject he clearly know so much about but how can he can help the next generation of metrologist to be as inspire about this topic as he clearly be that be very kind and thank my hon friend very much for his intervention if he wish have slide lecture that would be more than happy to deliver afterwards nobody wish for the slide mr thompson do not worry madam deputy speaker it be not one for today be nearly finished each stage of the traceability chain have some discernible uncertainty which generally increase as we move down that chain and instrument accuracy decrease estimation of uncertainty at each link in the chain be essential it be impossible to have traceable measurement without the inclusion of an uncertainty with that measurement when apply in manufacturing traceability allow we to create anything we can imagine within the confine of our choose manufacturing process it be the cornerstone of our modern manufacturing industry through this bill the government seek to update metrology regulation and the mean by which those regulation be enforce we have hear at great length different opinion about that process but the government be today ensure conformity with si ensure uniformity in the measurement sale monitoring and quantity of good far they be ensure that the secretary of state and other appropriate body have the power they require to inspect and enforce that conformity the bill will ensure that uk law be update to recognise new or update international regulation and keep we at the cutting edge of science and regulation member say early in the debate how the uk be at the forefront of regulation spend many year on standard committee work through these thing every standard committee ever work on feed into the british standard which feed into the european standard and the international standard those be the framework we be update today to ensure that we remain at the forefront it will mean cost saving for business and it will promote regulatory stability finally the provision lay out in this bill continue the work begin by the ancient egyptians the work that allow we to build everything from the great pyramid to the phone in our pocket the paper that we hold in our hand and indeed the very floor on which we stand today our work today will ensure that the bulb that light this room be of an appropriate brightness that the air that we breathe and that surround we be of an appropriate temperature and that we can finally get fairly measure full beverage of exactly ml in the pub support this bill wholeheartedly follow that jerome mayhew do not think can think that be an absolutely brilliant speech feel like party pooper because be go to drag the debate back to the product regulation and metrology bill and can only apologise be go to assert boldly that be the only member of this house who have sit on standard committee and draft european regulation but stand correct there be now two of we at first glance the bill look tiny there be just four clause on product regulation and four substantive clause on metrology there be reason why it be so tiny it do not actually say anything there be no description of the change anticipate by this legislation there be no example of what need to be address there be no indication of the direction behind any future decision nothing member particularly those on the government benches have refer to bike and scooter electrical safety defective toy and lithium ion battery to name just few but not single one of those thing be in the bill they could be this could be regulation bill try to fix the problem that have be identify but none of that be there bad than that there be no explanation for the silence the bill simply make request of this house of we as parliamentarian by say please give the minister the power to change primary legislation through regulation include the power to create new and novel criminal offence this be the very definition of skeleton bill where almost all the substance be leave to regulation that be contrary to an establish convention in this house and the other place that the principal aspect of policy should be in bill and only its detailed implementation leave to delegate legislation that be an established principle of our legislature if we wish to depart from that there need to be very good reason in exceptional circumstance there be good reason but be there exceptional circumstance here the issue be pick up immediately in what prove to be hostile reception in the other place on second reading on october last year that be follow by review on october by the delegated powers and regulatory reform committee which be not some right wing conspiracy theory group this be not brexit or die it be chair by labour it be chair by baroness ramsey and it be cross party committee by the way in another role she be the senior adviser to the labour party on standard and ethic yet her report have be entirely ignore by this government because it be damn in its conclusion it say that government guidance be that skeleton legislation should be use only in the most exceptional circumstance but that test be fail by this draft legislation as result that cross party committee chair by labour make the recommendation that clause and all be remove those be the substantive clause right through the bill on both side that be stinging indictment of this category of draft legislation however the committee member be so concerned that they do not leave it at that the following day they take the exceptional step of summon the minister and his official to give oral evidence that be very rare and it be the first time for three year that it have happen the committee member be clearly unimpressed by the answer the attempt explanation that they be give because in subsequent report on october they report that the minister and his official have fail to provide convincing justification as result of that second damn indictment of the government approach there be some movement the removal of some henry viii power and the addition of duty to consult at least in the first instance however other henry viii power remain and the duty to consult refer only to the first instance not to any secondary attempt the committee then produce third report on the bill in its current form it say that the delegation to ministers of law make power in this bill involve legislative power shift to an unacceptable extent from the democratically appoint legislature to the executive and also that the government have fail to provide convincing justification for the inclusion of skeleton clause in the bill actually think the government do understand what they be do because the bill give ministers the power to make politically contentious decision about the degree to which domestic law on product regulation and indeed on metrology should be align with eu law that be the real reason behind the bill the fear of eu alignment by the back door my experience in this place be mindful of what my hon friend have say already be that there be two type of bill to beware of the first be the bill whose provision be so permissive so broad lack the tailored approach that describe early as to allow law to be apply in way that be not expect by those who debate it as it pass through the house the second be the bill that make specific provision for delegate legislation for subsequent action by the government those two type of legislation be legislation to beware of and say that to member on both side of the house have see government of all kind introduce such bills which become in the end bad law of course agree with my right hon friend and that come to the nub of what want to say yes inevitably we be party politician we have the official opposition we have the government and we have those who sit on the left hand side of the official opposition above that however we be parliamentarian and some of we be quite new may look old and indeed be but be first elect in and an awful lot of member in the chamber who may be vote tonight be even less experienced than it take while to begin to understand the difference between the role of the legislature and the role of the executive and my profound concern be that we be at risk of hand very significant power from ourselves the legislature to the executive have hear these comment several time wonder whether the hon member will accept that wisdom be not necessarily proportional to the amount of time spend in the chamber the convention of the house and the convention of the legislature can not be brush aside by flip comment like that there be reason why we have convention there be separation of power between the executive and the legislature and the power to create legislation lie with we there be ground sometimes on which we can give it to ministers but there must be really sensible reason for that to be do and there simply be not in this instance have be follow the hon member argument closely it be certainly the case that with or without wisdom the house be capable of make poor decision have vote for measure and against they on occasion and the house have make poor decision however it be much more likely that the house will get it right rather than delegate legislation committee deal with statutory instrument where minister come along and read out brief that she or he often do not understand as be reveal under questioning if indeed question take place the argument for the bill be really to do with speed and capacity we do not meet to vote on thursdays but we often do on mondays there be plenty of time for the house to do this entirely agree do an analysis and of sit day since the general election have be on one line whip so there be no ground for the government to assert that they do not have time to put forward fresh legislation it simply be not the case and they do not have legislative agenda that they be progress with any urgency there be plenty of room and if we need to regulate we can do it we have big decision to take as parliamentarian we be be ask by the government to nod through blank cheque blank cheque that be in breach of our parliamentary convention it be against the express advice of the cross party delegated powers and regulatory reform committee not once not twice but three time say to you madam deputy speaker that any parliamentarian worthy of the name will vote against this bill as have be say on the face of it this be short bill but when we look beneath the surface it be even more exciting than the bare title of the product regulation and metrology bill suggest most of we go through our day without give much thought to the measurement of the unit that govern our everyday life confess that until very recently be one of they but so many of our scientific and medical advance have succeed or fail on the most precise margin as my hon friend the member for erewash adam thompson so brilliantly set out it be real privilege to be in the chamber to listen to his speech in the city of birmingham well know throughout much of its history as the workshop of the world many million of hour must have be sweat out to meet the fine of measurement and tolerance suspect my hon friend be capable of accurately estimate just how many hour that would have take however note in pass that one of just two remain proof house which fall under the scope of the gun barrel proof act and succeed act they attract lot of attention in the other place be in digbeth in the city of birmingham at the start of my hon friend speech he raise the question of when exactly the word metrology enter common parlance do not know what that date be but note that when the national physical laboratory be create in it be establish with metrology division one of the early guide force mr sears later find second career as scales manufacturer again in the good city of birmingham today when pharmaceutical manufacturing job be start to return to my constituency year on from the collapse of mg rover know some of the exact standard that those manufacturer must meet we need only look at the number of weights and measures acts pass by this house down the year to understand the importance of these question for our role as legislator fear that be about to commit an unwise act by reference magna carta in this place as that text have be the subject of one or two interesting email that suspect number of hon member have also receive but it be tell that it stipulate there be to be single measure for wine throughout our realm and single measure for ale and single measure for corn and it shall be the same for weight as for measure in the other place and it be fair to say in this place as well the argument over the bill have come down to simple point be delegate power and statutory instrument the right process for adapt to rapidly change landscape for product safety and international measurement standard it be worth remember two thing first the theory that we could make sufficient update through primary legislation can be test against the history of legislation in this place for example some of the provision in the consumer protection act have be overtake by event and it have prove hard in practice to bring forward the necessary change to that legislation secondly as have be say this work be initiate by the last government who at the time make the case for delegate power persuasively as the response to the call for evidence state over time the limited power we retain in domestic legislation become less effective rather than update these the uk rely on power in the european communities act eca to introduce new harmonised legislation to deal with product safety and metrology those power have now expire government of all colour must deal with complex forever change landscape and current legislation do not allow for many of the change necessary to keep pace with technological advance and modern hazard good example of the ever change metrological field can be draw from the change to the international system of quantity which alter in subtle way the definition of the kilogram the amp the kelvin and the mole with implication across very wide range of regulation think it be sensible to update those definition swiftly by regulation we have hear example of some of the unsafe product that be on sale at the moment it be worth note that the bill be not simply about definition but enforcement clause will enable some of those stretch resource to which my hon friend the member for stoke on trent central gareth snell refer to go far also note that through the transport committee receive representation from brompton bicycle very good british manufacturing success story which say that uk product safety regulation and enforcement have fail to keep pace with the development of bike technology unsafe poor quality bike product be enter the hand of uk consumer with sometimes devastating consequence my hon friend be make an excellent point many constituent around the country will appreciate the specific point he make about the change product environment and the way that product design and development be move very quickly have large number of resident who be concerned about bike be ride irresponsibly home make kit attach to bicycle and cyclist often speed on pavement that be an interesting example of how the bill could be very effective so thank he for his work on that thank my hon friend for his intervention know that be one of the area to which he pay lot of attention in the transport brief be sure that as the committee continue to look into this area it will build on that work as he say this be an issue that come up time and again in my constituency we might not ever be able to get every single one of those vehicle off the road but we need the power to bring more of they off our street where they pose threat to people safety to illustrate the seriousness of the challenge the government face and the need sometimes for very swift progress we need only to look to the scale of technological advancement in the field of hybrid warfare and the implication of those advancement for dual use civilian technology note that clause draw specific attention to product that can cause or be susceptible to electromagnetic disturbance in ukraine the two adversary be lock into cycle of innovation and reaction in drone warfare and electronic countermeasure that be escalate at blind speed some of those development have implication for the potential misuse of civilian drone in this country to suggest that primary legislation be capable of keep pace with that be not realistic similarly in respect of intangible product again an issue on which the house of lords spend large amount of welcome scrutiny time there be case that primary legislation can not cover enough eventuality in good time especially in the age of artificially generate code think back to the volkswagen emission scandal year ago when so call defeat device be intangible in nature the hon gentleman be make brilliant speech and he have focus on some of the key issue in way that not every speech have he make powerful case but why do he think that those argument have not persuade in three different attempt in three different report the cross party delegated powers and regulatory reform committee which provide expert insight into precisely such propose legislation thank the right hon gentleman for his intervention although do not agree with his characterisation of the speech we have hear today think hon member have bring wide range of perspective and that even though there have be some disagreement across the house and on occasion on the same benches all member have make their point sincerely have read the report the right hon gentleman reference and the minister evidence my reading of that report be that the committee hold very strong view on the principle of skeleton delegate legislation but the point it make be that the case must be make for the use of such power my view be that the case have be make in this instance because of the seriousness of the matter we be discuss refer the hon gentleman to the conclusion of the fourth report by the expert committee which state we remain of the view that the government have fail to provide convincing justification for the inclusion of skeleton clause in this bill that give ministers such wide power to re write in regulation the substance of the regulatory regime for product and metrology he be wrong in his assessment be he not no with respect think the hon gentleman have misunderstand my point the committee have every right to express that view we also have the right to express our view as legislator in this place as to whether the case have be make as say think the case have be make that primary legislation be not sufficient vehicle in this instance will just say to the hon gentleman that there be numerous precedent under the health and safety at work etc act for example for regulate dangerous product the difference be that primary legislation do not cover all the eventuality for product of the kind we be discuss today will finish by talk about the pint note in pass that the first legislation to clearly regulate the pint the act for the ascertaining the measures for retail ale and beer of do not see it as necessary to define the actual quantity perhaps it be leave to royal prerogative to define the history book do clearly show that the pint be safe so to speak in labour hand in his memoir of his time at head of the no policy unit the noble lord donoughue detail how harold wilson intervene to save the pint and it be labour government in who secure the metric opt out that preserve the inch the troy ounce and of course the pint know that hon and right hon member on the opposition benches have spend lot of time chase away phantom on this particular issue and hope that they feel that be good use of their time and that we see more of it in this parliament for the government benches however look forward to follow the progress of this important bill and to vote for it tonight and perhaps also to raise pint or as clause have it cubic decimetre to the bill good health as it complete its remain stage in this house forgive for bring the commons back to the purpose of parliament its historic purpose be to make law for our constituent and to hold the executive to account that be the fundamental that have be loosen by this bill although it be entirely skeletal in form the bill effect be very far reach indeed it be quite obvious that the bill have clear purpose which be to align great britain with the eu single market on good if it be not so we would not have clause the standard that be set in that clause be the eu standard if the bill be just about create the opportunity to make regulation because of regulatory gap it would not be tethered to the eu provision on good it would be open end and we would be free to make the choice that well suit we however the giveaway clause in the bill be clause that let the cat out of the bag as indeed do the hon member for walthamstow ms creasy when she quite clearly indicate that that be the direction of travel that she seek therefore that be the purpose when we look at clause we again have the open affirmation of the desire to make the compliance with relevant eu law so it be abundantly clear that this be creation to realign we with eu law the intent be to create this vehicle for realignment without voter notice of course that mean realignment with law that we do not make and that we can not change because they be make by foreign parliament the ambition in this bill in respect of clause be to disenfranchise as have happen already in northern ireland by our subjugation to the eu single market and all its rule the people of the united kingdom so that in their entirety they be at the government whim and can be subject to law they do not make and can not change that then inextricably tie we to the european court of justice it be the ecj that mediate and deliberate on those law that this bill wish to tie we to therefore it be an attempt to tie we not just to the eu single market but to the court that rule the eu single market on the point the hon and learn gentleman be make about enfranchisement and the fact that he wish this parliament to be in control of the power that it have do he agree that it would be sensible for the uk government to ensure that where power be devolve to the scottish parliament for example they seek consent from scottish ministers rather than just legislate the bill as currently draft allow ministers here to legislate in area of devolved competency much as he be make the case that the eu court would be allow to do one critical thing about the bill be that under the sewel convention it do not extend to secondary legislation it do not extend to statutory instrument the bill drive coach and horse through the sewel convention as far as devolution be concern because it heap all the power into statutory instrument one might expect such bold move to realign the united kingdom with eu law to be an up front piece of legislation do not think that that be too much to ask that it should be plain and clear for all to see instead it be to be convey in these statutory instrument and statutory instrument as we know be those that in the main pass through unnoticed we have all be to delegated legislation committees we know that they be farcical in that the minister come in with brief which be simply rigidly read and members nod the motion through it be farcical way to make legislation of any sort much of this debate have be about whether this bill lead we to dynamic alignment the government position be that it do not and that this be all mirage and fantasy if that be the case do the hon and learn member agree that simple amendment to this bill to make that clear would go long way to reassure member absolutely if the government be not as many of we suspect follow deliberate approach of circumvent debate in this house on key realignment issue and be seek rather to channel it through statutory instrument then call our bluff change this bill in that regard but this idea of skeleton legislation which set up the power that have be take from parliament and give to the executive be something which historically this party of government have rail against indeed within week of second reading in the other place the attorney general give the bingham lecture he say excessive reliance on delegate power henry viii clause or skeleton legislation upset the proper balance between parliament and the executive this not only strike at the rule of law value but also at the cardinal principle of accessibility and legal certainty in my view the new government offer an opportunity for reset in the way that government think about these issue this mean in particular much sharp focus on whether take delegate power be justify in give case and more careful consideration of appropriate safeguard that be the attorney general where do that go to be interested in the attorney general view and we should take it seriously do the hon and learn gentleman recognise that primary legislation in this place metamorphosis in its passage through scrutiny have be involve in many bills as shadow minister minister and back bencher and that be precisely what happen minister listen to argument and as bills return to the house they reflect that argument both from here and in the lords secondary legislation do not go through that process that be why it be so important that the bills we pass here do not contain the kind of permissive power that facilitate so much secondary legislation the right hon member be absolutely right if one want to realign the united kingdom with the eu the easy passage would be by statutory instrument that be why that be the choose mechanism here have one final point this parliament traditionally and properly make the law on criminal offence we set the tariff sometimes we say what the minimum penalty for criminal offence be but we always say what the maximum penalty be we say what the content be of the criminal offence what be the actus reus and the men rea but amazingly under clause and and clause and of the bill we be go to make criminal offence by statutory instrument surely we have lose the run of ourselves if we think it be appropriate to make criminal offence in that essentially uncontrolled manner it deprive this house and therefore those we represent of the very careful scrutiny that should always go into make something crime that be but another of the fundamental flaw of this undeserve bill order dr prinsley be tell that your speech be just few minute long so hope you will honour that welcome this bill which will address the alarming proliferation of unsafe product in online marketplace would like to talk particularly about the hazard of unsafe toy which be increasingly be sell online as very recently retire ear nose and throat surgeon yesterday actually know the very real harm that these dangerous toy cause have operate on young child who inhale small component from unsafe toy detachable part or part that be unsafely secure and be choke hazard and ribbon or string that exceed the legal limit create strangulation hazard these be frightening life threaten situation that no family should have to put up with those be not isolate incident which investigation find that over of toy purchase from some online marketplace be unfit for sale in the uk shockingly these toy falsely display uk and european safety mark mislead parent into believe that they be buy something safe for their child the tragedy be that in many of these case the seller simply disappear vanish from the platform and the family be leave with no way to seek redress from the harm cause that be why we must act be glad that the bill will give the government the opportunity to address this issue it will give they the power to regulate new and emerge business model and marketplace which previous law do not allow lithium ion battery be essential for achieve our net zero goal but as demand grow for product contain such battery we need to do more to protect consumer against dangerous lithium ion battery since bike and scooter fire have order it be an intervention not speech do the hon member agree that there should be mechanism to recognise and regulate high risk product so that we can protect consumer thank the hon member for her intervention would point out the particular danger of button battery something that be well know to ent surgeon which cause perforation of the oesophagus and the trachea by chemical reaction in the last two year of consumer have purchase from online platform with approximately million monthly transaction in uk we certainly need strong accountability for these marketplace without that dangerous item will continue to resurface put child at risk urge the house to ensure that the bill put more pressure on the seller of unsafe toy force they to take responsibility for their action you be an honourable man it be pleasure to take part in the debate we have have excellent speech from across the house think the whole house agree on the brilliance of the speech make by the hon member for erewash adam thompson and perhaps would say this great speech have come from opposition members in particular my hon friend the member for broadland and fakenham jerome mayhew the hon and learn member for north antrim jim allister and the right hon member for east antrim sammy wilson get to the heart and the nub of the critique of the bill we have also hear many good speech include the last one about issue of product safety and the need to have system that can keep up the speech that address both that issue and whether the bill be appropriate it be the outstanding speech by government member be make by the hon member for birmingham northfield laurence turner he do not like my praise of his speech in so far as it disparage in any way anybody else but he face up to the issue directly he do not just say well there be these problem with product and product safety and here bill that could do something about it he deal with the fact that the bill give enormous power to ministers as colleague across the house have point out the purpose of this honourable house be to hold the executive foot to the fire hold they to account and hold they in check and ensure that we champion the will of the people who send we here as have be say not only the minister but back in the secretary of state warn the house that the use of delegate power carry risk of abuse by the report taxation cross border trade public bill committee february the hon member for walthamstow ms creasy be not here so will try to be more polite than would have be if she be but if brexit derangement syndrome be condition it be one that affect not only people who be maniacally in favour of brexit but those who seem unable to think rationally from the other side the point that try to make to the hon lady in an intervention would make it again be that give such untrammelled power to ministers be frightening regardless of whether we prefer close alignment with the eu she say that we need common sense alignment but these power would allow super ideological future minister to come in and seek entirely for ideological reason to stop any alignment with the most sensible of eu regulation purely to have some brexit difference that make no sense whatsoever rise will press on little but may come back to the hon lady understand that follow the loveless landslide that bring the government to power the government and government members have do an about face they now delight in more power for the executive so much so that the bill very first subsection give the same secretary of state just reference the power to make regulation anywhere in the uk without consult parliaments in westminster holyrood cardiff bay or stormont on more or less anything he like be so pleased that the hon and learn member for north antrim raise the devolution question be minister for eight year and such be the complexity of the devolution settlement now that even with thousand of civil servant work on primary legislation ministers can come to the house and suddenly it get point out to they that they be in breach of the sewel convention and ignore how northern ireland have slightly different environmental or energy regulatory environment from scotland or wales they find that the situation be more complex than they first think now we be give power to ministers who will not have to go through any of that rigmarole they will not get to find out how they be trample on the devolution settlement and that be serious issue we on the opposition benches can make the argument but what we must really do be engage government members and get they to recognise that they be not here just to back the government they need to question these thing and not just ask whether the power could be use for good the hon member for birmingham northfield give brilliant speech with example of the speeding up and pace of technological change think he speak about the drone in ukraine even though opposition members may maintain that the system that we have work perfectly well he make the case that perhaps we need something speedy go forward and can see that he make strong argument none the less be the answer just to hand to ministers in this skeleton bill all the power in the world suggest that it be not know the minister and the secretary of state be decent people and hope that we will see as the legislation proceed through this house way to curb some of the power while allow we to have regulatory system that can speedily respond to inappropriate product none of we want to see parliamentary pride get in the way of an effective system we have to find way of make thing work this bill however go too far the other way that be why the cross party expert on the delegated powers and regulatory reform committee have look at it and say that they do not feel that the case have be make to justify such massive power some parallel be raise by the hon member for walthamstow and think it be fair enough to say look at the way that henry viii power and delegate power be take by the government in the last parliament quite rightly people question it but that be about implement brexit it really be something enormous that have to be do at reasonable speed those of we involve be cognisant of the fact that we do not want it to set precedent we do not want government to take the unique condition of implement brexit and take it as new way of govern to the comment from the hon member for erewash about rebuild the world that the ancient egyptians have they be very good at centralise authority and do not think that that be an entirely good thing that be exactly what the bill do so agree with he on that be sure the secretary of state be an excellent judge of thing such as the safe operation of laptop say for trainee solicitor but he will now have the power to regulate any product for sale in the uk on the basis of safety or functionality the immense power give to he will allow he to decide what be and be not sell in the uk without consult this place and by merely provide write statement the bill go far with minister acquire the power to give inspector the right to enter somebody home to seize any product that the minister have decide on the basis of non compliance that can be impose on manufacturer marketer installer importer or people who run an online marketplace the definition of which by the way can be alter on ministerial whim and at any point we have hear about dangerous and often unpopular electric bike and scooter but the power in the bill allow future secretary of state we have have some eccentric one in the past to decide to ban bicycle because he consider they to be dangerous he might look at the figure on that after publish statement he could instruct anyone he like to enter the house of every bike owner and every bike shop to seize every bike in the united kingdom the secretary of state could effectively end cycling in the uk without come to parliament he could create legion of cycle inspector who could enter people home or business and seize their property before dispose of it and the government want to hide this act under the innocuous name of the product regulation and metrology bill it be massive power to give to the secretary of state say this to the many new labour members be not very keen on any government even the one of which be member it be lord acton who say power tend to corrupt and absolute power corrupt absolutely well there be an element of absolute power in this bill but we have an opportunity both to recognise the powerful case make by the hon member for birmingham northfield for an appropriate system and by his colleague talk about different challenge and to make sure that we limit and reduce those power as the bill go through the house know that my cycle example be little extreme but it be also true it would not require the government to return to this house they would be able to do it the prime minister have tell we that the no mission of this government be growth yet his ministers not satisfied with take the fast grow economy in the entire and bring it to shudder halt have introduce what may be the most tediously name but potentially dangerous bill in the history of parliament we can look at what the government have do for business so far they have end the rate relief for hospitality make part time worker too expensive to hire hike the cost of employ people through next week job tax strengthen the trade union and make it impossible to fire new worker would not want to exaggerate this bill role but in crowded field it take the biscuit in many way business be struggle to cope with all these thing already and now we will have great business uncertainty cause by the fact that ministers can on whim choose which product can and can not be sell this will provide the exact opposite of the certainty that labour members suggest the bill could bring in way that have no logic behind it every single one of the measure in that infamous list that my right hon friend just go through require vote in this house and labour members have to put their name to each propose legislative change they will not have to do that under this legislation will they they will not the secretary of state not the current wonderful benign insightful and genial secretary of state but future rather less palatable one could wake up one day and impose new regulation on business that effectively strangle and bring red tape to every business in the land remember how close we be in to have government that would have be very different from the one that be opposite we today or indeed from the conservatives why be the government do this can not look into man soul but have an idea because labour spend year fight the uk attempt to remove the burden of regulation on business after we leave the eu at every turn labour try to cling to nurse rather than let business innovate and sell their good this government be seek to undermine and erode the freedom we have win over the last few year indeed that be in black and white in the bill the secretary of state may reimpose eu law on product without the requirement to come to this place and ask our permission to do so be not say that this be the bad thing the government have do as have say there be quite packed list include cut the winter fuel payment for pensioner the farm tax the job tax impose stamp duty on first time buyer which come in think suddenly someone want to buy house there be also the hospitality tax could go on but executive power be at their most pernicious when they have no limit this legislation be not about metrology or about the well regulation of product it be about give the government the power to do what they like when they like for reason they do not have to explain and then impose it as they see fit the fact that we might like and even trust the current secretary of state be no reason to give power like this to ministers about whom we know nothing now hope that labour members will join we in oppose this bill this have be genuinely important interesting and lively debate on product regulation and metrology it have also be debate about the balance of power between the executive and we here in parliament the uk product safety and metrology framework be derive from european union law and it develop while the uk be member of the eu when we do not have the opportunity here to address product safety in our change world as rapidly as we do now follow our departure from the european union the uk establish its independent regulatory system which must be flexible enough to accommodate emerge technology such as artificial intelligence and address change in consumer purchasing behaviour as the bill explanatory note state its purpose be to ensure that the uk be well equip to tackle modern safety challenge safeguard consumer seize opportunity for economic growth and so on the secretary of state say in his introductory remark that the bill be introduce in the previous parliament and want to emphasise that it be not want to offer the minister the chance to correct the record in his closing remark in case the house have be inadvertently mislead upon leave the european union the uk create the uk conformity assess marking know as the ukca to replace the conformité européenne mark know as the ce these marking be use by manufacturer to demonstrate product conformity the uk still recognise ce marking however the eu do not recognise the ukca will the minister confirm that discussion be happen with the eu include the resetting of discussion on trade to ensure that ukca marking and any product regulate here in the uk be mutually recognise turn to the point raise in today excellent debate we hear fantastic speech from my right hon friend the members for south holland and the deepings sir john hayes and for beverley and holderness graham stuart and my hon friend the members for broadland and fakenham jerome mayhew and for beaconsfield joy morrissey we also hear powerful voice from northern ireland on the adjacent benches from the right hon member for east antrim sammy wilson and the hon and learn member for north antrim jim allister we also hear the expertise that the hon member for wokingham clive jones bring from his background in the toy industry from the labour benches we hear impassioned speech often about product safety include from the hon member for worsley and eccles michael wheeler for bathgate and linlithgow kirsteen sullivan and for walthamstow ms creasy she describe we as sinner repent which hasten to surmise might mean that she be repenter beginning to sin we hear from the hon member for stoke on trent central gareth snell who be passionate advocate for ceramic from his constituency we have the pleasure of hear masterclass from parliament first metrologist the hon member for erewash adam thompson on the ancient history of metrology it be very enjoyable speech we hear speech from the hon member for birmingham northfield laurence turner and for bury st edmunds and stowmarket peter prinsley before embark on the reason why we will oppose the bill tonight welcome the government turn in the other place on their plan to rule over the size of the great british pint or as the hon member for erewash would describe it cubic decimetre although they be initially resistant ministers eventually recognise that our great british pint should remain untouched be afraid that that be all can welcome about this piece of legislation because the opposition be deeply concerned with the government overreach and excessive reliance on delegate power within the bill henry viii would be absolutely delighted by this piece of legislation labour members claim that it will simplify our regulatory framework yet all we see be the undermining of our sovereignty and the power of parliament this page bill would give the secretary of state unchecked power to amend product safety regulation change the definition of an online marketplace and introduce new penalty inspection power and charge on business drive up the already soar cost of do business in the uk as many hon friend have say it would grant the government sweep power to make we passive recipient of law make in brussels international trade and co operation be welcome but this be not what more than million people vote for in when we take back control it be betrayal of brexit the bill be not purely technical part of its purpose be to allow the dynamic alignment of good with eu single market law give the eu the power to rule on standard for manufacture good produce in the united kingdom this eu trojan horse bill could see we readopte regulatory regime over which we have no influence input or sanction leave we as rule taker not rule maker it be fundamentally not good practice or good governance to deliver substantial change through delegate legislation we must bear in mind that the use of delegate power carry risk of abuse by the executive which be not something the opposition could ever support rather it be our duty at this stage to check the power of the executive and ensure that we be not give they carte blanche to change the balance of power permanently in their favour official report taxation cross border trade public bill committee february these be not my word but those of the secretary of state tomorrow the united states could impose tariff on we it be paramount that we secure mutually beneficial uk us trade deal as soon as possible but can not see how the bill which drag we close to the european union would give the united states any incentive to work with we in closing let ask the minister few question can he confirm what the limit will be on ministerial power what oversight will parliament have of regulatory change make under the bill what consultation will occur with the real world business that be affect by the change will he confirm that no regulation make under the bill will prevent or impede uk business from trade internationally the bill undermine parliament and risk tie british business to eu red tape on which we have no say we can not allow these excessive power to create further uncertainty among british business of all size which already face the soar cost of do business because of the chancellor tax grab the bill be parliamentary sovereignty sell out we get brexit do let we keep it that way the bill give away control and that be why call on the house to back our amendment and stop it thank right hon and hon member from across the house for what have be an interesting and at time inform debate on the product regulation and metrology bill as my right hon friend the secretary of state say in opening the government primary mission be economic growth to help rejuvenate our high street and promote innovation and this legislation be an important element in that drive and will far cement the uk as world leader in product regulation and safety the legislation will have real world impact that we can all relate to as we have hear product safety failure can have devastating consequence and we be determined that our regulatory framework be as agile and flexible as possible in its response to new threat and complex modern supply chain but without stifle innovation there have be an awful lot of contribution and will try to cover as many of they as can think it be appropriate that start by reference the excellent speech from my hon friend the member for erewash adam thompson which light up the whole house he be of course the first meteorologist to have speak in this chamber metrologist metrologist he may well be on the bill committee because he have definitely talk his way on to it with his insight into this issue my hon friend the member for birmingham northfield laurence turner almost match he in term of technical specificity and his historical knowledge be also very important he have just finish sit on bill committee with but he be talk his way on to this one as well perhaps should not say that because it might encourage colleague not to speak in future debate my hon friend the member for bathgate and linlithgow kirsteen sullivan and the liberal democrat spokesperson the hon member for wokingham clive jones be among number of member who talk about the issue of bike which be real concern be sure the whole house have be move by the tragic case of bike fire that we too often hear about my right hon friend the secretary of state refer to the tragic death of sofia duarte meet her mother last year to talk about what we can do through this bill to prevent such tragedy from happen again in the wake of the increase number of fire associate with bike and lithium ion battery there have be call from business trade association consumer group and parliamentarian to tighten up the law this legislation will allow we to ensure that the uk product safety framework can keep up with technological development include on bike the power in the bill will allow we to update regulation to ensure the good protection for consumer and consistency with the majority of reputable retailer the government be currently consider how good to use the power in the bill to regulate these product in an efficient and proportionate way in particular to ensure that product that can pose great risk such as lithium ion battery and bike and scooter be safe that include bring forward power in the bill to well define online marketplace and confer additional duty on they to help stop the sale of unsafe product include converter kit as my hon friend the member for worsley and eccles michael wheeler point out this be fast move environment and the bill will give we the flexibility to tackle that do the minister agree that if uk manufacturer want to produce product for the uk market it should produce it to uk regulation and if it want to export it to europe it be sensible to produce that product to eu regulation which will open up massive market on our doorstep keep up with eu regulation will generally be good for the british business economy and help economic growth the liberal democrat spokesperson tempt to set out statement of policy which the bill be not intend to do we want to give ourselves maximum flexibility in our ability to deal with issue as they arise he talk in his speech about online marketplace and my hon friend the member for bury st edmunds and stowmarket peter prinsley talk about unsafe toy and button battery cite the fact that investigation have discover that up to of product purchase in online marketplace be unsafe because we recognise that online marketplace be in desperate need of regulation the bill will give we power to clarify and modernise responsibility for online marketplace in flexible and proportionate way to protect consumer and create fair playing field for law abide business it will enable the government to modernise the responsibility of online supply chain actor while the growth of commerce have provide consumer with great choice and convenience it can not be at the expense of consumer safety we will continue to engage with consumer group business and online marketplace in the development of specific online marketplace requirement to ensure that they be proportionate and to mitigate any cost to consumer can also confirm that it be the intention of the government to consult on the duty for online marketplace soon after royal assent and to bring forward subsequent regulation as soon as be practically possible my hon friend the member for stoke on trent central gareth snell speak with his customary passion about the ceramics industry in the potteries acknowledge his idea for protect the industry be not sure whether this bill be the right vehicle for his suggestion but will take it away and come back to he it be probably worth talk about the issue that seem to vex opposition members rather lot which be whether this bill be in some way reset to eu law by the back door it be about domestic regulation and we be not rejoin the eu by the back door the bill be about give we flexibility to ensure product regulation now and in the future that be tailor to the need of the uk of course there will be some instance when we will want to take similar approach to the eu but there will be other time when we will want to take our own approach those decision will be take on case by case basis in the good interest of uk business and consumer as my hon friend the member for walthamstow ms creasy say the retained eu law revocation and reform act give significant power to the executive and the liberal democrat spokesperson the hon member for wokingham quote on that act it reform regulation range across every function of society its regulation be far broad than those propose in this bill and the delegated powers and regulatory reform select committee call it hyper skeletal which be some way beyond the criticism it level against this bill turn to the reason amendment table by the official opposition it be worth restate that the bill be not about rejoin the eu david cameron comment that he want the conservative party to stop bang on about europe but there seem to be some way to go before his word reach fruition despite the fact that we leave five year ago the bill give we the necessary power to ensure public regulation now and in the future meet the interest of the uk the power set out in the bill will be use solely and exclusively in the good interest of uk business and consumer recognise that the house of lords delegated powers and regulatory reform select committee raise concern about this be skeleton bill but the government have consider those concern and other representation make by member in the other place our exist product regulation be necessary to keep consumer safe and to provide clarity and level playing field for business they extend to many thousand of page and cover huge amount of technical detail as the noble and learn lord pannick say in the other place the practical reality be that technical regulation of the breadth and complexity that will be produce can not sensibly be enact by primary legislation he go on to say that if we be require to use primary legislation every time we want to make regulation on product safety there would be little if any time for anything else official report house of lords february vol conservative members seem to have forget that since the consumer protection act government of all stripe have recognise the need to make product safety regulation by secondary legislation since the conservatives have be in power for year so they have more than enough time to find another way of deal with product safety but they do not choose to do that we be take pragmatic approach we have take notice of some of the concern raise about the power of the bill we have remove number of henry viii power introduce consultation requirement add additional affirmative resolution procedure and publish code of conduct that set out the control that we will have to ensure regulation be proportionate and evidence base be grateful to member of the other place for set out some of their concern as the shadow minister the hon member for west worcestershire dame harriett baldwin point out the conservatives do not introduce the bill in the last parliament be happy to confirm that that be the case that show that there be gap in the law that need filling and the conservatives fail to act on it some of the important consumer group in this country such as which recognise that action be need sue davies head of consumer right protection and food policy say it encouraging that the government be prioritise bill that should address the huge gap in consumer protection which allow online marketplace to facilitate the sale of unsafe and illegal product without face repercussion if member vote for the reason amendment we will not be have any of those protection do not think any responsible party would move an amendment along those line this government be never go to compromise on safety the bill be essential to strengthen the rule and regulation need to protect consumer business and the public therefore commend the bill to the house question put that the amendment be make jim allister stuart anderson stuart andrew edward argar victoria atkins gareth bacon harriett

mccluskey meur ra mr speaker be delighted to secure my first adjournment debate and for it to be on an issue so close to my heart trail hunting and more broadly animal welfare put simply animal cruelty should have no place in modern progressive century britain have spend most of my life live in rural area have witness at first hand the brutal reality of hunt with dog contrary to the view of some that opinion be share by many rural resident it be imperative that as lawmaker we address the concern surround trail hunting particularly in light of the hunting act and the government manifesto commitment fox hunting be not sport it be an activity that involve tracking chase and kill fox typically use pack of hound and rider on horseback it be ban by the last labour government through hunting act drag hunting be an activity similar to traditional foxhunting but with key difference instead of hunt live fox scent trail be artificially lay for the hound to follow the scent be usually create use mixture of aniseed and other substance and it be drag along predetermined route just to be clear have no issue with drag hunting the royal society for the prevention of cruelty to animals say that out of control hound on trail hunt have harm people pet and themselves in residential area do my hon friend agree that it be urgent that trail hunting should be ban as soon as possible to close the loophole in the hunting act order advise member that it be easy for we to hear they if they look to the microphone thank my hon friend for that intervention and entirely agree trail hunting as it be commonly understand involve pack of hound follow scent trail lay by human with the intention that hound will follow the trail rather than chase and kill wild animal the functional difference between that and drag hunting be that animal base scent of the traditional hunting quarry be use in trail hunting that be usually fox urine but the body part and carcase of fox deer and hare can also be use on the surface it appear to be harmless activity however there be now overwhelming evidence to suggest that trail hunting have become thinly veil pretence for illegal hunting activity under the hunting act be grateful to my hon friend for give way and for secure this important debate in my constituency several hunt include the heythrop hunt and the warwickshire hunt which cross the county border have be catch red handed hunting live fox do he agree that such incident show how urgent it be for the government to honour their manifesto commitment to ban trail hunting thank my hon friend for that intervention not only that but in his constituency have personally clear land on which local hunt have create an environment for fox to thrive it be complete nonsense to suggest that fox hunting be of any use in term of control it be not the act be response to the grow public outcry over the brutality of hunt practice it make it illegal to hunt with hound except in certain circumstance in the case of register hunt use scent trail first commend the hon gentleman speak to he before the debate so he know where be come from have very different opinion and the hon gentleman know that he respect that and respect he just want to put that on the record this be clearly devolved matter so england scotland northern ireland and wales will make their own decision separately the hon gentleman have outline his point of view but do he agree that the hunting community deserve to have their voice hear and consider in that legislative process the hunting community would dispute some of what have be say tonight just for the record as hunting man one who have never hunt with horse or hound think the hunting community should have the right to pursue it what do the hon gentleman think before we go any far let get the other point of view think it be absolutely right that all voice be hear but that science be follow legislation should be base on evidence and science and the evidence and the science suggest that the cruelty to the animal be pursue far outweigh the pleasure the hunt will give human being however be really happy for all voice to be hear in this debate the law must also be follow the fact that of register trail hunt end up chase fox prove that the law need tighten up and that we need tough sentencing ultimately this labour government will deliver that do my hon friend agree that that be priority thank my hon friend for that point do agree and will be come on to that later be sorry to make another intervention on the hon gentleman my neighbour in cornwall he be probably aware that spend hundred of hour in this house on this matter before the act be pleased that in spite of all the intimidation and threat that receive at the time the act still go through the point be make early that the voice of those who get their kick out of chase wild animal for sport need to be hear and indeed they have be we have already hear that the leader of trail hunt admit that they be indeed smokescreen they have use that word themselves to describe what go on with trail hunt agree with the hon member and thank he not just for his intervention but for all his work to raise awareness the hunting act do not go far enough it leave certain loophole particularly the allowance for trail hunting which have mean that the law be often undermine accord to the rspca and the league against cruel sports despite the requirement for hunt to obtain landowner permission and follow strict regulation there be significant evidence that trail hunt often lead to the unlawful hunting of fox and other wild animal accord to source in cornwall there be five foxhound pack alongside trail hunt some of those pack have continue to hunt fox illegally and have be film send hound to dig out fox hide in hole woodland and hedge many landowner continue to suffer horse and hound trespass and uncontrolle hound regularly end up spill out on to road cause danger to road user as mention by my hon friend the member for north ayrshire and arran irene campbell meur ras keren that be my very good cornish and will not try to repeat it unless have time to practise thank my hon friend for secure the debate to go back to his point about the difference between drag hunting and trail hunting lot of the negative thing that he describe would not come from drag hunt which have predetermine route and use different type of scent for the avoidance of doubt for anybody listen at home particularly those in the hunting community who may be concern might we just reconfirm that this be about trail hunting not drag hunting can say once again that have no issue with drag hunting this be about trail hunting trail hunt be often deliberately lay in area inhabit by fox increase the likelihood of hound disturbing chase and kill fox or other animal when the scent of live quarry be pick up these be not isolate incident they be part of broad pattern of behaviour that undermine the intent of the hunting act for example between august and march during the last hunting season several report be make of illegal hunting incident include cub hunting where the claim of trail hunting be use as defence in many of these case the evidence suggest that the scent trail be often formality with hunt continue to chase and kill wildlife several major landowner have take step to restrict trail hunting the national trust natural resources wales and forestry england have all ban trail hunting additionally united utilities and the lake district national park have suspend trail hunting activity with the lake district national park suspension describe as indefinite the ministry of defence have also halt the issuance of any licence for trail hunting on its land additionally in february the national lead on fox hunting crime assistant chief constable matt longman publicly state that of all the case that have review this be point that be make early where there have be successful prosecution of the hunting act trail hunting have be use as defence his comment reflect the disturbing reality that trail hunting be provide smokescreen for illegal fox hunting the hon gentleman be be very generous with his time his thesis seem to be that because the direct hunting of fox be make illegal trail hunting be be we as cover for it what would happen if he have his way and trail hunting be ban as well would it not then be possible for drag hunting to be use in some way as cover for illegal fox hunting if so be not this an endless process and should he not come out and say straightaway that he want every form of this activity stop think that have twice make the point that have no issue with drag hunting with drag hunting the scent that be follow be not that of the carcase of an animal or the urine of an animal therefore the likelihood that there will be wild animal include in drag hunting be much much small the evidence from the rspca and the league against cruel sports support the view that drag hunting be completely different from trail hunting and that there be no issue with drag hunting it be really important that this be not see to be witch hunt against people who want to have hack across the countryside with dog on specific and pre plan route it be really important nuance within rural community that we be not against all form of horse riding we want to make sure that wildlife and the natural environment be protect so respectfully do not agree with the right hon member in fact the league against cruel sports own analysis reveal that trail hunting have be use as defence in case involve allege illegal hunting by register hunt that highlight the major issue with the current legislation as the exist law be often unable sufficiently to hold to account those who flout the regulation under the guise of trail hunting moreover enforcement in the field have prove difficult although hunt be operate illegally knowingly or intentionally hunt live quarry it can often be challenge to prove that in court the impact on animal welfare be significant with wild animal particularly fox be force to run long distance while be relentlessly pursue after which they be tear limb from limb while still alive by pack of uncontrollable hound the suffering do not stop there non target animal include domestic pet and livestock have also be disturb attack and even kill when hunt veer off course create havoc in residential area and rural community this issue be not matter for one party alone support for ban trail hunting cross party line mp from various political party include the conservative party the liberal democrats and the green party have all express concern over trail hunting role in perpetuate illegal hunting activity this broad cross party support demonstrate share commitment to protect animal wildlife and the natural environment strongly believe it be time for we to come together and close this loophole once and for all public opinion on hunt in the uk have shift dramatically over the year around of the british public support the ban on hunt with dog and many of those people would like to see trail hunting ban as well the moral case for end trail hunting be clear it be inconsistent with the value of modern compassionate society that respect animal welfare hunt whether through traditional or trail method often take place in area of natural beauty and fragile ecosystem the disturbance cause by hound and hunter can have lasting effect on the local wildlife disrupt natural habitat and lead to long term ecological damage give the increase concern over biodiversity and the need to protect our natural environment ban trail hunting would be positive step in safeguard the uk wildlife and habitat we need to strengthen the hunting act to make sure it deliver the protection that animal need that mean ban trail hunting remove exemption that enable illegal hunting and introduce custodial sentence for those who break the law my hon friend be make powerful case while pledge to ban trail hunting be welcome fear that it could be insufficient if legislation focus solely on the term trail hunting hunt may adopt new euphemism to exploit exist loophole to continue their activity do my hon friend agree that effective reform must go beyond symbolic ban and address the entire framework that enable illegal hunting to carry on agree with my hon friend in addition to those change we must extend the time available to charge in illegal hunting case reverse the burden of proof of compliance with exemption and make hunt notifiable offence these step would make it easy to enforce the law and ensure that those who break it face the consequence thank the minister for his time today and look forward to his response on this issue the way we treat our wildlife reflect the kind of society we be and the legacy we will leave for future generation for hunt animal with dog be nothing less than profoundly cruel activity it be an activity that like most of my fellow labour mps campaign during the general election to ban today stand before this house to say that it be time to take decisive action and fulfil our promise to the electorate and end trail hunting in the united kingdom once and for all should declare an interest as chair of the league against cruel sports drag hunting be invent year ago it be peaceful activity trail hunting be not it be design to get around the current legislation why do my hon friend think that century of tradition be be ignore by the pro hunt fraternity my hon friend raise difficult question society move on and people value change over the course of the last few decade society have come to respect animal welfare far more than it ever have do before hunting be and be perceive to be traditional rural activity but that do not mean it be right it be wrong in modern century britain it have to be ban we have to bring in these change as say have no issue with people who want to have hack across the countryside in control manner but have profound problem if the outcome of that activity be the destruction of wild animal and the local environment my question to the minister be simple one when will the government make available parliamentary time to bring forward the necessary change to the hunting act to ban trail hunting congratulate my hon friend the member for camborne and redruth perran moon on secure his first adjournment debate and speak with such knowledge and passion about this important subject welcome the

support the animal welfare import of dogs cats and ferrets bill which will close loophole in the non commercial pet travel rule that be abuse by unscrupulous trader it will also give the government

both the welsh government and the scottish government have bring in ban on the use of snare in recent year and we be now consider the most effective way to deliver on that commitment we will set out the next step in due course in the meantime anyone use snare have responsibility under the animal welfare act to ensure that their activity do not harm protect specie or cause any unnecessary suffering the government be also commit to ban the import of hunt trophy from endangered animal the uk have long history of championing global conservation and the government be carefully review how to introduce effective legislation as soon as possible we welcome the establishment of the national animal welfare panel by the all party parliamentary group on animal welfare and look forward to work

proposal as we work to bring that about know that hon member in the chamber will share my deep concern about the recent high profile incident of hare coursing that have be in the news hare coursing be an abhorrent activity that can quickly shatter rural community sense of safety and security it be serious crime which be often carry out by organise criminal gang it be vital that rural community be protect by effective policing to ensure enforcement of the law defra alongside the home office be work jointly with the national police chiefs council to deliver an update rural and wildlife crime

investigation that include case of cruelty to wildlife and support local police force to take positive action against those who break the law through illegal fox hunting let turn to the primary focus of this debate trail hunting as we be aware the hunting act make it an offence to hunt wild mammal with dog except where it be carry out in accordance with the exemption in the act those find guilty under the act be subject to the full force of the law however as many have say here today the nature of trail hunting make it difficult to ensure that wild mammal such as fox be not endanger the trail be not lay constantly but be occasionally lift for distance and drop again to allow the hound to search for the scent huntsman and follower often do not know where trail have be lay and that can mean that at time the scent of wild animal be pick up that make it challenge to protect fox as well as other wild animal such as deer and hare from november to march as we have hear the league against cruel sports report nearly incident of suspect illegal hunting and incident of hunt cause distress or nuisance that be why the government be commit to go far by put in place ban on trail hunting my hon friend ask for specific timeline be afraid that at the moment can not give he that but want to assure member that we be work to move this forward and will deliver thorough consultation later this year to ensure that the legislation that be bring forward be effective in practice and that its impact be understand also appreciate that as we have hear there be people in this house who will not
