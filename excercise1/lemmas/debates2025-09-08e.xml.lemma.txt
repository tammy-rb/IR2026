side of this argument about national security when we stand alongside the us as our close ally britain commitment to the nato target clearly send strong signal of our resolve but that pledge must command public confidence that the money will be spend wisely can the secretary of state provide more detail on how he be work with the treasury the cabinet office and other to ensure that every

not from the ministry of defence budget as the then armed force minister the hon member for plymouth sutton and devonport confirm to last week in write answer the amount we will spend on the defence investment plan come entirely from the mod departmental budget therefore the actual figure for fund our future defence equipment be just by with no fund plan to go any high give the threat we face be

recruitment to the armed force must be base solely on merit we must recruit the absolute good to serve in the armed force as the hon gentleman will know an intelligent strategy for recruitment will seek to reach every single community across these british isle perpetuate narrative that woman and those from ethnic minority many of whom have prove time and again on service that they absolutely deserve to be part of our armed force be recruit because of some wake policy do they huge disservice totally agree but be that not why we should be concern that the contract for the new armed force recruitment service include annual mandate performance indicators focus on enhance equality and diversity within the workforce those be to be annually mandate in the contract my concern be that hardwire the requirement into the contract risk distort recruitment if the target be not hit we see that with the raf would it not be well to simply scrap the red tape altogether and focus solely on get the good people into the armed force irrespective of their background think the hon member have answer his own question we be talk about indicator and indicator be very different from target an intelligent recruitment strategy seek to reach out to all community across these island and we need to monitor how well our narrative be succeed if we be to have truly professional strategy we have to monitor its success in reach different community that be why we refer to an indicator my question be bit like the bus this morning spend lot of time knock on door and talk to resident in my

both physical and mental injury from service op courage have already see referral it be fantastic programme that run across the country and provide mental health service for veteran encourage any veteran who think that they need help to shout and seek help it be the first step to recovery call the liberal democrat spokesperson it be clear that vladimir putin remain hellbent on the conquest of ukraine while he drag trump along with false promise of peace it be right of the government to have take step such as put in place the recent price cap cut to hurt putin oil profit but the government must go far analysis by the centre for research on energy and clean air think tank show that the uk have send over million in tax receipt to the kremlin by continue to import petroleum product derive from russian oil from third country will the government commit to finally close this loophole which be currently fill the kremlin coffer we be always ready to take further step on impose economic

the clyde and the forth which clearly demonstrate the real benefit of be part of the union what assessment have the minister make of other potential export deal what step be he take to ensure that the ministry of defence take up those opportunity the type deal with norway show what be possible when we have determined export campaign we be look at work with number of our european ally and ally far

with my hon friend pension forfeiture for ex armed force personnel be rare it be usually reserve for case of serious criminal activity and those with serious criminal conviction but be it not time

asylum accommodation gosport deserve so much well will the secretary of state meet to discuss much more innovative future for this important order have lot of sympathy but please we have to be bit quick otherwise nobody else will get in be happy to meet the hon member to discuss the opportunity to use the defence estate to contribute to growth in every part of the country include hers how will the government ensure that cammell laird shipbuilding expertise and workforce be fully integrate into the defence industrial strategy in order to both strengthen sovereign capability and support skilled job in the north west there be real expertise in and opportunity for our shipyard nationwide both those that support royal navy military vessel and those that spend much of their time work on royal fleet auxiliary vessel which be the backbone of the royal navy fleet there be real opportunity in not just shipbuilde but ship repair would be happy to meet my hon friend to discuss those opportunity give that the labour conference will soon take place in liverpool perhaps can pop over and see she for many veteran hear loss be one of the hide scar of service and in number of case it have be link to defective hearing equipment will the minister use their art of persuasion on the prime minister to ensure an independent inquiry so that we can find out the extent of this and see whether any other equipment be involve and how we can prevent it from happen again anyone with hear loss from equipment can absolutely apply for compensation through the war pension scheme or the armed force compensation scheme broad work be happen on those specific bit of capability outside this place welcome the five new defence technical excellence college just announce but we need skill pathway right across the country have be work with ads on defence curriculum that could be deliver across college and university nationwide what plan do the minister have to support defence learning right across the country and will he meet and ads to see if we can roll out trial my hon friend be simply prolific in the area in which she be seek to improve defence and would be very happy to meet she to discuss this far there will be an announcement on skill in the defence industrial strategy that be come out this afternoon there be real opportunity to expand this work not just in defence technical education college but in institution nationwide will the secretary of state guarantee yes or no that no british serviceman or veteran will face prosecution for action take in northern ireland while serve their country as have be mention as we go through the process we will ensure that protection be in place to look after our veteran the reality be be be really honest that if people break the law they will be hold accountable but assure the hon member that veteran who serve will be protect young people in my constituency be cry out for decent well pay job especially in the defence sector so will the secretary of state agree to meet to discuss the typhoon order that be desperately need not only for our country but for job across blackpool and lancashire will indeed and my hon friend will be encourage hope by the visit pay to turkey and the initial agreement that have sign with turkey for big new order of typhoons which will be build in lancashire look forward to the order palestine action proscription and protests before we come to the urgent question should remind hon member to avoid refer directly to criminal case that be currently before the court there be also an active application for judicial review relate to the proscription of palestine action have decide to grant waiver in relation to that case as it concern matter of public order in which there be significant public interest member may therefore refer to that case urgent question to ask if the home secretary will make statement on the proscription of palestine action and public protest anyone who wish to demonstrate about the humanitarian situation in gaza or the action of any government include our own have the absolute freedom to gather with other and voice their view provide that they do so within the law but support palestine and support proscribe terrorist organisation be not the same thing the vitally important issue of palestinian right should not be co opt by one organisation that have show that it be willing to use violence in pursuit of its cause the clear advice and intelligence give to the then home secretary early this year be that palestine action satisfy the relevant test in the terrorism act and should be proscribe some of those hold placard in support of palestine action may not know the extent of its activity it have conduct an escalate campaign involve intimidation and sustained criminal damage include to britain national security infrastructure some of its attack have involve the use of weapon result in alleged violence and serious injury to individual palestine action member have be charge with violent disorder grievous bodily harm with intent actual bodily harm criminal damage and aggravate burglary charge that include in the assessment of the independent crown prosecution service terrorism connection these be not the action of legitimate protest group and for government to ignore expert security assessment advice and recommendation would be highly irresponsible be there to be far serious attack or injury question would rightly be ask about why action have not be take the metropolitan police have confirm that total of arrest be make at demonstration in central london on saturday most of those be under section of the terrorism act for display article in support of palestine action thirty three people be arrest for other offence include assault on police officer as the metropolitan police have point out that be in stark contrast to the people who peacefully march and attend the palestine solidarity campaign demonstration demonstration of this scale require significant policing response the new home secretary join the commissioner of the metropolitan police on saturday to observe the force operation and express her backing for the officer work tirelessly to enforce our law and to maintain order the fact that some officer be subject to violence and abuse be utterly shameful it be completely understandable that people rightly feel very strongly about the situation in gaza but support or be member of proscribe terrorist organisation be criminal offence and will never be acceptable regardless of the wide context we all want the suffering in gaza to end and the remain hostage to be return we all want to see peace say to the house that we must keep our focus squarely on achieve those aim and not on one harmful group that refuse to abide by our law and threaten our public safety order do not know who be do the speech but be go to crack down on ministers and shadow ministers if they do not keep to three minute have to get back benchers in do the minister agree to stick to the time in the future indicate assent thank you be glad that there be some acknowledgment nearly people have now be arrest because of concern about proscription there be clearly problem with violence and intimidation in our politic and we have to get this right because public confidence be fall too be not here as supporter or defender of palestine action and its tactic condemn without hesitation abuse intimidation and attack on the police and any political opponent the case for act on the group itself be and be strong we have see pattern of violence at its event and it have not dissociate itself from that violence but we also see police and refugee be target for violence alongside those who want to protest about immigration matter banner that say kill em all let god sort em out neo nazi group circle we can not ignore the impact on police on our street because of these incident but this be just not sustainable for our police or our criminal justice system there be difference between people protest use violence and people protest the use of proscription if we do not get the response right if we continue to arrest those in that secondary category the seriousness of the term terrorism risk lose its meaning and become dilute rather than strengthen proscription be suppose to be about stop those incite direct harm and violence go after somebody with poster test the boundary of liberty many of whom be clear that they do not support palestine action but feel strongly about palestinian right or free speech confuse rather than clarify the government intention people must be able to protest what be happen in gaza and the focus should be on what be happen in palestine not parliament square ask for this urgent question because think it be for we to act legislation on public order focus on specific act proscription order target specific terrorist group nothing sit in between give that what discussion have the minister have with the police about distinguish between member of palestine action and people concern about proscription itself interruption the offence of recklessly encourage support of proscribe group run counter to that focus on criminality if he will not abolish that offence will he at least set out guidance to the crown prosecution service and the police on any public interest test in use it the previous policing minister order this be what happen grant the urgent question because think it be important to hear you and you be advise that it be two minute think you have now finish or be about to do apologise mr speaker be advise that it be three minute but that be my fault terrorism be different from terrorising opponent but both should be criminal offence will the minister commit to review of that section so that we can get it right for the sake of our democracy order believe the advice be correct to two minute interruption that be correct do not want my department to be blame be genuinely grateful to my hon friend for bring these issue to the house they be important and it be right that minister be hold accountable for they be sure that the whole house will agree with my hon friend remark about violence and intimidation which have absolutely no place in our politic she will be aware that there be significant body of work take place across government co ordinated by the defend democracy taskforce to ensure that all our elect representative be able to do their duty and represent their constituent without fear or favour the government take that very seriously indeed my hon friend make number of point and will struggle to respond to all of they she will understand that the police be operationally independent of government but of course we remain in regular contact it be important to take this opportunity to thank the police for their important work they come under huge amount of scrutiny rightly so but think we see at the weekend an impeccable police operation in which brave officer stand and do their duty at least of whom be allegedly assault in the line of duty the final thing to say to my hon friend relate to draw the distinction as she will well understand on the absolute right of anybody in our country to express their concern about the desperately difficult situation in the middle east and more specifically in gaza the ability to go to the street and join other in express individual or collective concern about unfold event be they in this country or far afield be cornerstone of our democracy this government would never do anything to get in the way of that it be interesting that ten of thousand of people take to the street this weekend and be able to express their concern in an entirely lawful way my hon friend ask about whether we be seek to review any element of the terrorism act it be worth point she to the recently publish article by jonathan hall kc the independent reviewer of terrorism legislation who say with regard to tackle palestine action that there be no way ordinary criminal law would be effective against funding training and recruitment the government must ensure public safety and that be what we will seek to do call the shadow home secretary we in common hope with everyone in this house fully and unequivocally support the right to peaceful protest include on issue in the middle east whether the hostage who remain captive or civilian in gaza whose plight concern we all however in exercise that right to protest violence be never acceptable palestine action have commit deliberate criminal damage against various premise use sledgehammer to attack police officer and deliberately sabotage raf plane no matter how strongly people feel about an issue and whatever the right and wrong of that issue use violence to advance political agenda be never acceptable it be not how we do thing in this country we settle thing through debate and election the security minister have give the house assurance about the necessity of this measure have not be brief or be offer briefing on that but the minister command widespread respect across the house and member will take his assurance seriously will he give an assurance that the police be take all possible preventive action against palestine action where it may be plan future attack against premise or future act of violence include use the offence of conspiracy to commit public nuisance under which the police have wide range power join the minister in extend my thank to the police for the difficult work they do keep we safe finally will use this opportunity to express my support for protest that take place on sunday in parliament square and the campaign against antisemitism march which address it be regrettable that neither the home secretary nor senior minister address that march so will the security minister take the opportunity to express the government resolve to combat antisemitism wherever it be find be grateful to the shadow home secretary for his remark and the tone of they on his final point yes let take the opportunity on behalf of his majesty government to state our absolute abhorrence of antisemitism wherever it rear its ugly head hope he know that the government will do everything we possibly can to stand against the force of racism wherever they seek to rear their ugly head completely agree with the right hon gentleman that violence be never acceptable in pursue political agenda and be pleased that we be able to establish consensus across the house in that regard on his point about briefing we brief the shadow minister ahead of the proscription action back in july and as he know would be happy to brief he on privy council term whenever he should wish be also able to give he the assurance that he seek about the work the police be do as former home office minister he know that the police be operationally independent but assure he that the police will be take all necessary measure to guard against future attack be happy to speak to he about those matter far and be grateful for his support for these matter today as understand conviction simply for display the name of proscribe group have be extremely rare unless there have be clear evidence of intent to promote group more extreme action if that be the case and as it be clear that the act of protest and civil disobedience see in recent day be not act that would ordinarily form part of case for proscription why do the police not simply stop the arrest take the opportunity to acknowledge the difficult job that the police do in my experience recently and over long period the police have do an excellent job often under very difficult circumstance it be important that we consider proportionality these operational judgment have to be make by the police often on the ground and often under pressure or in difficult circumstance it be also important that we consider that we would not tolerate the kind of activity that we have see in recent day and week from an organisation that be motivate for example by islamist extremism or by an extreme right wing ideology similarly we can not tolerate that activity from palestine action and this government will support the police in do the difficult job that we have ask they to do call the liberal democrat spokesperson the right to peaceful protest be cornerstone of liberal democracy but event over the weekend have set dangerous precedent and risk have chilling impact on free speech and legitimate protest in the uk the arrest of protester under terror law follow hundred of arrest under the same power last month be deeply alarming the lib dems warn that that would be exactly what happen when the conservatives expand terrorism power in there be no doubt that those use violence antisemitic abuse or hate speech must face the consequence but those crime be already cover by exist law it can not be right that simply display placard in support of proscribe organisation while peacefully protest can result in conviction and up to six month in prison will the minister urgently review terrorism legislation specifically as it be impact the right to protest peacefully to ensure it be proportionate and contain the nuance that it so clearly need be grateful to the hon lady as always for the sensible and reasonable tone in which she make her remark but have to say that do not agree that the event of this weekend have have chilling effect on our democracy think it be quite the opposite ten of thousand of people come to london to exercise their absolute right to demonstrate on matter about which they be concern the overwhelming majority of people who come to london be able to do so in an entirely reasonable and lawful way only very tiny minority be not able to do so in that way and deliberately seek to get arrest the hon lady ask entirely reasonably about necessity and proportionality and about whether the government intend to review exist legislation she have raise that point previously we have discuss it and know that the leader of her party the right hon member for kingston and surbiton ed davey raise it over the summer recess of course we look very carefully at legislation but the government do not currently have any plan to amend the exist legislation not least in the light of the ongoing criminal proceeding relate to palestine action and the ongoing judicial review it would not be appropriate to carry out review at this time we think that the uk counter terrorism legislation strike the right balance between protect national security and individual freedom include the right to the freedom of expression under article of the european convention on human right the hon member for hazel grove know the high regard in which hold jonathan hall the independent reviewer of terrorism legislation and she know that the legislative framework be subject to independent statutory oversight by the independent reviewer the government will of course consider any recommendation that he seek to make have advise the hon lady previously to get in touch with he think that she have and know that she will want to look very carefully at what he say those arrest be merely hold sign wear shirt and display general support for group that do not come close to the loose definition of terrorism meanwhile political pundit and columnist seem free to discuss palestine action without fear of criminal prosecution do not think that anyone should face arrest for do that but it do not seem fair that people can get away with it as long as they be do it in front of tv camera will the minister explain how the law be be apply whether it be be apply fairly and where people be allow to show support for palestine action it be clear that some people be be allow to do it but other be not my hon friend have long stand interest in and concern about these matter give she an absolute assurance that the law be be apply fairly say to she know that she will agree with this that nobody be above the law it be important to think about how we collectively seek to respond to those who behave in similar way but underpin by very different cause such as extreme islamist terrorism or an extreme right wing ideology if people be demonstrate on behalf of those organisation in the same way that we have see people demonstrate in support of palestine action think people would absolutely want the police to act in the way that they see they act over the weekend say again the law be be apply fairly nobody be above the law and the police need to be able to ensure that they be able to enforce it without fear or favour and that be what think they do over the weekend call the chair of the home affairs committee the burden of police these protest be fall on certain force more than other that be also the case during the disorder last summer can the minister give some reassurance that the home office be provide the support that be need to those force to ensure that they can manage the protest and so that their do so do not distract from day to day policing the chair of the select committee make an important point yes can give she the assurance that she seek the right hon lady be right that recent activity have provide particular burden on particular force the home secretary and and of course the policing minister and colleague right across government work very closely with the police and we will ensure that they have the necessary resource for the important job that they have to do last august police officer be hospitalise after be hit with sledgehammer while respond to palestine action attack on business near bristol fact that be absent from our debate when we vote to proscribe that organisation recently the attacker have sledgehammer axis whip and other home make weapon do the minister agree that that cross the line of any legitimate protest into terrorism yes would the minister have say that no one be above the law and that violence be never the answer agree with he and know that he believe that the law should be wield with integrity so when be we go to see the proscription of violent settler group in the west bank many of whom be perpetrate reign of terror on innocent palestinians in that part of the world but who may be garner support and raise fund in the united kingdom the right hon gentleman be an experienced member of this house and have serve as minister in the home office so be sorry to have to put my response to he in this way but he will understand why do so we never comment about matter relate to future proscription know that his word will have be hear by colleague in other government departments as well as in my department he make his point with great consistency he have raise they with previously but know that he will understand that there be long stand protocol across number of government that we do not talk about future proscription activity thank the minister for his response to the urgent question but concur with some of the comment from my hon friend the member for walthamstow ms creasy about people be arrest include my constituent some of whom be protest peacefully want to come back to the issue of the impact on frontline policing as central london mp be see resource be draw away from my local police to deal with the protest my constituent want those frontline police officer to be solve crime on their street the minister will understand the sheer scale of their concern about ensure the police can get to grip with that locally return to the point make by the chair of the home affairs committee will the minister assure that those ongoing discussion with the police be happen include with the chair of the metropolitan police federation who say on the world at one today that the protest be not sustainable my hon friend raise very important point as do the chair of the home affairs committee she will absolutely understand the importance that this government attach to the safe street agenda can give she an assurance that we be work very closely with the metropolitan police and other police force around the country to ensure that they have the resource they need to police these kind of protest and activity alongside the other activity that they be require to police the home secretary the policing minister and take these matter very seriously we meet senior representative of the metropolitan police just last week but give my hon friend an absolute assurance that we will ensure that the police have the necessary resource to do the job that we ask they to do give the scale of arrest over the weekend and the minister state that he have no intention to review legislation will he commit instead to an independent review of the use of terrorism legislation against people peacefully protest to see if it be fit for purpose be grateful to the hon lady for her question hope that she hear the response give moment ago that it would not be appropriate to get into review process at this particular moment because of ongoing legal proceeding we be incredibly fortunate to have jonathan hall kc as the independent reviewer of terrorism legislation he bring weight of authority and credibility to the process know that he have particular view on the issue and invite she and other member to look closely at what he have say about it do the minister agree that the continue mass arrest of peaceful protester many of whom be protest about the proscription of palestine action but would not for moment support the activity of palestine action be something that we should distinguish and that we should advise prosector and the police about not least because the furore around the arrest risk drown out the rightful protest about the difficult situation in palestine and gaza to which the minister have refer my hon friend raise some really important point for clarity it be an offence to display support for palestine action but it be not an offence to criticise the government decision to proscribe so difficult judgment often have to be make by the police on the ground let give she categorical assurance that this government will do nothing to get in the way of somebody absolute right to protest about matter about which they be concerned in many respect it be incredibly heartening to see ten of thousand of people take to the street to express their concern in an entirely peaceful and lawful way and hope that will long continue as have indicate previously have my doubt about whether the terrorism label be most suited to group that be certainly criminal certainly violent and arguably seditious in its attack on the asset of our military but have positive suggestion to make will the minister undertake fully to brief the chairman and member of the intelligence and security committee which use to chair but on which now no long serve if they be able to see information that the minister can not share publicly and say to we that they be satisfied with the terrorism designation for one would find that reassuring be always very grateful to the right hon gentleman who speak with real wisdom about these matter and can give he those assurance we have be in contact with the committee which he use to chair it consist of some incredibly experienced and wise parliamentarian and we seek to take their counsel at every opportunity so yes we have engage with they and will continue to do so on this matter and other while palestine action wag its campaign of intimidation and go about damage military basis with very little impact in the middle east this week the government will host president abbas and president herzog for discussion on more peaceful future for palestinians and israelis alike do the minister agree that unlike palestine action this government be actually take genuine and serious step to support peace in the middle east be grateful to my hon friend for his comment and completely agree think there be an absolute point of consensus in this place and hope much far afield about the urgent need to secure peace in the middle east this government lead by the prime minister the foreign secretary and colleague in the foreign commonwealth and development office will do everything we possibly can to support that important process the optic of octogenarian priest be arrest alongside hundred of peaceful protester be absolutely awful for this government we have only three arrest over the weekend in scotland because police scotland seem to deploy much more conciliatory and community base approach do the minister support operational independence across the uk if police force feel it be in their interest to have different policing arrangement from the metropolitan police will he support they and say that there will be no government interference in their operation be grateful to the hon gentleman for his engagement over the course of the summer can give he an absolute assurance yes of course we believe in the absolute importance of the operational independence of the police they have to make some very difficult judgment but hope he agree that nobody should be above the law there be not an age limitation with regard to these offence the police have difficult judgment to make but in the main they have act proportionately and without fear or favour in the good tradition of british policing this weekend alone almost people several of whom be from my constituency be arrest the terrorism act be not bring in to arrest vicar retired grandmother and nhs consultant for hold placard yet the police be now in the position where that be exactly what they be do weekend after weekend will the minister consider the view of international human right expert like the un human rights commissioner who have describe the ban as disproportionate and unnecessary will he also acknowledge our concern that political decision must be open to political challenge otherwise we risk massive loss of confidence in our democracy completely agree with the point about political challenge that be why we be here today to debate the decision and the policing around it hope my hon friend will understand that the government have act in good faith as we always seek to do the advice that the government receive be clear and unambiguous palestine action be concern in terrorism and its member have demonstrate willingness or intention to conduct in pursuit of its cause serious violence against person under those particular circumstance the government have responsibility and duty to act as have mention previously and my hon friend will know the independent reviewer of terrorism legislation have be widely quote about his response to the action that the government have take he conclude in recent article that there be no way that ordinary criminal law would have be effective against this organisation do the minister agree that while in this case proscription may be finely balanced decision the law must be uphold whether you like it or not whoever you be and wherever you be do he therefore share my concern that in this case there appear to be some regional disparity in the interpretation of the law as evidence by the different rate at which people be arrest across this country at the weekend as always be grateful to the right hon gentleman for his question and acknowledge his assessment of the decision as be finely balanced as know he will understand should this or any government have take different approach we would no doubt have be in this chamber debate why the government have decide to not proscribe these be difficult judgment but under the circumstance have describe the then home secretary do exactly the right thing in take the decision she do as for the right hon gentleman point about regional disparity he will have hear the comment make just moment ago about the operational independence of the police however if he have see particular occurrence that he think be not in that spirit ask he to write to would be very happy to look at they so many people myself include be look at the famine in gaza and the plan annexation of the west bank with sense of complete desperation and lack of agency people want to demonstrate that desperation through peaceful protest and it be difficult for many of we to see the mass arrest of people hold placard understand that the nature of proscription mean that show support for proscribe organisation be criminal offence but the act be peaceful and the cause be so desperate at the time of voting the effect of arrest demonstrator be not make clear to we we must reflect again on the effect of proscription when assess whether to proscribe palestine action to what extent do the government take into account the right to free expression and free association include under article and of the european convention on human right not the right of the proscribe organisation itself but of the wide cohort who will be criminalise for peacefully express support for it of course agree with my hon friend point about peaceful protest and can give he an absolute assurance that in take this or any decision the home secretary act on advice and very carefully consider range of different factor he be right to talk about peaceful protest peaceful protest take place in london over the course of this weekend which be very good to see but at the particular demonstration at which there be significant number of arrest people be also arrest for separate offence include allege assault on police officer none of we want to see that kind of violent activity we will work closely with the police to ensure people have the ability to protest in peaceful way that be cornerstone of our democracy but it be entirely unacceptable that anybody should seek to assault police officer hear the distinction that the minister be attempt to make but the fact remain that almost largely peaceful protester be arrest in london this weekend be sure that when we look back on this we be go to conclude that it be not only huge waste of police resource but chilling moment for free speech in this country give that the government seem so convinced that these people be associate with terrorism will they commit to publish datum on what proportion of those arrest be actually charge with terrorism relate offence say to the hon gentleman hopefully in constructive way that the only distinction be seek to make be between those who break the law and those who do not we see very interesting comparison over the course of this weekend ten of thousand of people come to protest and be able to do so express their concern about the terrible situation in gaza without support proscribe organisation as say in my early remark there be big difference between be able to protest in support of legitimate cause and express support for proscribe organisation that be criminal offence and the police have an absolute duty to enforce the law which be what they do nobody be above the law yet the metropolitan police report that total of people be arrest under section of the terrorism act at the weekend the vast majority for simply hold placard state oppose genocide support palestine action can the minister confirm whether the government have receive any legal advice concern the implication of host visit by israeli president herzog in relation to the uk genocide convention responsibility particularly give his recent record of state that there be no innocent civilian in gaza and personally sign artillery shell destine for use in gaza will any visa application make by the israeli president to visit the uk this week be reject or will he be subject to police investigation if he do arrive understand why my hon friend have ask that question hope that he will understand that he be ask about matter for which do not have ministerial responsibility he will also understand that the government receive range of legal advice across range of different departments the purpose of this particular response today be to look at the issue of proscription and the recent protest activity can give he and the house an absolute assurance that this be government who believe in uphold the law this be government who believe in the importance of international law and we will work with our ally and partner to ensure that international law and domestic law be uphold on this day year ago three found member of plaid cymru hand themselves in after burn the raf bombing school at penyberth today they and all their supporter would likely be brand terrorist for non violent direct action lump palestine action with maniacs murder cult and russian imperial movement be calculate cynical and disproportionate it have lead to the arrest of hundred if not thousand of protester what do the minister think will be the consequence now that his government look more interested in silence protest than maintain police by consent struggle to follow the logic of the right hon lady question give that ten of thousand of people be absolutely able to express their democratic right to protest over the course of this weekend be sure she would have see that hope she will understand that this government have not do anything that interfere with anybody lawful right to express their concern about an issue just to pick up on one other point that she make let give she an absolute assurance that we do not group the three proscribe organisation together for the reason she be completely mistaken she have ask question and she might want to listen to the answer there be two reason why that decision be take frankly the first be that this be government with busy legislative agenda and we need to be efficient with precious parliamentary time the second and perhaps more important reason be that this government do not look at the ideological origin of the threat we will do what we need to do to keep the public safe regardless of where the threat come from that be the right approach it be even handed and it be on that basis that we proceed in recent week number of my constituent in stroud have be arrest many of they be over and the whole situation seem to have become slightly ridiculous do the minister agree that proscribing be use sledgehammer to crack nut with great respect and do not mean to be flippant think it be rather unfortunate use of sledgehammer give previous event no do not agree with my hon friend think the action of the government have be necessary and proportionate for the reason explain early worry that there be number of people who seek to express support for an organisation who do not fully understand the activity that that organisation have engage in in recent time mr justice chamberlain grant the judicial review on the basis that the home secretary have not consult palestine action before proscribe it the judge rule that it be reasonably arguable that there be duty to consult palestine action before proscribe it as report in the guardian if organisation meet high standard and high threshold for proscription under the terrorism act why should there be duty to consult that organisation before proscribe it hope the hon gentleman understand that give that there be ongoing legal proceeding it would be completely inappropriate for to comment on any legal ruling or judgment that have be make but can give he an assurance that when it come to make this decision all the necessary legal and expert advice be consider very carefully there be formal process that enable any organisation that be proscribe to seek legal right to redress and the government be very supportive of any organisation that have be proscribe pursue legal avenue of appeal it be the right of any such organisation to do so and this government would never get in the way of that legal right do my hon friend agree that this be not case of people democratic right to protest be curtail the democratically elect government and parliament have legislate member have proscribe palestine action lawfully and now police enforce the law free from political interference the law be clear people be no long allow to support this organisation and to do so risk lawful arrest do my hon friend far agree that there be nothing to stop people protest in support of the palestinians or against this israeli government as long as they so do peacefully and within the law completely agree with all my hon friend point he know and know and be sure the house know that have the government take different decision would be stand here at the dispatch box seek to justify that decision as well may ask the minister to reflect for moment on the fact that this be the large number of people arrest since the terrorism act come into force those people who be protest on saturday be protest at the horror of the genocide in gaza and british complicity in it through arm sale and military co operation and support they be deeply concerned about civil liberty in our society and feel that the legislation rush through this parliament damage their right to civil peaceful protest in our society the minister know that the weight of history be against he he know that at some point the government will have to review this legislation because otherwise the situation will simply get bad and bad can he not just bring himself to say now that the government will look at it again review the whole situation and rather than proscribe peaceful protest in our society accept that we have history behind we that bring we all here and be build on protest and dissent the right hon gentleman have be member of this house for very very long time so he will know that this legislation be not rush through parliament it come through parliament in the same way that other proscription action have come through over many many year let seek perhaps two point of consensus the first involve freedom of speech do not know what the right hon gentleman be up to at the weekend but have sneaking suspicion that he may have be on the street of london and good luck to he it be his absolute democratic right to protest in the way in which he be well know for do the government have do nothing to stand in the way of he and his colleague in that regard let however say one more thing to he although he and may disagree on many thing hope that as supporter of the trade union movement we agree on the importance of people safety in the workplace he ask to consider something perhaps should ask he to consider the importance of safeguard people safety and security in the workplace which be not matter to which the organisation that we be discuss today have give much consideration hundred of people have now be arrest for terror offence face up to year imprisonment for no more than peacefully hold placard most be elderly and many be healthcare worker priest and ordinary work people all be prepared to risk severe punishment for do what our government have fail to do the proscription of palestine action be an authoritarian attack on the right to protest it be absurd unworkable and unsustainable will the minister and the new home secretary consider the government position this government and the new home secretary will do everything that be necessary and proportionate to keep the public safe these be difficult judgment that require very careful consideration very careful consideration be give to the decision that be take and it be motivate by very strong desire and responsibility to keep the public safe may thank and congratulate the police for arrest successfully so many hundred of people who break the law and shockingly support proscribe terror group do the minister expect they to be charge and prosecute to ensure we have proper deterrent against support proscribe terror group let first join the hon gentleman in thank the police for the important work that they do it be absolutely shameful that there be assault on member of the police do their job in london this weekend that be totally unacceptable and rather undermine the credibility of those who say that these be entirely peaceful protest with regard to the hon gentleman other point hope he will understand that these be matter for the crown prosecution service which be independent of government so it would not be appropriate for to comment on they but share the concern that he have express abhor the method of palestine action and indeed any violence in the course of protest but understand that four group have be de proscribe in the last year be sure that the aim be for all ban group to de escalate and become legitimate protest group so what step or evidence would be require for palestine action to be de proscribe in the future be grateful to my hon friend for his thoughtful and sensible question there be formal legal process to be follow as say in response to an early question the government completely understand that any organisation that be proscribe have an absolute legal right to contest that decision this government will not stand in the way of that legal process and we will respond in reasonable and responsible way there be legal appeal under way that will run its course and then we will have legal ruling the government will of course abide by that many member of my community be arrest in london on saturday include senior priest an elderly jewish man and teacher who have spend year with gazan child and have witness the horror of see they kill by israeli troop over the last couple of year these people be not terrorist while be sure all member of the house agree that anybody attack serve police officer in the street deserve to be arrest do the minister accept that the use of counter terror power be wholly disproportionate to the peaceful action that these people take by simply hold sign and set dangerous precedent for free speech do not accept the hon lady critique about the precedent with regard to free speech for the reason that have already reference and because ten of thousand of people be on the street of london this weekend express their free speech the police have difficult judgment to make do not accept her analysis that this be not proportionate the government have an absolute responsibility to act when the evidence suggest that we need to take decision to secure public safety which be what the government have do we stand by that decision and we will work with the police to ensure that people obey the law where they do not regardless of their age or professional background be afraid there have to be consequence many of those arrest over the weekend for simply hold placard be old and disabled citizen and human right activist who can hardly be describe as terrorist consider that the un human right chief have warn that proscription dangerously conflate protest with terrorism do the minister accept that we at least run some risk of suppress protest and dissent through which we obtain many of the freedom that we enjoy today really do not think that that be the case at every stage of these proceeding the government have be absolutely clear about the important right the cornerstone of our democracy of people to protest about matter about which they be concerned this government have not do anything to get in the way or prevent people from do that we see that this weekend ten of thousand of people have their say they be able to do so in way that be lawful and do not require they to be arrest because they have not break the law do not accept the analysis that this have chilling effect on free speech quite the opposite think it absolutely demonstrate that people can come and demonstrate in lawful way and that the police will respond in an appropriate manner it be shame that the home secretary could not come here today to defend her government over people have be arrest since this labour government proscribe non violent direct action group for the first time in british history include elderly people disabled people priest nhs worker and the child of holocaust survivor the un high commissioner for human rights have condemn this proscription as disproportionate and unnecessary warn that it risk create far chilling effect will the minister finally admit that his government get it wrong and that they have threaten and undermine our free speech and right to protest and will they review and immediately lift this ban first the home secretary be meet our five eyes ally who be here for the five country ministerial that be incredibly important work in secure our alliance with our united states canadian australian and new zealand ally these be important partnership that this government value and that this home secretary be invest in on almost her first full day in office on the other point the hon lady seek to raise she have an absolute right as everybody do to protest in lawful way there be nothing that this government have do to prevent she or anybody else from do that what this government have do be ensure that we be well place to protect the public be sorry that she do not agree with that that be her absolute right but maintain that support for freedom of speech be cornerstone of our democracy and this government will always enable people to have their say absolutely condemn any action or violence take against the public or indeed the police however write to the former home secretary twice on this matter because many legislator here have yet to see evidence that satisfy we about the proportionality of the proscription of palestine action and how the government balance that with the public right to protest and freedom of speech could encourage the minister to review this law not least because it have an impact contrary to what the government want in that the more arrest there be the more it draw attention to palestine action entirely understand why the hon lady may wish to raise concern in the way she have she make an important point about evidence and give she an assurance that we have put into the public domain all the evidence we have be able to hope she will understand that there be strict limitation on some thing we be able to say for variety of reason not least that there be ongoing police investigation and ongoing criminal proceeding that limit the ability of ministers to talk about this issue but within those constraint we have try to be as clear as we possibly can about the reason for this decision on number of occasion the previous home secretary and have lay out the reason why we take this decision order urge the minister to be bit more succinct in his response hundred of peaceful protester have be arrest this weekend in the name of national security but in what way do peaceful protester tactic of hold banner compromise national security if the aim of national security be fundamentally to ensure that we can live in free society where our democratic freedom be protect can the minister not see that the mass arrest of peaceful protester be an authoritarian measure that undermine not protect those freedom completely acknowledge that the concern the hon member have express be entirely genuine and well meaning hope he understand the importance that we attach to the rule of law we do not think that people should be except from the rule of law because they be of particular age have disability or have particular professional background that would be entirely unfair nobody be above the law the police have difficult job to do to police these protest gently say to he that the protest we see over the weekend be not entirely peaceful with other arrest include for assault on police officer hope that none of we want to see that activity in our capital or anywhere else for that matter thank the minister for his answer and fully agree that there can be no place for violence in our politic however do he accept that elderly retired priest and disabled veteran would not be protest in the way they be if they genuinely believe that palestine action be similar organisation to isis or al qaeda can he provide any additional guidance or advice on how member of the public can legitimately protest against the proscription of this organisation first let say to the hon gentleman that neither the government nor be seek to make the comparison he offer what we do believe be that people should follow the law it be criminal offence to seek to support proscribe group the police be do the job of ensure the law be enforce again make the comparison that if it be people protest about other organisation extreme right wing ideological or islamist organisation then certain commentator not in this place but outside it would seek to view the matter in different way we have to be even handed and fair and that be what we have seek to be nobody would support the violent action of some of the people in palestine action of course but the number of arrest be place huge pressure on our police the demographic of those arrest be clearly absurd the nature of what they be do be hold placard in response to the horror they be see on their television we be all in this house see those horror the previous home secretary say that many of the people who support the group do not know the nature of the more violent element of it give the apparent imbalance of what we be see be the minister not concerned that it create dangerous precedent when in future we try to enforce against people who be actually terrorist and have malign intent on our street as have say previously understand the concern that be be express the hon gentleman refer to somebody hold placard they be hold placard that express support for proscribe organisation and that be criminal offence in an answer give just moment ago say that the government be limit in term of the detail they can provide about the activity of palestine action for the reason have explain if people be consider seek to protest and provide their support for this proscribe organisation invite they to look very carefully at what that organisation have be engage in there have be significant reporting about some of those activity that might focus the mind of those who seek to support they in future the more than people who have be arrest include blind veteran elderly people nhs worker and even the child of holocaust survivor yet the government be intent on aid and abet israeli of they will be exhibit in london this week at the arm fair alongside roll out the carpet stain with the blood of the child of gaza for the president of israel why be non violent protester be treat with great punishment than government bombing and starve million of child do the minister agree that if there be real justice the government would arrest the israeli leadership and send they to the international criminal court hope very much that there be consensus across the house about the desperate situation in gaza and the middle east hope the hon gentleman will understand that the government will do everything they can to work with partner and ally to seek to bring resolution to that desperate situation he refer to the age of the protester just say to he that the law have to be apply fairly and universally therefore if someone be of particular age that do not enable they to break the law in the same way that it would not enable someone of young age to do so with over people arrest this weekend proscribe palestine action clearly have not work as intend will the government urgently review our terrorism legislation to ensure that those who legitimately protest in favour of the palestinian cause be not treat as terrorist for simply wear shirt or hold placard refer the hon gentleman to the remark that have be publish recently by the independent reviewer of terrorism legislation can the minister tell what safeguard if any be in place to ensure that terrorism power be not misuse against people exercise their democratic right to protest peacefully against proscription include elderly vicar hold placard that be an entirely fair challenge that be precisely why we have jonathan hall kc the independent reviewer of terrorism legislation look at these matter very closely an expert in this field who be entirely independent from government there be respect for he across the house the government certainly hugely value his opinion would ask the hon lady to look carefully at what he have say on these matter sixteen hundred individual mainly senior citizen have be arrest the minister will understand that this be not just big operation but one that involve taxpayer money with million of pound spend on arrest and no doubt million spend on legal aid if people be prosecute in our court system will the minister release the legal advice upon which this proscription take place so that the public can see whether taxpayer money be be use effectively there be process in place when the home secretary make decision on proscription as part of that process she will of course consider legal advice as well as advice from expert right across government and law enforcement can give the hon gentleman the assurance that these decision be not take lightly no government and no home secretary would seek to take these decision lightly and the previous home secretary certainly do not do so our free speech be protect under the european convention on human right and we should view with great suspicion anybody who would remove the united kingdom signature from that convention this government proscription of palestine action have lead to the arrest of more than peaceful protester another assault on freedom of expression urge the government to review these power which also risk undermine our anti terrorism law the hon gentleman will have hear the response give early to question on that specific point would gently say to he that police officer be assault over the weekend and while completely understand why people want to refer to non violent protest and completely accept that the majority of people be behave in non violent way hope that he and other will join with in absolutely condemn any attack on the police that take place over the weekend thank the minister for all his answer be and be pleased to see step to ensure that protester who be outside the realm of peaceful protest and demonstrate support for proscribe organisation be deal with in term that line up with the law palestine action illegal street protest be impact the police ability to do their normal job do the minister believe there be enough police officer to deal with more of these scenario and how will the government ensure that police on the ground in community be not sacrifice in order to police these protest the hon gentleman make an important point can give he an absolute assurance that we work very closely with the police to ensure that they have the resource they need and the necessary legislative framework in order to do their difficult job as he will understand from his own part of the world it be important that the police be able to enforce the law without fear or favour it be worth point out that the police work closely with organiser each week to facilitate safe lawful protest and know that they will continue to do so hundred of thousand of people have be able to make their voice hear while only very tiny minority have be arrest for break the law omar al bayoumi arrest and extradition urgent question to ask the minister of state for the home department if he will make statement on the arrest of saudi national omar al bayoumi and the failure to extradite mr al bayoumi for his alleged involvement in the september terror attack the attack on be an appalling assault on freedom we remember the courage display by the american people in the aftermath and in the year since ahead of the anniversary this week our thought remain with the victim and survivor as well as all who love they almost year on there be risk that we might forget the destructive and barbaric scale of the attack on would like to remind this house that the attack kill nearly innocent people injure thousand more and give rise to substantial long term health consequence for the victim the september attack be the deadly act of terrorism in human history would like to take this opportunity to remember every single one of the victim and their family in addition to the huge loss of life the attack also cause at least billion worth of infrastructure and property damage it would be inappropriate to comment on an individual case such as the one that the right hon gentleman raise as he will know it be also long stand government policy follow by successive government to neither confirm nor deny an arrest for the purpose of an extradition request the purpose of this policy be to protect the confidentiality of ongoing investigation reciprocate international good practice maintain trust and confidence between state and minimise the risk of fugitive escape justice it be always matter for the competent authority in request territory if they wish to make request for extradition to the uk there be an ongoing civil legal action in the united states and due to those ongoing legal proceeding the government be not able to comment far today the extradition process be formal international procedure where one country request another to return person accuse or convict of serious offence to stand trial or serve sentence the process typically begin with formal request from one country to another extradition from the uk be govern by the extradition act for all country outside the eu state to state system operate whereby request be send between government with decision making split between ministers and the uk court whether or not formal extradition arrangement be in place with the request state will determine how incoming request progress through the uk system there be many country where bilateral or multilateral treaty be in place however the uk can co operate with any country on an ad hoc basis through the special extradition arrangement provision in the act the home office have an operational case work unit the uk central authority which exercise the home secretary responsibility for non eu extradition to and from the uk for all incoming extradition request send to the uk from any country in the world the act require uk judge to decide whether the request person extradition would be compatible with their human right the uk unequivocally support the rule of law all individual request for extradition be consider individually by our independent court comply with the provision of the act yesterday edition of the sunday times reveal that in the aftermath of the metropolitan police be force to release omar al bayoumi who be believe to be saudi intelligence agent accuse of support the hijacker because the fbi withhold evidence arrest in birmingham day after al bayoumi be take to london to be interrogate by met counter terror officer the fbi decline to provide those officer with vital evidence of al bayoumi involvement in the evidence include hand draw aircraft diagram trajectory calculation match the pentagon attack and an address book with the attacker code name code name that bin laden himself do not disclose until year later the fbi refusal to disclose this evidence prevent al bayoumi extradition to the united states fbi record show that in al bayoumi meet two official from the saudi ministry of islamic affairs those official be assess to be part of network of individual connect with the facilitation of two attacker separate assessment by the fbi arabic specialist conclude that mr al bayoumi be co optee of the saudi general intelligence presidency which be its secret service full investigation by the intelligence and security committee be need it must investigate why the fbi clearly avoid extradite mr al bayoumi and exactly what be the involvement of the saudi government in particular their ministry of islamic affairs and secret service as the minister say it be nearly year since in that time we have extradite many innocent people to america but we fail to extradite someone who deserve to be send over there we need to get to the bottom of this in part so that we do not see this terrible atrocity happen again know that the right hon gentleman apply huge weight of judgment and consideration to these matter so completely understand why he seek to bring this matter to the house attention hope though that he understand that be very limited in what can say by way of response the right hon gentleman will remember do not think he will mind my saying that he have be around for quite long time that in we be operate under the extradition act as he have mention the sunday times have report that key document be not consider in when mr omar al bayoumi be subject to investigation in respect of the bombing in the united states of america the sunday times article suggest that the us do not pursue extradition in the right hon gentleman will understand that there be legal proceeding ongoing in the united states and that mean that be not able to say any more at this point hope that he and the house will understand the reason for that call the shadow secretary of state let start by congratulate my right hon friend the member for goole and pocklington david davis on secure the urgent question and the sunday times on its reporting as the minister say be one of the most sickening terrorist atrocity of our lifetime commit by islamist extremist yesterday piece in the sunday times raise serious question about the case of omar al bayoumi it appear that the uk police and the fbi have clear evidence that omar al bayoumi assist terrorist and have close link to the saudi government or element of the saudi government and indeed be their agent it be not say that just last week us district court judge george daniels sit in new york find there be reasonable evidence that two saudi citizen one of whom be al bayoumi be send by the saudi government to assist the hijacker that raise some extremely serious question that would like the security minister to answer gently say to he that the ongoing civil proceeding in new york by no mean preclude he from answer ask he not to hide behind that first why do the uk police release al bayoumi so quickly when they hold other suspect include someone in an adjacent cell for extended period in that case for five month secondly do the saudi government or the us government pressure the uk government to release al bayoumi early and not pursue the matter do the security minister agree with the judge that al bayoumi assist terrorist and that he be send by the saudi government to do so will the security minister release all the relevant document include those hold in the national archives will he look into this matter and report back to the house finally do he agree that the intelligence and security committee should urgently investigate this matter be grateful to the shadow home secretary for his remark he understandably reference the article in yesterday edition of the sunday times which accept raise number of important question that be absolutely worthy of scrutiny and deserving of the house attention give he an assurance that the government and as security minister will look closely at the matter raise in the context of the debate do not accept the point he make that we be seek to hide behind the legal proceeding take place in the us an article be publish in newspaper yesterday and give both the shadow home secretary and the right hon member for goole and pocklington david davis an assurance that we will look carefully at the detail contain within it the shadow home secretary also make reasonable point about the intelligence and security committee as an experienced member and former minister he will know that it be not for to direct the activity of the isc it be an independent committee and it be very much matter for the chair and the committee to decide what they wish to pursue however know the chair as do he will be well known to hon member right across the house would be surprised if he do not want to take look at it call the liberal democrat spokesperson ben maguire thank the minister for his update and echo his tribute to the victim of the appalling attack however after recent revelation about omar al bayoumi his alleged involvement with the saudi intelligence service and his link to the hijacker number of press question remain unanswered first why be british investigator not give access to all the evidence that the fbi hold include the capitol hill video and the aircraft sketch who in the uk government be brief about al bayoumi arrest at the time why be there no clear record of ministerial oversight do the saudi authority make representation to the uk government regard al bayoumi detention if so do this ultimately influence the decision to release he finally and most importantly what safeguard be now in place to make sure that crucial evidence from foreign intelligence agency can not be withhold from british counter terrorism investigation be grateful to the hon gentleman not least because he rightly raise the important point that we should always seek to remember and reflect on the sacrifice and the loss of the victim and survivor of terrorism he be right the victim and survivor of the horrific terrorist attack that have scarred community here and around the world must be remember this government take that incredibly seriously and in that spirit we have recently consult on the creation of national day for victim and survivor of terrorism it be vital that the day reflect the voice and experience of those who have be directly impact by terrorism offence the hon gentleman ask number of detailed question but will not be able to respond in detail to all of they for reason that have already outline can say that we will look closely at the matter that have be raise hope he see that there be reason why we can not get into the detail of this today but give he and the house and assurance that we will look closely at this my right hon friend the member for goole and pocklington david davis do the house service today in raise this important matter but there be wide issue associate with the extradition treaty with america the house will recall that the treaty be set up when sir tony blair be prime minister to address terrorism but in recent year it have controversially be use for much wide remit from time to time it have look as though commercial and national advantage be seek from it that suggest that the time may be right to review it will the minister look at the matter carefully and consider whether now be the time to do that agree with the right hon gentleman that this be an important matter with wide ramification will not commit to the formal review that he describe but commit to he and to the house that we will look carefully at the issue that have be raise and the point he make and will endeavour to come back to he and other on this issue as soon as possible do the minister accept that ever since the saudi nationality of the vast majority of the hijacker become know there have be deep suspicion about the role of the then saudi government in the atrocity that take place to what extent do the government believe that the nature and attitude of the saudi government have change over the past year hope that the right hon gentleman will understand that on this occasion want to look forward rather than back the united kingdom government hugely value the relationship that we have with saudi arabia and visit it relatively

funding to establish five defence technical excellence college so that we can promote to over school pupil the benefit of career in the defence industry and our new defence skill passport which will make it easy and fast for veteran and worker in other industry to move into the defence sector over the past few year defence firm have express grow concern about attend job fair the harassment and intimidation to which they have be subject have force company to cancel event on university campus the campaign to boycott and target defence firm misunderstand the purpose of deterrence we know the full measure of freedom and security in britain because of what our defence industry do the strategy will help the industry to attract the talent it need by create dedicated presence on the ucas website new defence apprenticeship and graduate clearing system and defence university alliance to strengthen career in the sector the war in ukraine remind we that innovation be the central pillar of deterrence to ensure that we meet our objective of well capability and increase growth we be committed to spend at least of our equipment budget on novel technology the newly establish uk defence innovation be back by million of ringfenced investment and have the authority to reallocate funding and resource ensure focus on priority and value for money today strategy outline how we will employ ukdi to rapidly produce technology that give our armed force an advantage we will set out the first of the innovation challenge that we want industry to go after as well as how we will well support firm in test their innovation this government inherit what the public accounts committee describe as broken procurement system for too long defence have be burden by waste delay and complexity yet today we know that whoever get technology to its frontline force the fast win we have prove that we can do it for ukraine now we must do it for britain our segmented approach to procurement set ambitious target to drastically reduce the timescale to get new project on contract as part of the big shake up to the ministry of defence in over year we have create the role of national armament director and because we want uk firm to win not just at home but abroad we will improve our export licensing system with new digital platform well training for staff and reform procedure include allow exporter to apply for licence during the bidding process unlike previous strategy our one be fund it be also the culmination of month of detailed work and close engagement with industry academia and trade union throughout the process our aim have be to produce strategy with the defence sector rather than to it with clear plan back by historic investment our government alongside industry will now deliver for britain commend this statement to the house call the shadow secretary of state for defence be grateful to the minister for early sight of both his statement and the hard copy document before respond to the statement may express on behalf of the opposition our wholehearte condemnation of the late drone attack on kyiv the large of the war with small child among the dead it be reminder of why we need to step up and rearm at pace and scale to strengthen our deterrence in dangerous world the strategy statement of intent publish last december state the defence industrial strategy will be develop at pace and will be publish in late spring it be now autumn it have be delay when we need real pace from the government and that be part of pattern some time ministers promise on the floor of the house that the strategic defence review would be publish in the spring but it be publish in the summer the defence housing strategy be promise for the summer and we now understand that it will be publish as late as the christmas recess can the minister guarantee that the defence industrial policy will be publish this year it be not just labour review that be be publish far later than promise the sdr promise that national armament director would be in place from april on page and as the minister just say the defence industrial strategy state that we have create the role of national armament director if the government have create the role could they kindly tell we the name be andy start the interim nad or be he the new permanent empower nad if so be he on his previous salary or the much high one for the new role key appointment and strategy month late war be change rapidly but labour be move far too slowly on the content of the defence industrial strategy we welcome further measure to boost the skill base of our defence sector while we will wait to see the full detail of the growth deal we strongly share the government goal of spread the prosperity benefit of defence around the united kingdom can the minister tell we when those will be up and run and whether the million investment represent new money that be not previously include in the mod budget also welcome measure to boost defence export not least establish real government to government offer and restore the defence export team back into the mod that be something be work on and be glad the government be implement it our main concern about the strategy be that it lack the ambition to fire up our defence industrial base at the scale and pace require at time when the threat we face be so stark the blunt reality be that for all labour talk actual procurement have be largely on hold since the election with the now notorious write answer confirm in spring that the government have purchase just three new drone since the election last july quite simply they need to start sign actual capability contract thousand of job be at stake in some of those major procurement that be mean to have be resolve in the sdr but on which we still await decision for example on friday have the pleasure to visit leonardo in yeovil the cornerstone of uk military rotary it be clear that the new medium helicopter procurement be critical to its future when announce the nmh competition deliberately strengthen tender scoring to support defence job here in the uk be the government still commit to nmh if so when will they give the green light we hope that will be at the defence and security equipment international for that matter when will we see further progress on skynet the red arrows replacement artillery and the many other key decision that the industry be wait on we want to see pace in procurement not endless dithering and delay however we all know the reason why the waiting go on for so many uk defence company large and small the government have not prioritise boost defence spending meaningfully in the near term instead they use smoke and mirror to inflate what appear to be go into the mod for example the government reclassify the intelligence budget into defence so that they can claim to be spend by when the reality be that the mod budget that which actually fund the equipment plan will be equivalent to only of gdp in that same year while key procurement decision continue to be put off tomorrow labour will plough on as fast as possible with surrender sovereignty of our critical defence base on diego garcia at cost of billion the first payment be of million next year and can safely say that instead of give that to the government of mauritius we would spend the money on rapid procurement of drone and counter drone tech for the british army from our brilliant british defence sme that be what we want to see from today strategy the delivery of strong sovereign drone industrial base and the same for space rotary military vehicle and so many other as well as artificial intelligence and tech warm word deliver late be not enough we need to see real world ramp up of the defence industrial base with serious investment and not smoke and mirror the prioritisation of uk defence company and rapid boost in our ability to deter the rise threat we face think the shadow defence secretary really want to welcome this strategy but be find it difficult because the politic have get in the way will deal with some of that but first let say that be grateful to he for his word about the attack in kyiv it be so important that although we may disagree about some thing across this house there be strong cross party support against putin illegal invasion that must never wane suggest politely to the hon gentleman that the mess in defence procurement that we inherit be one that he be in charge of when he be in government it be therefore bit cheeky of he though generally speak like cheekiness to raise these question the platform that he ask about should have be sort out under his government but never be he know for sure that our investment will be in the defence investment plan we will publish later this year he also know that for the national armament director recruitment be well advanced we have appoint andy start as the interim nad but it be important that we get the right person for the role we will continue that process the shadow secretary of state also ask about defence growth deal and that be new money he also know that we have sign deal for defence procurement contract since the election we will sign more on the back of the defence investment plan later this year the hon gentleman also accuse we of dither and delay but fear that that be political projection from the failure of his time in government we have clear increase in defence spending and clear strategy publish today that direct that increase defence budget at british company that back british sme and that create the skill that our industry need know that he want to back it know that he be passionate about drone which be why know that he will back our doubling of funding for drone and autonomous system in the sdr say to he politely this be huge opportunity for british business up and down the country in every single nation and region of our land and the strategy set out the objective and opportunity hope that on reflection he will be able to welcome the strategy thoroughly and to give it full hearted support because our industry deserve the support of this house it have the support of this labour government and we will continue to increase defence spending direct more of it at british business call the chair of the defence committee welcome the minister announcement and advance sight of the government defence industrial strategy which rightly seek to strengthen our sovereign capability and to bolster british defence business one element of the strategy be offset as set out on page of the document whereby contract with overseas company will lead to british job and novel technology the minister will be aware however that while the practice be use in other nation previous attempt have be abandon because they have lead to increase cost and complex contract problem how will the minister ensure that the government get the detail correct that the practice will indeed benefit british worker and that the cost be not merely load on to other contract the offset policy that we will shortly consult on with industry provide not just the opportunity for we to bring our industry close together but mean that in circumstance where we have to buy from foreign provider which could be because of quality or specific opportunity we have the ability to then invest more in uk business this be commonplace and have feature in the norway deal and in procurement by the australian government and south korea it be model that work and it create an environment where we can mesh our industry together more closely with those of our ally help to share research and development cost for new platform and ensure that when we be not able to spend money on british purchase british industry still benefit from increase skill and increase investment in novel technology this be an area that will directly benefit uk firm and our entire defence ecosystem especially with those investment in skill which will last lifetime for the worker involve and show real defence dividend call the liberal democrat spokesperson thank the minister for advance sight of the defence industrial statement welcome the announcement today of the new defence industrial strategy because for too many year the conservatives choose to ignore the challenge across our defence industrial base in light of the threat that we face from an imperial putin and other revisionist power it be right that this government have serious approach to the defence industrial base in our country the opportunity offer through the defence skill passport will add vital channel for people who be already in employment to make the transition to the sector uk business be play vital role in support military operation in ukraine yet we know that many business operate internationality will the minister ensure that all british individual work in the defence sector in office abroad will also have the skill that they need to support our ally as the need to work closely with our european ally continue to grow will he provide an update on what progress the government have make on secure the uk access to the eu security action for europe fund it be vital that we properly incorporate small and medium sized company into the defence supply chain across britain while welcome the government commitment to new defence office for small business growth will the minister set out how the new office will effectively support the integration of small and medium sized company into supply and procurement it be crucial that the uk be prioritise spend its money at home and with the good business to create forward think defence industry will the minister support an innovative approach to the development of new defence capability that continue to give business opportunity to innovate even when the product be in use while the type deal with norway be positive step in work closely with our ally will the minister confirm that the delivery timeline for expand the uk own type fleet will not be delay finally last week my hon friend the member for st ives andrew george ask the then foreign secretary to assure the house that the government would not award billion contract to israeli defence manufacturer elbit to which he reply with resound yes will

continue those conversation there need to be provision of value for money for the british taxpayer and opportunity for british business and be confident that the discussion will be productive the sme office that we be seek to create be one way of help those small business that feel that they have an innovative project for defence but struggle with the labyrinthine bureaucracy and confusion about who to go to have one stop shop that enable people to access those contract and navigate the process will be real boost for sme sell their product into the ministry of defence the hon member be right about the need for spiral development but in reduce the contracting time we need to be alive to the fact that the technology that we procure need to be spiral develop at pace so that we do not have legacy system that then get spiral development many year later on the hon member two final question the type deal with norway be superb boost for shipbuilding on the clyde discussion with our

continue work with she and other glasgow mp on how we make the most of the type project the swedish archer self propel gun be in the process of replace the and it will itself be replace by the german remote controlled howitzer system can the minister say when the in service date of the howitzer will be how much uk componentry will be in it how many uk job do he anticipate will be generate by it it

growth deal what assessment have the minister make of quick win place such as aldershot and farnborough that be already deliver for the government on defence but with the right extra support and brief from government could do even more thank my hon friend for champion her local business her constituency be not only the home of the british army but an incredible base for innovation and advanced technology there be real opportunity to grow this sector far in her constituency and across the uk and the defence industrial strategy seek to do that by direct more of the increase in the defence

university partnership be so essential in provide those skill be happy to meet she to discuss this matter far congratulate the minister on his promotion have just return from the us with the nato parliamentary assembly where we review disruptive technology from ai to quantum and see how it have chance to change the defence industrial base what consideration of that fast move technology be there in this defence industrial strategy thank the hon gentleman for his question and for championing novel technology the million that we have allocate to uk defence innovation be intend to champion those disruptive high end technology but we have also be clear that we want to spend of our equipment budget on those advanced piece of technology we also need to support the wide ecosystem that support those technology which be why we also make announcement in the strategy about support our university and research partnership that deliver they certainly with us project rely in many case on british technology there be really strong ecosystem for learn the lesson from ukraine and maintain technological edge there be real opportunity for uk business to do more and the more link we have with our us friend on those advanced technology and the well welcome the government commitment to support for ukraine to our security and to our regional economy the north east send proportionately more of its young people into the armed force than any other region in the country yet the ministry of defence spend less with our business and industry than it do with any other region despite our fantastic high value advanced manufacturing it appear that we have not be offer defence growth deal so will the minister meet and stakeholder to address this question urgently my right hon friend the member for liverpool garston maria eagle have agree to do so will he make that commitment reply to the debate on defence in the north east only few week ago and be very happy to meet my hon friend to look at that issue this be not just about how we back the current defence industry that exist right across the country include in the north east it be about how we provide route for firm that might not think of themselves as defence company to sell their product and service into defence make those route easy to navigate especially with the new sme offer will greatly support many of the business in my hon friend constituency be happy to meet she and her regional colleague to make that case far the government say over the summer that the dreadnought programme be on track despite the fire last year at barrow the challenge of covid and the other government programme that be run delay however there be lot of latitude in say that the programme will be deliver in the early be the minister able to clarify in which year the first vessel will be in service that have significant implication for the length at sea of exist submariner thank the right hon gentleman for his question and in particular for frame it around our submariner the secretary of state and the prime minister have both be to zero day event at which our nuclear bomber return to base after many month away their tour be far too long and to ensure we can bring those down we need to not only bring on the new dreadnought class submarine but make sure that the submarine that be in refit the vanguard class get to sea fast we be make effort to deliver both those thing it be difficult for to give the full in service date on the floor of the house but be happy to write to the right hon gentleman with some detail that may be able to publish thank the minister for his statement welcome this industrial strategy which as my hon friend the member for slough mr dhesi say demonstrate how closely align strong domestic defence sector be with our economic security and sovereignty can the minister add bit more detail about what assessment his department have make of the potential further export opportunity arise from this industrial strategy which will strengthen not only uk economic growth but our economic and defence relationship with our ally have just return from south korea where hold number of discussion with government ministers about export opportunity and importantly partnership about how we can use british ingenuity and expertise in support of our ally generate capability which benefit all of we in win win situation there be export opportunity across every single sector of british defence manufacturing in bring defence export into the ministry of defence we aim to align the infrastructure that we have within the mod both in our overseas representation and in our expertise to power those deal so that we can announce more deal like the type deal and the billion lightweight multi role missile contract with missile be make in northern ireland and export to ukraine there be huge opportunity for we to do even more and it be good to have my hon friend support for power up those export especially for those sme that could be the powerhouse of the next generation technology be sure that the minister as fellow devon mp will be only too well aware of our thriving high tech cluster and the support it provide to the defence industry from its base in torbay what assurance can the minister give our high tech cluster in torbay that it will be take account of as this strategy develop so that it can play its part in support our nation defence as plymouth mp know that the success of the defence industry in plymouth be about what happen not just in the pl postcode but in the wide regional ecosystem torbay especially with its marine technology have an awful lot to offer an important part of how we power growth be ensure that the plymouth growth deal and indeed all the growth deal that we have announce today benefit the wide region and not just the particular location the increase in skill and the focus on buy british from british base firm will help business right across the country include in the hon member constituency this morning be at the nuclear skills academy in derby it be partnership between rolls royce and the university of derby that teach the skill need to create the reactor that power our submarine and it deliver apprenticeship year the defence industrial strategy deliver the big investment in defence skill in decade can the minister tell we more about how it will help small defence supplier to secure the skill that they need too be grateful to my hon friend for raise the rolls royce skill work because derby be one of the good in class example in this area that company can invest in its people because of the long term security that this government have provide with the multibillion pound commitment to buy new nuclear reactor from derby for our nuclear submarine our skill investment be not just about the prime invest in skill for that single business it be about the skill ecosystem so we must invest for all the supplier and sme as well there be no point in prime have full apprenticeship if the supplier they buy from which be essential to the end product do not have enough skill that be precisely why skill be at the very heart of the defence industrial strategy we have announce today exemplary example like rolls royce be superb in deliver those skill place on record my excitement at see raf wyton in my constituency directly mention in the defence industrial strategy last week be at raf wyton for hugely successful discussion on its future as defence technology cluster with senior officer from the cyber and specialist operation command the leadership of huntingdonshire district council and planner from the cambridgeshire and peterborough combine authority invite the procurement minister and the defence secretary to visit raf wyton believe they may be due to anyway not only to see the tremendous work that defence intelligence do but to see its suitability as the defence energy and capability resilience centre of excellence that would address my fear that the land may be sell off for housing by the defence infrastructure organisation by accident in the interim also invite they both to the huntingdonshire defence showcase right here in parliament next month thank the hon member for champion his constituency there be real opportunity at raf wyton not just in term of the military purpose that defence intelligence provide there that be obviously difficult to talk about in the public space but in term of the spin off and industrial opportunity that the wide estate offer would be happy to attend those event and look forward to continue the conversation about wyton and return to visit there soon today blockbuster strategy completely rewire many of the institution at the heart of our defence financing the national wealth fund the british business bank and uk export finance with the news that the chinese bond market may now be open to russian defence company do my hon friend agree that we need to keep innovate and keep evolve how we do defence financing to support our own industrial base first thank my hon friend for the work he have be do on how we open up finance to small business in particular and how we deal with some of the policy that restrict access to finance for those firm that work in defence he be absolutely right that internationally we be see more of those nation that sometimes oppose our value come together but we need to make sure we be innovate with our finance and that sme have access to capital that be one reason why we be seek to create more predictable pipeline of acquisition that enable business especially small business to borrow to invest if scotland be lucky we will get per capita share of the million in the growth deal which be barely twice what the snp scottish government have invest in the skill academy in bae alone however the omen be not good because scotland be routinely short change in defence expenditure the london government be spend more in the south east of england than they do in wales scotland and northern ireland put together the minister own region seem set to benefit and be not sure where the union dividend be between portsmouth and yorkshire see as he be hold the pen and write the cheque which hopefully will not bounce will scotland at the very least get its per capita share of that million we hear such negativity from the scottish national party on day when we have announce growth deal for scotland create skill and infrastructure rather than welcome for that investment we hear more negativity it continue the pattern that we have see from the snp in scotland not interested in defence not interested in defence job not interested in the growth that that bring only when there be win do snp members finally come out and say something positive there be lot to be do in scotland to grow that sector we be back the scottish defence industry and hope that the hon gentleman party will do so soon we know that when we back british job british industry and british innovator community across our country reap the reward what step will the minister take to ensure that our proudly home grow small and medium sized enterprise can be supportive in deliver this industrial strategy have see some incredible innovation in our defence sme such company have the opportunity to transform the warfighting capability of our force and to support our ally but for far too many of they it have be too difficult to find the person who be award the contract to navigate the process to understand how to access the forward supply or even to get security clearance to understand what their competitor be do this defence industrial strategy seek to rectify those problem by create single new one stop shop for sme so that all of they in every part of the uk can access mod contract and we can benefit from their innovation and agility imagine that the timing of the defence industrial strategy be link to the defence security and equipment international conference that be happen in london this week so could the minister have word with the mayor of london emphasise the importance of that event for the defence industrial strategy the brilliant brain in malvern in my constituency have come up with something that be very topical and timely well way to deal with those who seek to spoof and jam the gps signal it be deliver with mod funding and be be sell to other country around the world but the uk do not seem to be buy it could the minister look into that specific issue if the hon lady write to about it will certainly look into it this morning be on the bridge of hms mersey one of our offshore patrol vessel which be moor outside the excel centre in east london as part of the dsei conference this be huge opportunity for growth and of course there be defence job in london and an opportunity to grow even more in every part of the uk include the nation capital welcome the minister statement and congratulate he on his new role it be fantastic that plymouth have be name as the site of one of the defence growth deal this be very positive for south east cornwall give our close tie with the worker who cross the river tamar daily use tamar crossing and the autonomous naval vessel training in our local cornish water in fact of babcock devonport workforce live in south east cornwall will the minister outline how the positive impact of this announcement will be feel throughout the region and will he assure that local housing and transport improvement will be consider critical to the successful delivery of this important deal thank my constituency neighbour for her advocacy all the growth deal that we have announce today include the plymouth growth deal will help the wide region in each location not just the specific location to build skill base that will help the supplier as well as the prime in those location my hon friend be right we also need to look at skill and at housing the barrow model for instance be good one for we to look at because barrow need to grow big in order to build the submarine that the royal navy need that be not just about the shipyard although investment from this government be go into it it be about housing education and health in that community this be precisely the model that be be follow for other location across the uk include those in the south west rise may ask member to be brief and the minister to be even short over the summer join the chief of the general staff on visit to supacat at dunkeswell in devon learn there that to keep supply chain active manufacturer need continuous order that keep british make capability sharp be pleased to hear that plymouth be go to enjoy cut of the million pledge for defence growth deal but can the minister let we know about the next order for the incredible jackal high mobility transporter as the hon gentleman know the jackal be make in devonport in the constituency that represent it be good platform we will be make further announcement about order across whole range of land vehicle which company across the uk will be able to bid into the work on the jackal continue with the long wheelbase variant be produce at the moment can the minister assure that along with the huge defence contract that this government have already secure for shipyard in scotland this strategy will also offer great opportunity for fabrication yard include at methil in my constituency it be save from closure by labour ministers and its brilliant workforce be already deliver new million government contract under its new owner navantia uk thank my hon friend for raise that example our million investment will create the facility for the build of the royal fleet auxiliary new fleet solid support ship that be an important part of keep our royal navy supply well into the future be grateful that he speak about manufacturing because there be huge opportunity in this strategy for business like the one he mention very much welcome the indication that northern ireland will participate in the defence growth deal but will the minister explain the interplay if any with the

well as for last week news of the significant infrastructure investment in the rosyth dockyard in my constituency which be highly welcome for job in the area as the minister say the real defence dividend will be the long term skill we have see skill devolve to the scottish government but they have utterly fail when it come to defence skill because of their absolutely childish attitude towards the defence industry seventy two hour do not make up for year of failure will the minister meet to discuss option to ensure that skill and the delivery of skill opportunity in scotland defence sector

scottish parliament election we can find new partnership between the scottish government whoever may form that and the uk government so that we have less politic and more focus on growth now that the killer in the kremlin have reinstate the serious prospect of all out war on the continent of europe do the minister accept that this place premium on national autonomy in our procurement process in future with procurement issue will the government make it clear to what extent we can proceed with acquire the necessary munition irrespective of what be happen to the ally with whom we might normally co operate thank the right hon gentleman for his customarily thoughtful question he will know of our intention to build six new munition factory include new energetic factory precisely because there be shortage and there be concern about supply and resilience he will also know that we be seek to onshore number of capability the defence industrial strategy deal with number of those capability especially around national security which we want to see enhance our sovereign capability encourage he to read that part of the strategy shortly this defence industrial strategy show that we finally have government who take our british defence industry seriously foundation of domestic order enable british business to compete effectively for export order can the minister outline the nature of the support from uk defence innovation that our defence and defence adjacent sme might need in order to help they commercialise their technology hope he will consider teesside and the north east for

company and for company that be not sell into defence currently but which have an opportunity to do so the million investment in uk defence innovation be design to go after the most innovative and disruptive technology prime have good role in this but so do sme encourage all business to lean into that opportunity and to really go after the increase funding and the export and contractual opportunity that that will provide the minister have make number of announcement about skill in the defence industrial strategy which be much appreciated but can he explain how they will integrate with exist skill framework and whether the industry will be give the flexibility to develop new course at the wartime pace that the strategic defence review reference the hon gentleman be exactly right for instance the work that ads be do on its new curriculum be really interesting and exciting there be real opportunity to go after the skill challenge nationwide in order to give the man and woman in our armed force the kit they need and to export to our ally we need to invest more in skill it be something in which this nation have under invest for far too long that change with the defence industrial strategy today welcome the minister statement the defence industrial strategy will strengthen our security and grow our economy these reform will boost job in community such as my west dunbartonshire constituency which be sandwich between the million investment in faslane and the billion contract with norway guarantee shipbuilding on the clyde for year to come will the minister agree to meet the leader of my local authority and the chief executive of west dunbartonshire council to explore the opportunity for bring further defence investment and employment to west

people with crucial engineering skill it be vital that the defence industrial strategy new clearing style system for apprenticeship work with local sme and college to expand these opportunity can the minister clarify how the system will operate in wales where apprenticeship be devolve that be precisely why we be seek more engagement on defence with the devolved administrations defence be reserved matter but skill be devolve so we need to form new partnership between the different government across the united kingdom include in wales the skill around raf valley be really very impressive and there be huge opportunity for growth if we get this right we will create more good well pay job in the hon lady constituency and across wales an opportunity that this government be go to seize with both hand be delighted that the face of procurement be change and that hopefully we will see telescoping of the time between the flash of inspiration and the bang of kinetic effector as they say the neutral vendor framework for innovation be very important part of that but will the minister give an assurance that the business and trade committee recommendation that we have metric so that we can measure output and not simply input can be bring forward thank the hon member and agree with he be big fan of data lead dashboard and the ministry of defence will be produce those because when it come to procurement we need great datum lead approach and focus on prioritisation we will be go after area that have fall behind which be afraid the last government fail to do that be our new approach have already meet the chair of the committee and look forward to meet he far to discuss how we can take on board the recommendation to make sure we get this system right to provide certainty for the whole defence sector but particularly for the small and medium sized business in my constituency will the minister confirm when negotiation on the uk join the billion security action for europe will

build and support uk business sell product to our european ally there be huge opportunity here and we will continue those discussion do not want to set an arbitrary deadline but those discussion be ongoing and hope the cabinet office and the mod will be able to come back with good news in due course welcome the government announcement of dedicated procurement hub in northern ireland to support our sme although note that no location have be announce in northern ireland can remind the minister of the excellent opportunity that the aldergrove base in my constituency present and how it would be

history and our heritage and hope it be also part of our future take that as strong early bid and be happy to talk to the hon gentleman about how we can maximise skill in his constituency thank the

ireland will relish the idea of job come our way we in the democratic unionist party welcome the defence industrial strategy acknowledge the need for world class defence and make the most of our world

of growth as well as support our security objective the worker in northern ireland should be very proud of the work they be do certainly be point of order on point of order madam deputy speaker the hon member for clacton nigel farage at congressional hearing and in write evidence have suggest that the us government explore possible trade consequence in response to the uk online safety act would you agree that suggest that foreign government take measure harmful to the interest of this country be not behaviour commensurate with the office of member of the uk parliament indeed would you agree with several constituent of clacton who have describe the member statement as treacherous be grateful to the hon member for give notice of his point of order take it that he notify the hon member for clacton that he intend to refer to he in the chamber indicate assent the hon member be nod the chair be not responsible for anything that hon member say outside the chamber that in itself would be full time job but he have put his point on the record renter right bill programme no motion make and question put forthwith standing order no that the follow provision shall apply to the renters right bill for the purpose of supplement the order of october renters right bill programme consideration of lords amendments proceeding on consideration of lords amendments shall so far as not previously conclude be bring to conclusion four hour after their commencement the lords amendments shall be consider in the following order to to and to to to to and to subsequent stage any further message from the lords may be consider forthwith without any question be put proceeding on any further message from the lords shall so far as not previously conclude be bring to conclusion one hour after their nicholas dakin question agree to renter right bill consideration of lords amendment must draw the house attention to the fact that lords amendment and engage commons financial privilege if either of those lords amendment be agree to will cause the customary entry waive commons financial privilege to be enter in the journal clause right to request permission to keep pet beg to move that this house disagree with lords amendment with this it will be convenient to discuss lord amendment government motion to disagree and government amendment in lieu lord amendment and government motion to disagree lord amendment and government motion to disagree lord amendment and government motion to disagree lord amendment and government motion to disagree lord amendment and government motion to disagree lord amendment and government motion to disagree lord amendment to government motion to disagree and government amendment in lieu lord amendment and government motion to disagree lord amendment government motion to disagree and government amendment in lieu lord amendment to to to to to and to this government be elect with clear mandate to do what the conservatives fail to do in the last parliament namely to modernise the regulation of our country insecure and unjust private rented sector and empower private renter by provide they with great security right and protection our renters rights bill do just that and it need to receive royal assent as quickly as possible so that england million private renter can benefit from its provision before turn to the lords amendment want to thank baroness taylor for so ably guide the bill through the other place put on record my appreciation of all the peer who contribute to its detailed scrutiny as you will know madam deputy speaker the government make several important change to the bill in the other place with view to ensure that it will work as intended and in response to the legitimate concern raise about the implementation of specific provision in the interest of time will update the house only on the two that be most apposite the first change concern the date from which tenant be require to pay new rent in instance where the first tier tribunal have set new rent amount follow tenant challenge to propose increase the government be elect on clear manifesto commitment to empower tenant to challenge unreasonable rent increase it be essential that we deliver on that commitment not only to protect tenant from undue financial pressure but to prevent rent hike from be use as form of back door eviction once section notice have be abolish however recognise that there be inherent uncertainty about the volume of rent increase challenge that will be bring when the new tenancy system come into force and as safeguard against scenario in which the first tier tribunal be overwhelm by sharp increase in challenge lords amendment to introduce new delegate power that will enable the backdating of rent increase follow determination by the tribunal of new rent amount want to reiterate what baroness taylor make clear in the other place namely that it be not the government intention to make use of this new power unless and until it be consider necessary to avoid lengthy delay for genuine case to be hear if use it would be subject to the affirmative procedure to allow appropriate parliamentary scrutiny in addition to introduce that important safeguard the government also conclude that there be compelling case for the use of an alternative body or mechanism to make initial rent determination subject to final viability assessment we intend to establish such an alternative body or mechanism as soon as possible and will confirm further detail in due course the second important change the government make in the other place concern insurance to cover potential damage from pet as hon member will be aware the bill as originally introduce mirror provision in the previous government renters reform bill enable landlord to request such insurance in instance where tenant have request pet in response to concern express by several peer that the insurance industry appear unlikely to provide suitable financial product at the speed and scale require and that the reasonable request of tenant to keep pet might be hamper as result lords amendment and remove the provision in the bill which make landlord consent to request to keep pet conditional on the tenant take out or pay for pet damage insurance just last week be ask similar question back home the legislation back home be not cover by this house the issue for those who have animal be that almost every person who have an animal in flat apartment or other property always look after the property as if it be their own and the issue of animal damage do not come up it do however come up the odd time so be it not well think the minister be say this to have an obligation rather than legislation to ensure that the tenant cover any damage by pet because most tenant will be accountable for their pet no matter what as ever thank the hon gentleman for his intervention he make good point there be evidence that pet damage be in many case not extensive or particular issue where pet damage occur as will come on to make clear in response to the relevant lords amendment we think that the provision in the tenant fees act which allow for tenant deposit to be change in response to such issue mean that we have the necessary delegate power but will set out further detail on that particular issue in due course will now turn to the amendment make by peer in the other place we welcome the scrutiny and challenge provide and be willing to make sensible concession in some area but most of the amendment in question serve to undermine the core principle of the bill and for that reason we can not accept they let make clear precisely in each instance where that be the case start with lords amendment lord amendment dramatically broaden the scope of possession ground so that it encompass not only full time student live in house in multiple occupation but non typical student such as old student with family undertake postgraduate study who may live in self contain one and two bed property ground exist precisely because the government recognise the unique nature of the student rental market and be determined to ensure that the annual cycle of student letting continue accordingly however ground be deliberately design to ensure that the benefit of the new tenancy system introduce in the bill be not deny to non typical student we believe restrict its use to hmos or dwelling house in hmos strike the right balance and therefore urge the house to reject lords amendment lord amendment introduce new ground for possession for the sole purpose of allow landlord to regain their property to house carer for themselves or member of their family live with they everyone in this chamber recognise the vital work carer do to support people to live independently and with dignity however while the government be profoundly sympathetic to the need of those who require care be afraid we can not support this amendment for two main reason first while appreciate entirely that some peer currently own and let rental property in close proximity to their home with view to one day use they to house carer for themselves or member of their family there be no compelling evidence to suggest that this practice be sufficiently widespread to justify the insertion into the bill at this late stage of dedicated possession ground to cater specifically for it secondly the definition of carer in the amendment namely anyone provide any form of care in voluntary or contractual arrangement be so broad that the scope for abuse in our view be substantial therefore urge the house to reject the amendment lords amendment would reduce the prohibition on re let or re market property follow the use of possession ground from month to six we recognise that there will be occasion when landlord regain vacant possession of their property use ground but be unable subsequently to sell it despite repeat attempt to do so but we be not prepared to weaken the strong safeguard against abuse provide by the month no let provision it be essential to prevent landlord misuse ground and evict tenant who be not at fault whether that be because they have make legitimate complaint or simply because the landlord want to re let at high rate the government remain firmly committed to the month no let restriction and urge the house to reject lords amendment on that basis lords amendment be related amendment that exempt share owner from the month re let and re marketing restriction as well as other important restriction want to make it clear that the government recognise the plight of share owner live in building that require remediation know from my own effort to support share owner in my constituency of greenwich and woolwich that those affect by the building safety crisis often face unaffordable cost often with no viable exit route other than distressed sale it be worth note that to well support affect share owner the government have already take number of step to provide great clarity about what flexibility and assistance share owner should expect from register provider include in relation to sublet at market rate we also recognise that there be more that might be do outside this legislation to mitigate the impact of the building safety crisis on share owner and be commit to explore all option however while very much commend lord young of cookham for champion the interest of share owner in difficulty and be more than happy to continue to engage with he to determine if there be way to provide they with great support that do not undermine the core principle of the bill be afraid that can not accept lords amendment at this time purely because the government remain of the view that it could undermine protection for the small subset of tenant who happen to rent sublet home from share owner lord amendment would allow landlord to require an additional deposit equivalent to three week rent as condition of consent to tenant request to keep pet we can not support this amendment require further three week deposit would cost the average tenant in england over such sum would be unaffordable for many tenant and would greatly exceed the average deposit deduction for pet damage of we be satisfied this speak to the point make by the hon member for strangford jim shannon that the exist requirement for five week deposit for typical tenancy be sufficient to cover the risk of any damage relate to pet ownership crucially as mention we already have the delegate power necessary under the tenant fees act to allow high deposit for tenancy with pet should evidence come forward to the contrary for those reason urge the house to reject lords amendment lord amendment and would require local authority to meet the criminal rather than the civil standard of proof when impose penalty for rental discrimination and rental bidding breach the government be absolutely clear that the civil standard which be align with similar legislation such as the wide anti discrimination provision of the equality act be the appropriate one to apply in these circumstance require local authority to meet the more stringent criminal standard of proof for provision that can not lead to criminal offence where the conduct persist would make local authority enforcement extremely challenging and would be prohibitively resource intensive we can not accept the amendment for those reason and urge the house to reject they finally lords amendment would bring service family accommodation within scope of the modernised decent home standard that the government be introduce begin by once again acknowledge the integral role that safe and decent accommodation play in the life of our service personnel and their family the government be absolutely determined to improve the standard of service family accommodation across the entire defence estate in scotland wales and northern ireland as well as england however the government can not accept the amendment as have be debate at length at various stage of the bill the ministry of defence be absolutely clear that subject secure defence site to local authority inspection as this amendment would do be unworkable due to access and security constraint in any case as we have make clear many time the mod already apply the decent home standard as benchmark have go far with its decent home plus standard for service family accommodation and have commit to comply with awaab law requirement and to mirror any of its timescale for deal with damp and mould in its key performance indicator as the house will know early this year the mod announce an additional billion investment in service family accommodation as part of billion commitment over the next five year and in the come month the government will publish defence housing strategy set out clear renewal standard and further step to improve accommodation for the man and woman who serve our country importantly those renewal standard will apply to the whole uk defence estate ensure that the different nation of the uk be not subject to different decency standard as would be the case under lords amendment we believe that there be very strong reason for object to that amendment but appreciate fully that peer want certainty that all service accommodation will be bring up to the requisite standard with view to provide great confidence about the government clear intention in this area can confirm today that the mod will lay before parliament and publish on an annual report on the standard of service family accommodation in the uk hope that the transparency and accountability that annual reporting will facilitate will provide sufficient reassurance of the government commitment to the commendable objective that underpin lords amendment however for the reason have provide we will not be able to accept it today mention at the outset that the government be willing to make sensible concession in some area and that be the case for lords amendment to which would expand ground to allow landlord to evict their tenant to house self employ worker and other type of worker engage in agriculture peer also agree to lords amendment to which would expand ground in order to allow landlord to evict wide range of worker than just tenant who be employee have reflect on our position the government have table amendment in lieu that narrowly expand ground to allow agricultural landlord to evict assure tenant in order to house both employee and non employ worker engage in agriculture we believe this small technical change will support the government clear intention of ensure that the agricultural sector can continue to function effectively without compromise wide security of tenure and be pleased that both lord carrington and the national farmers union have indicate their support for these change to conclude the bill have undoubtedly be improve as result of the scrutiny to which it have be subject but the government be not prepared to allow our core principle to be undermine in the way that the amendment would urge the house to support the government position and look forward to the remainder of the debate call the shadow secretary of state the uk need vibrant and fluid private rent sector we need it to deliver community that be happy and cohesive and to deliver fairness stability and security for family have be look at the government position on the bill and pay tribute to the minister for housing and planning the hon member for greenwich and woolwich matthew pennycook for the work he have do on it or be he the right hon member indicate dissent well he deserve to be the right hon gentleman he have be do the hard yard he have do load of work on this bill be sure he be disappoint that he do not get to lead the department congratulation to the new secretary of state but have no doubt that the opportunity will come in the near future would just say be patient for the moment while have no doubt that the bill be full of good intention it be poorly though through and counterproductive in fact be assume it be poorly think through but it be entirely feasible that the measure within it be well though through and be design to undermine the private rent sector it be inept either by accident or on purpose will go with inept by accident because that be more in keep with the government action in this department the bill be clearly mishmash of measure on issue that be back bench hobby horse issue that those on the front bench do not have the authority or the courage to put to bed it be entirely counterproductive as have be recognise and highlight by their lordship in the other place the bill risk drive private landlord out of the sector reduce the supply of private rent accommodation and push up rent for those in the private rent sector limit the supply of such accommodation mean limit the option for tenant in the private rented sector and leave they bad off we do not need to look very far to see what happen when government get this wrong in scotland fix term tenancy be abolish rent control impose and regulation tighten and what be the result few landlord shrink supply and the fast rise in rent in the uk with edinburgh and glasgow facing steep rent rise than ineptly labour run london the labour government in westminster be about to make the same mistake because government back benchers be for whatever reason obsess with fix an already highly successful sector the private rented sector have the high satisfaction level of any tenure type high than level in the social rent sector or among owner occupier do not know what correspondence the right hon gentleman be look at but the correspondence receive from my constituent in hillingdon do not tell story of sector that be secure and safe instead my constituent tell that they be battle damp and mould and have have rent increase in recent year be that success in the opposition view the hon gentleman make the classic statistical error of assume that his inbox be representative of all the people in the sector have it not occur to he that people who be happy in their private rent accommodation do not tend to write to their mp say apropos of nothing just want to let you know that be happy have it on good authority from my hon friend the member for ruislip northwood and pinner david simmonds my good friend and colleague that the hon member for uxbridge and south ruislip danny beales be not do terribly good job of champion the social rent sector in his constituency he seek to deny the private rented sector while simultaneously deny people the social rent sector be not sure where he think people in his constituency should live the point be that the bill be mishmash of incoherent proposal which instead of be design to improve the private rented sector be design to keep angsty back benchers happy but front benchers be already start to learn that they can not pay political danegeld to their back benchers give the front bench team due notice their back benchers will be insatiable they will take whatever red meat they be throw and they will ask for more we have already see this madam deputy speaker with the propose change to social security and disability benefit the front benchers have plan but their back benchers have other plan and guess who win those show courageous leadership on the turbulent back benches the government will see the same again on this issue the opposition understand that good tenure mix be good for the uk we take measure to improve the private rented sector but we make sure that we do it in the right order we make sure that the court be ready be intrigue by the right hon gentleman remark about the success of the private rent sector if the sector be so successful and be work so well why have the opposition consistently hold the position both when they be in government and believe go into the election that they would go forward with end no fault eviction be confused would be grateful if he could explain it be interesting that on the one hand we have voice on the front bench say that we do not do anything in government while at the same time voice on the labour back benches say that we be do something will the right hon gentleman give way again no perhaps labour members should co ordinate their criticism the previous conservative government understand that there be need to reform the system but that every part of the system need to be ready that be why we make sure that the justice system be ready first before we start make change to the legal framework give tenant landlord and court the time to adjust however the labour government have abandon that discipline the change put forward by their lordship come about through careful consideration of the provision in the bill and their implication in real world scenario not the fantasy world of many labour back benchers the labour government be defeat in the other place on several important amendment there be pattern to the government defeat time and again ministers accept principle but when it come to take action to deal with the principle they fall short will give some example from amendment on report in the other place amendment and in the name of lord keen would raise the standard of proof for financial penalty to beyond reasonable doubt the principle be clear set serious penalty require have serious evidence the noble lord keen make the case powerfully in the other place yet the government still refuse to act in do so they be introduce huge degree of uncertainty for both landlord and council and uncertainty be toxic to the provision of home in the sector make these change will reduce the housing supply the minister mention amendment in the name of the noble baroness scott which would extend ground to all student home not just those with three or more bedroom this be another example of the government accept the principle and the need to act but fail to do so in the student rent sector it be important that tenancy match the academic year to give landlord in the sector credible chance the government establish that as principle and agree with it but then exclude one and two bedroom property as if student be never accommodate in they my own son as back benchers be keen to personalise example be student who be currently accommodate in two bedroom flat why would the landlord of that accommodation be outside of scope but the landlord of student property with one more bedroom be within scope the idea that we can not work out who be or be not let to student be nonsense student have their own council tax category and it be often the case that they can only get student accommodation and enjoy the benefit of the student discount for council tax by prove that they be student it would be really easy cut off to say that all student accommodation fall within scope the government accept the principle but then fail to address the issue they accept the logic but do nothing about it amendment in the name of the noble lord de clifford would ensure that tenant who want to rent with pet and landlord who want to rent to people with pet can both have degree of security the government accept the principle that pet be likely to cause more damage to rental property than would be cause if tenant do not have pet they accept that principle when they put forward the idea of special insurance product to cover such damage if they do not believe that pet be likely to cause more damage they would not have go down the road of explore an insurance product specifically for pet owner but they do they establish the principle then when it become clear that the insurance product be too difficult and the sector would not bring they forward they basically say you know what we just go to ignore recognise challenge but do nothing about it amendment propose sensible and credible additional deposit to protect against the high likelihood of damage from pet should declare an interest that have pet and rent property need to keep close eye on my terrier because they love dig sometimes they dig in the garden but they be not so disciplined not to attempt to dig in the carpet in the house recognise that tenant have to take additional responsibility but also recognise that it be totally legitimate for landlord to want to seek additional protection the government recognise that but then do nothing about it amendment also in the name of the noble lord de clifford be about create the framework whereby landlord can evict tenant in order to create space for someone who would then care for they the reasoning that we hear from the government front bench just now be quite shocking that the only people who might be interested in put this forward would be member of the other place with the implication be that they have large property and it be all about self interest the argument be that there be only small number of people that this might be relevant to and because they be small in number we can ignore they it be an interesting political philosophy that small group of people can comfortably be ignore by government that be certainly not the politic want to put across early in response to my hon friend the member for uxbridge and south ruislip danny beales the shadow secretary of state say that my hon friend do not need to pay any attention to the people in his inbox who have contact he be he not advocate exactly that we should not listen because it be small number of people and we should accept these amendment so that this legislation can be water down be he not argue both side of the same coin on this if the hon gentleman be go to criticise what say he should have at least listen to what say what say be that extrapolate rise no no get it right first time what say be that extrapolate from member of parliament inbox be not good way of gauge the full spectrum of opinion within cohort of people at no point do say and would never say that we should ignore the people who write to we and no one should assume that we do be pretty certain that the hon gentleman would not and certainly do not that be absolutely not what say the point be make be that the government argument be there be that many people and frankly they all posh so we can ignore they that be basically the framing of their argument but tell that to the extended family of people typically of ethnic minority origin who often live in close proximity to each other there will be community all across the country where the elder of the family have rent property that have tenant in they but because those property be near where they live they envisage at some point in the future member of their extended family move into the property in order to provide care for they disregard and diminish this as an idea just because it be something that the government front bench accuse only the posh members of the other place of do be rather distasteful the shadow secretary of state fail to address the second concern the government have about amendment which be the substantial risk of abuse that will flow from the definition of carer the definition under the amendment could be anyone provide any form of voluntary care it could be someone who provide the weekly shop do he not see the risk of abuse that come with ground that be so broadly draw that be our other concern and he have not address it there be always opportunity for abuse but we can not be close off provision that would be really valuable to many family around the country because there be risk of abuse if we be to do that there would be load of area where government would not legislate we do not disregard an opportunity just because of the potential for abuse we manage that potential for abuse will move on bit more quickly as want to ensure that all labour back benchers get their opportunity to speak interruption it be their legislation lord amendment in the name of lord cromwell would reduce the ban on re let from month to six month that be wholly pragmatic point there be the idea in the bill that landlord would have to wait for month but if it be clear after six month that despite genuine effort there be provision to ensure that effort be genuine there be no chance of sell it be entirely reasonable that landlord should seek to re let that be not as quickly as member on the labour benches would do so nevertheless it be an entirely fair provision the large government defeat in the other place come on amendment in the name of lord young of cookham which be about the exemption for share owner from the month ban on re letting the minister say at the dispatch box that he recognise that this area create challenge but urge the government not to dig in their heel on the issue the cohort of people envisage by the amendment be often those most in need of flexibility people who be not of significant financial mean and limit their option when it come to perhaps distressed asset would be entirely wrong have no doubt that he recognise that urge he to move quickly to resolution on this matter to reassure the chamber and the other place that those people will not be disadvantage by the bill the lords amendment be well think through they attempt to take this mishmash of bill and knock it into some credible shape provide protection for tenant and bit of reassurance for landlord so that they can continue to provide supply of private rent accommodation to help people get on the housing ladder and to live in home they love and value in community that they cherish if the government choose to blindly ignore those amendment have no doubt that the bill will have the effect of reduce the number of landlord reduce the number of home and increase rent which be the opposite of what any of we in the chamber should want that be why the opposition will support the amendment once again stand here proud to speak in favour of this groundbreaking legislation that finally bring some balance back between the landlord right to profit from an asset and the renter right to home oppose in particular lords amendment and propose by the landlord lobby in the other place amendment and would increase the evidence bar for all civil penalty offence to the criminal standard of proof beyond reasonable doubt rather than on the balance of probability that would gut the ban on discrimination against housing benefit recipient the ban on refuse to let to family and the ban on bidding war those measure would be almost unenforceable if the amendment stand discrimination be notoriously hard to prove and we all know that early interaction between renter and prospective landlord be often not in writing so prove beyond reasonable doubt that prospective renter be prevent from let property because they might be benefit claimant or have kid would be extremely challenging it be the same for prove bidding war council already struggle to pursue civil penalty case because of the staff time and resource involve in gather evidence to support those case introduce that new high bar of evidence for already challenging case would make they almost unenforceable it would also be out of line with other legislation such as the equality act which require only the civil standard of proof if we do not oppose those lords amendment such unlawful practice will continue unchecked and renter will continue to face homelessness as result also oppose lords amendment which would reduce the restricted period from month to six month the nationwide foundation find that one in five landlord sale eviction in scotland do not end up with the sale of property it be so clear that this change period would make it far too easy for landlord and agent to claim they be sell the property only to re let it at high rent shortly after let we leave no loophole for rogue landlord no let period with financial penalty for breach provide clear and significant deterrent against such behaviour but six month be too short to deter abuse especially for landlord with large portfolio twelve month be an effective deterrent against unlawful dishonest eviction and we should keep that measure as come to the end of what want to say welcome the new ministerial team and thank the member of the former ministerial team for their work on the bill and make one plea to the minister who be so glad to see still in his place we must get on with this as soon as this brilliant groundbreake bill receive royal assent let we get commencement date in and let we make that no more than three month later so that renter on that day will know that three month far along no one can throw they out of their home just cos with every month of delay and every month that go by another family be remove from their home by bailiff follow no fault eviction in the year since we take power household have lose their home to no fault eviction it be time to get on with it to everyone who rent their home say this government and the labour party will always have your back call the liberal democrat spokesperson be grateful to the minister for present the government position on the lords amendment as indeed he present their position on the amendment we table in committee only regret that in do so he reject all of they be go to congratulate the secretary of state on his new position but he have escape just in time will come to our amendment the other place take different view on some of they but will first declare my interest in registered provider of social housing generation have be cut off from the dream of home ownership after half century of flog off council house over million have be sell off since by successive conservative government there be now in effect none leave for the thousand of family who now need they that be why the liberal democrats have vision to restore hope to million who aspire to decent home by build our target of social and council rent home per year back up with commitment of an extra billion on top of the affordable housing programme budget fund by fairly reform capital gain tax so that more people benefit from relief but those who make big gain pay more alongside that the liberal democrats want new generation of rent to own home so that people can get on to the ownership ladder it be the big and most ambitious programme since council housing be invent by lloyd george and addison back at the beginning of the century we have also long campaign for an end to no fault eviction and for long and more stable tenancy for tenant the government have put both those key measure in the bill and that be why we support it and want to see it enact tenant have live for far too long with insecurity and the fear that if they speak up they might lose their home some of the lords amendment before we would improve the bill while other would weaken it lord amendment would require tenant to pay pet deposit which would pile on new financial burden put the right to own pet out of reach for those already struggle it be not in the spirit of the bill so we can not support it similarly lords amendment would cut the prohibition on re let unsold property from month to six that might sound like neat compromise but in practice it would give cover to any rogue landlord look for an excuse to evict six month ban would be far too short to give tenant the protection from abuse that they deserve lord amendment seek to raise the bar for enforcement by move the burden of proof from civil to criminal in torbay we have almost more people who rent in the private sector than the national average while the vast majority of landlord be good landlord sadly there be some rotten apple out there push against lords amendment be essential because we need to ensure that local authority have the power to hold these landlord to account hope my hon friend agree do agree with my hon friend and pay tribute to the sterling work he do in torbay and have do in the past as leader of the council on these issue that change in the burden of proof may sound technical but in fact it would gut the power of local authority to hold bad landlord to account as my hon friend have just say at stroke it would make justice for tenant far hard to achieve lord amendment point in the same wrong direction it seek to introduce fix term tenancy but the whole point of the bill be to shift to periodic tenancy arrangement that give renter both flexibility and more security drag we back to fix term which would become standard across that particular element of student housing would undermine those core principle on the other hand there be amendment that make the bill fair and more workable which we support lord amendment recognise the reality face by share ownership leaseholder who can be can be and be hit disproportionately hard when sale fall through through no fault of their own without that exemption they could face financial ruin this be simple matter of justice and we support it lord amendment which would create new possession ground where landlord need to house carer be in keep with the liberal democrats belief in the importance of support the million of carer out there who be so often overlook it be right that the law should recognise the vital role they play and if there be risk of abuse it be open to the government to table their own amendment to set out how they would make the same provision for accommodation need by carer lord amendment which would legislate for decent home standard for our military go to the heart of who we be as society and our obligation to those who serve push for this amendment at early stage in the commons and indeed this have long be the liberal democrats position have be raise by my hon friend the member for north shropshire helen morgan in the previous parliament it be therefore disappointing that while the government have come forward with their own amendment on other matter they have not come up with any such amendment on decent home for our military although that have be agree across the party in the other place do my hon friend agree that if the ministry of defence itself say that the mod housing standard be already high than the decent home standard the government should do the decent thing and accept lords amendment and put it on the face of the bill indeed our military deserve no less than this be on the face of the bill in whichever way the government wish to do it if it be so easy and as my hon friend point out it be the government position surely it can hold no fear for they it would be disappointing not to have those amendment we be tell that of service accommodation meet the decent home standard my hon friend the member for epsom and ewell helen maguire have clearly already read this part of my speech but those figure come from contractor who be responsible for manage those property and have an interest in say that they already meet the standard there be no independent assessment the defence committee paint very different picture when family report to it the committee state it be disingenuous for dio to present glossy brochure about be decent home plus when they be anything but it be clear that the dio property frequently do not meet the standard crucially it add moreover there be no local authority or anyone else to hold they to account as would be the case for private and other local landlord we be also tell that it would be impractical to extend the decent home standard to military housing because of access behind the wire yet former chief of the defence staff lord stirrup remind colleague in the other place that civilian official already go into far more sensitive area of military basis so that be not serious objection do those on the lib dem benches have any concern about one of the issue that raise apply the decent home standard to the defence estate in england when different standard will apply to scotland and wales to other part of the united kingdom fracture the defence estate in that way be problematic any opportunity to give our service people decent home begin with england should be take be surprised that the minister have not grasp it with both hand the minister and the government be in the position with large majority to legislate for this in whichever way they choose but it need to be on the face of the legislation that be what our military deserve warm word about thing improve be not enough we have hear they before my hon friend the member for north shropshire gain categoric assurance from the last government housing minister at the dispatch box that that government would legislate they do not the hon gentleman say nothing have change yet again but do he not welcome as do as constituency mp with significant amount of military housing around raf northolt the significant billion plus investment into military housing and the insourcing back into public ownership of thousand of mod home after the previous government botch privatisation deal which cost taxpayer huge amount of public money welcome the move to which the hon gentleman refer include the insourcing but the responsibility for determine whether the home meet the decent home plus standard be down to contractor who have commercial interest in report that the difference with the decent home standard generally be that it be subject to independent inspection that be crucial difference surely there should be robust and accountable regime set out in primary legislation to ensure that that investment continue and those standard be reach that be the least that our service people should be able to expect as be say my hon friend the member for north shropshire be give categoric assurance that the government would legislate in this regard but they do not and neither have this government lord stirrup the former chief of the defence staff remind the lords speak from experience that this be not new problem but one that government have fail to tackle for decade he say for decade now have see at close hand the deficiency in service family accommodation for year have listen to successive government undertake to get to grip with the issue for decade have see they fail to do so so why should or anybody who come after put any faith in any government promise that be not back up by enforceable report house of lords july vol that be the nub of the issue service family have hear promise for decade now surely be the time for action our military deserve the gold standard and that mean they deserve legislative provision for decent home however the government wish to do it urge the hon gentleman to engage with the clear concession make from the dispatch box the confirmation that the ministry of defence will lay before parliament and publish on an annual report on the standard of service family accommodation in the uk give transparency accountability and reassurance that the standard we all want to see improve and be meet will be welcome any report that will deal with this issue but the fact be that unless the government accept an amendment or table their own amendment to provide this protection for service family in primary legislation our service people will be the only category of renter who be not guarantee the decent home standard in primary legislation private renter will be social renter will be but our military service family will not be that can not be right the balance be wrong and the government need to do more they need to legislate the government final objection be that they want to do it differently so be it will wait with bated breath as be sure the whole house will for the government amendment give servicemen and servicewomen the gold standard they deserve since the government have table no amendment of their own however we shall continue to press our both here and in the other place our armed force should not be the only group in britain exclude from the right to decent home in legislative term that be what lords amendment deliver and it must stand part of the bill this bill be about vision for well home and for dignity security and fairness for renter that must include the family of our armed force such as those of the commando royal marines in norton fitzwarren and elsewhere in taunton be proud to start petition to save norton manor camp follow its propose closure by the previous conservative government that commitment must sit alongside our national mission to build more social and council per year to restore hope for whole generation that be what liberal democrats be fight for and that be the change the country desperately need the bill before we be one of the most important and impactful bills currently before parliament say that not as someone who have see few email in my inbox but as someone who have feel the impact of the sector have experience homelessness twice in my teenage year and have be evict through section eviction as renter as an adult for many year in london know the worry that many go through when push for simple repair to be make or for mould to be address fear that ultimately their reward for assert their legal right will be section eviction the private rented sector in this country be unbalanced and insecure and the right of tenant be far outweigh by the power of the landlord in our legal system like many in this place be aware of countless case of constituent who have experience section eviction and poor treatment right across the sector treatment that the bill will go significant way to remedy that be why hope member will support the government in oppose the lords amendment which seek to weaken neuter and undermine key provision of the bill specifically want to mention lords amendment and be pleased that the minister have outline that the government will oppose they lord amendment and would require local authority to meet criminal standard of proof to impose financial penalty for discrimination and rental bidding that seem completely inappropriate for the offence with relatively small maximum penalty of that be also completely out of kilter with other provision that local authority would enforce to similar civil standard it would be incredibly hard to meet that burden of proof for many of those offence how would tenant prove beyond reasonable doubt that for instance they have be discriminate against for be on benefit anyone in that situation would know quite clearly that that be incredibly difficult if not impossible to do clearly the amendment would neuter the provision of the bill local authority have incredibly limit resource particularly for enforcement action and such high bar would be likely to deter they from pursue those offence far lord amendment which would allow landlord to require pet deposit of up to three week rent as condition of consent to tenant keep pet in their property be again disproportionate first it would hit the poorest hard be pleased that the opposition spokesperson the right hon member for braintree sir james cleverly have pet and have no problem with such provision but many people not on parliamentary salary would struggle to pay three week extra deposit on top of the five week deposit already in place the minister mention an average cost of in constituency like mine in london the cost would be even more than for rent three or four bed family home it would probably be several thousand pound that be completely disproportionate charge for simply have cat or dog at home secondly there be no evidence that such pet deposit be require to protect property recent research by the university of hull find that three quarter of pet own tenancy result in absolutely no claim against the exist deposit level so would argue that the five week deposit be more than adequate to support pet own household in fact battersea dogs cats home find that own pet increase the length of time someone stay in tenancy and reduced tenant turnover benefit the landlord financially not harm they be also significantly oppose to lords amendment which would reduce the period for which landlord could not re let their property from month to six month after they have evict tenant on the basis that they intend to sell their property my concern be that this six month reduction be not sufficient time to meaningfully disincentivise landlord from game the system and would reintroduce section through the back door take the london market for instance where average rent have increase by over the last five year the successful sector that opposition members have highlight six month be not long enough to dissuade landlord from benefit from that sort of rental increase over short period of time the inconvenience that month time period would cause to well mean landlord who be struggle to sell be relatively minor compare with the potential harm cause to the many tenant who would be affect by such loophole in conclusion house be home not just investment this bill be write to rebalance the relationship between the landlord and the tenant in the tenant favour fix decade long power imbalance that have deprioritise the right of tenant to safe stable and affordable home all the amendment have in common share motive to shift the balance back towards landlord to weaken this landmark legislation that would save some good landlord small inconvenience but it would be at the expense of the right and protection afford to each and every tenant that be not reasonable or justifiable and that be why will vote against the amendment hope that other will do the same and give renter the right and security they deserve renter have wait long enough this bill be overdue and it be time to deliver the conservatives have their chance they promise reform then water it down the renters reform bill gather dust while tenant be leave to suffer so liberal democrats absolutely welcome this government renters rights bill but let we be clear this bill must hold firm in protect the right of tenant my inbox be overflow with experience that should shame we all family sleep on the floor window that whistle in the wind home riddle with damp and mould and tenant harass by landlord to intimidate they out of their home this be not just about comfort and health it be about dignity justice and fairness energy efficiency must be front and centre too many renter be live in home that make they sick and be pay through the nose to heat they fuel poverty be national scandal and the bill have role to play in end that while the spotlight be on private renter we must not forget those in social housing or in home own by institution they deserve the same right protection and standard want to talk to lords amendment and ministry of defence housing it be outrageous that the family of those who serve and who risk their life for we be deny the legal protection that other will enjoy these family be often uproot isolate and leave behind while love one serve abroad or at sea yet they be tell that they do not qualify for the same decent housing standard as everyone else have meet family and service personnel around the country and even around the world through the armed force parliamentary scheme and one of the issue most frequently cite by those thinking of leave the armed force be their housing too many of their home be below par the government say that most mod home already meet the standard fine then what be the harm in give these family the legal right to decent housing if the home be good the law will confirm it if they be not that be why we need the law let we be honest many tenant whether in military housing church estate or country manor be afraid to speak out they be afraid to challenge their landlord and lose their home right must be for everyone accessible without fear or favour the government claim that council can not access the home for security reason but be sure the minister will know as do those of we who have military home in our area that most family home be not behind the wire for those that be there be solution we must find solution and ensure that these family have the same right no one should be deny decent housing because of who they work for want to address the attempt to water down the bill we in this house all know that some landlord use the excuse of sell up to evict tenant only to re let at high price do the hon member agree that lords amendment which would shorten that re let period from month to six month would severely undermine one of the main aim of the bill to end no fault eviction by make it disappointingly easy for landlord to evict on just that basis thank the hon member for raise that point and save the trouble of do so absolutely landlord give excuse that be perhaps not all they seem to be have hear from tenant who be terrify of be evict under section with landlord rush to act before the law change and evict with absolutely no excuse have hear from renter who feel like they be in david and goliath battle lord amendment be an attempt to treat pet more harshly the proposer of the amendment have it wrong as the hon member for uxbridge and south ruislip danny beales say tenant with pet be good news for landlord research show that their landlord be well off by over year thank to low vacancy rate and marketing cost for their property would be landlord who happily take pet amendment require criminal standard of proof for civil matter in my mind that be not justice but obstruction last week meet the housing ombudsman service it tell that one in five call that it deal with be from people it can not help private renter people in new build and people in conversion the system be break and the scale be tip too far from our tenant the bill must fix that we need one ombudsman one law one standard one rule wherever someone live if their home be own by someone else and it be not up to scratch they should be able to challenge it get it fix and live in decent home housing be not just brick and mortar it be the foundation of everything else health education family and work every renter deserve home that be safe warm and fair declare an interest as the chair of the all party parliamentary group on cat as an animal owner myself have two cat rise to give voice to the many concern express to by pet owner across the country their concern relate specifically to lords amendment which would allow landlord to request pet deposit equivalent to three week rent the amendment be narrowly agree to on report in the house of lords in july in response to the government decision to remove the right for landlord to require tenant to take out pet damage insurance cats protection have argue that the government decision to remove the provision allow landlord to request pet relate damage insurance be the right one as the insurance sector be not ready to meet demand competitively the minister in the lords outline many argument against the pet deposit amendment include that an extra three week deposit be unaffordable for many tenant she also refer to report commission by battersea cats dogs home and the university of huddersfield which find that of landlord report that they do not encounter any damage cause by dog or cat in their rental property she note that the government be content that landlord would be suitably protect against the cost of pet damage through exist tenancy deposit and wholly agree cats protection be also strongly of the view that charge an additional pet deposit be neither necessary nor proportionate measure already exist for landlord to seek additional compensation from the tenant in the very rare circumstance in which damage cause by pet may exceed the value of the exist security deposit the amendment could see tenant force to find up to extra for one bedroom flat in high rent area that would mean that those without additional ready fund be price out of have pet another problem with the addition of pet deposit be the potential lack of transparency in landlord decision on what constitute pet damage and what constitute the type of damage that would otherwise be fund by the standard security deposit some landlord may just see the extra fund as an option to withhold more money for standard wear and tear damage can be avoid with the use of throw and rug for example know that cats protection and dogs trust adopter be always give information on how to provide enrichment activity to keep pet happy perhaps the right hon member for braintree sir james cleverly would like to take advantage of those to ensure that his terrier do not tear up his carpet be concerned that the amendment will reintroduce the very inequity that the pet provision be design to remove put the price of pet ownership out of reach for many tenant and entrench geographical inequality we all know how beneficial pet ownership be not just for the welfare of the animal but for our wellbeing cat and their stat cats protection report find that over half million household who would like cat do not have one simply because their rental agreement forbid it strongly believe that the additional pet deposit should be withdraw from the bill the standard security deposit be more than adequate to cover any damage cause by pet will oppose lords amendment and encourage colleague from across the house to do likewise rise to speak to lords amendment and on the wide issue of pet ownership which many other member have speak about pet ownership in rent accommodation be an issue on which have campaign for many year in this house some member will remember the dogs and domestic animals accommodation and protection bill otherwise know as jasmine law that introduce to the house in it support the principle of pet in every home the british people care deeply for the welfare of animal especially in my romford constituency we all understand how important animal be to the life of human being as the owner of two staffordshire bull terrier buster and spike who be sadly no long with we know just how important the companionship of pet be to so many people especially those who live on their own own dog or cat or any kind of household pet improve both physical and mental health provide vital companionship and help to tackle loneliness in fact pet ownership be estimate to save our nhs around billion year by reduce the number of gp and hospital visit despite those clear benefit housing issue remain the second most common reason for animal to be relinquish to animal shelter and sanctuary such as battersea dogs and cats home which be privileged to visit only few week ago have have many link to that charitable organisation over the year particularly during my time as shadow minister for animal welfare some year ago with grow number of people rent it be absolutely essential that the bill work in support of responsible pet ownership in rent home rather than put further barrier in the way that be why must express my opposition to amendment and any clause that make it hard for tenant to keep pet the introduction of large up front deposit will only serve to price many people out from own pet especially in the ongoing cost of living crisis it be absolutely wrong that someone should be prevent from own an animal that they love and want to be with because of this situation the law need change as have argue for many year include with ministers in the previous government whom have to go and see before they eventually agree that this policy be the right one hope that my shadow front bench colleague will reconsider their stance commend the hon member for uxbridge and south ruislip danny beales for mid dorset and north poole vikki slade and for paisley and renfrewshire south johanna baxter for all their comment on this issue what should have be bill to unlock pet ownership for those in million of home now risk exclude they altogether entrench the idea that pet ownership be privilege for homeowner only that can not be right do not believe that be what the government intend early proposal on pet insurance know issue to do with that have be raise today but they can be overcome provide fair balance between the concern of landlord and the ability of tenant to meet the cost insurance spread the expense more evenly across the year and avoid the burden of large one off deposit it be disappointing that that approach appear to have be set aside by the lords amendment finally urge his majesty government to work closely with animal welfare charity and the animal welfare sector in general when develop the guidance that will accompany the bill speak as an honorary member of the kennel club perhaps should have declare that at the start and supporter of the dogs trust battersea dogs and cats home and of course cats protection it be important always to remember our cat we need clear definition of what constitute unreasonable ground for landlord to refuse tenant request for pet that clarity will help landlord and tenant alike and avoid unnecessary dispute end up before the ombudsman or court jasmine law have always be about the simple belief that people should not have to choose between home and beloved companion we must not let the bill through the lords amendment and particularly lords amendment undermine that vital principle wish to speak against lords amendment to which expand eviction ground and lords amendment also wish briefly to revisit the core principle of the bill which be end no fault eviction and provide stability not just for individual but for the private rented sector introduce private renter database and an ombudsman to restore right to private renter as well as transparency so that they understand their tenancy in more detail and to establish awaab law in the sector those be vital intervention in the private rent sector which we know be diverse and it be important that the bill become law as soon as possible all of we on both side of the chamber will recognise the impact that uncertainty on the issue have have on the private rent sector for number of year have to say that it be pretty unedifying to listen to the opposition renege on their previous commitment to end no fault eviction the first commitment from the conservatives to end no fault eviction be in think that be about four conservative prime ministers ago but have give up counting understand that the shadow housing secretary might not remember the position that the previous prime minister take on the issue but this provision can not come into law soon enough the number of private rent sector no fault eviction notice that my constituent receive and the instability that they cause in the sector be cause real harm and distress to those who live in it lord amendment to would expand possession ground and those completely unnecessary expansion provide yet more uncertainty in the sector they open up the risk of further additional claim and of introduce other ground for eviction which undermine the overall principle of the bill support my colleague who have speak against lords amendment which would raise the evidence bar it be completely unrealistic to think that it would be possible to do that not only because bidding war and contest often take place through verbal dialogue but because of the lack of resource available to local authority to investigate such case do not believe that the amendment be practical or be table in particularly good faith we want renter right restore and balance between renter and landlord can not stress enough the urgent need to bring forward the bill to give confidence to renter all those who rely on people live in private rent accommodation and those live and work across the uk who need the sector to be successful urge member to vote against the lords amendment and to support the government in get the bill into statute welcome the government move to empower tenant for too long in this country own property have be see as way to create additional wealth rather than the intention be to provide safe secure and warm home for tenant not all landlord be bad but there be some bad apple out there and all those who be unable to get on to the housing ladder or who actively choose to rent deserve security of tenure and confidence that they will not be evict at the whim of landlord which often mean be force to move out of the area and uproot child from school declare an interest because my young daughter have spend four year rent in london and for the last two she have be live in horrific mould cover flat she have to move out of the last one early because the mould crawl up the wall be so bad that it be affect the health and ruin the belonging of she and her flatmate in that be simply not acceptable for the thousand of people live in unsuitable accommodation we must ensure that local authority can take action against negligent landlord for that reason the liberal democrats do not support lords amendment support lords amendment which would extend the decent home standard to accommodation provide by the ministry of defence for use as service family accommodation in my constituency of south devon the prestigious britainnia royal naval college bring large number of military family to the town of dartmouth some of whom live in mod housing those family who commit to life of service the whole family be involve when one member serve our country deserve at the very least home that be safe comfortable warm energy efficient and decent be not sure that agree with the security argument offer by the minister give that much mod housing be locate outside military basis it be not beyond possibility to find way to ensure that local authority can access that housing liberal democrats have long campaign for decent home for military family who deserve exactly the same standard and legal protection as other renter and urge the house to support lords amendment turn to pet friend of mine recently fail to move back to devon because she simply could not find rent accommodation in her price bracket and her search be severely hamper by the fact that she have much love family dog be tell that she be not eligible even to look at property because of the dog be discriminatory and it make difficult search impossible we be in an area that be short of house available to rent if we take the average rent in the south west of per month the proposal to allow landlord to request pet damage deposit of up to three week rent equate to an additional up front which be simply out of reach for most tenant the current rental deposit cap of five week rent be sufficient to cover any potential pet relate damage and nobody should be price out of pet ownership simply because they do not own their own home therefore do not support lords amendment finally turn to agricultural worker agriculture be one of the large industry and employer in south devon which be predominantly rural constituency many of those work on farm as dairy worker relief milker and tractor driver be require to live on site as they have to work incredibly unsocial hour and live on site make the job slightly more manageable support measure in the bill that allow repossession when property be require to house agricultural worker whether they be employ or self employ farmer regularly tell how difficult it be to find housing for farm worker with many have to rely on caravans and cabin that be not suitable for long term living as it be increasingly common in farming for worker to be self employ we must ensure that they too be cover by the ground for repossession so support lords amendment be glad that manage to sneak in this speech and hope will finish it there have be many speech make by member on both side of the chamber many of which have focus on the many thing that the bill will hopefully achieve confirm that my hon friend the member for paisley and renfrewshire south johanna baxter do have two very cute cat now turn to more serious issue domestic abuse and domestic violence one of the most challenging case that have pick up as member of parliament since last july be that of my constituent caitlin whose situation have raise on the floor of the house previously caitlin partner be arrest for coercive control less than week after she sign tenancy agreement with he caitlin have never live in the property that they rent together but have have to pay thousand of pound of rent on that property because her mother be the guarantor and he refuse to pay rent on it the simple fact be that caitlin do not have the right she need to be able to get out of that situation which have have huge financial and personal impact on she her mother and her family be remind of what my hon friend the member for birmingham yardley jess phillips say when she come to fundraiser in lichfield few year ago government often talk about the need to defend the nation and their first responsibility be to keep people safe with more gun more tank and more police officer all thing that we need to maintain our freedom but too often skate over the fact that for huge proportion of the population we can not even guarantee their safety at home in support caitlin have work with the domestic abuse housing alliance an organisation of more than housing association and local authority work to ensure that every survivor can choose home where they be safe and free from abuse have speak to those at the alliance about the bill and some of the amendment that we be consider will read their reflection into the record as they have important implication for the issue be raise part of what those at the domestic abuse housing alliance want to see and that they urge the minister to do do not require legislative response we should however press local authority to ensure that if they be to be give investigative and enforcement power their staff be train to recognise domestic abuse and coercive control as separate issue rather than treat that solely as tenancy or antisocial behaviour issue the domestic abuse housing alliance ask we to ensure that the amendment make by the house of lords that threaten to weaken the bill be remove these change would water down right in england least secure tenure and put survivor at great risk halve re let protection increase deposit for pet and create new repossession ground all undermine stability and safety for survivor the bill must return to the commons in its strong form to deliver real security survivor must not be collateral damage in parliamentary compromise the bill be once in generation opportunity to put housing security and safety at the heart of renter right when hear that from an organisation such as the domestic abuse housing alliance find it difficult not to be proud to walk through the lobby and support my government in get rid of the watering down amendment from the other place we have an opportunity to make real change for survivor and be proud to be part of it with the leave of the house will close what have be brief but good natured and consider debate thank all right hon and hon member who have speak in open the debate set out in some detail the reason the government be resist the bulk of the amendment make in the other place but in the time remain will far substantiate some of the government argument and respond to number of the issue that have be raise in the debate several hon member question the government logic in resist lords amendment relate to ground they argue that it be too narrow as make clear ground exist precisely because we recognise the unique nature of the rental market we think that the ground as it exist cover the majority of the market but the truth be that no one size fit all solution cover all circumstance we have be clear we do not want to deny to non typical student the benefit of the new tenancy system under the bill remove the restriction could lead to student who need more security of tenure such as single parent live with child or postgraduate couple live together who have put down root in an area be evict more regularly the possession ground as originally draft strike the right balance and we will resist the amendment on that basis several hon member raise the issue of pet insurance and question why the government have change their position debate in the other place be extensive furthermore alongside that draw on the expertise of peer such as the earl of kinnoull lord de clifford and lord trees the government consult the association of british insurers and the british insurance brokers association follow such engagement we conclude that we be no long confident as we once be and as the previous government be that the insurance and underwriting sector will have sufficient or suitable product available at the scale and speed require for either landlord or tenant to purchase we do not want to leave tenant in position where they can not comply with condition set out as part of the pet consent grant by their landlord as that would mean as several hon member have make clear that they simply would not be able to have pet which would defeat the object of have the pet provision in the bill the government position be pleased to say be support by battersea dogs and cats home and other organisation hope that hon member note that report produce by the university of huddersfield which be commission by battersea dogs and cats home find that of landlord report that they do not encounter any damage cause by dog or cat in their rental property when damage be cause by pet that be an average additional cost of per property compare with for non pet relate damage the report also show that renter with pet tend to stay long in their property than those without pet indicate financial and social advantage for landlord in foster long and more stable tenancy in the rare case where the insurance and deposit do not cover the cost of the damage cause by pet landlord could take the tenant to small claim court by bring money claim to recoup any outstanding fund on that basis and have reflect we be satisfied that the exist requirement for five week deposit for typical tenancy be sufficient to cover the risk of increase damage by pet ownership as note in my opening speech however the government will continue to keep that under review we already have power available to allow for high deposit for pet if need the very topical and pertinent issue of share owner affect by the building safety crisis be raise by number of member the government be absolutely clear we recognise their plight as make clear we have already take number of measure to well support share owner in that position we recognise more can be do outside this bill we be more than happy to continue conversation with peer hon member and organisation such as the shared owners network about what more we can do in this space on issue such as valuation sub let request and repurchase we remain of the view however that the amendment in question could undermine protection for that cohort of tenant who happen to rent sub let home from share owner carefully consider argument make by the peer and their validity we will have further conversation will carry on those conversation to ensure that we be satisfied whether solution that do not undermine the core principle of the bill would allow we to provide that great support to share owner carer and the carer ground be raise by number of hon member we have all recognise the contribution that carer make but we believe that not only be there not sufficient evidence that the scenario in question be extensive that it be common but that there be real risk of the ground be abuse the shadow secretary of state the right hon member for braintree sir james cleverly mention the example of family across the country who own property and who may wish to move family member back in as carer gently point out to the right hon gentleman that if the carer be family member as set out in ground landlord can already use that ground to gain possession enable they to accommodate carer we think that lords amendment be draw too widely and be open to abuse we will resist it on that basis finally come to the last couple of issue that be raise several hon member make powerful case for not accept lords amendment and relate to the criminal standard of proof we be absolutely clear that the civil not criminal standard of proof be the appropriate one the standard of proof be low for the breach in question breach of the rental discrimination and rental bidding clause in the bill precisely because they be purely civil rather than criminal matter raise that standard of proof to align with other criminal offence would logically result in repeat instance of those breach on rental discrimination and rental bidding attract the high fine of rather than do not understand the logic of the opposition position but we very much think that those breach should remain subject to the civil standard of proof with the penalty of and without the impact on local authority across the country will briefly address the argument make by liberal democrat members about service family accommodation we have have extensive debate about the subject and know that they be come from an honourable place when they make those argument but gently point out that the ministry of defence have make it clear that in its view subject secure defence site to local authority inspection as propose in the amendment table by baroness grender be unworkable because of access and security arrangement as several hon member have say let we find solution to that the mod do not think there be workable solution and be worried about fracture how standard be apply across the defence estate as this legislation apply only to england as have say in the come month the government will bring forward defence housing strategy set out clear renewal standard and further step to improve accommodation have offer very clear concession from the dispatch box that we will provide for annual reporting to give the transparency and accountability that those standard will be meet be grateful to the minister for give way and for his engagement in the issue of service family accommodation will he consider bring forward primary legislation on the face of this bill or another bill so that service family be give the same legislative protection that private and social tenant be give be more than happy to continue the conversation with the hon gentleman and with liberal democrat peer in the other place but our argument today be that we can not accept the amendment table by baroness grender we think that the concession that have offer today from the dispatch box should be sufficient to satisfy the concern that have be raise will briefly address the incredibly important issue of implementation which be raise by my hon friend the member for tipton and wednesbury antonia bance this bill must receive royal assent as soon as possible the time that it have take for the legislation to make its progress through the house be not cost free family across the country have be subject to no fault section eviction which we know be lead cause of homelessness and renter across the country need the bill on the statute book follow royal assent we will allow for smooth transition to the new system and we will support tenant landlord and agent to understand and adjust to the new rule we want to make that change as smoothly and efficiently as possible and to introduce the new tenancy for the private rent sector in one stage on that date the new tenancy system will apply to all private tenancy exist tenancy will convert to the new system and any new tenancy sign on or after the date will be govern by the new rule we will work closely with all part of the sector to ensure smooth transition and we will provide sufficient notice ahead of implementation to conclude this labour government be go to succeed where their conservative predecessor fail we will level decisively the play field between landlord and tenant and transform the experience of private renting in england while we have show ourselves more than willing to make sensible change to the bill in response to concern raise we be not prepared to accept amendment that undermine its core principle look forward to continue the constructive conversation that have have with peer over recent week with view to secure agreement across both houses in the near future and commend the government position to the house question put that this house disagree with lords amendment diane abbott jack abbott debbie abrahams shockat adam

and other that people live with their disability and that those disability do not know the bound of such arbitrary time limit thank jackie snape of disability action yorkshire the royal national institute of blind people waterside changemakers and all the other campaign group who have help with the campaign and the petition we know that disabled people already face unfair and additional barrier when participate in society these structural and societal inequality include high living cost and limited transport option the petitioner therefore request that the house of commons urge the government to allow disabled people to use their bus pass at all time of day include during peak hour to promote fairness independence and equal access to public transport follow be the full text of the petition the petition of resident of north yorkshire declare that restrict the use of disabled person bus pass during peak hour be unfair and place additional barrier on disabled people who already face significant structural and societal inequality include high living cost and limited transport option the petitioner therefore request that the house of commons urge the government to allow disabled people to use their bus pass at all time of day include during peak hour to promote fairness independence and equal access to public transport remote coastal communities motion make and question propose that this house do now costigan meur ra madam deputy speaker be pleased to have secure this debate on government support for remote coastal community my constituency of camborne redruth and hayle be one such area and there be grow evidence that such constituency face distinct and underestimated challenge welcome the under secretary of state for housing communities and local government my hon friend the member for peckham miatta fahnbulleh to her new position accord to the office for national statistics around million of the population live in coastal settlement in england and wales in these community deserve strong representation in parliament because just as the human body often shut down extremity at time of extreme shock our remote coastal community tend to feel the chill of economic neglect first experience public service withdrawal under investment and erode socioeconomic opportunity to illustrate report by onward find that coastal neighbourhood be more likely to be in the low decile for income deprivation than inland area and half as likely to be in the good do my hon friend agree that the government fair funding review be right to take into account the sparsity and rurality of coastal area and visitor number into the new calculation for example hotel in cornwall in the winter can cost but in the summer it can cost and county council spend twice as much on home to school transport as london borough prove how much more it cost to provide those service in rural area agree entirely with my hon friend although think the government should go far in relation to visitor number because the current proposal look only at day tripper will come on to that issue little later in my speech we know that place matter recent report from the resolution foundation find that one third of pay difference between labour market stem from the place themselves not the people who live there that should be wake up call for all of we there be several interrelated pressure drive this deprivation that be not adequately currently reflect in government assessment of need commend the hon gentleman for bring forward the debate as say when speak to he early there have be many debate on coastal erosion and remote coastal community in my constituency of strangford as in the hon gentleman constituency the problem of coastal erosion be finance from westminster some year ago but that have now fall by the wayside the issue be not just about coastal erosion but about social erosion the closure of the pub the post office and the shop and reduce public transport if it even exist ever mindful that the drive to change that must come from westminster do the hon gentleman agree that there must be more money put into community budget to address great social isolation agree that be why on the back of this debate be call on the government to develop specific remote coastal strategy first there be the pressure of geographical remoteness itself physical isolation and sparse population drive up the cost and complexity of deliver public service in cornwall our landscape of small scatter settlement and constrain transport link mean that service provision be inherently far more expensive those cost be not capture by labour and property index alone on transport link do the hon gentleman agree that the final repair in phase of the dawlish rail resilience programme be vital to remote coastal community in both devon and cornwall agree the dawlish line be very important in relation to cornwall and it need to be consideration for relevant ministers member may not realise that sit here we be close to middlesbrough than to camborne in my constituency but remoteness be not just about distance it be barrier to access opportunity and resilience when visit teacher in torbay secondary school reflect on how there be often bay mentality and lack of aspiration for youngster do the hon gentleman agree that often in our local coastal community there be lack of aspiration compare with many metropolitan area where there be great richness of culture and opportunity for our young people entirely agree and will address that later in my speech the second pressure be seasonal demand from tourism while the visitor economy have long hold strategic value for coastal community the seasonal influx of tourist place immense strain on already creak public service such as waste collection highway beach safety and emergency response which face significant seasonal surge those fluctuation be not capture in standard funding model yet they have real budgetary impact tourism can bring prosperity but also pressure in cornwall summer mean more traffic more waste and more emergency call and significantly high cost than those associate with the resident population alone my constituency be lot close to here than the constituency of my hon friend it be just bit far down the thames we have strong tourist economy but due to the housing pressure across the country these day the housing and accommodation on the isle of sheppey hide masked community live in holiday accommodation all year round particularly in caravan that be not pick up in the government datum at either national or local level be interested to hear from my hon friend whether that be problem for he as well in my community it mean that we have high level of deprivation that simply be not be account for in the current government spending plan or formulae welcome the government revision to the spending formulae which will help my constituency but we could go far entirely agree with my hon friend again will come on to that little later in my speech on high cost the pressure that be feel most acutely by resident of camborne redruth and hayle as hear on the doorstep or in constituency surgery be housing coastal housing market shape by seasonal appeal have high proportion of second home and short term holiday let which significantly reduce supply and drive price beyond the mean of local people while many of those home sit empty for month appreciate the decision that this government have make on stamp duty to dampen demand for second home but be horrified to hear last week that the reform party suggest that the excessive purchase of second home in cornwall be not problem be disappointed that reform member be not here now in my constituency high level of second home ownership short term holiday let and holiday home reduce the housing supply for local family and force they away from their important support system do my hon friend agree that we need strong support for generally affordable housing delivery in coastal area such as our back by sufficient infrastructure my hon friend be absolutely right and that be something will talk about in moment there be particular pressure in cornwall but there be also pressure in other remote coastal area relate to second home ownership and airbnbs sorry should say short term let accord to datum from lighthouse cornwall have the large supply of short term let in the country the figure be around property which be up by since have long support compulsory registration scheme for short term let one that include fire safety regulation and look forward to the government forthcoming housing strategy cornwall suffer from chronic lack of affordable home appreciate that it share that problem with other remote coastal location with the second high housing target in the country and over people on the housing waiting list the scale of need be clear but our remote geography infrastructure limitation and construction skill shortage make conventional housing delivery extremely challenging thank the hon member for give way and for secure this important debate he be focus on tourism and housing but in my coastal constituency there be many business particularly in the fishing industry that could benefit from investment to deliver economic growth in may the government launch the fishing and coastal growth fund worth million over year do the hon member agree that in her response to this debate the minister should update the house on the progress of that funding and that those fund should be allocate proportionately to reflect the size of scotland fishing industry thank the hon member for his intervention be sure that in the fullness of time we will receive more detail on that funding which will be very important for the fishing industry we be certainly very keen to ensure we see the benefit of it within cornwall it have to be practical and it have to be apply where it be most appropriate the issue of home be an important one when home become investment rather than home for local people community lose their heart and young people lose their future as such the next pressure want to highlight be educational isolation and the lack of opportunity face young people in remote coastal location which have be mention research from plymouth marjon university show that school in such location struggle in vital area include school staff recruitment and retention support and external investment poor transport link rural road and seasonal traffic make travel difficult limit opportunity for both pupil and teacher and deter potential recruit our young people be present with hobson choice move inland to find work opportunity or face an uncertain future with limited prospect of home of their own that migration reinforce geographic inequality in recent report on the issue the institute for fiscal studies note reduce economic disparity require bring opportunity to people not just raise skill but build place where skill be reward its report specifically highlight that coastal area tend to lose out with migration reduce average earning by over in part of cornwall young people face the half compass effect with the sea on one side poor transport on the other and limit access to employer direct consequence of that lack of youth opportunity can be see in the age profile of remote coastal community accord to the office for national statistics the median age in coastal build up area be three year old than in non coastal area and of resident over be retire compare with inland thank my hon friend for secure this important debate he be labour south by south west to my north by north west it be good to have our community connect to government who make change for rural area and coastal community my constituency have much in common with his it face the same challenge of connectivity demographic and housing and it also have the same potential with fishery the people themselves the culture the language and the renewable resource which all of the community should have share in do he agree that we need not only more central government support but more devolution my constituency have be badly treat by devolution we face the ferry fiasco that have cost half billion pound we have face the farce of highly protect marine area be impose on we by devolve government that would have close down our entire fishery and because of depopulation we face the fiasco of reduce funding be punish for people move away do he agree that we need not only more central government support but more power in these peripheral area so that we can run our own affair thank my hon friend for his pertinent point about remote coastal area and the challenge we face obviously he face particular challenge that we do not face in cornwall as he also have to put up with an snp government since many resident live outside build up area the true figure on age might be even high cornwall have see sustained population growth largely drive by the migration of old people draw to its geographical appeal as place to retire this old migration population mean increase health and care need datum from the institute of cornish studies show that of household move to cornwall from elsewhere be economically inactive place huge further strain on public service funding formula rarely account for that reality we have more demand for carer more long term health condition and more demand on health and social care system in remote area like cornwall care be hard to reach and far more expensive to deliver with our age population come the health inequality that deeply affect remote coastal community the chief medical officer report on health and wellbee in coastal community identify coastal excess of disease drive by deprivation age profile and behaviour such as obesity smoking and alcohol use life expectancy healthy life expectancy and disability free life expectancy be all low in coastal area the report make it clear that in coastal community these factor converge to the detriment of local people who face income insecurity low pay seasonal work and limited educational capital the year health plan do acknowledge the challenge face by coastal community particularly in its shift from hospital to community care but more need to be do thank the hon member for secure this debate do he agree with about the extra pressure on people live in remote rural coastal community such as ilfracombe in devon the life expectancy there be year low than in other part of devon the integrate care board need to be fund for the cost of support the local minor injury unit at ilfracombe hospital especially during tourist time when the population of my area double be just glad that we have labour government who be take the national health service far more seriously than the previous government do my deep concern be that deprivation be not adequately reflect in standardised measurement particularly the index of multiple deprivation as the government primary tool for assess need research from plymouth marjon university due to be publish on september introduce the concept of pretty mask by cornwall postcard beauty the six key finding of the report show that the index of multiple deprivation do not give enough weight to transport dependency housing displacement employment precarity healthcare withdrawal educational isolation and community resilience although the measurement have strength without reform it we risk miss the deep structural issue face remote coastal community in june as be mention early by my hon friend the member for truro and falmouth jayne kirkham the government launch the fair funding review acknowledge that outdated model have short change place like cornwall it include long overdue remoteness adjustment previously drop in and recognition of some of the cost associate with tourism however in cornwall the ending of the share prosperity fund which have be use to develop economic prosperity announce on the same day that million of pound be make available for mayoral combine authority in the north and midland be bitter pill to swallow the index of multiple deprivation do not see the full picture and when measurement fail funding fail be pleased to see that new iteration of the index will be release later this year and that the department for environment food and rural affairs have be bring into the process to consider rural affair but the specific need of remote coastal community must be consider as well time and again evidence show that remote coastal community be often conflate with rural area overlook in key metric and treat as peripheral decision about these community must be base on accurate meaningful assessment of deprivation urge ministers to commit themselves to review the forthcoming research from plymouth marjon university because although it focus on cornwall the issue that it raise be likely to apply across most other remote coastal area also ask this minister to commit herself to dedicated remote coastal strategy to deal with these issue holistically our remote coastal area have so much economic potential but up until now government policy have seem to favour investment in urban mayoral authority area in london birmingham and manchester do the hon member agree that the government need to go far and appoint minister for coastal community be not sure that such minister be what we need what we need be absolute focus and cross departmental government strategy for remote coastal area in these area we feel acutely the focus on urban area and in particular mayoral combined authority without sustained investment in remote coastal area in housing transport skill and economic development our collective economic potential will remain untapped call andrew george meur ra madam deputy speaker and congratulate my constituency neighbour the hon member for camborne and redruth perran moon not only on secure the debate but on the way in which he cover the issue and make such strong case for the very special need of remote and coastal area we hope that the new group of ministers will attend to those need although the previous ministers be do good work in this regard and be not in any way dismiss or disapprove of that work as the hon gentleman say only of the population of england wales and cornwall be coastal in my constituency which cover west cornwall and the isles of scilly of the population live in coastal community and be in the far south west of the country we be in that sense remote most people in our area actually see london as remote indeed remoteness be concept that depend on which end of the telescope we be look through the big difficulty for people live in coastal area be the remoteness of where the decision be take and for they the remoteness be the other way around people in the centre be often not listen to or not hear the word and the need of people in rural area and in particular people in coastal area such as the hon gentleman mine and those of all the other member who have speak this evening welcome the minister who need time to absorb the magnificence of the hon gentleman speech be use my speech as buffer during which she can absorb that magnificence but want to add few point which hope she will take on board in addition to those that the hon gentleman make particularly want to embellish little furth his point about housing it be not an accident that coastal area often contain lot of highly desirable housing market where lot of people with wealth be very keen to invest their money that be very much an investment although sometimes they also buy house for personal recreational use what we have find in cornwall in recent year especially since the small business rate relief be introduce in be that there have be an almost industrial level of shifting of second home from council tax to business rate that be purport to be or actually have become holiday let for business rating purpose owner apply for small business rate relief and then pay nothing we be talk about wealthy people who can afford more than one home simply flip their property with the benefit of their tax lawyer and other depend on what be to their advantage in term of tax frankly one must take into account the obscenity of the fact that all those who have do that and be entitle to small business rate relief also benefit from covid aid so they receive four level of payment amount to apiece in the case of cornwall most of those people have their primary address outside cornwall and one might argue that they do not need penny piece of that money but they still claim it by the end of the last decade half billion pound of taxpayer money have go towards subsidise the wealthy have holiday home in cornwall have make this point to treasury ministers and housing ministers before and be somewhat surprised that ministers have not yet be prepared to look at this policy and to consider at least review it surely it be far well to spend half billion pound on first home for the thousand of family in desperate need rather than simply shovel that money into the pocket of wealthy second home owner hope that the minister will be prepared to look at that my next point be perhaps rather unique to the isles of scilly some of the big pressure that scillonian face relate to transport give that they be mile off the mainland not lot of people appreciate that from east to west my constituency be about mile when one take into account all that wet stuff between land end and the isles of scilly it be very expensive area to cover either by air or by ferry what we be seek for the isles of scilly be something approach parity with the scottish island people on the isles of scilly pay four five or sometimes six time the amount that people in scottish island would normally expect to pay to get on ferry or to fly to and from the island that also have an impact on freight and on build cost on the island mean that although we desperately need affordable home it be very difficult to get they off the ground within the viability threshold of homes england it be very significant challenge there be no parity in relation to old people bus pass because there be not bus and those subsidy therefore do not exist people who live in the off island have to pay significant or for ferry just to get from an off island to st mary to do some shopping there be no such thing as subsidised transport and the fare as for the bus would be really nice between the island if we could possibly get it the isles of scilly do not have parity with the mainland on that the isles of scilly also do not have parity on education there be not sufficient capacity in the island to provide it there so all the or year old under the mandatory rule that apply for education need to go to the mainland but there be insufficient fund available to be able to do that be talk to baroness smith at the moment to try to make sure that the isles of scilly get the full support so that student get the backing not only for transport cost but for accommodation and support there be lot of cost in relation to the isles of scilly that be simply not meet and hope the minister be seize of that the final point which the hon gentleman who represent camborne redruth and hayle emphasise and know he will be serve on the english devolution and community empowerment bill committee be that it be absolutely important to get devolution right in some coastal area such as cornwall it be really important not simply to apply the same bland uniformity that we might be able to get away with for other location place such as cornwall need unique settlement we be make good progress on that with the minister predecessor who be certainly understand and the conversation be go well hope that the minister will be listen to the voice of cornwall on the devolution settlement the only region for cornwall clearly have to be cornwall and there be very strong argument for it do not have the opportunity to make they this evening but know the hon gentleman and indeed all six member from cornwall and the isles of scilly be very keen to make sure that the message get to this new group of ministers that cornwall deserve special settlement on devolution if the speech of the hon member for st ives andrew george be nothing more than buffer dread to think what mine will be congratulate my hon friend the member for camborne and redruth perran moon on secure this important debate middlesbrough south and east cleveland be an odd constituency and my hon friend mention the middlesbrough part of it east cleveland be rural and coastal community define by its proximity to the north sea from the cliff of huntcliff and boulby which be some of the high in england to the hidden gem of skinningrove beach it be place of great natural beauty it be also place of great talent yet too often that talent be lose completely agree with my hon friend about the brain drain migration of young people inland to find opportunity elsewhere time and again employer in my constituency have meet and tell of their frustration at see their talent pool displace to nearby urban centre or even far into leeds york newcastle and so on hear the same from young people themselves who feel they have to get out to get on and that be hold our community back in so many way there have be lot of discussion about devolution quite rightly and completely agree that it have to be do in the right way we have devolve combined authority in our region and feel quite strongly that our coastal community and our rural community be not fully acknowledge in some of the strategy bring forward by the regional government skill be great example think insufficient work be put in to make sure that young people can access opportunity in some of the new industry come into teesside as my hon friend mention public transport be another example get from the furth part of my constituency to urban centre be extremely difficult and very challenging for young people and that be exacerbate some of these divide and the deprivation that we see coastal community be often describe as leave behind really want to get across the point that we be not problem to be resolve as think my hon friend say but an opportunity it be decade since ippr north publish report northern prosperity be national prosperity that can be extend to many community across the country by unlock economic growth in remote area we can benefit the whole country and the whole economy we be untapped in our potential motion lapse standing order no motion make and question propose that this house do now costigan government of many colour have miss trick by not invest and unlock economic growth in our community we be not problem but we could be if not address do the hon gentleman agree that if coastal community have just fraction of the investment in public transport that be make in place such as london and other big metropolitan area they would flourish beyond belief do agree that be part of the problem in our part of the world by invest in infrastructure whether that be public transport or grid connectivity for our manufacturer the entire economy across the country can benefit have one village aysdalegate which do not have clean water supply these be the basic of modern day life my hon friend the member for camborne and redruth mention towards the start of his speech that the economic divide among our region have lead to kind of fray of the social fabric there be danger that we become more vulnerable to the anger resentment and radicalisation that we often see in our politic it be mistake to assume that radicalisation can only happen to very small number of people who be particularly vulnerable it can happen to anyone when the economic condition be ripe particularly at time when social medium giant have build algorithm design to keep we angry and afraid and to make we think that our country have never be so bad it be important to remember that that be not real when we visit our coastal community we see that england be alive and well it be there in fishing village farmstead the stained glass of church window dry stone wall and roll field it be there in marketplace allotment and so much else we must not lose sight of that that england be alive and kicking that unpixellated england be wait for we all to come home be grateful to my hon friend the member for camborne and redruth perran moon for secure this important debate for my first day in this job and for his tireless advocacy on behalf of coastal community completely agree coastal community be vital part of our national identity serve as postcard of national pride and reminder of our heritage and share maritime history but behind those postcard lie another story as my hon friend have rightly allude to for the beauty of our coast can mask the everyday reality of the people who live there all year round these community face unique set of circumstance we know as my hon friend point out that coastal community tend to have old population and low rate of employment which often mean few opportunity for young people we know that the social mobility commission find that coastal community have some of the least favourable condition for childhood in the country disproportionately high number of child be eligible for free school meal and their parent have relatively low qualification level we know that these community tend to suffer from lack of connectivity point that hon member have make geographically economically and digitally with bad coverage and few business opportunity than in high growth sector let assure the house that this government understand the challenge face by coastal community the government mission be to reverse inequality and unlock the full potential of all our community include our coastal community to ensure that they play vital role in our economy and our future appreciate the minister list the disadvantage that we have in our coastal community although she do not mention the fact that our health service be overwhelmed in the summer the dawlish minor injury unit not be open due to lack of staffing for example do not help when number in our town double in the few week of summer it really be very disadvantageous for the local resident thank the hon member for make that important point about the pressure face by our coastal community particularly at peak tourist point it be important that we acknowledge that what we be try to do as government through long overdue reform to the local government finance system be redirect around billion of exist funding to the place and community that need it the most which will enable council include in our coastal area to deliver reliably for their resident we also acknowledge and recognise that delivery cost vary across the country deprivation remoteness vary ability to raise taxis locally and the impact of commuter and tourist as the hon member point out can all affect how hard it can be to deliver service in coastal community that be why we be committed to ensure that those factor be account for in future funding allocation an important move that will have an impact on our community be concern about the get it right first time nhs template that the health service apply to our health service in devon and cornwall it be system that be very much draw from the metropolitan experience of health provision and do not account for sparsity and the fact that we have sea either side of we can the minister assure we that get it right first time will take account of place where there be rurality and coastal impact on our health service whether it be our nhs or our public service there be challenge for we to ensure that we be design service that work for different community and that recognise the diversity of those community and that be what we be commit to as department we be commit to work with our colleague across government to ensure we be provide the service that people need tailor to the need of local community that be big thrust of the devolution agenda which be very committed to and passionate about on which we have make big progress as government and will continue to do so have submit proposal to the tees valley combined authority to get east cleveland economy move the focus of my invest in east cleveland event on friday will the minister commit to work with to bring investment into our rural and coastal community so that we can unlock job and growth for the whole country thank my hon friend for champion his area and for the work he be do locally and will absolutely commit to work with he the opportunity to unlock the potential of our area be huge and be very committed to play my part to help we to deliver that alongside that we be clear that we want to deliver wide range of programme to address economic social and health disparity across the country include in our coastal area in camborne and redruth for example we be already invest million via the camborne town deal through to march as well as million via the uk share prosperity fund until the end of this financial year in addition our billion plan for neighbourhood will deliver up to million of funding and support over the next decade into community across the country one in three of those community be coastal mean that up to million will directly support regeneration in coastal town and neighbourhood at the spending review the chancellor announce an expansion of this programme to as many as place include new trailblazer area such as barrow and bootle south with these area receive early support to tackle local challenge and drive growth the programme will help community to improve cultural venue health and wellbeing service and critically local infrastructure it will champion local leadership foster community engagement and strengthen social cohesion member raise challenge around flooding which the department recognise the department for environment food and rural affairs be take action to improve resilience in coastal area particularly on the key issue of flooding we be conscious that we need to take action as we respond to climate change the flood resilience taskforce be improve the co ordination between national and local agency which we need to get right we have invest record billion over this year and last year for the construction and maintenance of flood scheme support project and protect property by march over the next three year furth billion will be invest in flood and coastal defence critically we recognise the strategic importance of coastal community such as barrow which play vital role in our national security this government have commit to provide million over year to improve education employment skill and health and wellbeing alongside investment in the town centre there be significant opportunity for we to capitalise on the natural asset and strength of our coastline include by support clean energy industry finally on the key question of fair funding we recognise that we need to take well account of the driver of deprivation when we allocate funding we be consult on the proposal and take in all the representation we have be give and we will respond in due course member should be assure that we recognise the specific challenge in coastal area such as connectivity and their impact on deprivation we be try to factor that into the approach we be take with the fair funding formula as proud coastal nation there be many opportunity available to we and this government be already take step to make sure that we capitalise on they we be commit to work with member across the house to unlock the full potential of our coastal community thank my hon friend the member for camborne and redruth for bring forward this important debate and for be tireless champion of coastal community look forward to work with he and colleague from across cornwall and across the house be so sorry to interrupt the minister peroration but she cover without detail the funding formula for local authority and whether it will properly address the poverty and deprivation in rural area cornwall be the poor region in the country and achieve european objective status one of the high level of regional development aid but it be not see in government eye as the poor region certainly as far as the criterion be concern will the minister ensure that the criterion the government use properly assess the level of deprivation in rural area we be very exercised about ensure that we support area of deprivation and we always keep all index and metric under review my hon friend the member for camborne and redruth talk about the research which look forward to read in detail ultimately my objective be the objective of hon member we know that there be area that face huge challenge and we need to get the right support to they in order to do that we must ensure that we understand the issue and be target they obviously the metric that be use have critical role and the house have my commitment that we will keep this area under review be committed to work with member across the house on this issue we recognise the importance of our coastal community and we see huge opportunity the government be put in place large number of programme and support scheme and we be keen to work together to make sure that we unlock those opportunity house adjourn
