everyone in the house will be delighted and relieve at the progress she have make may also take this opportunity to pay tribute to nicholas howard this be his last prime minister question after support eight consecutive prime ministers through these session it be never my favourite part of the week but his commendable service make it far more manageable yesterday labour mp vote to remove the winter fuel payment from more than million british pensioner include those with just of income with that decision debate and make it be now important that the house understand the full consequence of the government choice may specifically ask the prime minister this will he now publish the impact assessment before the house rise the fact of the matter be this the conservatives leave billion black hole and they hide it from the office for budget responsibility richard hughes be absolutely clear that it be the large year ahead overspend outside the pandemic of course when it come to mitigation and impact we have put those in place ramp up pension credit deal with housing benefit and link it something that the party opposite do not do for year because of the tough decision that we be make to stabilise the economy we can make sure that through the triple lock increase in pension will outstrip any loss of payment but before the right hon gentleman complain about we clear up his mess perhaps he would like to apologise for the billion black hole this order want to hear the question when be in government deliver record increase in the state pension we protect the winter fuel payment and we give pensioner cost of living benefit the prime minister be the one who be take money away from pensioner on this have get nothing to do with the public finance just this morning his own chancellor his mps may not have be listen to she admit that she would prefer it if this policy do not even raise any money obviously the government would not have make this decision without an impact analysis yesterday the energy minister confirm that so ask very simply again why will he not publish the assessment now remember the day when the conservative party be concern about balance the book it have leave billion black hole responsibility for this decision lie there the only way we can rebuild our country invest in our public service and make sure that everyone be well off be if we clear up that mess and deal with the billion black hole last week we learn that the shadow housing secretary be call for mean testing of winter fuel payment and now it turn out that the shadow paymaster general agree with she and even boast about texte his own mother say that she do not need the payment until the right hon gentleman apologise for the mess that the conservatives have create he be in no position to criticise the action that we be take hear hear they be shout now but those argument do not even convince of the prime minister own mp who suddenly find yesterday that they have urgent business elsewhere we know why the prime minister be hide the impact assessment the labour party own previous analysis claim that this policy could cause death be the number in his impact assessment higher or low than that we be take this decision to stabilise the economy that mean that we can commit to the triple lock by commit to the triple lock we can make sure that payment of state pension be high and therefore there be more money in the pocket of pensioner notwithstanding the tough action that we need to take the right hon gentleman go around pretend that everything be fine that be the argument that he try in the election and that be why he be sit on the opposition side and we be sit on the government side pensioner watch today will have see that the prime minister have repeatedly refuse to admit or to publish the consequence of his decision we will continue hold he to account for that change topic today be back british farming day when we recognise that british farmer produce food that be of high quality and have high welfare standard and high environmental standard than import food at time of increase global volatility it be also crucial for our food security and national security will the prime minister therefore confirm whether he will be adopt the national farmers union recent proposal to enshrine national food security target in law food security be really important be glad that the right hon gentleman raise that we have talk to the nfu about it rural issue be really important that be what we fight the election on and why we have lot of rural constituency member sit behind now we will continue to talk to the nfu we take food security very seriously be not sure hear specific answer but farmer also do great work to preserve the beauty of the british countryside something be sure the prime minister will appreciate give his new find preference for landscape over political portraiture when it come to land use protection be currently in place to ensure that the most productive farmland be use for food production rather than alternative like solar do he agree that it be not appropriate or right that developer with vested interest grade the quality of that farmland themselves will he look at make that process independent rural community be neglect under the last government confidence be at an all time low and thousand of food and farming business be be force out of business of course we will work with they and get the balance right but again we be pick up and clear up the mess and rebuild our country as glimpse in wales the labour government hammer farmer hit they with top down eco target labour own assessment of those plan say that it would lead to thousand of job loss less food security and would destroy rural income while farmer describe it as bleak and damaging will the prime minister reassure english farmer that he will not threaten their livelihood and will he rule out impose those same top down target here we will work with farmer across the whole of the united kingdom as we have make clear to support they but here we be and it be absolutely clear no contrition and no responsibility for the economic black hole the broken nhs or the prison crisis the ruinous legacy of year of failure we have start rebuild the country renter reform house building gb energy the national wealth fund and the border security command could go on while the opposition try to rewrite history we be get on with build well country for the future be sure the whole house will join in pay our respect to lieutenant rhodri leyshon who tragically pass away last week my thought be with his family and love one and with the hms queen elizabeth crew during this very difficult time housing in portsmouth be in dire strait but local resident in portsmouth north have valid concern around population density infrastructure and the environment so be glad that this government be work on deliver affordable housing in the city will the prime minister ensure that the infrastructure be properly consider and that community be involve in the planning process for any new development let start by say that be sure that the whole house will join in send condolence to the family of lieutenant leyshon agree on the desperate need for affordable housing which be why we will deliver the big social and affordable housing uplift in generation

the early comment from the prime minister about our amazing late queen and join he in send our good wish to her royal highness the princess of wales do not think anyone could not have be move by her powerful video and we hope that she will make full and speedy recovery when it come to fight cancer we know all too well that every day count in the last year of the last government over patient wait more than two month just to start their urgent cancer treatment the bad on record will the prime minister help boost cancer survival rate by guarantee that every patient can start their cancer treatment within day thank the right hon gentleman for that question on really important issue report by lord darzi will be out tomorrow which will set out in stark term the failure in cancer treatment under the last government which be really serious issue this timeline matter which be why we be take step straight away to ensure that we comply with it because life depend on it we have already take the decision to put in more scanner and to use technology to catch this early it be very serious issue and very serious failure by the last government thank the prime minister for that answer will look at the plan the government be put forward last night liberal democrats vote against withdraw winter fuel payment we believe it be just wrong to balance the book by remove this support from pensioner but we do understand that there be difficult choice to be make to clear up the appalling financial mess leave by the last conservative government one of the many reason for that mess be the conservatives prioritise tax cut for the big bank cost billion year will the prime minister instead reverse those cut so we can afford to support million of struggle pensioner through this very hard winter will resist the temptation to get ahead of the budget what be important be that we recognise there be billion black hole that have be leave by the previous government interruption their practice be to ignore it and kick it into the long grass we be take the tough decision because be absolutely convinced that that be the only way we can start rebuild our country invest in our public service and make sure that everybody be well off my southport constituency have experience difficult summer first want to reiterate that our thought be with the family of alice bebe and elsie who

build infrastructure and maintain responsible stewardship of the countryside the welsh labour government policy be for all new power line to be place underground where possible the uk labour government favour overhead pylon why be the prime minister government oppose welsh colleague in wales we be absolutely committed to the transition to renewable energy because it give we energy dependence it lower bill and of course the next generation of job be tie up with it we have to do it in cost effective way but we will make those decision in cost effective way the uk steel industry need serious government who work in partnership with both business and trade union to secure transition that be right for the workforce and deliver economic growth in wales we know that deindustrialisation can be devastating for community so can the prime minister tell how the government be safeguard job and secure the future of steelmake community like our for generation to come we be take every step we can in relation to the steel industry because it be vital that we give it the support that it need we need steel in this country we need steel make in this country and our plan and our mission mean that we be go to need more steel not less it be the duty of the government to ensure that job community and people be not ignore in the transition and that job be protect the business secretary will provide an update to the house this afternoon oxfordshire have see huge amount of population growth in recent year without the infrastructure to match new railway station on the great western main line between didcot and swindon at grove and wantage would help to reduce traffic and improve access to both oxford and london do the prime minister support investment in our railway and will he meet to hear the case for new railway station at grove and wantage thank the hon member for raise this issue which be important for his constituent we be commit to put passenger at the heart of our railway great british railways will work closely with regional government mayor operator and passenger group to ensure that rail investment meet the need of community and will ensure that he get the meeting he want with the relevant minister to discuss the issue in his constituency that complete prime minister question will let the front benches clear port talbot transition project with your permission mr speaker would like to update the house on the improved deal that this labour government have secure for the worker of tata steel specifically as it relate to its plant in port talbot as well as set out the detail of this improve deal be also announce today our ambition for new uk wide steel strategy one that equip our steelmaking industry with the right support not just to adapt but to thrive in the new green economy but before do so want to address the situation we have inherit since become secretary of state two month ago have have to respond to series of challenge not just with the steel industry but in shipping such as at harland wolff and in other area where the previous government have simply cease to make decision and decide to leave they for we to deal with that be dereliction of duty and it have leave the steel industry in particular in an extremely perilous position the previous government have be promise plan for the steel industry for year with what be able to announce today with the signing of legally binding deal that enable tata to order its electric arc furnace as part of significantly improve package this government have make more progress in two month than they make over the previous parliament but if we have start these negotiation even year ago never mind year ago as they have the opportunity to do have no doubt that we would have secure an even well deal for the community so start with an apology to the people of port talbot because they be let down by the previous government while this deal be much improve acknowledge that it fall short of what would be my ideal have however be to port talbot several time and meet the workforce there along with the rep and the generation of family who have literally forge port talbot as we know it that be why when tata first announce that it would be close the blast furnace result in some job loss know that the workforce deserve so much well warn my predecessor not to proceed with what they have negotiate why because be confident that the government could secure well deal well deal for tata worker and well deal for the people of port talbot and be able to announce today that this government have secure that well deal but reiterate that if we have have the opportunity that the previous government have over so many year we could have do more the key feature be as follow first we have agree process with tata to assess investment opportunity for new additional capability that will deliver more secure long term job than the deal we inherit this be on top of the plan for the instalment of the electric arc furnace we have agree process with tata to take this forward and will report back to the house on that progress but this be the most important element so be announce the deal now rather than after the process be complete because for tata to secure the build slot for the electric arc furnace that element need to be sort now further delay would put the whole project at risk and could lead to much bad outcome secondly in every conversation have have with tata director have stress the need to avoid compulsory redundancy wherever possible have ask they to channel their effort instead into job matching and retrain so that the steelworker of port talbot who have dedicate so much to the industry in the past can now help shape its future as they will be able to transition and move within the business as well as that tata be agree to offer comprehensive training programme for any employee as an alternative for those at risk of compulsory redundancy this would be on full pay for one month then year per employee for month tata will fund all those cost employee will be able to choose from recognise qualification to develop seek after skill that will be in high demand in the local economy now and long into the future we know too that tata expect that during the construction of the electric arc furnace at least new job could be create which will tap into the local labour market wherever possible thirdly where we can not secure new job or training work closely with the union we have help to secure improved term on redundancy tata employee be now able to express an interest in the most generous voluntary redundancy package the company have ever offer for restructuring of this size employee will now be pay week of earning for each year of service up to maximum of year at the same time we be ensure that there be minimum redundancy pro rata and retention payment of for employee leave the business because of these closure over member of staff have express an interest in voluntary redundancy who will be eligible on these term fourthly as part of the deal the company will also be release acre of its site for sale or transfer this be valuable real estate which will help bring in more company and more employer not just from the steel sector but from whole host of other industry too help to diversify the workforce at port talbot while conservative members tell we that there be no alternative to the original proposal we know that there be and we have bargain hard for it and we be put in watertight condition within our grant funding agreement for job guarantee to claw back investment if these job do not materialise for example there be now an improved grant repayment of for every job that be not retain post transformation this money will be repay directly to the government and be powerful incentive for tata to deliver the uk job target but our ambition for steel be so much big and broad than one single company it be about the whole sector the uk have always be proud steelmaking nation with rich heritage stretch back to the industrial revolution from car to crane to ship and scaffold british steel have be and be still use the world over embody our industrial might and innovation yet for year steel have be neglect industry in this country crude steel production have decline by more than in the last year indeed some proclaim the industry decline would be inevitable in the century that it be somehow sunset industry but those people be wrong we on this side of the house have never believe that decline be inevitable and while the industry face challenge today we want to do everything we can to ensure that it can adapt and grow tomorrow that be why be pleased to announce that we will introduce our new steel strategy as hon member know our manifesto include plan to make available billion for steel on top of the million transformation of port talbot our intention be to increase our uk capability something the previous government never attempt so that we can create more vibrant and competitive steel sector in the uk as part of our steel strategy this government will look seriously at option to improve steel capability across the supply chain include in primary steelmaking we be clear that we can not prioritise short term subsidy over long term job which be why with the help of independent expert we will review the viability of technology for production of primary steel possibly include direct reduce iron steel be essential to deliver on our net zero goal and build the next generation of green infrastructure and know that labour member be passionate about that that be why under our steel strategy we intend to use the procurement act to drive economic growth and account for social value in the thing that the government buy and the project we commission work be already under way to increase the role of steel as we build our manufacturing base we recognise that for far too long britain energy intensive industry include the steel sector have be hold back by high electricity cost more often than not this have make the uk less attractive to international investor but we will take action on that our clean energy mission will ensure that we be no long expose to the kind of gas price shock that we have see in recent year and that will help british business to compete and win in the global market in support of that ambition we be work with like minded nation to tackle global trade distortion include through our chairing of the global forum on steel excess capacity this year our steel strategy will be develop and deliver in partnership with the steel sector and trade union and it will work in lockstep with the government industrial strategy which will set out our ambition to ramp up investment strengthen our supply chain and create more well pay job in the place where they be need most in order to drive forward our partnership on the steel strategy will shortly meet industry expert and interested party for discussion on the industry future we intend to publish the steel strategy in the spring of next year the government care about steel and the community it support and recognise steel fundamental importance to the economy support steel in this country be about be involve in the detail and shepherd individual plant into the future while protect the people in they but it be also about provide direction of travel an inspiration for investment and cause for confidence so that the sector can play its part in the next year and beyond we be not naive about the scale of the challenge before we although the situation be still challenge this be well deal for port talbot than be on the table and it be the maximum improvement we could make in two month it represent well destination and well transition to the bright future that steel will have under this government commend the statement to the house call the shadow minister thank the secretary of state for give advance sight of his statement wish could say that be surprise by any of its content but the medium and the press have of course be relentlessly brief on it over the last couple of day it be also no surprise that once again labour be preside over the demise of our steel sector output fall by under the last labour government and of job be lose today deal mean that of output will go at port talbot an electric arc furnace will take five year at good to get up and run some suggest that it will be eight to nine year before single new job be create if we see any new job at all as the statement say this be transition but it be heartbreaking transition for thousand of people transition from be in work to be out of work in his discussion with tata why do the secretary of state not take step to ensure that the blast furnace will not be close before the new electric arc furnace open be this not the new labour playbook scrap job scrap production and become reliant on higher pollute country for import that be not what call decarbonisation must say feel little sorry for the secretary of state who have be dispatch here to announce these spending decision just day after labour day of shame on winter fuel cut for pensioner in government the conservatives provide grant of million towards the billion invest by tata steel one of the large support package in the government history at the time of the last government announcement that support be expect to save at least job in the company we work with the welsh government and tata steel to establish dedicated transition board to support affected employee and the local economy back by million in total will the secretary of state provide an update on any of those job projection today announcement be notable for the absence of any reassurance or plan for the thousand of steelworker in scunthorpe who may not have job by christmas equally notable be the government failure once again to provide any detail on the domestic production of virgin steel the secretary of state say that we will have steel strategy in the spring but thousand of job along with production capacity have be scrap today it be no surprise that last week during the urgent question on steel four time the minister for industry fail to commit to safeguard the future of virgin steel production in this country be sure that the secretary of state do not need remind that if he allow the scunthorpe work to close too we will be the only country unable to produce virgin steel that leave we open and vulnerable to cheap foreign import particularly from china to his credit he have always argue against offshore our steel industry he concede once that it would be fundamental political mistake what conversation have he have with the secretaries of state for transport and for defence about the impact of the government new steel policy on our national security and ability to deliver infrastructure will he assure the house that he be do everything in his power to ensure that we do not lose virgin steel manufacturing in the united kingdom for the benefit of new colleague the government when in opposition be commit to billion year of borrow to fund their decarbonisation plan price tag that have magically disappear although the target have not the secretary of state make promise about that to the steel industry but where be those promise now where be that money be he still battle the chancellor we know that labour union be quite successful in squeeze money from the treasury so maybe he can send they to stand up to the chancellor if he be have problem the government have our support in ensure that the future of steelmaking in this country be sustainable that go beyond tata and south wales only in labour world can the word improved mean few job and higher pollute import when he return to the dispatch box hope the secretary of state will do well for uk steelmaking have be member of parliament for year in which have see some interesting political event but do not think have ever hear contribution with such brass neck that be quite something because there be quite menu to choose from let explain what be do during polling week in the lead up to july parliament be not sit and be shadow secretary of state be go between key seat as would be expect negotiate with union tata my colleague in the welsh government and every relevant body to prevent action that would have result in the entire closure of the port talbot work on polling day it be as though the government have already go they be not on the pitch the first thing have to do before even become secretary of state be ensure that there be something there to save because it would have go under the conservative party interruption conservative member really need to listen because my contribution be factually accurate and will help they to understand the real situation the point of the new investment be to save job there will be well term for the people who be unable to get the new job include well cushioning during their retraining for entry into the rest of the economy have explain why it be well deal as hope the shadow minister have see he mention medium report they have not come from my department but appreciate that there be lot of interested party the union and the welsh labour government recognise that this be well deal hope that the conservative party recognise on take step back from the statement why the deal will make such difference the shadow minister mention virgin steel let talk about my frustration about that he will understand that the two blast furnace site scunthorpe and port talbot lose great deal of money every day the manager be so feed up with the lack of action under the last government that they have put timescale on their closure the simple truth be that do not have the timeframe that be available to the conservative party moreover when it come to scunthorpe do not yet have the carbon capture infrastructure in place that will be necessary for the ideal solution would love to be position to look at the hybrid solution that the shadow minister put forward keep the blast furnace open while we bring the electric arc furnace online but all the time that could have be use to work on that be during the conservative government and they do not do that work there be therefore far few option available to we and the situation be far more challenging since become secretary of state have have many meeting with the uk management about scunthorpe and have have three meeting believe with mr li the principal shareholder also meet he when be shadow secretary of state we have be clear that we want transition in scunthorpe and want to put up government money alongside what the company may offer but that have to be part of transition to the future the workforce and the route that be offer to they have to be part of that even if we be successful in do that my frustration be that the option available be very difficult for the area the solution would ideally deliver which could have be deliver by the conservatives in those long year be not available when conservative member leave the chamber today hope they reflect on the mistake they make their lack of action the legacy they bequeath we and fundamentally the improvement we have be able to make in such short time call the chair of the business and trade committee be not yet chair of the committee mr speaker but finger cross welcome the secretary of state announcement hope the whole house will recognise that what he have bring we today be not set of sound bite but strategy in the long term that strategy will benefit from strong cross party consensus so hope that it can be the subject of future select committee inquiry the secretary of state put his finger on the key issue to safeguard the future of the steel industry we need to de risk the demand for steel in this country what reassurance can he give the house about how we will use procurement and crucially the creation of big offshore wind industry in this country to drive demand that will keep the furnace go at port talbot and elsewhere this country pioneer steelmaking now we need to reinvent its future order may say to member especially senior member that when they speak face the opposite direction from where be sit can not hear what they say please speak towards the chair that be how we keep neutrality work as well my right hon friend be absolutely right we be not just seek to deliver new improved transition deal for the key site but want to improve the overall business and investor environment for steel in the uk believe that can be do the kind of investment in core capacity that we be think about could be very successful in the united kingdom obviously two month be insufficient for the due diligence that be require on some of the elaborate and consider business case necessary but the process be about deliver that we can turn this into an extremely positive story for uk steel call the spokesperson for the liberal democrat party steelmaking be of vital strategic importance to the uk we need it to build the crucial infrastructure necessary to generate sustainable growth and safeguard our national security the neglect of the steel industry in recent year be just another part of the previous government disastrous legacy today announcement be welcome sign of change the step the government have outline to help protect job and crucially to develop steel strategy be long overdue we need to finally move on from patchwork of last minute rescue to long term plan that will set the industry on sustainable footing this be true of the steel industry and across our economy we desperately need real industrial strategy that work in tandem with this plan for steel will the secretary of state assure we that his steel strategy will be fully align with wide industrial strategy and will take view on steel importance to our economy and society as whole will it aim to balance the need for infrastructure national security and net zero commitment will he assure we that he will bring the strategy to this house by spring next year for scrutiny and debate so that the industry can finally move on with certainty very much welcome the hon member word and her recognition of the improvement that we have make with this deal fundamentally we have recognise the need for well business environment move away from relatively short term response to that much well more secure long term framework she will understand that the significant increase in investment that this new government be willing to make can make substantial difference however the emphasis must be on long term investment for the future so that we can secure those long term secure job there be several different way that we can do that absolutely agree that our method should be align with the industrial strategy and we will be able to make some announcement on that in the near future lead up to the launch of the steel strategy next year call the other potential chair of the select committee that be incredibly gracious of you mr speaker laughter think your word be hear across the chamber may welcome the secretary of state to his place and underline the importance of his commitment and the strength of his negotiation add my voice to those who talk about the importance of public procurement but may draw his attention to the carbon border adjustment mechanism as understand it we have disadvantage in this area because of how the mechanism be establish in the uk it be due to be introduce on january which be late than in the eu clearly disadvantage our uk producer will he update the house on what he plan to do in that area be grateful to my hon friend for his question and to you mr speaker for your very skilful introduction he be right to talk about that wide business environment and specifically ask about the carbon border adjustment mechanism we have inherit this situation of the uk be out of line with the eu obviously because our carbon price be low there be potential carbon barrier to uk export to the single market can tell he that we be look at that the carbon border adjustment mechanism be key part of wide policy environment that must deliver decarbonisation which be not deindustrialisation we must recognise that the current policy environment be not do that in the way that any of we would want listen to the statement from the secretary of state with interest will he specifically say first when the strategy will be publish and bring to this house secondly what level of government investment will be behind the strategy thirdly what assurance can he give to steelworker across england at port talbot and scunthorpe in particular that their job will not be put at risk because of steel be dump in the uk from china be grateful to the right hon member for her question we will see the strategy in spring next year and the resource behind it include the exist government allocation for port talbot and the new money that the government will put in it be billion clean steel fund so it be significant investment obviously want certain amount of return from that want to work with private sector partner the kind of capital expenditure that be involve in the transition to green steel require very significant partner who can deliver it be not just question of the government do this alone and think hon member recognise that steel safeguard be important the right hon lady will know that steel be significant part of the exist trade remedies authority protection many of which relate to china but not exclusively so and we keep they under regular review thank my right hon friend for today announcement and for remind we of the role that steel play in our green transition he have do more in two month than the conservatives do in year many of my constituent in monmouthshire especially in caldicot and chepstow work in the steel supply chain and in steel do he recognise that his announcement today have ramification for the whole of south wales thank my hon friend very much for her question let say again that wish that we be in position to do even more but can tell hon member that this be the maximum improvement that be possible within two month know that in constituency such as my hon friend people be seek more than anything else recognition that steel be not sunset industry it be vital to the future it be not the case that it should be in inevitable decline in the uk indeed we be an outlier in term of the size of our steel industry among comparable and oecd country this could be and should be very positive story and be honestly confident that we can deliver that in future the right hon gentleman mention procurement and over countless year we have have statement and new strategy for steelmaking will he set out his plan to secure long term order book for steelmaking in this country so that investor can make sure that they get value for money as well as the taxpayer equally how will he endeavour to use the public purse to purchase british steel while at the same time encourage the export of british steel to other part of the world be grateful to the hon member for his question and very much agree with he as the shadow secretary of state avidly read the statistic that the department publish about uk content in domestic steel procurement we must recognise that it be usually relatively high but only in the sector where we be produce particular grade of steel part of the strategy have to look at future demand not just for what we already produce but in term of gap and business opportunity if we be improve the business environment we need not just to help incumbent producer in the united kingdom transition but bring in new entrant create more competition in the market can see that there be significant demand in the market it be the market that be drive the demand for green steel have no concern about the future order book it be the business environment take advantage of that demand that this strategy need to address thank the secretary of state for his statement and for all his hard work in recent month it be clear that the delay in the negotiation have have very real cost when be visit port talbot on friday what the worker and the management want to know be whether those delay have now come to an end can he reassure the house that we will do everything we can to make sure that the construction do now get go on the future of this plant thank my hon friend for his question and for recently visit the site to speak to management and the workforce he be right about the understandable level of concern in the workforce obviously that be often speculate on in the medium and there be huge amount of interest in it make this statement today because of the need to proceed with part of the plan and not to lose everything entirely also want to be able to answer question such as his and to make it clear that the government manifesto commitment to the steel transition fund form part of wide ambition coherent strategy for the future of steel across every part of the uk the loss of virgin steel production in wales be serious economic blunder that will devastate the community of port talbot union have previously call for additional investment of million in port talbot to save job meanwhile germany have invest billion in decarbonise steel in one region alone this year can the secretary of state explain why he will not match the ambition of the worker here and government of other country to save welsh steel the level of ambition and resource that we have as new government be actually great than the figure that the hon lady have just give to do the work that she describe require private sector partner the government can not alone meet the capital expenditure need indeed to be successful it be well to work with private sector partner to deliver that have partner to retain virgin steel production be part of what the strategy will be able to address if have partner willing to keep blast furnace open would be very interested in that however do not want to spend this very large sum of money in our clean steel fund on subsidise operating loss for one or two year which would eat up most of that billion and leave we with nothing at the end of it want to co invest with the private sector for good secure long term job which be much in demand she be right to say that other european country have be way ahead of the uk in the past few year but the level of ambition from this government not only match that among some of those european competitor but exceed it what discussion have the secretary of state have with the workforce and their union about this improve deal the answer be great many as my hon friend will understand have always be conscious not just of the specific impact on the workforce at port talbot but of the fact that some of the big industrial transition of the past in the united kingdom in the north east of england where grow up be not handle well think people recognise that think that the previous government levelling up strategy be recognition of the long term damage that be do in the late and early by that transition get that right and show the workforce that this be government who care have always be paramount have be to port talbot several time last meet the community rep week ago and be able to have frank conversation with they in everything that have say and will continue to say recognise that we wish that we be in position to do more but within the parameter of what we have and where we almost be in term of the entire loss of the site be confident that this be the big improvement that be possible in two month we will always work with they to ensure that we be get everything that we can for the site the wholesale price of electricity in this country be already pretty much the high in europe and it will probably get bad as we shift towards renewable with the possibility of outage and intermittency that mean that electric arc furnace will become more expensive what be the secretary of state do to ensure that supplier do not perfectly legitimately turn to china for its virgin steel produce in dirty blast furnace the right hon gentleman will know that this have long be campaigning issue of mine have talk repeatedly about the relationship between decarbonisation and the potential for deindustrialisation and the policy environment in this country not be fit for purpose to deliver that on the wholesale electricity price of energy intensive industry for most of the time under the previous government the uk price be wildly uncompetitive there be some movement as he know with the supercharger policy near the end more can be do and there be an even more exciting long term position that we could get to he will have to wait for the budget and maybe the spending review for some more detail on that but this issue have to be an essential priority for the competitiveness of the uk we have to recognise that lot of the industry that we will transition to be very heavy user of electricity not just clean steel but for instance gigafactorie this will be key tool in the future that we have to do well on than we have in the past year congratulate my right hon friend on secure this improve deal know how hard he have work over many year not just in the short term before and since the election as he refer to in his answer to the shadow minister the hon member for mid buckinghamshire greg smith on procurement will there be presumption in favour of use british produce steel both in nationally significant project in green energy and in defence that would be in stark contrast to what the previous government do in particular with the fleet solid support contract thank my hon friend for all his support during our year in opposition when we tackle many of these issue he ask about procurement of course anything that we do as government will be consistent with international trade rule and our commitment to open market and multilateralism there be legitimate way in which social value can be consider in government procurement give the value and quality of what we produce in the uk be very confident in procurement play big part in the future of the steel industry on defence and the blast furnace he will know that neither scunthorpe nor port talbot play direct role in some of the key ministry of defence contract sheffield forgemasters play more of role in that there be more capacity and capability that we can look to as country for opportunity in the future the truth be and the country need to know this that the thousand of job and the loss of the blast furnace announce today be because of both main party obsession with net zero the reality be that blast furnace have be lose money because of high energy cost cause by very expensive renewable energy but we be where we be in the event that tata do not build the electric arc furnace that be be promise will the secretary of state guarantee the house that the taxpayer money will be return to the taxpayer be afraid that the hon member be misinformed as to what this be about the issue be that these site lose approximately million day they have do so for long time and the owner be feed up and want to know that there will be plan for the future the role of the government be to make that future well than it would otherwise be be we not on the pitch deliver it there be issue around the competitive cost of industrial electricity in the uk but they be not the issue that he say on the guarantee that he seek he will have hear my statement the contractual term of the grant funding arrangement include that clawback capacity not just for the overall project but even down to the number of job retain those be the kind of job guarantee that want in the public private relationship go forward welcome my right hon friend commitment to introduce new steel strategy steel be not sunset industry it be critical for our economy and national security know that he be friend of teesside will he give we some clarity on the status of discussion around investment in steel in teesside at the moment my hon friend be right to make that point we can not say enough that this be not sunset industry it should have bright future we can get this right on the negotiation my hon friend will know what have already say about the conversation with british steel it be very challenging issue we have make it clear that the government be there to play part and we obviously want that to be part of transition we have make that as clear as can be as soon as have further information will update the house thank the secretary of state for his statement as supporter of industrial strategy welcome the idea of steel strategy in the future but will ask couple of specific question on the detail first be it the government policy that the domestic manufacture of primary steel be strategic industry that must be protect and guarantee what do the government intend to do about the sourcing either domestically or through the import of coke coal early he seem to suggest that he would not intervene to support british steel in scunthorpe can he confirm that if we lose that capacity we may go five six or seven year without steel manufacture in this country welcome the hon gentleman support for industrial strategy have say many time that there should be as there be in many country cross party agreement perhaps not on the detail but on the premise and what we be try to achieve he ask about domestic manufacture and the blast furnace remain open that be of course my preference but need business partner company that be willing to do that do not think that it would be reasonable to spend the very considerable sum of money that we have pledge on subsidise short term loss rather than on the ability to deliver new thing he also ask about coke coal obviously that depend on the long term future of the blast furnace that be what they need in relation to british steel want transition plan my comment early be about my frustration that for the ideal deal in place like scunthorpe would have be to build the future alongside operate what we currently have that be available to the last government they do not proceed with it the kind of infrastructure need for the long term future of operating blast furnace would require carbon capture and storage it be cancel many time by the previous government and be not there be heavily constrain in my option but be still do everything that can to get deal for the workforce and to ensure that there be business there that command the support of its customer to transition in the future congratulate the secretary of state on announce the steel strategy after such short period in office the industry have be cry out for it for very long time the conservative party fail the industry by not produce it will he say bit more about what he hop the strategy can achieve for the steel industry throughout the uk in particular in motherwell in my constituency there be future opportunity particularly from renewable some of the steel that will be necessary in the automotive sector and some of the new technology that be be take up around other european country there be particular excitement about direct reduce iron how we deliver the business environment hopefully with new and exist partner be absolutely key hope that that be what the strategy will deliver thank the secretary of state for his statement which show the priority that the government be give steel in direct contrast with the previous government who have absolutely no industrial strategy it be real cheek of the shadow minister to suggest otherwise early will the secretary of state say little more about the plan for llanwern its dedicated workforce have be through hard time recently with support llanwern can turn into the fine automotive finishing line in the world will he commit to develop that and to safeguard the future of the plant say again that have the election not be call statement such as this would not have be not possible it would have pass we by that be the situation that we face my hon friend rightly talk with pride about her constituent at llanwern which be an incredibly important and successful part of the industrial supply chain in the united kingdom will ensure as part of the transition that the downstream function which be so valuable and praise and which carry such respect in the industry be protect and that the transition plan do not disrupt the business model which be again proof of the sector success and of future opportunity thank the secretary of state very much for his statement and welcome his endeavour which think we all recognise to create firm foundation for the sector as it move forward also recognise his commitment to harland wolff to which he refer that be indeed great news not just for worker but for the construction sector in northern ireland however the steel industry face the problem of affordable energy which he mention in his introduction will he safeguard the long term sustainability of that and other industry by immediately address the energy price crisis and implement the necessary long term green energy fix be extremely grateful to the hon member for his support for what we have announce have competitive environment be an absolutely key issue be already have extensive conversation with the chancellor and key cabinet colleague include the secretary of state for energy security and net zero about the way to do that not just in the short term but in the long term when we will clearly have significant renewable energy base there be lot of exciting option available include in how we use some of that capacity in area of low consumer demand can tell he that that be key priority for get this right in future congratulate my right hon friend on the deal that he have announce as former british trade commissioner to india assure he that it be well deal from well and more serious government than the conservative government will he tell the house what direct conversation he have have with tata about future investment in the uk be grateful to my hon friend although know that the workforce have at time be frustrate by tata plan understand why tata itself be frustrate by the previous government and how long it take to do the deal in opposition have extensive conversation with tata to build the kind of relationship that have be necessary to deliver something like this meet executive chair chandra at davos and then fly to mumbai as colleague may remember to build that relationship also see he yesterday alongside the prime minister and the chancellor because he be in the united kingdom we be continue those conversation and work with all partner to deliver the kind of opportunity that we think will be available in the uk in future patrick finucane murder with permission mr speaker would like to make statement about the death of patrick finucane patrick finucane be human right lawyer on february he be brutally murder in his home in north belfast by loyalist paramilitary group the ulster defence association in front of his wife geraldine who be wound and his three child one of whom be now the hon member for belfast north john finucane from that day onwards mrs finucane and her family have campaign tirelessly in search of answer about the killing of their love one in an inquest be open and close on the same day with an open verdict subsequently number of investigation and review be conduct in follow the collapse of power sharing the uk and irish governments agree at weston park to establish public inquiry into number of trouble relate case if recommend by an international judge judge peter cory be appoint to conduct review of each case and in he recommend that the uk government hold public inquiry into four death those of rosemary nelson robert hamill billy wright and patrick finucane judge cory also recommend that the irish government establish tribunal of inquiry into the death of former royal ulster constabulary officer bob buchanan and harry breen inquiry be promptly establish in all those case with one exception the death of mr finucane meanwhile in the third investigation by sir john stevens into allege collusion between the security force and loyalist paramilitary have conclude that there have be state collusion in mr finucane kill that investigation be follow by the conviction in of one of those responsible ken barrett with criminal proceeding conclude the then northern ireland secretary paul murphy make statement to parliament set out the government commitment to establish an inquiry but despite number of attempt the government be unable to reach agreement with the finucane family on arrangement for one in the coalition government decide against an inquiry instead review of what have happen lead by sir desmond de silva qc be establish sir desmond conclude that he be leave in no doubt that agent of the state be involve in carry out serious violation of human right up to and include murder the publication of his finding in lead the then prime minister david cameron to make from this dispatch box an unprecedented apology to the finucane family on behalf of the british government cite the shocking level of state report december vol in this case in the supreme court find that all the previous investigation have be insufficient to enable the state to discharge its obligation under article of the european convention on human right the court identify number of deficiency in the state compliance with article in particular sir desmond review do not have the power to compel the attendance of witness those who meet sir desmond be not subject to testing as to the accuracy of their evidence and potentially critical witness be excuse from attendance in november the then secretary of state for northern ireland announce that he would not establish public inquiry at that time pende the outcome of continue investigation but that decision be quash by the northern ireland high court in december this government take our human right obligation and our responsibility towards victim and survivor of the trouble extremely seriously the plain fact be that two decade on the commitment make by the government to establish an inquiry into the death of mr finucane first in the agreement with the irish government and then to this house remain unfulfilled it be for that exceptional reason that have decide to establish an independent inquiry into the death of patrick finucane under the inquiries act have of course meet mrs finucane and her family first on july to hear their view and again yesterday to inform they of my decision mrs finucane ask the government to set up public inquiry under the act and as have just tell the house the government have now agree to do that in line with the supreme court ruling and the court of appeal judgment of july this year in make this decision have as be require consider the likely cost and impact on the public finance it be the government expectation that the inquiry will while do everything that be require to discharge the state human right obligation avoid unnecessary cost give all the previous review and investigation and the large amount of information and material that be already in the public domain indeed in the most recent high court proceeding the judge suggest that an inquiry could build on the significant investigative foundation which be already in place as part of my decision make process also consider whether to refer the case to the independent commission for reconciliation and information recovery the commission have power comparable to those provide by the act to compel witness and to secure the disclosure of relevant document by state body power identify by the supreme court as be crucial for the government to discharge their human right obligation the commission be find in separate proceeding in february this year by the high court to be sufficiently independent and capable of conduct article compliant investigation and while be committed to consider measure to far strengthen the commission have every confidence in its ability under the leadership of sir declan morgan to find answer for survivor and family however give the unique circumstance of the case and the solemn commitment make by the government in and again in the only appropriate way forward be to establish public inquiry many of we in this house remember the savage brutality of the trouble truly terrible time in our history and we must never forget that most of the death and injury be the responsibility of paramilitary include the ulster defence association the provisional ira and other we should also always pay tribute to the work during that time of the armed force police and security service the vast majority of whom serve with distinction and honour and so many of whom sacrifice their life in protect other it be very hard for any of we to understand fully the trauma of those who lose love one son and daughter spouse and partner father and mother and what they have be through there be of course nothing that any of we can do to bring they back or erase the deep pain that be cause but what we can do be seek transparency to help provide answer to family and work together for well future for northern ireland which have make so much progress since these terrible event hope that the inquiry will finally provide the information that the finucane family have seek for so long the government will seek to appoint chair of the inquiry and establish its term of reference as soon as possible and will update the house far commend this statement to the house call the shadow secretary of state thank the secretary of state for his statement and for advance sight of it and his courtesy call this morning be particularly grateful to he for bring it forward before recess know the deadline that the court give he be september so it be important that we have the chance to hear the government position and ask question before we rise for conference recess the murder of patrick finucane like so many murder during the trouble be dreadful act of violence that must not be forget the opposition stand by the finding of the de silva report that while there be no evidence of an overarch state conspiracy in the case of his murder there be shocking level of collusion something for which the then prime minister now lord cameron rightly apologise to the house in that year fully appreciate the secretary of state desire to bring the matter to close after very long period and know that full public inquiry will do it but wish to ask serious question about the decision to choose full public inquiry over one of the alternative that he mention it be clear that the finucane family who have suffer so much be owe further and deep investigation that much be make clear by the supreme court finding in february when it note that the de silva report have not be able to compel witness or take its evidence in public in other word it have not be article compliant however as the secretary of state say this year the belfast high court conclude that the icrir be capable of conduct an article compliant investigation and be sufficiently independent to do so my first question to the secretary of state be give that the icrir have power to compel witness and take evidence in public what be it that full public inquiry will be able to do that the icrir can not this be important because the icrir be already fully staff and active and could begin work quickly whereas the establishment of full public inquiry and the building of that team will inevitably take time give the opportunity for further delay ask he to set out for the house what step he be take to ensure that the public inquiry be conduct as quickly as possible can he give an undertaking to have appoint chair and agree term of reference before the end of the year say in his statement he refer to the high court proceeding where the judge suggest that an inquiry could build on the significant investigative foundation which be already in place hope that will mean that we can have term of reference relatively fast similarly in the secretary of state conversation with his right hon friend the chancellor have the secretary of state set an expectation of time and cost we know from previous public inquiry that unless these thing be consider early on the inquiry can take long time and cost great deal on the issue of the icrir itself be pleased to hear that the commission have the secretary of state confidence we agree that it be show itself to be an excellent and effective body with highly capable chair note that it be also the creation of the previous government it be create as he know by the northern ireland troubles legacy and reconciliation act which his government have commit to repeal indeed the house will appreciate that large part of that legislation be give over to the creation of the icrir ask he to reassure we that he have no intention of repeal that part of the act return to the public inquiry that have just be announce there be one other issue on which we should seek clarity today in his statement the secretary of state refer to the unique circumstance of the case it be important that we understand exactly what those unique circumstance be because it be important that the government do not unwittingly set precedent for many more public inquiry as veteran of the cabinet office become acutely aware of danger that public inquiry could cease to be the exception and become the rule give that there be think to be thousand of murder from the trouble still unsolved there be risk of set precedent that would make inquiry the rule there will be those who ask that if there be to be full public inquiry in one murder case why not in another or in many other to avoid that happen if this case be as the secretary of state say genuinely unique the government have responsibility to set out why that be we must not risk turn the system of public inquiry into more routine process be sure that he will feel the same way and ask he to make that commitment thank he for his statement be grateful to the opposition spokesperson for his opening remark and will respond directly to his very legitimate question what be unique about this case apologise for the length of the opening statement but think it be really important to take the house through the history be the commitment give on two previous occasion by the government of our country that there would be public inquiry to come to his last question it set no precedent but there be exceptional circumstance relate to this case that lead to take this decision will of course especially as the finucane family have be wait year seek to establish the inquiry as quickly as possible we have to appoint judge the judge then have to be consult by myself about the term of reference the time it take will depend on how the inquiry unfold be acutely conscious of cost the hon gentleman point be extremely fair which be why it seem to that give all the material and information that be already out there what the inquiry can most usefully do be not seek to go over all of that but interrogate the information material and witness as necessary as the supreme court make clear that be what have be miss that lead it to conclude that this be not article compliant we have commitment to repeal and replace the legacy act and we will begin that process shortly finally lay to rest the conditional immunity the hon gentleman will have hear what the government have say about civil case and inquest on the independent commission while shadow this role in opposition and since take up the office of secretary of state have be very clear that while we want to return to the principle of the stormont house agreement there need to be information recovery and there need to be continue investigation it be true that the agreement envisage two separate body but those function be combine in the icrir as have be very frank in say now that body have be establish and all its staff appoint really do not see the point in abolish it only to recreate something that look very much like what we have today it be pragmatic decision that have take also make clear in my statement that be committed to consider further step to strengthen the icrir independence and its power as necessary hope that provide the hon gentleman with the reassurance he be look for on january conservative minister douglas hogg claim in parliament that solicitor in northern ireland be unduly sympathetic to the cause of the report standing committee january seamus mallon mp respond that he have no doubt that there be lawyer walk the street or drive on the road of the north of ireland who have become target for assassin bullet as result of the statement that have be make tonight official report standing committee january three week later lawyer pat finucane be shoot time and murder in his own house in front of his wife and three child commend geraldine finucane and the finucane family include of course the hon member for belfast north john finucane on their tireless campaign to get to this point and thank the secretary of state for finally do the right thing on behalf of the british government in announce this inquiry when do he envisage the inquiry begin thank the hon gentleman for his appreciative word he allude to very very unhappy history in this and many other case do take the point make by the hon member for brentwood and ongar alex burghart about all the pain and suffering that all family have experience but in this particular case have decide that this inquiry be the right thing to do the murder of patrick finucane remain shocking crime even now year on and even in the context of so many tragedy that take place during the trouble in northern ireland be sure that the thought of everyone in the house be with the family of patrick finucane as mine be they have suffer for so long wait for answer after that terrible day and hope that the independent inquiry announce by the secretary of state will go some way towards bring at least some closure for the family after all these decade the liberal democrats welcome the secretary of state statement and his announcement of the independent inquiry but do he agree that there be need to acknowledge the wide need for truth and justice in northern ireland in contrast to the shadow secretary of state the hon member for brentwood and ongar alex burghart ask he whether he will come to the house with wide statement on repeal the legacy and reconciliation act which of course the liberal democrats oppose in the last parliament and talk more widely about the role of legacy in northern ireland which of course be so important can also ask the secretary of state to clarify the ability of this inquiry to compel document and witness and like other can ask about the timescale of the inquiry be sure he agree that patrick finucane family have wait long enough already be grateful to the hon gentleman for welcome the inquiry and be very happy to give he and all member of the house an assurance that as we develop our proposal be in the process of talk to lot of people about how to give effect to the repeal and replace commitment that be in the gracious speech will of course come back to the house with proposal in due course and keep it inform the honest answer to the question he and other member have put be that want to get on with this inquiry as soon as possible but have certain duty that have to undertake in order to give effect to it however after this long period of time let we get go with this inquiry as soon as we possibly can the brutal murder of pat finucane in front of his wife and child be mire in collusion before the killing as it have be in the many long year since today be about the tenacity of the finucane family include my constituency neighbour the hon member for belfast north john finucane but it will have resonance for many other victim of the trouble whose need have for many year be put behind the need of the victim maker who want the truth to remain covered up be so glad that the truth may now finally out for this family as the secretary of state know many other family have face obstruction from state and non state actor in their quest for truth and reconcile future be think of family such as those of the victim of freddie scappaticci the family of sean brown and many other will the secretary of state commit to the same swiftness and determination in remove the barrier that have be place in front of those family in their quest for truth the hon member have allude to number of case of course we be await the final report on operation kenova the interim report have be publish early this year undertake and make commitment as any holder of this office would do to carefully consider each individual case and reach what think be sensible way forward collectively there be huge task for all of we in play our part in enable family to find out answer that they have not yet have in that context welcome the icrir announcement on monday this week that it have have inquiry and have already agree to start look into eight case that be significant because there be those who say that no one should go anywhere near the icrir because of its origin and parentage if may use that phrase however have take the decision that the icrir will remain in place it do have power it have the ability to get information and to question people and it have say that it want to develop what it call system of enhanced inquisitorial proceeding which be public hearing of course hearing in public be really important to many family because they want the truth to come out and to be able to ask question but crucially for justice to be see to be do can press the secretary of state far on the issue of other family month ago under the previous government those family see bill which do not support repress and restrict their ability to have inquest today they see full public inquiry be announce for another family will the secretary of state update the house on what personal engagement he will have with those family inevitably they be go to say we have get public inquiry in this case but we be be ask to wait in the queue for this legacy bill inquest body they will think something be not right about that be very grateful to the right hon gentleman who be such distinguished holder of the office now hold for raise that point over the past three week have meet number of those family whose inquest be bring to an end some because of the may portculli that come down and bring an end to the inquest other because the coroner have say we do think we can take this any far because of issue to do with confidential material undertake to the house to reach decision in those case and inform the family as quickly as possible as have say before one of the reason why we make our commitment in relation to the legacy act be this what be it about this part of our united kingdom that mean citizen should be deny the right to bring civil case which be what the act do and to have an inquest that can not be right and proper which be why this government have make that commitment welcome the secretary of state statement and be sure all colleague give thank that northern ireland and its people now live in peace can the secretary of state tell we how he think this announcement will help contribute to continued and meaningful reconciliation in northern ireland for one family this now provide process but be very conscious that many other family will say what about we that be why we need to find the most effective mean to get to the truth and that be part of the reason as have explain why decide that we would not get rid of the commission have meet sir declan morgan number of time and have confidence in his ability to do his work we have to find practical mean of provide answer to all of those family so that they feel their story can be tell and they can get what they have be look for the point wish to emphasise again to the house be that this particular case be exceptional for the reason set out in my statement one of the thing the secretary of state do not outline in his statement be that the supreme court consider whether it be appropriate not to proceed with public inquiry and that the supreme court agree provide that an investigation could satisfy article compliance he have say today that the icrir not only have his trust and confidence but have the ability to perform such task for other family so when he rightly say that family across northern ireland will ask the question what about we so too do because the most exceptional circumstance about this be the exceptionality of treatment over family still have neither truth nor justice and if the plan enact last year continue they will never get justice would ask he in repudiate the icrir and suggest today that it be not an appropriate mechanism for the finucane family and do not besmirch their grief or their quest for truth and justice but it be appropriate for every other how can he honestly look victim in the eye and say that there be not hierarchy there should not be hierarchy and the right hon gentleman and share reservation with indeed opposition to the legacy act because it do cut off lot of route to justice in the end think family should have the opportunity to avail themselves of inquest and civil case but the commission be now in existence the honest answer to his question be that in this particular case and this do not apply to any of the other the government of our country make commitment twice once at weston park and secondly by the then secretary of state to establish public inquiry think it be right and proper the government in the past have make that commitment that we honour it and that be the answer would give he the state collusion in the murder of human right lawyer in front of his wife and child be an incredibly serious matter that chill we all so very much welcome the decision by my right hon friend the secretary of state for northern ireland on public inquiry into the murder of pat finucane it be decision to be welcome and it be good signal from our new government that they be meet their commitment and obligation however this very welcome announcement must of course be follow by the action that the secretary of state have rightly outline will my right hon friend therefore give further reassurance to this house that all necessary resource will be provide so that there can be truth and justice in this incredibly important matter be grateful to my hon friend and constituency neighbour for what he have say have make this decision think all of we would recognise the need to get on with it as swiftly as possible this be bad decision today it will cause anger and far hurt for the many hundred of family who have not have justice for the murder of their love one include the mass murder of protestant workman at kingsmill the blow up of protestant workman at teebane and the horrendous murder of worshipper at tullyvallen among other think the secretary of state have to explain to the house why after ten of million of pound have be spend on inquiry and review of this case he still believe it be necessary to acquiesce in the demand of the family by have another inquiry how do he justify it to those hundred of family that no such resource will be put in place to seek out the truth about the murder of their family member give the record of inquiry of this nature be golden goose for barrister and solicitor in northern ireland how be he go to ensure that the cost be cap the right hon member recount some of the terrible murder and have myself meet as be sure other have the only survivor of the kingsmill massacre and hear at first hand the truly chilling story of what happen on that day first considerable resource be now be give to the independent commission and it be important to recognise that because it have huge task on its hand hope other will come forward to the commission to avail themselves of what it can offer secondly and have say this to other member in answer their question in this particular case commitment be make twice and think it be important that we honour it we also have to recognise in this particular case that the court hold in that all of the investigation accept what the right hon member say about they and their extent and of course they involve the expenditure of public money do not meet the requirement of article face with that and face with the quashing at the end of of the decision of previous secretary of state not to call an inquiry pende further investigation it have fall to to look at this and to decide how we be go to go forward have set out my reason as clearly as can hope to do will the secretary of state clarify that he have now end any opportunity for the family and love one who still hold out hope that there would be an inquiry into the death and murder of their love one at the hand of terrorist across northern ireland be he say that the only opportunity for they be to go to the independent commission for reconciliation and information recovery an organisation that do not have the full support of the community of northern ireland and do not have the support of and have be query by many of the family who have lose love one can just seek clarity from the secretary of state that he be say to those family that their only opportunity for truth recovery and justice be to go through this organisation and that he will not engage with they about further inquiry say to the hon gentleman that the independent commission should not be the only opportunity open to they that be why have indicate that this government will restore civil case and we will restore inquest in the first instance in those case where they have be bring to an end by the legacy act agree with he that it would be quite wrong if one be to say that there be only one route deny people the family the right to inquest and civil case that apply in all other part of the united kingdom that be one of the thing about the legacy act that be so profoundly wrong it do not say that we be go to establish new body and people could use that route but could also use the other two inquest and civil case that have be available to they thus far it shut those other route down that be part of the reason why the legacy act be so widely opposed in northern ireland must be honest that it will take time because it will obviously require primary legislation to deal with the bit of the legacy act that stop the inquest and the civil case and that will flow from the consultation be currently undertake thank the secretary of state for his statement we should all put on record our thank to the hon member for belfast north john finucane his mother geraldine and all the finucane family who have campaign for so long as have so many other for this inquiry recognise the difficulty in prescribe what an inquiry should do the cost of it and the length of time it should take but can the secretary of state tell we roughly when we can expect to establish the inquiry in its formal setting can he give some kind of outline timetable for how long it will take to hopefully bring about resolution after the disgraceful murder of pat finucane all those year ago as have already indicate will seek to establish the inquiry as quickly as possible how long it will take be ultimately in the hand of the judge when he or she be appoint thank the secretary of state for his statement as he understand the democratic unionist party stand against the legacy legislation in the interest of pursue justice for victim what he say today will give hope to family such as those affect by kingsmill have an adjournment debate on the kingsmill massacre in the last session on january year innocent man who just happen to be protestants be murder with weapon that be link to other serious republican terrorist crime over year period information have indicate that the perpetrator be help by the garda síochán clearly some of the garda síochán have ira sympathy it could be say that by their very position they be agent of the state of the republic of ireland will the family of those innocent protestant man be grant the same path to justice as the finucane family if no inquiry be grant on kingsmill it will be perceive and indeed will be prove by the secretary of state himself that two tier system of justice for victim have be clearly enshrine by this government how disappointing how disgusting and how angry that make be sorry to have disappoint the hon member as indicate have meet the one survivor of the kingsmill massacre have some appreciation of just what an appalling and brutal event that be at time of many appalling and brutal murder there have be an inquest which conclude recently as recall it hold the provisional ira responsible for that murder be sure that the family want to proceed far and one of the option open to they be to go to the independent commission but at the risk of repeat myself need to point out that come to my conclusion because the finucane case be exceptional for the reason that have try to explain may begin by apologise to the secretary of state and the house for be absent at the beginning of the statement secretary of state have there ever be family give more preferential handling by government than the finucane family they have have prime ministerial apology multiple investigation inquiry and now an uncapped public inquiry after the family reject previous government offer of inquiry be not the tragic takeaway from the statement that the icrir be good enough for innocent victim of the ira the ulster volunteer force and other but not good enough for the finucane family why be the secretary of state perpetuate that odious hierarchy of victim be not be the answer know that the hon member be slightly late in come to the chamber and from the beginning set out my thought process he will have an opportunity to read my statement subsequently clearly set out the reason why reach this decision it be fact that when the then prime minister david cameron apologise from this dispatch box it be unprecedented because he refer to shock collusion in this case we member of this house should take that extremely seriously all of we who be committed to uphold our obligation we be face with two promise to establish public inquiry accept what the hon member say about that not happen after because of the then stance of the finucane family but that have now change there be also the supreme court decision of it say be afraid that for all that have go before the state have not comply with its article obligation we will now do so bill presented renters rights bill presentation and first

light on terrible culture in the industry in the year lead up to the tragedy culture of put profit before people and culture in which safety take back seat it reveal building safety system that be fundamentally break with deficiency that go unchallenged by different government the consequence of these failure be still with we today there be too many building with unsafe cladding and the pace of remediation have be too slow we will consider all the recommendation in detail and we will respond within six month as part of that work we will listen to and engage with the bereaved survivor and resident in the immediate community we will update parliament annually on progress against every commitment we make as the prime minister say there must be more radical action to stop something like this from ever happen again official report september vol the recent fire in dagenham show we the danger that many resident continue to face my east london constituency be among those with the most cladde high rise block in the country so have long campaign for the urgent remediation of affected building and know that member across the house grapple with similar issue in their constituency have see at first hand how relentless the work can be for resident who be try to get remediation start our constituent not only have to endure the fear and uncertainty of live with unsafe cladding but face the high insurance premium and service charge that go with it the delay be hold people back they can not make plan or get on with their life they live in fear they feel stuck as minister for building safety be honour to have the opportunity to work alongside the deputy prime minister to make thing right and ensure that last week moment of truth become legacy of change so that no other community have to go through that suffering we will bring the full power of government to bear on this task above all we will accelerate the pace of remediation and go far and fast to drive change across the industry thank the minister for what she just say on the remedial work that will be do some will be in the public sector most will be in the private sector in many case resident be pay the price in very high insurance premium as she rightly acknowledge could those resident who have suffer great deal of stress and cost over the past few year expect some form of compensation for their loss because of the failure of government and the industry to undertake the proper remedial work we recognise the impact on those with high insurance premium we will take action to protect they and will have the necessary dialogue to address the right hon member point and ensure that there be not high insurance premium do the minister agree that firefighter and the fire brigades union need to be listen to and that the government need to deliver the statutory advisory body to ensure that the lesson of grenfell be learn we have already have discussion with key stakeholder include firefighter and the head of the fbu we want to ensure that we speak to all relevant stakeholder we need to work across range of institution to get this right and tackle the root cause of fire risk want to focus on the number of affected property the remediation of residential building above metre be be monitor by my department for half of they remediation have start have complete remediation however count the building that we know about be not enough we estimate that as many as building that need remediation have not yet apply for the cladding safety scheme that be maximum estimate there may well be few than that but those responsible for those building have no excuse for fail to apply we will work with regulator to ensure that the building be identify rise will make bit more progress we will ensure that dangerous building be find and deal with the money be there the speed must increase we be not leave this task just to regulator the government must do more and this government will do so congratulate the minister on her appointment it be absolutely right that the government should be provide support include financial support for those building that need work do urgently of course the problem be that the building safety fund have different rule and criterion for building in the social housing sector and those in the private sector when the prime minister speak about grenfell he speak about the discrimination and poor treatment of social housing tenant will the government rectify that by make social housing provider equally eligible for help from the building safety fund thank my hon friend for his work on this matter serve on the communities and local government committee under his chairmanship many year ago and learn great deal from his work the government have commit up to million in grant funding for the removal of grenfell style cladding in the social sector and social housing landlord can apply for the grant scheme in particular circumstance but we be work with regulator and the sector to ensure that social landlord assess the progress of remediation work there be much to do and look forward to work closely with he on that and the wide agenda since some progress have be make include the building safety act which labour support but what be clear be that the speed of work to fix unsafe cladding be not fast enough the recent fire in dagenham and slough underline the vulnerability that persist in our build environment since come into office we have meet regulator and other industry partner to press for action to make building safe we be contact all metro mayor in england to ask for their support in drive forward local remediation acceleration plan work in partnership with regulator congratulate my hon friend on her appointment which in try to put right these wrong be to one of the tough job in government wish she all the good one of the thing that would help be to improve the skill throughput in the construction industry in my constituency only one large block have have its cladding completely removed and that start five year ago it have take that long to deal with it so those that have have no work start be way behind one big brake on that be skill in the construction industry what be the government do to improve and enhance skill in that sector thank my hon friend for her intervention on this really important agenda will say more about the remediation action plan and our response the prime minister commit to make sure that we respond to the recommendation of phase within six month and we will certainly be look at those recommendation the point she make which be very important have be raise with over the past few month be also familiar with those concern as raise they myself when we be in opposition turn to enforcement action our message to building owner be clear those who fail to make their building safe will face enforcement action the funding be there the government have commit billion to remove dangerous cladding and industry be provide the rest all block of residential flat above metre now have access to scheme to fix unsafe cladding qualifying leaseholder be protect by law from crippling bill for historical safety defect as the prime minister make clear in his speech in the house last week we will take the necessary step to speed this up we be willing to force freeholder to assess their building and enter remediation scheme within set timetable with legal requirement to force action if that be what it take to tackle industry intransigence as mention we will set out further step on remediation this autumn welcome my hon friend to her new position know that she will be firm advocate for those thousand of people who be still wait for remediation to be do on their building while we need to have partnership with the big housing builder to meet our target of million some of those same developer be still drag their foot on do the remediation on home will she assure resident in my constituency and across the country that part of the deal those developer may be do with other part of her department will be about take seriously their remediation responsibility for those building be grateful to my hon friend for that important point number of developer have already sign agreement on the remediation agenda the prime minister the deputy prime minister and the whole government have make the clear commitment to build the million home these be two side of the same coin we have to make sure that building that be not safe be make safe and that the future home that we build be safe and secure and address the need of our country she make important point and we be very much on the same page there be no excuse for building owner not to enter cladding scheme that they be eligible for any owner who fail to do so will be hold to account we will not sit by while they fail to act as well as act now to keep people safe we be learn the lesson from grenfell for the long term we be invest in and support local resilience to deliver strong planning response and recovery the department have provide million in core capacity and capability funding to local resilience forum since these be fundamental to our national resilience and the department will continue to consider every opportunity for far strengthen they include by support the cabinet office to shape and develop the programme of engagement with local stakeholder through the resilience review we will ensure robust oversight strong regulatory framework and an unwavering commitment to accountability at every level that mean reform the construction product industry that make this fatal cladding those who compromise that safety will face the consequence that mean take step to make the necessary improvement my write statement last week focus on improve the fire safety and evacuation of disabled and vulnerable resident in high rise residential building in england in our first week in office we have resolve an important recommendation from the grenfell inquiry first report five long year after it be publish the home office will bring forward proposal this autumn for residential personal emergency evacuation plan residential peep as they be know resident with disability and impairment whose ability to evacuate could be compromise will be entitle to person centre risk assessment this will identify appropriate equipment and adjustment support their fire safety or evacuation as well as residential peep statement that record what they should do in the event of fire we be get that important work go by fund social housing provider to deliver residential peep for their renter the government will engage with representative group as these plan be develop the home office plan to lay regulation as soon as possible with view to the proposal come into force in in addition we have make progress on deliver sounder evacuation alert system for new building to reduce the likelihood and impact of future fire as recommend in phase of the grenfell inquiry report we will consider recommendation from phase regard construction product shortly as mention as the house be aware we have also announce the withdrawal of the outdated national class for fire testing standard in favour of the more robust european standard and we will update approve document to make provision for sprinkler in new care home last week we also announce furth million in grant funding to reopen the wake watch replacement fund and to support more resident in building with fire safety defect to put in place common alarm system to help they keep resident safe the minister have talk about support for high rise building in my constituency my local authority have remove cladding from several council block include one grow up in which be of four storey or few what support will the government be able to give low rise block and what check will they do the evidence show that the risk tend to be in the high rise and that have be the focus but there be arrangement to ensure that low rise building with safety issue be address we need to look at these issue in the round it be important that we do not miss anything but in the department work so far the big risk have be in the high rise take the hon member point and where there be issue with low rise building we be very much willing to look at how we provide support my hon friend be be generous in give way to member across the house as she say early in her remark and just touch on again sometimes recalcitrant developer be really reluctant to pay and do not engage with resident there be danger that those resident will be leave at the bottom of the heap as they compete for skill product and so on be sure she be mindful of that but be she able to give those resident any comfort about the pressure the government can put on those recalcitrant developer to help get on with the work and make they pay later have deal with such case in my own constituency be very aware of the challenge the prime minister make it clear that if further action be need we will take it but we will use the exist law and the power we have to take action now assure my hon friend that official be work closely with member of parliament to support they and their constituent to ensure that action be take hope that can meet colleague regularly to support they with official to ensure that those who be intransigent do the work that they be require to do we will take action and we will work with member to ensure they get the support they need in response to the recent fire in slough and dagenham the government be support local team to assist those affect firefighter also attend fire in my own borough high rise building in blackwall be very grateful to emergency worker for their bravery and quick response to those and other incident follow the fire in dagenham at roundtable of regulator and partner the deputy prime minister make clear that fix unsafe building must happen fast member across the house will share our resolve in want the finding of the grenfell inquiry to be catalyst for change want to assure the house that we will hold further debate on the grenfell inquiry report in the autumn which know many member will want to contribute to it will be an opportunity for they to share their insight to discuss the specific recommendation that have be make and to work with we to bring about the change that be urgently need in the meantime we will support the metropolitan police and the crown prosecution service as they complete their investigation and bring prosecution this be about deliver justice and accountability but it be also about treat everyone regardless of where they live with respect in that spirit we be listen to those affect we be engage with resident local authority housing association and other in the fire safety community to ensure that our policy and action reflect the concern of those affect we be set an expectation of industry to ensure that resident be listen to protect and have peace of mind that action to make their home safe be matter of priority and take seriously look to the future we will ensure that the security health and wellbeing of resident and their wide community will drive our mission to build million new home over this parliament we will never forget the grenfell tower tragedy on that night in june over the past seven year the bereaved survivor and the immediate grenfell community have campaign relentlessly to protect their fellow citizen despite their personal loss and pain as the prime minister say in the memory of grenfell we will change our country and we will bring the full power of government to bear on this task because that be the responsibility of service and the duty we owe to the memory of every single one of the life lose call the shadow minister would like to open by share the commitment of his majesty official opposition to support the government in ensure that in particular the legislation bring forward in the previous parliament broadly with cross party support to address the issue that the under secretary of state for housing communities and local government the hon member for bethnal green and stepney rushanara ali and colleague have outline follow the grenfell fire take full effect through regulation and implementation across the sector it be absolutely clear as be state by the leader of the opposition during the prime minister statement last week that we share the government determination to ensure that everybody in our country be able to feel safe in their home and that risk whether they be know or might emerge from the continue research into this field be properly address we will do our very good to work with she and colleague in constructive manner to ensure that that happen today debate be also an opportunity to consider many of the broad issue around build safety that will come into play as we consider the government plan to reform our planning system increase our housing supply bring in new form of build into the united kingdom and reform building regulation great deal of the report from sir martin into the grenfell incident focus on the role play by build regulation and their operation in the market for material and design in the terrible disaster that take the life of people however we should not waste an opportunity to consider more broadly how other part of our housing system and our planning system can ensure that risk that might emerge in the future be deal with effectively for example we be aware when planning application come forward that the safety and resilience of building be not simply down to its construction and material it be also affect by its location its proximity to other source of risk and its design from its very inception they all have part to play we know from point that have be make in the past by member from across the house about the role that housing play in the context of public health that in the capital for example air quality be often bad indoor than it be outdoors as result of building design with poor ventilation and poor mechanical system that create long term health and safety burden for resident which can be alleviate by give due consideration to well design and resilience at the initial stage encourage the government to consider as they embark on this process how to manage some of the very complex interaction when seek to improve the safety of building where there be freeholder leaseholder and tenant all occupy some of the same space be aware from experience in local authority that hillingdon council have to go to court on occasion to gain access to council property to undertake basic maintenance and servicing work to installation against the will of the occupier even though that work be be carry out at no cost to the tenant that demonstrate some of the practical difficulty that that complex relationship can create in ensure that local authority and other be able to fulfil the duty that this house and the legislation place upon they it be also clear from both the grenfell report and other research that the drive towards building efficiency in particular energy efficiency have create risk of loss of focus on safety we know that this have be part of global move to recognise the need to address climate change through well quality insulation and the more efficient construction of building increasingly we see building be bring forward with modular construction of different type hotel arrive in shipping crate pre construct room be simply stack up and then give brick skin frame construct home be significant part of the delivery of the housing market these provide an opportunity to make the available fund go far and create more home more quickly that be extremely welcome but we need to ensure that the risk that might be associate with some of those form of construction especially where they take place at scale be properly consider would like to hear little more from the government in due course about how the broad context of build safety and resilience will take those matter into account would the shadow minister like to reflect on the fact that around four year ago the previous government set up committee to look at modern method of construction but the last investigation show that it have not actually meet it be important that we get this right we can see the problem with timber frame home and all the difficulty they cause in the it be important we get the technique and construction right but there be bit of gap in the previous government approach be there not of course it be embarrassing to hear that again from experience of local government know that great deal of work have be put in to ensure that modern method of construction be put forward for government consideration often there be exemplar around the country of how new estate and new home have be deliver there be certainly no lack of evidence on the opportunity available we also have an opportunity to reflect on the many challenge in our current housing stock and in other type of building such as school and hospital once upon time aerate concrete and asbestos be regard as wonder material and house builder and government would have be consider inefficient if they have not ensure their use we now know that they have create problem and risk that require significant level of expenditure to remediate that bring to another important point building resilience be not just about home the bbc recently do an excellent piece of work commemorate the original health and safety at work etc act which be implement by government follow number of quite appalling incident mainly in factory where significant loss of life occur because the design of building mean that in the event of fire for example it be difficult or impossible for people to get away we know that school building have be destroy and that thus far not single school have be fit with sprinkler where fire have result in total loss of the building the cost of instal that equipment at the design and construction stage be relatively modest compare with the impact of retrofit it so there be an opportunity for the government to reflect on how as we take forward their strategy on investment in new school we ensure that that resilience be as far as possible build in and that the full cost to the taxpayer that occur when hospital or school be lose be consider we must reflect also on how we ensure that office building and factory under construction meet the high possible standard especially as they often face many of the same challenge around new material and new form of design that be intend to make they more efficient but potentially bring in risk that it be our duty to foresee and prevent as far as we possibly can we will shortly consider the renters rights bill that will have wide impact especially on the build to rent sector we have see new form of developer come into the market with the specific intention of construct from the outset long term rental home welcome the shadow minister comment about work cross party one thing we need to do be establish the fact the reality of what be go on and the confusion leave by the previous government people be be tell by mortgage provider that they need an form but by freeholder that they do not they be stuck go back and forth for year would he like to take this opportunity to recognise the confusing legacy leave by his government and apologise to all the thousand of people who be stick in place feel that they have no place to go give the broad cross party consensus in the last parliament about the importance of the new form of legislation and the regulation that follow from it think we should seek to maintain that consensus as far as possible but as somebody who in previous life work in banking and as mortgage adviser know that the challenge around the mortgageability of property especially property of novel construction go back many decade for instance very limited number of lender will provide for property locate above shop because of that particular set of risk be similar example despite apparent clarity from government there clearly be lot of debate within the sector and some lender prefer to go belt and brace demand the provision of something that be not require by law or regulation before make lending decision and the then government do significant work in the previous parliament to bring clarity and address those problem that be helpful introduction to point that want to touch on briefly the role of the insurance industry both in the challenge that will follow from grenfell and in the wide experience of our constituent many people find themselves significantly challenge because owe to lack of clarity or to uncertainty about the construction of their building they face significant insurance cost sometimes to the point where only one insurance provider be available other face very significantly increase cost because of the behaviour of landlord who seek to apportion the insurance cost across all the property in their portfolio rather than accord to the risk of specific property that particular tenant or leaseholder inhabit it would be helpful for the government to give some consideration to how they can work with the insurance industry to ensure that those who be pay for insurance be pay fair price and that it provide the necessary cover that mortgage lender for example will expect it be clear that as well as the strong commitment we on the opposition benches can give to support the government and the minister in take forward the regulation and ensure that they address the concern that have be express we must also make the most of an opportunity to consider wide issue of building safety in london for example there be significant number of bison block construct with pre stress concrete at the time it be consider wonder material and mean of deliver significant number of new home efficiently and at low cost which have particular structural risk around they that local authority across the capital and the wide country have have to address we have also hear little bit about the role of the fire service in carry out inspection and prosecution where property be find not to meet the fire regulation all those point be indicator of risk across the system and there be an opportunity for government to ensure that ministers have clear line of sight so that such indicator can be effectively address if there be role for we politician to play in local government and here in westminster it be to ensure that all these other people be do their job promise that the opposition will support the government as they seek to achieve that and hope that together we will be able to take this work forward effectively so that all our constituent can sleep safely in their bed welcome the under secretary of state for housing communities and local government my hon friend the member for bethnal green and stepney rushanara ali to her position as my hon friend the member for hackney south and shoreditch dame meg hillier say in an intervention few moment ago it be probably one of the most challenging and difficult job in government we all see the struggle face by conservative ministers who have to deal with these issue over many year indeed we be still struggle because we have not get to the position that we would all like to be in want to comment on the many report produce by the levelling up housing and communities committee in the last parliament and the one before when be privileged to chair the committee we produce two report after grenfell follow dame judith hackitt initial report on the issue to the government we also do pre legislative scrutiny of the building safety bill follow up with report do quite lot of work on thing like construction product and have correspondence with ministers on those subject every one of our report be agree unanimously by that cross party committee and be pleased that the shadow minister the hon member for ruislip northwood and pinner david simmonds have indicate the opposition support for the general approach to these matter we all want to see building safety carry out on all the building in our constituency in timely and proper manner as be look back at dame judith report and decide what should say today as well as pick out one or two bit of the select committee work something strike she say that it be about not just build rule and regulation but culture the grenfell report clearly set out that there need to be an overall comprehensive review to avoid the gap in regulation that be absolutely right and the government will no doubt follow that through and report on what they be go to do but dame judith say that there be race to the bottom culture in the building industry that it be about how cheaply could thing be do that be show in grenfell as there be example of cheap product be substitute for other in the end the safety of individual be put behind financial return unfortunately that be far too common in the construction industry the minister may even struggle more with that fundamental reform to attitude and culture than she do with the review of building regulation which will be struggle enough itself that have to be bear in mind right the way through nevertheless we look forward to the government response to all the recommendation of sir martin moore bick and his inquiry the minister say in write answer to the other day that about home still have dangerous cladding on they after all this time that really be quite shocking wonder whether the minister might consider update that figure regularly maybe place it in the library every three month so we can all look at whether progress have be make quickly enough she might even like to provide list of all the building their owner and their developer so we can start to see who the guilty party be some have legitimate reason for not have make change yet which we want to know but other simply be not interested in get on with the work that be their responsibility there be some other problem and challenge that the minister might also like to address my attention be draw to particular block that could access the building safety fund for the removal of cladding but not for other safety work that need to be do include replace miss firewall and dangerous fire door that be okay when developer be involve who should be push to put right their wrong of their construction but in this case the developer have go bust and the building be own by its leaseholder where do they go in that situation well actually the building work just stop we end up with building safety fund that be not comprehensive the select committee recommend it cover all aspect of build safety work and cover just clad and because other element of building safety be not cover by the fund there be situation where building be leave unsafe and there be no one really to point the finger at and say they responsible the minister probably can not give an answer to that point today but hope she will think about it if we can start to identify precisely where these building be many more such situation may emerge where there be recalcitrant developer and owner how can the leaseholder get help as have be mention they be often face with high insurance cost and enormous worry about what happen next in their life the select committee talk to people who be in despair and that be few year ago they be probably still in despair now because nothing have change in their situation on top of that they can be face with legal cost to challenge the developer and owner can the minister give we some assurance that her department and official will stand ready to offer all assistance possible to leaseholder in that situation who be really struggle and desperate in many circumstance the leasehold knowledge partnership have do good work in provide assistance but the technical and legal advice should really be come from her department want to mention one or two other key issue although if try to go through all the building safety issue that come up in the select committee would be here for lot long than today debate skill have be mention when the committee look at the building safety bill we recommend national system of third party accreditation and registration for all professional work on the design and construction of high rise building that do not include all the people who work on building such as labourer and those with other skill but all those involve with professional skill whether it be architect those oversee construction work or build safety manager should be properly accredit and there ought to be national system it be clear that there be gap in that regard as for those who work in the trade involve it be disgrace that under build electrical safety regulation it be still the case that the only rule relate to competent person in high rise building an electrician who do work in kitchen where there be water or in the garden where there be water will not be cover by any building safety regulation an electrician who do work in the bathroom will be cover but will have to be part of competent person scheme which do not mean that the person do the work must be competent it simply mean that the company must be register as have someone who be competent to sign off the work at the end of the day even if the person never see the work that have be do the committee report on that several time back in and never get any far with it so it need to be look at construction product be clearly problem at grenfell and welcome the comment about that in the grenfell report we call over and over again for comprehensive review of the testing of product and their safety we call for the publication of information not only about the product that have be test and find to be safe but about those that have fail what dame judith hackitt find initially in her review be that company be go from one testing house to another with their product until they find one that pass they no one be ever notify of the failure and that can not be right sir martin moore bick have call for more transparency over product testing so can we ensure that failure be report as well as success in all the cost of grenfell while developer be be hold to account to some degree not one construction product manufacturer have be ask to pay single penny towards the cost of build remediation although many of they be clearly responsible for some of the problem why be that we push the then government about it we last write to the relevant minister in march last year the government commission report by paul morrell on construction product and safety but never respond to it in detail will this minister now look at it and give response will she look at the testing and categorisation of product and at how manufacturer can be make to pay some of the cost that should not fall on leaseholder or on social housing provider be pleased by the recommendation in the grenfell report that build control officer should always be appoint by an independent third party the developer should not be choose in some case their own friend to sign off building in the case of the high rise building the building safety regulator be now responsible for appoint build control officer let compliment the hon gentleman on all his work on this do he agree that one of the problem be the systemic underfunding of local authority lead to the inadequacy of all their inspection regime build control in particular which have have such devastating effect on the quality of building in so many part of the country yes do the committee have make many recommendation in many report about the whole issue of local authority funding and the squeezing of resource in respect of service of this kind give the priority that authority have to give to social care in all its form and now temporary accommodation as well as the question of resource however there be the question of independence the building control officer will be beholden to the developer whoever the developer be because the developer will say if you give difficult time on this building will not give you any work for the next one that must be stop the last government would say that they do so in respect of the high rise building but it need to be stop for all building and be pleased about what sir martin say about that in his report let now return to the issue of social housing be sorry but must tell the minister that be not go to let it go away both the prime minister and the deputy prime minister make comment about the discrimination against and bad treatment of social housing tenant for long time we have have the attitude that this be poor housing for poor people who do not really matter we must challenge that because they do matter landlord in the social housing sector housing association and council will always do their good to make building safe and in some case because there be no access to the building safety fund unless they can show that they can not do the work and they can always find some money to do it that will mean squeeze the headroom in the housing revenue account or housing association business plan that squeeze headroom would otherwise be available for the building of new home if the government want to build million new home and fully support that think it be one of the good commitment that they be make they will not be build by the private sector alone substantial number of social house will have to be build and that require hra resource and resource in the housing association business plan the more we squeeze they with other responsibility that be not finance by the building safety fund the less money will be available to build new social housing thank my hon friend for raise that point about the impact on the hra we have two such building where the council have to deal with compartmentation with no support from the government and have to rehouse family in just under year per good practice do my hon friend agree that the pressure on council have be much great than it have be on private developer to move quickly on remediation and removal order must remind member that contribution be make through the chair so it be important to make eye contact with the chair rather than with the minister on the front bench be sure you appreciate madam deputy speaker that always want to make eye contact with you laughter probably will not be call again for long time after that of course agree with my hon friend that while social landlord in particular should take their responsibility seriously and think that most of they do many be struggle my final ask of the minister be this give the urgency of the issue will she agree to meet together with kate henderson the chief executive of the national housing federation and the representative of the local council who recently produce an excellent report about funding for council house building to discuss this issue and the extra challenge that it pose to both housing association and council at what be difficult time let end by thank all my colleague who be involve in the select committee in the previous two parliaments its new chair be to be elect today and offer to help and support whoever it be in any way can because be sure that this issue be one that the new committee will want to address call the liberal democrat spokesperson let begin by congratulate the minister and welcome she to her position as we have already say in this chamber the liberal democrats welcome the final grenfell report we want to record again our thank to the family of the victim and of course the survivor for give their testimony their expert and their statement to the inquiry we know how difficult that will have be much have already be say today about the issue of cladding so will not say anything about it in my speech as other member have point out this be not just about the remediation of cladding there be many other fire safety issue in building that need to be remedie this be debate about building safety and we must discuss other matter there be various fire safety issue in various building in my constituency particularly be sure that other member will have correspondence about this in their inboxe the need for fire door remediation either the fire door be inadequate when they be instal in the first place or they be instal incorrectly that need to be fix but the developer the building owner and through they their management company be not take responsibility for it indeed they be try to pass the buck and make the leaseholder and the tenant pay for the replacement of the door where that be necessary and use defect period that may well have expire as an excuse for not take up those issue and not pay for remediation in one instance one of the leaseholder commission survey before the expiration of the defect period which identify problem with the fire door but the developer be still claim not to be responsible for replace all the fire door in the building although they be of identical design and the developer have accept responsibility for these particular door this be an example of where the construction industry be unfortunately not take responsibility for the issue that it have create whether intentionally or unintentionally there be other fire safety issue which we will all have see in our inboxe some of they will be thing that we in the construction industry have work in it for many year describe as patent defect which can be see when someone come across patent defect they can see that something do not work but there be many latent defect which be hide in the depth of building and can not be see by the naked eye those defect become apparent much later and we need to provide way to help leaseholder by ensure that they do not have to shoulder the financial burden of rectify they such defect be fundamental to the building for example there be safety issue around gas pipe that have be incorrectly instal in some case it have be find that there be inadequate shielding around the pipe as happen in building in my chelmsford constituency could go on and on about other fire safety issue but know that other hon member want to speak and have quite few thing that would still like to say there be huge backlog of issue that need to be remedie and the minister talk about the number of building that need to be remediate speak to fire safety expert from local authority not one in my constituency who be responsible for look at all the building in the authority housing stock they have to put together report that have to be submit by the deadline which believe be early this year when they try to submit it to the health and safety executive the hse say whoa hang on do submit it now we can cope we let you know when we want to receive those document it may well not be until so would say that the number of building the minister talk about be definitely an underestimate and urge she to discuss this issue with the health and safety executive to see what other resource it might need to be able to move more quickly let we remember that people be live in building that they have officially be tell be not safe every single night they go to bed know that their family and child be sleep in building that be not safe we do not know the full extent of the problem and there be many recommendation that can come out we can talk about how the construction industry operate and so on but let talk briefly about the planning system when we be talk about fire safety it strike as very strange that the fire service be still not statutory consultees on planning application for high rise building over metre of course the fire service be expert in fire safety yet we do not make they statutory consultee that feel very strange to and it feel like big oversight urge the minister to look into that member have talk about historical issue and the need to remedy they point out to the minister and everyone present that these issue be not just historical be aware of building less than two year old that have fire compartmentation problem and miss firestopping this be an ongoing issue as one fire safety expert put it to after everything that happen with grenfell developer be still get away with it this be systemic problem and there be many reason for it it be partly drive by finance and other thing but as the hon member for sheffield south east mr betts say it be also cultural problem there be lot that we need to work on will briefly admit to slightly guilty pleasure quite like watch the programme air crash investigation which might seem bit macabre do not want to give the impression that the airline industry be perfect but big up those in the airline industry the industry investigate issue and crash work out what go wrong and then do not point the finger of blame no matter where the fault lie it look at how such issue could have be avoid and how it can make sure that they do not happen again in the future if only we could make the construction industry do the same and change the culture rather than shrug our shoulder say well it not my fault and blame the subcontractor the manufacturer or whoever have work in the construction industry for long time know that that happen lot if we could change the culture to be more like how the airline industry investigate problem would be very happy to see that there be another industry that the construction industry could learn something from have just mention fire safety issue and thing that need to be remediate and be sure that many people in the chamber have be issue with safety recall notice whereby motor manufacturer have to recall car and fix the safety issue if there be problem with the brake or anything in the engine be safety issue they recall the car and fix it at their expense would like to see something similar happen in the construction industry so that people take much more responsibility come back to leaseholder because it be incredibly important that we remember the implication for they when there be delay and thing be not fix not only be there fire risk as mention before we have people who be on hour watch other members have mention the difficulty with get mortgage at the moment many leaseholder can not sell their property and move on that have implication for the housing crisis because it mean that there be less churn in the housing industry as few people be able to move out of their flat and allow other people to move into they that be exacerbate the crisis as other have mention there be also the problem of insurance like other hon member be concerned that social landlord be not eligible for government fund to remediate building leave many of the most vulnerable people at risk urge the government and the minister to listen to the national housing federation which represent hundred of housing association and the end our cladding scandal campaign on these issue remind the house that the liberal democrats have be call for the removal of dangerous cladding from all building and we need to make sure that leaseholder do not have to pay for it to reiterate what say early this should not be just about clad there be other serious issue particularly firestoppe fire door be incredibly important as my hon friend the member for st albans daisy cooper say to the prime minister just last week we need the government to step in and provide the cash up front to carry out the remediation in some circumstance and then they should go after those responsible that would alleviate lot of suffering finally would just like to say that fire safety be not luxury it should be see as right would like to put on the record the thank of my constituent in kensington and bayswater which include the wide grenfell community for the cross party support last week when the phase report of the grenfell inquiry be publish we thank the minister and the government for make time today and for commit to future time and we thank the prime minister for his statement and heartfelt apology on behalf of the british state for what happen he speak for we all include the leader of the opposition the grenfell legacy obviously have lot of dimension but one of they be build safety urge member to remember the victim of the fire whose legacy have to be fix this crisis after the report be release there be three immediate action that the community want to advocate in this place the first be about criminal prosecution which be not matter for discussion today however as the justice secretary mention in question yesterday it be important that we ensure that the court system be prepare for any potential decision that come through the metropolitan police and cps process and that court backlog and the complexity of any potential trial do not result in even further delay to justice secondly the accountability of the company be not just about criminal investigation it be about their role in public procurement and pay for remedial work we need to continue to push on that finally we be discuss policy change today to ensure that this never happen again but the pace of change have be far too slow as my hon friend the member for sheffield south east mr betts say that be partly due to the culture of how tenant social housing tenant in particular be treat and about their agency and power and respect there be ten of thousand of people up and down the country who be still go to bed in building that be unsafe in my constituency quite incredibly give the history of grenfell we have one of those building that be not yet on the department list it undergo fire inspection just few month ago and flammable rendering be find this be good example of what many member have mention it be building with approximately social tenant and share ownership leaseholder who have scrap together the money to get on the housing ladder and have now be hit with month increase in their service charge primarily drive by the dramatic increase in insurance after the fire inspection take place agree with the shadow minister call to look at the insurance market because in that case there be not competitive bid for insure the building know there have be discussion with the association of british insurers to see how we can bring down the cost but urge the government to look at this because in the short term while we wait for the remedial work to take place the situation be simply unaffordable for those leaseholder certainly think we need to look at the insurance industry in addition that building be another example of the merry go round of buck pass that we talk about last week between local government national government developer freeholder and housing association we need clear timeline to speed this up and really welcome the prime minister commitment on that we need incentive in the system carrot and stick to ensure that we do not have these never end situation where leaseholder and tenant be unclear about when the work will be do as the minister say the money be there so this be about knock head together and make sure that at an individual building level we get the speeding up that we need will write to she about the specific building that have mention speed up this work be obviously part of the answer but the recommendation from phase and phase of the grenfell inquiry be also relevant they go beyond cladding as the hon member for chelmsford marie goldman mention really welcome the government announcement last week that residential personalise emergency evacuation plan for disabled people will be take forward it be big frustration for many of my constituent that that do not happen under the previous government we look forward to more detail on what those peep will look like urge the government in the comprehensive spending review to look at funding for multiple year for social landlord to implement that and at scheme to ensure that developer and freeholder cover the cost for private building we be all still digest the full phase report and there will be time to go into it in more detail but one recommendation that urge the government to think about straightaway be the streamlining of accountability in term of ministerial responsibility and the regulator so that we do not have disperse system between multiple department that make it easy for thing to fall through the crack as sir martin moore bick make clear in his report hope we will have time to discuss that in detail finally on the question of who should pay welcome the prime minister statement that he will be write to the company and look at exclusion in the public procurement process to ensure that company reference in the grenfell report will not be able to access public tender also put on the record my thank to the golfer shane lowry who yesterday belatedly but he get there in the end remove the sponsorship of one of the company mention will not mention it by name just out of caution more broadly these developer clearly need to need to pay for the remedial work the campaigner have do an incredible job as the minister say in her opening remark their ask have always be for truth which we now have from the inquiry for justice which we hope will come from the criminal prosecution system and for change which it be on all of we in this house to deliver call peter fortune to make his maiden speech thank you very much madam deputy speaker have learn from the potential misstep of the hon member for sheffield south east mr betts and promise to gaze at you throughout my entire speech maiden speech be by tradition and design quite light hearted and that be how have fashion mine but want the house to be in no doubt that this debate be on very serious issue welcome the cross party conversation about the disaster at grenfell and know that my constituent in bromley and biggin hill send their thought and prayer to the victim and survivor and their family and to other who have be impact it be obvious that represent the fine constituency in all of this great united kingdom before set out my case let say few word about my main predecessor note of course those community we welcome from the constituency of both beckenham and orpington the majority of my new constituency however be inherit from bromley and chislehurst and sir bob neill kc sir bob be and be creature of this house magnificent speaker bon viveur and good friend to many in this chamber bob dedicate his adult life to service he start as councillor before move to the greater london council the glc of course meet its demise in bob unperturbed simply hang around until it be reinvent in when he become the first assembly member for bexley and bromley in on the passing of the much love awkward squad member eric forth bob fight difficult by election to become the member for bromley and chislehurst for nearly quarter of century bob have be part of the fabric of our community always ready to fight for those who need voice bob have deep admiration and love for the law he have hold many position in politic but believe that it be as chairman of the justice committee that he reach his pinnacle his knowledge and depth of understanding have be of unquestionable benefit to the house but his love of the law be trump by love that be much deep it be not west ham it be not opera it be not even gibraltar to which know he have give so much time his great love be for ann louise the woman the wife and the friend who have make he so happy member will know that fate take particularly callous decision early on in their relationship but they will also know that bob and ann louise face that challenge with their typical resilience and humour thank he for his service and for the graciousness and kindness with which he have always treat and wish his family well before move on to make the self evident case that bromley and biggin hill be the great constituency that have ever exist want to make note of another previous member for bromley the former prime minister harold macmillan as minister for housing he take on the responsibility of meet new and ambitious housing target he be not keen at first write in his diary in that it be not my cup of tea at all despite his concern he meet the inflated target year early and change the life of family right across the country by present they with the opportunity to live in safe and secure home wonder how he would feel this link to the substance of the debate if he know that resident of north point in bromley be still suffer due to cladding crisis that be no fault of their own this be an injustice that have go on for too long and it be vital that the whole house work together to free those who be impact from the shackle of poor governance and lack of accountability before talk far about the constituency would like to say thank you to the good people know can not linger here for too long or shall be reduce to an emotional puddle but must recognise my beautiful family without

physical manifestation of the place it be wonderful place comprise sundridge bickley hayes and keston the bit of darwin that be in the family along with coney hall bromley common biggin hill and of course the ancient market town of bromley rather than give geographical tour will demonstrate the amazing contribution from across bromley and biggin hill to the field of literature sport science and

themselves into their spitfires and hurricanes accelerate down the runway at biggin hill gently pull back on the stick and glide free from the bond of earth imagine the cognitive dissonance that must

of string of town that be all unique but have common heritage in the wool trade and there be commonality in the way they have face the world since that trade have die away to win in calder valley and represent it candidate have to be able to speak to different people in different community and successful government should always do so donald thompson the first mp for calder valley in his maiden speech for the predecessor seat of sowerby in refer to the shift in the use of our mill say not all the mill now spin and weave dozen of they house new report june vol perhaps the story of the modern calder valley be how we have adapt to that change the town of calder valley run along the river calder that river have bring beauty and support the textile trade that once make our community world famous but it also bring the flood that hit our community particularly hard in and visible sign of the impact of climate change which will define many of our come year however the town have be able to rebuild rely on an incredible community spirit and way of be with the world that chris mccafferty calder valley mp from to describe in her maiden speech as bloody minded proud pernickety and report november vol would demur from say that myself but certainly recognise it in many of the people represent when be chris be good enough to accept on work experience in her office each town have its own history and tradition guard proudly the town of todmorden be the traditional county boundary between yorkshire and lancashire with yorkshire governance an oldham postcode and an accent somewhere in between it be home to the famous radical parliamentarian john fielden who change the law to reduce the number of hour that child could work to hour day over the year the town have boast an astonishing two nobel prize winner and be the birthplace of incredible edible which pioneer grow vegetable in community space move down the river the town of hebden bridge be once famous for fustian trouser and

the ground of yorkshire large football club be name for the road that lead there elland be now home to great business and even well people be proud to be member of elland round table and our annual bonfire raise thousand of pound for local good cause round table across the country offer lot of charity work but they also give man an opportunity to do thing alongside each other create an intentional community of friend that have be vital to man mental health over the year pay tribute to they elland will soon be improve by new train station on which my right hon friend the secretary of state for transport will hear quite lot from in due course our rural community include ryburn and greetland will pass both spelling to hansard later where farmer continue to reinvent themselves from bse and foot and mouth to political shock such as brexit the life of small farmer be never straightforward however they should not be underestimate as custodian of our landscape nature and biodiversity by support small farm we can answer many of the problem we face in other place the big population centre in the constituency be brighouse and rastrick famous for its brass band that have the dubious honour of the long run no in british chart history over the year brighouse have produce everything from biscuit to valve and it perhaps typify the story of our change industry as much as anywhere the mill do not spin and weave but they be now home to new industry on to be bear and raise in calder valley and be keen to continue the campaign tradition of past mps from john fielden to chris mccafferty who be tireless campaigner for woman right despite my severe dyslexia get good education at calder high school thank to great teacher like my hon friend the member for stoke on trent south dr gardner it be the first purpose build comprehensive school in the north of england although no one in my family have choose politic as their path it would be untrue to say that they be not political indeed go back to my great great grandfather my family have be labour supporter said ancestor john hughes be agent to joshua ritson the first labour mp for city of durham one of labour mp elect in the cohort but the only josh the intake see fold increase in the number of labour mp and sevenfold increase in the number of joshes hope that both number continue to hold strong hear hear be the fourth mp for calder valley and the fourth with local government experience in general local government be good grounding for work here but nowhere more so than halifax town hall which be design by charles barry who design much of this place too halifax town hall be his final building so we like to say that he practise on parliament but perfect his work in calderdale my predecessor craig whittaker serve twice on calderdale council where he have the job of cabinet member for child and young people he be also whip in this place although he and may not agree on many issue we have share love for calder valley he be committed public servant who between the council and parliament give two decade to his community my council career culminate in take the role of cabinet member for adult service and wellbeing which include social care it be perhaps fitting that have be elect for party that want to get to grip with this issue in government while it be easy to talk about the health service and delivery find the difference that good care worker make to people life can be even more impactful when look at the area on which have focus in my career it be the less glamourous topic that draw spend lot of my career look at the welfare system and how it can alleviate poverty have work at oxfam the child poverty action group and church action on poverty proud trade unionist also support often low pay worker with the union of shop distributive and allied workers and the public and commercial services union have always believe in get benefit right in support people into work rather than punish they for not be able to find work and in support with dignity those who simply can not work that be one thing we can do to make our economy strong and people happy in work and life at pcs have the honour of work with many committed public servant in often unseen but absolutely vital job include public safety which remind we of the topic of today debate many of those role be unthinkingly close in the bonfire of the quango and we must always remember that our action in this house have large impact elsewhere my more recent career as council cabinet member for social care and my day job at the general medical council have teach similar lesson as well as give glimpse of the amazing commit people work in the caring profession it be only shame that the unreformed care system place different value on the work do inside and outside the nhs hope that national care service will recognise that care work be skilled work and should be support in the same way conclude by thank my community of calder valley for the faith you have show in over the year our town sit like unique pearl in the pennines form from yorkshire grit and bind together by the history of the textile

correct all of they but my constituency be in fact the most beautiful and the most brilliant in the country have my hon friend ever be to burnley slanderous stand here honour beyond belief to represent the great town of burnley padiham and brierfield town that be part of the story of our nation this be the land of dramatic sandstone avenue of hill and sky of romantic scenery in the shadow of pendle hill this be the land of regimented urban landscape of terrace top and tower nestle among chimney and waterway cushion by village farm country pub and proper pint we be england and lancastrian and we be proud burnley the meadow by the brun first record in the century have long be hub of culture and commerce we have century market the century towneley hall play and the century st peter church indeed come over the moor from the wrong side of the pennines charlotte brontë visit gawthorpe hall in padiham wordsworth write of the site of pendle hill and burnley most prolific poet henry houlding lead literary renaissance for northern town in the century once the epicentre of the global cotton trade the worker of our town build this country it be say at its height that burnley cotton industry have clothe britain by breakfast and the rest of the world by dinner we be birthplace of movement too suffragette such as margaret aldersley and fighter leader and thinker non conformist be we radical and reformer and once the seat of labour leader no less in arthur henderson say all this because want to stress that our story do not start or end with the mill loom for long time be our tool in our hand be the industrial world make but now we be so much more we do not buy the standard story of decline we be place determine with eye focus on the future hungry to play our part by the way we have no great example of burnley endurance and enterprise than burnley football club yes sometimes in the face of emotional trauma at time extreme they be twice champion of england and one time winner of the fa cup let say believe for the first time ever in this house up the clarets as town we be now thriving dynamic multicultural symbol of renewal and creativity to be make in east lancashire be to be benchmark of quality particularly in our manufacturing aerospace science and cultural industry with world beat amazing innovative company put we on the map we be also unusual politically in that the constituency have be represent by all three major party in the past year alone although hope to bring very lengthy period of stability in that regard burnley padiham and brierfield be so often paint as town with problem and extensive poverty which be true but to end our description there be to misunderstand our mindset our mission our sense of history and community our fight be not in trading narrative as to how we get here we have problem yes but we do not simply retreat to the warm nostalgia of our history we know that that way lie only stagnation our fight be in create solution for tomorrow less interested in rhetoric storytelling and ideology town such as mine want outcome for we one ability to deliver solution mean lot more than the colour of rosette outcome be what matter what be good be what work in our public service that mean dependable quality transparency choice the interest of user come first and an approach that challenge every vest interest in the public interest reflect on this mantra and the debate today want to talk little about our housing stock first raise by my predecessor peter pike in his maiden speech of the once proud regiment sandstone avenue that speak of early once step up for family be now in poor and worsen state too many of my constituent live in substandard under insulate cold and mouldy home low land value lock out investment but more critically lock out family from the decent accommodation that they deserve and write off whole community as just not worth the investment if we be to continue to thrive we need more housing new housing more social housing and decent retrofit programme not see on scale since the last labour government it be only through that growth that we can achieve the sort of improvement in our public service that we need that be the only way that we will attract the secure job and dynamic workforce of the future too many of our young people be stick in generational cycle of worklessness which hold back entire family because of lack of opportunity skill connectivity and actually confidence we will only truly grow as country when people in place like ours feel that growth touch they when prosperity reach the doorstep of our terrace when we break the cycle and say if you have the will we will give you the way no one leave behind in my time here hope to represent to the good of my ability those value and ambition at this juncture as be tradition pay tribute to my predecessor in burnley and padiham antony higginbotham and in brierfield and nelson east andrew

innovation hub we be currently home to some fantastic cutting edge business from the renewable energy sector through to the health science they be complement by the provision of excellent technical

champion they all in everything do congratulate the new hon member for chippenham sarah gibson on brilliant maiden speech it be quite emotional at the end there and all hon member who have make maiden speech today my hon friend the member for burnley oliver ryan be still young lad now but he be an even young lad when have the displeasure of campaign with he in burnley he have short on but he still manage to win it be great to see he in his place and it be pleasure to listen to his maiden speech this debate be obviously about very serious matter my thought and the thought of everyone in the chamber be with the people man woman and child who lose their life in the grenfell fire over seven year ago it be an appalling event and the survivor and the community be yet to see justice that might mean criminal prosecution as my hon friend the member for kensington and bayswater joe powell rightfully highlight know he be urge for that to happen at pace as he do yesterday during justice question or in regard to the broad building safety crisis ensure that building be make safe at pace sir martin moore bick phase grenfell report and recommendation make for difficult reading in fact digest they will make we angry we all have to channel that anger collectively and responsibly to ensure that the victim of grenfell and previous fire such as lakanal and in kirby be respond to by the body politic and the new government my good colleague and hon friend now on the front bench just think about this each and every one of those people who lose their life should still be with we today enjoy the life that we enjoy and have the frustration that we have as the report say the event be entirely preventable it be entirely predictable but the lesson from history whether that be lakanal or the early fire in kirby be not learn they be not act upon by successive government of all political persuasion or by industry will not name the company refer to in the report for obvious reason to do with the court case government product manufacturer you name it grenfell be the result of organisation and individual as the report say be systematically dishonest dishonesty be hardwire into the construction and building industry put profit before people life we can not escape the fact that this be political decision drive by ideology the coalition government be reference in the report their time in office be basically bonfire of red tape it be deregulation build they high build they cheap and refurbish they cheap and the consequence be all too clear indeed resident of grenfell alert the council of the day regulator and the power that be that this be an accident wait to happen and it do happen with all those consequence for all to see of course some of this have continue we have have company game test of product that be put on high rise product that should never have be there let we be frank those product be solidify petrol thousand of they be put on high rise up and down the country high rise insulate by solidify petrol this country be quite unique in the fact that it greenlighte those product through deregulation it be no coincidence that we have fire such as lakanal and grenfell the hon gentleman have mention the gaming of the system and the test be he as appal as be to read about the way in which those test be game it be say that those product which be design not to burn fail the test so the company go back second time one of the issue with the test be that the temperature have to not rise too much so the company insulate the temperature gauge rather than admit that they have product that ultimately be not fit for the purpose they be try to sell it for be he appal as be that that practice be allow to happen and do he agree that the testing house need to shoulder some responsibility for the fact that it be allow to happen absolutely be appalled and as have say those product be still with we my hon friend the member for dagenham and rainham margaret mullane will refer to recent incident in dagenham where they be try to remediate the problem in september an external wall survey reveal that the cladding on the spectrum building in my constituency be not compliant with building regulation work to remediate that building be not action until three year later in july the building be then engulf by flame few short week ago with only of the remediation work still outstanding do my hon friend agree that urgent step be need to massively scale up the process of remediation agree with my hon friend she have demonstrate how alive and kick this issue be and the need for the new government who have not be in power very long less than week now to step up and step in on the issue of regulation and remediation know that they will do just that because of campaigner whether it be grenfell united the all party parliamentary group on fire safety and on leasehold the clad action group or hon member in this place we now have strong regulation in the form of the building safety act as the new shadow minister the hon member for ruislip northwood and pinner david simmonds have say there be considerable cross party work over that period of time and be the shadow housing and planning minister throughout that week process we certainly have strong regulation framework now to remediate those building and as the minister mention considerable amount of money have be commit billion of pound but the act undoubtedly have some hole remediation be not do at pace it be incredibly slow and it be clad centric as be mention by the hon member for chelmsford marie goldman which mean it do not cover the broad fire safety issue that it should cover the new labour government and the ministerial team have quickly discover they be crystal clear about this that the remediation process be incredibly slow and they be go to turbocharge it seven year on from grenfell only of building have be fully remediate think the minister mention that up to building have be identify so the task in hand be incredible it be alarming but follow the grenfell inquiry phase report know that we will step up and move thing on at pace member have mention insurance premium find it somewhat bizarre that in number of remediate building the insurance premium be go up the shadow minister refer to that how can that be if something be safe surely the risk have go down think there be some fundamental question to ask there there be certainly issue about commission be pass on to management agent and freeholder and plethora of other thing be cause insurance premium to go up minister certainly need to ensure that there be intervention on thing be pass on in service charge such as insurance so that we can bring down cost it may be that we should have similar model to that for flooding with flood re the government have become an underwriter to help bring cost down be not go to get overly party political but intervention by the previous government do not work so collectively we have to move thing forward there be plethora of issue we have talk about insurance and the previous chair of the select committee my hon friend the member for sheffield south east mr betts who be not in his place at the moment refer to issue with mortgage he also mention the lack of parity in funding between social housing provider or housing association and the private sector again that need to be address by the government there be lot of money out there and lot of people with responsibility for this mess need to pay some leaseholder in building such as the decks in my constituency be beyond the scope of the building safety act they do not have protection but be what be call the exclude leaseholder yet if those individual flat be not remediate it mean the whole block be not remediate it also mean that many be face bankruptcy and can not sell on again there be bit more homework to be do at pace by the new government to ensure that there be justice for leaseholder who be innocent in this whole toxic mess my hon friend the member for kensington and bayswater mention one of the key recommendation in the phase report about the regulator and will conclude on this point at the moment the building safety regulator be in the health and safety executive and as he say be not convince it be resource as it should be that add to the mix of confusion around accountability as do the fact that there be several pot four or five different pot of finance we need one single regulator accountable to minister to get grip and provide the drive to remediate such building at pace finally justice be certainly about ensure that all those building up and down the country be safe but it be also about ensure that those responsible for this those responsible for grenfell be bring to account through criminal prosecution be delighted to be able to speak in this debate compliment and congratulate the member who have make their first speech the hon member for bromley and biggin hill peter fortune for calder valley josh fenton glynn for guildford zöe franklin for burnley oliver ryan and for chippenham sarah gibson which be the town where be bear this debate about build safety come on the back of the report by sir martin moore bick on the grenfell fire which should be sober reading for anybody who have any sort of public duty or be in public life it catalogue how privatisation underfunding inadequate surveillance and inadequate supervision lead to vulnerable group of tenant be leave in desperate situation in which large number die he conclude in his report that every single one of those death could have be avoid have there be proper regulation and protection his proposal be far reach and look forward to the government respond in detail in the near future on how they will ensure proper regulation and supervision and above all role for local government as the local inspectorate of all building to ensure that they be all safe and that all the material be correctly put together the idea that deregulation can bring about safety be obviously nonsense and this report have show it to be such recent change to building regulation require approve inspector to be certify that be welcome but do the right hon gentleman agree that the original scheme under which supervision be by local authority which be not financially tie to the contractor developer or employer be considerably safe than this deregulated system with approve inspector perhaps the government should look carefully at change that the hon member be absolutely right the watchword have to be independence of both inspection and regulation the idea that developer can mark their own homework have to be get rid of sharpish because it be dangerous precedent and we can now see the result of it this horrible fire at grenfell do not come from nowhere there be the knowsley fire and the lakanal house fire there be constant reference to the danger of inadequate or inappropriate cladding the lack of fire equipment and the fire risk that go with that this have to be the most massive wake up call there have ever be it also show that community such as those in grenfell be treat with contempt by their local authority regulator and other they simply do not care in grenfell there be mixed group of working class tenant live in dangerous place on the day that the report come out one of the resident be ask about it and he say that the cladding might as well have be make of firelighter give the danger it present to they all something quickly need to be do about that we must look at how we deal with the need for remedial action when the grenfell fire take place inspection be immediately make of building all over the country that be the right thing to do by and large local authority respond well and remove cladding in my local authority islington cladding be discover on one local authority building fyfield house and that be immediately remove by the authority however find that building in the private sector and other building in which leaseholder live have not be deal with in the same way or with the same efficiency and tenant resident and leaseholder be pay the price for that to give an example there be nice leasehold development in my constituency call highbury square it be apparently well build and have good facility the problem be that it have cladding that have not be certify or approve so the insurance cost be very high the developer do not want to pay for the remedial work and despite numerous meeting be hold with ministers in the previous government and so on no action have be take the family live there can not sell or move they can not do anything they be absolutely stuck say in my intervention on the minister that those who have have to incur huge insurance cost just to remain in their flat should be compensate and the stress among people who live in such place should also be recognise through compensation if there be huge dispute about who will pay for all this be quite sure that many company will try to take legal action against the government surely it be the government responsibility to step in if necessary and do the work they can charge it to the owner of the freehold or leasehold who be the cause of the problem in the case mention aviva pension fund be responsible in the case of the drayton park development in my constituency which the ministry be well aware of have several meeting about it with ministers under the previous government and many official it be galliard homes which seem to be try to evade its responsibility to ensure that the work be carry out appeal to the minister to look carefully at the excessive delay cause by endless argument with developer and the owner of freehold those delay have put people at risk and have lead to enormous cost for they come across other development all the time that seem to be in the same situation include some of those at the former arsenal stadium site this debate be about all that in this debate we also recognise how community respond and how they respond to the grenfell fire go there the day after the fire and meet the firefighter who unbelievably bravely have be try to deal with fire the like of which they have never see before they do not really have the wherewithal to deal with it their bravery be enormous and their stress be huge some of they receive abuse from our medium and other who try to put the blame on they they be the last people who should be blame also see how the community come together have be on every one of the silent walk for grenfell that take place every year on the anniversary usually in the company of the former member of parliament for kensington emma dent coad who do fantastic job not just at the time as the mp but since then campaign for safety and justice for the victim of grenfell it need to be recognise that the community come together to support and to demand and they expect answer from this government so that they can live in place of safety in the future the last thing that want to say know that other wish to speak be that fundamentally this debate be about housing and how we treat people we have have market domination of the principle of housing we have go away from the principle of housing as human right and instead to market solution to it all we can see the result several thousand people rough sleeping every night ten of thousand of people live in grotesquely overcrowded condition and many people in my constituency third of they live in the private rented sector which be largely unregulated insecure and very expensive have be leaf through the renters right bill just produce by the secretary of state welcome much of what have read but unless the bill address the fundamental issue of the cost of private renting instead of leave it to the market to set the cost area like mine will suffer from social cleansing for long time to come working class family will be move out because they simply can not afford to stay we want to maintain the community in our inner urban and city area in all part of the country so we need rent regulation as well as security of tenure and all that go with it that mean public intervention build more council house and take the market element out of how planning decision be make on build council housing instead we should say the priority for all our community be sufficient supply of good quality well design council housing finish on this thought we have the potential to build some wonderful place but also to take over many empty property and convert they into some form of council or social housing we need to ensure that housing be well design with sufficient open space and good room size when developer be create home for someone to live in they should think it through change in life disability that may occur and everything else and ensure that we have the high possible quality social housing design for the future this report could be great turning point in the way that we deal with housing in our society or it could be shelve and forget in few year time the people of grenfell who suffer and be still grieve the loss of other will never let we forget it call chris curtis to make his maiden speech start by congratulate the hon member for bromley and biggin hill peter fortune my hon friend the member for calder valley josh fenton glynn the hon member for guildford zöe franklin my hon friend the member for burnley oliver ryan and the hon member for chippenham sarah gibson on their fantastic maiden speech it

lead the milton keynes development corporation with bold and uncompromise vision the mantra that everybody on that team live by be make no little plan fred be streetfighter who more than anything else be willing to do what be need to achieve something that many other have consider impossible get money out of the treasury allegedly he insist on construct the outer road of milton keynes first make it hard for the budget to be cut later scheme that those work on wish they have think of he also once march into whitehall on christmas eve and refuse to leave until his budget be approve just mention to

indoor toilet milton keynes offer beacon of hope high quality home be build for ten of thousand of new resident and at its peak family be move in every single day in just few decade what be once vision on planner desk have transform into one of the uk most dynamic economic powerhouse today we be home to santander uk one of the big bank in the country and red bull racing the fast formula team

five minute walk of park or green space it be say that plant tree be one of the great act of altruism we dig we plant seed and with that small act we shape the world for many generation to come fred roche and the team plant more than fair few tree in fact milton keynes boast over million tree more than per person but would argue that build new town be an even great act of altruism fred pass away few year before be bear but stand here today as member of the first generation that truly benefit from his vision thank to fred design my young parent be able to scrape together enough to raise and my brother in spacious house with its own back garden the dream of home ownership become reality for they provide we with the security and stability need for the good start in life the park and green space they create back then may one day be enjoy by my own child now will not pretend that we do not have our share of challenge one will work tirelessly to address in this place but milton keynes be build on that new town promise of good job public service that be there when you need they and most importantly affordable and high quality new home it be place that give the opportunity so that could one day be stand here give my maiden speech in the house of commons mention that because in my short time in politic have notice that too often people search for excuse to oppose new development there be view or have be view that it be more politically convenient to be voice that yell no rather than voice that search for way to say yes and while the acronym nimby may be modern invention the sentiment be not glance through hansard of the and we find countless example of opposition to the building of my hometown but there be consequence to that short term political thinking if it be not for fred and the milton keynes development corporation team ambition back by the labour government the two bed end of terrace that my brother and grow up in would never have exist as proud son of milton keynes can think of no mission more important for this new government than to build the new town and new home that this country need it will require we to embrace the spirit of fred roche visionary unyielde in the face of opposition and make no little plan but it will allow we to build future where every child in britain have the opportunity to thrive in home and community that nurture their potential as mine do for it be pleasure to address the house on the critical issue of build safety before get to the meat of my speech may congratulate the maiden speaker we have hear today they have take we on tour of britain or perhaps more particularly tour of england that would send the newly reconvene all party parliamentary group on publish into an excitable frenzy hope some of those word find themselves in the publication of the future particularly congratulate the hon member for milton keynes north chris curtis on his maiden speech and thank he and his brother for their service to his constituent and to those imperille by the risk of fire the cladding and fire safety scandal that underpin this discussion be national issue that impact resident in almost every constituency across the country but which do so highly unevenly with different geographical intensity and which for those who be unaffected and unimpacted can go almost entirely unobserved for those who do feel the direct effect the result can be devastating my constituent have make this point to in the most vivid term to find yourself resident in building catch up in the cladding and fire safety scandal be to find yourself lock in bewildering series of revelation and disclosure beyond your control and often beyond your understanding each one of which undermine your confidence in the safety of the place in your life and the life of your family that should be sanctuary your home unlike more urban area my constituency of surrey heath have not be especially hard hit by the scandal but neither have it escape it all together my constituent live in the north court development in camberley our main market town have live through the trauma of find that their building pose serious risk to they from unsafe flammable cladding and fire safety failure that have be present in the building from the point of construction more than year ago risk and threat that should never have be there cover up by plasterboard and panelling and which be only bring to the surface in the month and year follow the tragic loss of life in the grenfell tower fire despite the effort of inquiry to ensure that such tragedy be never repeat accord to figure that have see there remain in the uk today building with unsafe cladding of those be await remediation and of those have yet to even start the process accord to the building safety register that leave around half million life still at risk we must also remember that the government figure relate only to mid and high rise block those above metre in height we have no datum to understand how the building safety crisis be affect many ten hundred and thousand of block that do not meet that height threshold clear and urgent question remain about if when and how the government plan to gather and publish that datum we can not hope to resolve the issue if we have no clear or quantifiable grasp of the scale and scope of the problem where action be take it must be robust efficient and inform by the good expertise available give the potentially fatal consequence of inaction maintain the high standard in future building safety measure be essential recent dispute such as that between barratt homes and the resident of royal artillery quays over combustible panel leave on escape stairwell during remediation work raise serious question about whether current approach to remediation be sufficiently robust we must also question the capacity of the new building safety regulator to investigate such issue recent report state that as of february the regulator have only regulatory lead and eight caseworker situation describe as chronically under resource resident of building undergo remediation work have urgent question and concern that need to be address have be contact by many constituent share their distress and anxiety about process that leave they feel powerless and prisoner in their own home as speak here today the resident of north court be live amid scaffold plastic sheeting and constant noise while the flammable cladding that once wrap their building be remove the recent fire in dagenham underscore the risk associate with such project and we can not allow repeat of that to occur resident across the country be not unaware of these risk and live with the constant uncertainty that they pose the house should commend the extensive legal reform enact after grenfell include the fire safety england regulations the building safety act and the establishment of the building safety regulator however have yet to see the regulator actively enforce the regulation through prosecution we can not allow nor can we afford law pass in this place to go unenforced whether owe to lack of political will insufficient funding for regulator or poorly draft legislation as have already mention the victim and family of grenfell have not yet receive the justice they deserve and can not allow my constituent to suffer similar injustice look forward to see those who violate regulation in the residential property sector hold accountable without further delay while time be of the essence want to ask the minister and indeed the government to take few key action first ask they to act with more haste less speed to ensure that safety be not compromise in the name of expediency the relevant datum must be gather and publish regulation must be robust and regulator must be properly resource secondly ask they to convene building safety crisis taskforce to help shape the resolution of the building safety crisis draw together industry leader resident local and national politician civil servant and third sector stakeholder thirdly ask they to undertake full and holistic review of current and propose building safety regulation in order to understand what work how those regulation interact with one another and the enforceability and the willingness to enforce the regulation currently write into law the safety of my constituent in north court and that of other throughout the country depend on such action commend all the maiden speech that we have hear today feel as if have be on tour of england follow the description of so many constituency may associate myself with what be say by the hon member for bromley and biggin hill peter fortune about his predecessor bob neill now represent part of bob neill former constituency and know from talk to people during the recent general election campaign that he be hold in high regard by his constituent wish he all the good for the future be sick and tired of come here and raise the issue of master gunner place in my constituency it have be in need of remedial work for very long time and still nothing have be do it be build by countryside properties now vistry group ltd and we understand that it be about to be hand over to company call samnas although that be yet to happen have write many time to the manage agent rendall and rittner about issue that have be raise with by my constituent but to no avail be approach by one of my constituent who live in master gunner place he have try to sell his property on four occasion at the final attempt he have one bidder whose bid he accept however the bidder be refuse mortgage owe to the size of the service charge the charge for rise by in to and such charge be now trap people in home they be unable to sell under section of the landlord and tenant act the leaseholder be entitle to demand from the freeholder or the manage agent an explanation of how those charge be arrive at when the resident of master gunner place ask for that they be give only partial information and on several occasion the manage agent fail to meet the requirement to respond within day in the end the agent flatly refuse to supply the miss information when my constituent complain to the manage agent it do not answer it just get its solicitor to respond and threaten he with county court judgment as result of that my constituent have no option because of the term of the lease he have to pay up otherwise he could have be in default he end up pay the service charge plus nearly in legal fee and interest for be two month late with his payment the resident try to mount legal action but ironically they fear that if they be to take on the freeholder over the cost they would risk the freeholder add the cost of defend the action to their service charge because of the term of the lease they be absolutely trap in situation whereby they need the information to be able to legally challenge the freeholder but the freeholder and the manage agent be withhold the information that be need to undertake the action that can not be fair situation for the resident to be leave in do my hon friend agree that it be also about insurance have constituent in similar situation who have have to pay in insurance cost yes insurance cost be drive up service charge have hear of increase in service charge that be attributable to insurance cost insurance company be gouge price and make money on the back of this situation give what have bring we to this debate it be absolutely appalling that they be behave in that way remedial work be ultimately the responsibility of freeholder and contribution from leaseholder should be cap management company be oblige to provide the detail of what they intend to spend on such work but unfortunately they be withhold that information the manage agent should not be able to charge resident anything until the information be supply the cap should be spread over year and no more than one tenth of the cost should be charge in any one year in the absence of the relevant information leaseholder can not check whether the charge that be be impose on they be reasonable if they do not pay they and they challenge they they risk be in default of their lease and receive letter from solicitor the reality be that the term of lease prevent people from be able to get justice the outstanding safety work in the block in master gunner place be simply not be do survey be do at the end of and it be clear that the work need to be do in the intervene year none of it have be carry out the developer vistry group be supposedly in the process of handing over the freehold to samnas but because the legal document have not be sign the leaseholder have be leave in limbo and be unable to progress any of the work the leaseholder engage lawyer to write to the developer in order to get reply on the scope of the work that need to be carry out and they be inform that the work be due to start in august here we be in september and nothing have be do they still have no idea about what work be in scope or what contribution the resident will have to make there be three block involve in the development and to date none of they have have any of the remedial work do it be now time to draw line under all this it have go on for too long we know that the work need to be do we know who be responsible for it and we should not be allow they to drag their foot any more it be time for the remediation acceleration scheme to put rocket under those developer and freeholder we should be ensure that they carry out this work and that if they refuse to do so they be fin only fine will make these people see reason it be only if they be hit financially that they will change their way the remediation acceleration scheme must also include compensation for leaseholder for all the unreasonable charge they have be force to pay because the management company and the freeholder have withhold the information need to ensure accurate fee and charge and that the cap be be properly apply where those company have not do that we should be make sure that they be fin call melanie ward to make her

friend the members for calder valley josh fenton glynn for burnley oliver ryan for milton keynes north chris curtis and for cowdenbeath and kirkcaldy melanie ward and the hon member for bromley and biggin hill peter fortune for guildford zöe franklin and for chippenham sarah gibson represent the new constituency of penrith and solway which take in part of the old carlisle copeland workington and penrith and the border constituency therefore follow some truly great parliamentarian willie whitelaw pillar of strength behind the thatcher government david maclean lord blencathra who now excel in the tradition of likeable nuisance in the other place baroness sue hayman champion of farming and rural affair whose skill will be put to good use on the labour benches sir tony cunningham family friend my father fine mentor rory stewart who now entertain members at least on the labour benches dr neil hudson who have be re elect as the member for epping forest and mark jenkinson who represent

authority step down from that council know that my former colleague will do their good to ensure that challenging local government reorganisation be success as begin my time in this place leave behind

follow set the ground for long last reform that ensure these thing can never happen again commend the decision to create the building safety regulator with its focus on high risk building while many

churchill once say if you put two economist in room you get two opinion unless one of they be lord keynes in which case you get three opinion when it come to the interpretation of british standard affect electrical safety and fire safety my view be that if you put two electrician in room you will get two opinion but if you put the bill payer in the room with they you will only get one the regulator should ensure that any new rule be unambiguous and can be apply consistently have hear number of maiden speech and do not wish to get into the unwinnable debate about whose constituency be the most beautiful will just take it as give that my constituency that take in the solway coast national landscape part of the north pennines national landscape and not least the north lake district include the borrowdale valley for which have deep love be undoubtedly in the top however the real beauty of my constituency be not in its architecture coastline lake or hill it be in the people when

people begin by share the call of grenfell united for the removal of flammable cladding from building now for sprinkler for the hillsborough law and for speedy criminal prosecution of those whose negligence greed and dishonesty kill people but there be something more here which urge hon member to understand the grenfell next of kin group call this report kg of word on page rather than justice the anger that grenfell survivor have express be an anger that many of we feel that in britain today work class people be treat as expendable less than year before the fire the grenfell action group warn that their dangerous living condition would cause catastrophic event an incident that result in serious loss of life they predict their own death because they know how little anyone in power care about keep they alive that be the inescapable conclusion of this report building firm engage in systematic be what the report say to profit without ensure safety some of they know that their insulation be rag inferno but they keep sell it anyway after the early fire at knowsley and lakanal and after large scale test warn of the danger of cladding neither the british government nor kensington and chelsea council come to help the resident of grenfell then after the fire former secretary of state responsible for housing lord pickles loudly tell the inquiry to not take up too much of his time nobody seriously think that the resident of london wealthy street would be so ignore so derided treat with such contempt for decade and leave to die let we tell the truth about the society in which we live when two billionaire drown on submarine voyage to see the titanic powerful country unite in global rescue effort but when poor people and persecute people drown in the english channel or burn in grenfell tower we do not mobilise every single resource to save their life and bring they to safety that be kind of class war war on exploit and persecute people wherever in the world they be bear grenfell tower be name after sir francis grenfell general who carry out colonial violence in ireland sudan and south africa when the british ruling class want cheap labour from place like those it house worker in an unsafe building name after man who may have kill their ancestor and then ignore their warning and leave they to die that be grenfell tower resident have speak up

slough wokingham and bracknell what hear from the fire service about the scale of the problem that it be uncover and the serious threat to human life from build safety issue be incredible to give the house some idea of the problem which relate to clad and other issue the fire service explain that it have discover hole in what should have be safe partition firewall and dangerous cladding in building across the county and that it would take very long time to carry out assessment across the whole of our county just one english county to fully understand the risk to resident not just in tall building but as hon member have mention in low rise flat below the limit set for some of the measure the service set out other problem include wooden cladding poorly design fire door and the need for wake watch incredible work follow on those issue over number of year it have take huge amount of work locally and be sure across the country to tackle that awful legacy there have be significant delay in address many of the problem although they be uncover some year ago it take long time to tackle they under the previous government watch in many case local resident be leave wait several year for remediation to privately own or housing association block welcome the measure that the minister outline to speed up that work and continue to press forward some issue be link to local supply chain

overseas management company be not take action to tackle it quickly enough to make matter bad they could not sell their property and have to live there in some case face very high cost to remove the cladding welcome the minister action on all those thing but wish that the previous government have speed up their measure to tackle this huge problem across the country have question for the minister appreciate that other member have yet to speak so will be brief but want to hear more from she about action to tackle management company base overseas and how she plan to roll that out appreciate that

laura moffatt have know laura for many year in fact the first time ever enter the chamber be when be year old student at holy trinity on work experience sit in that far corner which understand be not correct procedure the support laura have give over the year have be incredibly significant it contribute greatly to my be here today after many year of hard work this year we have an amazing win for the red in crawley be of course speak about crawley town league two play off win it be fantastic result for as one of the town foremost cheerleader it be great that for one day we be absolutely everywhere if people type crawley into google firework pop up in their browser crawley be my home it be where be bear and where go to school it be where have fight on behalf of my community for the last year as councillor council leader and now as an mp honestly believe that crawley be not only the good constituency in the uk but the good town outright our economy be powerhouse deliver one of the great concentration of employment in the country we be one of the uk most visited constituency even though frustratingly every time we be ask where we be from we still have to add it where gatwick airport be crawley be home to mark lemon who during his tenure as editor of punch magazine inspire fear on both side of the house we be home to pioneer electrical engineer dame caroline haslett more recently crawley have give britain one of our lead journalist in dan walker one of our most influential band in the cure and the nation favourite or at least most ubiquitous comedian in romesh ranganathan it have give we gareth southgate england great football manager since alf ramsey and victorious paralympians jodie grinham and katie george dunlevy thank to the long history of municipal socialism in the town our early father and mother include alf pegler bert crane and brenda smith we be bless with fantastic facility such as the hawth and tilgate park home to many of my happy memory include marry the love of my life feel privileged to live in town that have so much to offer however before member pack in their constituency and move down to mine let say that crawley be not without its challenge despite so many accomplished crawleyites social mobility in the town be the low in the south east often have to get into real argument with northern mp to demonstrate that crawley have some of the low social mobility in the country far low than most of the north over recent year rise deprivation have mean that exceptionally high level of employment have do little to assuage poverty in the constituency and over third of crawley child be now grow up in poverty early this year crawley borough council become the first council in the country to declare housing emergency love my town and be here to fight for it and solve those and other issue face the constituency if there be one issue that intend to prioritise above all other during my time in this house it be housing which be not only essential to solve crawley immediate challenge but part of the history of the town fear that this part of my speech may echo many of the sentiment express early by my hon friend the member for milton keynes north chris curtis crawley be mention in domesday book and we be home to an anglo saxon church but the town as it be know today begin in with the passage of the new towns act an amazing achievement that believe rival labour creation of the nhs it have be intend that crawley would be the first of the post war new town but unfortunately stevenage pip we to that title follow last minute legal challenge to the development some thing never change in create the town planner draw inspiration from the garden city movement design each neighbourhood to be its own self contain village incorporate neighbourhood centre with its own school gp community centre and shopping parade and foster strong sense of neighbourhood identity at the centre of the town be modern town centre and to the north be one of the country large industrial estate locate away from residential area where pollution might affect people and provide skilled employment in light industry across the town those planner build comprehensive infrastructure green urban space and high quality council housing ensure that resident from every walk of life could move to crawley if you talk to that first generation of new towner they talk about be able to walk down the street and pick out which of the house they want imagine if that be the case today they could do that because the new town development corporation be grant the power to buy land cheaply at agricultural price and the ability to grant themselves plan permission to deliver at pace believe that the model that work almost year ago remain the most effective mean through which new housing can be deliver in term of quantity quality and affordability indeed the only period over the past century in which the growth in housing supply exceed the growth in demand be when the uk be build the new town the lesson of history certainly recent history be clear no matter how easy it be to get planning permission builder will not build housing if that will result in drop in house price direct delivery can overcome that obstacle be proud to campaign in the election on labour platform champion the development of new town as an alternative to the high cost low quality urban extension and infille that we have all too often see be pleased that the government have already announce their first site and hope that many more will now follow use the same mechanism develop and deploy by nye bevan to bring an end to the appalling housing condition that the country face in be that not what today debate be about in the country face not only shortage of housing but city fill with slum housing in the most appalling condition failure to learn the lesson of history have result in far too many home today pose danger to those live in they from the horror of grenfell tower to the mould that eat away daily at people health the step need to address those risk to life be urgent and necessary we must put resident safety back at the heart of housing but we can not forget that now as in for too many the choice remain between dangerous housing and no housing at all with an intense programme of housing construction base on the new town model of the we have the chance to bring an end to the housing shortage that affect so many of our constituency mine include in the process we can once again ensure that everyone have the dignity of safe place that they can call home call tracy gilbert to make her maiden speech thank you madam deputy speaker for call in this extremely important debate congratulate my hon friend the members for crawley peter lamb and for cowdenbeath and kirkcaldy melanie ward on their touching and move speech really be proud to be one of the scottish delegate in the tradition of maiden speech begin by pay tribute to my

constituency previously represent by the hon member for edinburgh west christine jardine this part of the constituency hold special place in my heart as it neighbour west pilton where live and where my stepchildren go to school and attend greater pilton childcare centre during the it be groundbreaking facility provide family with access to affordable flexible childcare model that hope we can learn from and replicate when we live in west pilton our flat be riddle with damp we have to run dehumidifier constantly and it would produce litre of water daily our child health suffer and paint over black mould be normal we be lucky we be eventually able to move however the flat be still there and would suggest that the issue remain too housing resilience must be priority when building and retrofit home access to safe and secure home be fundamental right and although it be devolved issue in scotland we must learn lesson and work together across government to deliver affordable healthy energy efficient home for all which must include the removal of unsafe cladding also place on record my sincere thank to malcolm chisholm who help we at this time he represent edinburgh north and

start by pay tribute to the victim and survivor of the grenfell fire as well as the wide grenfell community thank the brave firefighter who go to work every day all over the country to keep our community safe theirs be genuine public service and their expertise and selflessness deserve more than just respect start with funding and investment to see they properly resource at their work the contribute factor to the grenfell tragedy can be see in constituency and community all over britain we see they every day when local authority have their budget cut and the service they provide be negatively impact of course it be not just local authority that feel the pain of budget cut our emergency service be no stranger to savage underfunding in scotland more than scottish fire and rescue staff have leave the service in the last decade the scottish government have call on the scottish fire and rescue service to find million worth of saving by saving be the more palatable yet misleading name for cut credit must go to firefighter and their union in scotland because they be protest against the cut that will see hundred of job lose and fire appliance take off the run this relentless underfunding whether to essential public service or in building regulation lead to immiserated and impoverished community that face heighten danger the topic of this debate be highly relevant to an issue in my constituency as domestic property in clackmannanshire have be identify as have reinforce autoclaved aerate concrete include roughly of the council housing stock last october homeowner in tillicoultry receive knock on their door inform they that they have just two hour to gather their belonging and evacuate their property can only imagine the stress that those people must have feel understandably the confusion they feel at such news mean that many leave behind important document such as drive licence and passport as well as personal belonging and precious family heirloom on which frankly monetary price can not be put nearly year on those homeowner still have not be grant access to retrieve their possession among the resident impact by raac meet couple who have live in their flat for year this hard work couple have achieve the dream of home ownership when they finally pay off the mortgage on their ex council flat they describe it as moment of immense pride and achievement those emotion have be replace with anxiety despair and in no small measure anger anger at the insurance company that tell resident that there be no obligation to cover such thing as they say that raac be not name peril or insure cost after evacuation some of the homeowner find themselves place in hotel some choose to stay with family or friend some have to present as homeless and be relocate to clackmannanshire council temporary accommodation some be relocate to bed and breakfast accommodation in kirkcaldy in fife town mile away from tillicoultry what situation to be in for those homeowner who work locally have child in school or look after elderly relative nearly year on and those constituent live life in limbo some be lead nomadic existence go from property to property some feel like burden on their friend and family some tell their physical and mental health have suffer and some have tell that they be star into the abyss that their golden year of retirement have be snatch away because of the financial impact of what have happen to they but all of they be unite by the anguish of not have somewhere to put down root and call home the ever reduce budget provide to local authority be likely to mean that the solution my raac impact constituent will have to be collaborative effort to reiterate clackmannanshire council like so many local authority as well as the scottish fire and rescue service know about budget cut with housing be devolved matter and the scottish government announce half billion pound worth of cut only last week fear the scottish government will not right this wrong either say that with no criticism of the scottish government my constituent do not want finger pointing they want action warmly welcome the resetting of the relationship between the scottish government and this labour government this new positive working relationship be exactly the approach my constituent from tillicoultry will need for they to receive the equitable solution and justice they deserve with that hope the minister will meet to discuss possible solution to the benefit of my constituent congratulate all colleague who have make their maiden speech today it be massive relief once you have do it so congratulation to they all this be really important debate not just for the constituent of colleague who have speak already but for my constituent too want to echo many of the point that colleague have make so far will speak briefly the grenfell tower inquiry publish last week criticise poorly run complacent government department that have fail to act there be leaseholder at no london road in newcastle under lyme who be live in constant fear that history may repeat itself back in leaseholder at no london road be make aware that an external survey have highlight significant fire safety concern over the building cladding and that urgent action be need the site be approve for government fund renovation but over two year later the previous government have fail to act to protect the safety of my constituent it get bad on top of live in constant fear of fire break out the leaseholder have be leave to foot the bill of premium insurance cost due to the building safety concern five year ago the insurance premium be today it have rise to as result leaseholder at no london road in newcastle under lyme be be force to borrow money and some have declare bankruptcy be sure the minister will agree with that this situation be completely unacceptable and can not go on hope he will find time to meet know other colleague have seek such meeting too because we need to ensure that this government act where the previous government fail with the leave of the house will close this debate for his majesty loyal opposition it have be very constructive debate with wide range of contribution from member congratulate all member who make their maiden speech it be strike that they cover huge range of different issue which have be debate and will be debate in this parliament be particularly strike by the expertise show in area as diverse as local government housing electronic and support for refugee all of which be sure will play significant part in the future would also like to put on record my thank to my hon friend the member for bromley and biggin hill peter fortune for his very entertaining maiden speech the hon member for sheffield south east mr betts make some observation about the hackitt review and the liability of construction material manufacturer for the consequence of significant problem in the building in which their material be use as the minister say the billion building safety fund which be put in place in the previous parliament be significant step towards address those concern but it be clear that that be just one example of the many issue that need to be address have list of point to put to the minister and hope we will be able to work constructively together as we take forward variety of legislation couple of member touch on personal evacuation plan consultation take place in in which wide variety of stakeholder be invite to express their view key concern raise by the local government association declare an interest as parliamentary vice president of that organisation be that current legislation imply that there be duty on local authority and social housing provider to anticipate without have to be ask or inform by resident the need of those who may require special arrangement for evacuation in the event of an emergency it be clear from feedback across the sector that where there be no expectation that tenant or an occupier will advise particular individual or authority that present significant challenge suggest to ministers that as they bring forward the government response that issue be address with high degree of clarity so that everybody know their responsibility and where they stand be strike by observation make by number of member about particular challenge include issue with fire door and latent defect in building which may not be spot at the time of building regulation inspection have personal experience of work in local authority that commission school we discover afterwards that the fire door which look robust and solid only go up as far as the suspend ceiling that have be instal by the contractor in such an example the individual do the building inspection may need to have significant part of the building take apart so that they can carry out their duty and see what need to be do we need to ask ourselves how we can ensure that that enforcement be see as reasonable by contractor and can be resource effectively by local authority so that latent defect in item such as fire door and fire stopping do not arise and create risk that simply can not be effectively manage for the future number of member make reference to the long term history of the current set of building safety challenge be well aware have be in local government throughout that period that the approach take by the previous labour government be to create arm length management organisation for housing some member include the hon member for burnley oliver ryan make particularly positive reference to the last labour government retrofit programme simply urge member as they begin to think how they would wish to resource some of this work in the public sector building stock to ensure that we do not see return of that approach let create arm length management organisation load they with the debt so it be on the government book and then expect they to carry out the work the number of arm length management organisation have diminish there be time under previous labour government when local authority could not access that funding unless they set up an arm length management organisation small number of those organisation remain but the vast majority of local authority area have determine that it be more efficient to do this work directly and in house have high degree of control visibility and accountability for that work be step forward so urge those who might be tempt by the view that arm length body be the way to leverage additional funding into the sector without it appear directly as cost to government to avoid that approach we should be absolutely clear about the route for the provision of those resource and about the accountability for they in her maiden speech the hon member for chippenham sarah gibson make reference to flooding as an example of an additional issue that give rise to build safety and resilience challenge although it be not touch on in today debate we also need to reflect that this house have in the past have to get to grip with issue such as the impact of legionella and the significant building regulation change need to ensure that very vulnerable resident be not place at risk by failure to carry out the proper inspection of build safety system and have have to ensure that building regulation and instal system be function as they should to keep people safe from that particular risk this wide range debate have touch on many different element of the building safety and resilience world and hope that that will inform ministers thinking however have particular question on which want to press they for an answer at the beginning of the debate we hear from the under secretary of state for housing communities and local government the hon member for bethnal green and stepney rushanara ali about the decision to return to or enable the use of the eu standard relate to construction material know that mention of eu standard have trigger effect on some member it do not have that impact on because be strong supporter of close co operation with our neighbour think that the minister be probably refer to the write ministerial statement of september in which the government announce the decision to remove the end date that have previously apply the date by which ce mark construction material could be sell within the uk market and to allow those product to continue to be supply to that market with no end date that strike as reasonable decision but should like to have specific assurance on one point the eu regulation on the fire safety of construction product date from and those be the relevant regulation apply to product that meet the ce mark standard that be of course before the grenfell tower disaster occur uk regulation be update in response to the disaster by the previous government in and take account of the specific risk relate to construction material that be identify in the initial phase of the report may ask the minister to assure the house from the dispatch box that follow the government decision to set aside the end date by which only the ce mark be require and to allow uk standard to be effectively set aside the standard of the product that be import to the uk meet at least the uk post grenfell fire safety standard otherwise there be risk that product that we would not be satisfied to see instal in building and that have give rise to serious concern in the past may continue to be supply to the market because they meet those eu standard even though they may not meet the new uk standard many of my constituent be extremely concerned for their safety they be live in constant fear because of build safety and resilience issue be sure the shadow minister agree that the pace of remediation have be too slow in the seven year since the grenfell tragedy do he also agree that firm action need to be take by developer freeholder manufacturer and other organisation and that the government must push to ensure that the pace of remediation be quicken entirely agree about the need to ensure that this work happen apace during the debate the contribution from the like of the hon member for sheffield south east and for runcorn and helsby mike amesbury demonstrate the complexity of some of the issue with which government of all party have wrestle over the year have the insulation material that be identify in the grenfell report in my own home because in certain application it be consider to be within building regulation we know that this be not straightforward process and we need to ensure that building regulation have the absolute clarity that local authority require that be why press the minister on this point can we as house be confident that the consequence of that write ministerial statement will not be risk of material that do not meet the standard that we impose in be import and sell into the uk market it be clear that there will always be debate not just in the context of housing but in the context of any complex public service in this country between those who think that the good approach for regulation be to specify the outcome that we want to see we want the resident to be safe in their home we want the child to be safe in the child home and we want the patient to be safe in hospital that be very similar to the approach take in the aviation sector which be mention early and those who argue that the good approach be for parliament and other relevant authority to specify the precise safety feature that we wish to see instal each of those approach have strength and weakness the previous government particularly in the early year be keen to focus on the safety outcome that be be pursue rather than to specify individual measure that have to be take partly out of concern that those individual measure might not be as effective in practice as they need to be it be clear from the contribution by member of all party that they understand the complexity of this debate the minister will have to make decision as we consider the future of building regulation do parliament specify that there have be sprinkler system in one building but mister system in another be we go to specify that there have to be dry riser in one type of building and wet riser in another type of building or be those simply matter that we prefer to leave to local building control service while specify the level of safety that we expect to achieve all of these be important element in this complex debate as say in opening for his majesty loyal opposition we be determined to carry forward the work that we do in the last parliament largely in partnership with labour members on fire safety and building safety those piece of legislation inevitably require the current government to provide guidance to local authority build control service builder construction firm and other part of the sector by work together constructively to support the effective implementation of those measure and provide absolute clarity on the expectation we will achieve our shared aim of ensure that all our constituent know that the building in which they live and work and in which they be educate and receive medical treatment meet the relevant safety standard and be environment and place in which they can safely go about their daily business call the minister this have be an important debate on the safety of our residential building and more importantly the safety of the resident who call those building home the final report of the grenfell tower inquiry set out the appalling failure of the industry and successive government as my right hon and learn friend the prime minister set out in his statement to the house we apologise on behalf of the state to each and every one of the bereaved family and survivor and to the immediate grenfell community we will demand responsibility for build safety responsibility from this government and responsibility across the industry too many building still have unsafe cladding and the pace of remediation have be too slow like many colleague in the house be in this chamber seven year ago have we say to ourselves then that we would still be in the same situation seven year later think we would have consider that we have fail that be very much the case and this government intend to address the failure as say too many building have unsafe cladding and the funding be there there be no excuse for building owner not to enter cladding scheme for which they be eligible we will accelerate effort to bring all remain building into remediation scheme and empower regulator and local authority to act include by consider new legislation for good reason much of this debate have be about safety rather than resilience but as the minister with responsibility for local resilience want to make the point that we be look very closely at resilience at both national and local level in response to the grenfell tower inquiry and the inquiry into the covid pandemic we be look at way in which we can response to crisis and the chancellor of the duchy of lancaster be lead review of resilience which will include work with the devolved government regional mayor local leader and local resilience partnership again the report have say that we ought be do that we be look at the recommendation very carefully and make sure that local area be empower and have the capacity to respond in time of crisis thank the minister for give way on the point about resilience obviously firefighter and the fbu be key stakeholder in resilience work want to ask question that ask early about the statutory advisory body in response to grenfell what be the government timetable for develop that and get it on board be grateful to the hon member for her question be the shadow fire minister before the election and be very proud to get into our manifesto the commitment to get the fire family in the same room and drive standard can not give she the exact date today but can tell she that deal with this issue be priority for the home office and we be get on with it this have be slightly odd debate because its substance be exceptionally serious and rooted in one of the nation great tragedy but we have also have the joy of dozen member make their maiden speech the hon member for bromley and biggin hill peter fortune say in his eloquent speech that he hop those watch would understand why it have be this way will pay due respect to those colleague by reflect on some of the thing they have say start with the hon member for bromley and biggin hill everything he say about his predecessor bob neill be true bob be so respected on both side of the house and the way the hon gentleman start be very much the way that bob finish which be very encouraging he mention the brave pilot leave his constituency to go to war and their sacrifice so that we can hold debate today that represent the spirit that we should all hold to every day that we be here his point be well make he also bravely say that the only football league team that have conservative member of parliament be his team in bromley and that notts county fan might remind people of that at the weekend as member of parliament for nottingham will let my pies support friend know although think the language might be more choice than the suggestion the hon gentleman come up with my hon friend the member for calder valley josh fenton glynn have show incredible persistence in get here as he say this be his fourth time stand for election and that say lot about he because other might not have bother it be really hard to run for election certainly in the face of disappointment and in of an incredibly narrow loss other might have look for alternative seat but he love his community calder valley and he be one and the same so it do not surprise that he stay on and it be source of great joy that he be here he talk about the long running no in the chart have originate from calder valley he be no for long time but now he have reach no similarly the hon member for guildford zöe franklin she say that this be her third attempt to get elect and she have show similar persistence she say that she bring with she message of change she mention special educational need and water quality this parliament and indeed this government will be measure by the progress make on those two issue like my hon friend the member for burnley oliver ryan be proudly one of the labour and co op members of this parliament we join may or and more than councillor as labour and co operator it be great joy to see he in his place be strike by what he say it make feel similarly about my community he talk about the proud heritage of his town but also its ambitious future he say that the industry might change but the principle will be the same as minister for town give the commitment that will work closely with he to make that reality although think he be brave to say that labour leader have come from his constituency very early on see the whip make note straight away thank the minister for his kind word be sure he will agree that town be the centre of lot of our community hope he will support the continue effort to rejuvenate town centre effort see in community such as mine in calder valley and that of my hon friend the member for burnley oliver ryan we need to make sure that our town continue to thrive in the come century and reinvent themselves just as the mill reinvent themselves in my community absolutely can give that commitment think the model will change well know the model will change we want to get rid of the beauty parade and move to more allocative model of funding base on local priority and local leadership in order to rejuvenate our town and drive our economy forwards the hon member for chippenham sarah gibson confess that she be previously an architect hope that she will bring her insight to the department work particularly on housing our door will be open possibly not uncommonly she say that she will fight for more train station for her constituency suspect that many will join she there be beautiful irony in my hon friend the member for milton keynes north chris curtis say that his constituency be the home of the cock and bull story because although he be always very modest about this he have significant public profile in an industry that be about anything but cock and bull story it be all about very hard polling on many occasion when have have an idea that think be brilliant he have disappoint by find way to say on twitter why what propose be not right or desirable in the eye of the public but he have always be friend to when have ask he stupid question about polling and appreciate that will the minister give way will in second but have not finish with my hon friend just yet he be very well know pollster but people do not know just how much he love milton keynes he love it to the point of perhaps go on about it bit but not today there be great experience from milton keynes on the subject of new town and city and hope that he will help we in this parliament my background in polling teach that we need to listen and speak to people from across society as we do in that industry and make sure that there be nobody who do not get listen to that be very important in this debate because lot of the problem address in it be cause by community and housing body not be listen to that have result in lot of these problem not be bring to the forefront do the minister agree that across politic and on all the issue that we discuss in this house we need to be make sure that we listen and speak to everyone in society as pollster do that be right that be well express sentiment in the context of this debate it be our job of course to express what we think and all of we will have strongly hold view but it be so crucial that we be tribune for our community and give voice to those who be least hear that be such an important role be pleased to hear the minister make reference to new town my constituency of central ayrshire benefit from the new town of irvine where be bear just recently irvine be part of the government long term plan for town programme and secure commitment to million to help we bring irvine back to its good day hope that the minister agree that new town be essential to economic growth and development both in scotland and the rest of the uk could not agree more new town be feature of our manifesto and there be deal of public excitement about that the minister know that have great deal of time and admiration for he have rise to my foot on the subject of building safety because many of my slough constituent particularly leaseholder be feed up of be fleece the labour party manifesto commit to leasehold reform so will the minister say exactly what action the government will take to assuage the concern of my constituent as always my hon friend give great voice to the people of slough we have hear clearly the message on leasehold reform and we be look at it very closely will cover little of what we be plan to do in the substantive part of my speech my hon friend the member for cowdenbeath and kirkcaldy melanie ward make important point about her fight and her predecessor fight for woman equality so much progress have be make but we be well short of an equal parliament as we be every time we should all reflect on that as collective and in our political party and on how we can change that it will change in our lifetime but the pace be far too slow my hon friend have the enviable but perhaps daunt task of follow not only gordon brown but jennie lee two giant of the labour movement but the passion and conviction with which she speak augur well as do she work for medical aid for palestinians recently she speak very movingly about her colleague and the work they do my hon friend will have notice that in my first speech mention that in fife we have housing emergency draw his attention to the fact that in march the snp scottish government cut the affordable supply programme budget by almost million the new uk labour government be have to clean up the mess leave by the conservative government their black hole of billion in scotland the snp have be in power for year and have no excuse fife council have hop to build new council home over the next five year but that be now under threat too many people in my area as say in my speech do not have safe appropriate place to call home do my hon friend agree that it be about time the snp take responsibility for its financial mismanagement note once again that snp members be not present in the chamber for this important debate this be perhaps the defining issue of this generation all political leader have to demonstrate that they understand the frustration and pain cause by the lack of decent housing in this country we be talk today about some very direct and fatal consequence but across the country there be other way in which housing problem limit aspiration health and opportunity we be elect on manifesto promise to deliver change but colleague in other part of the union have to realise that they also have responsibility it be time to make few excuse and build more house be frustrate with the snp government slow progress on facilitate the removal of dangerous flammable cladding the scottish government be allocate million by this place to facilitate the programme but only million have be use with only one project be complete to date do the minister agree that the snp government need to address this imbalance urgently if anything have come out of the report and if we have learn anything over the last seven year it be that get these remediation do require really strong political will we make that commitment in the apology we give and we be take action we need to see that north of the border too on strong political leadership will the minister join in congratulate those council that as soon as the new building regulation come out take immediate action to put in wake watch be talk about the wide regulation not just the one about cladding but the one about compartmentalisation in milton keynes within year we have empty two tower block that have compartmentalisation rehouse more than family and then demolish the tower whereas milton keynes family in private development with similar issue be still wait for remediation work to be do we often hear that council be slow than the private sector but do the minister agree that council have respond more quickly and more responsibly than the private sector to these issue my hon friend be too humble to point to her role in milton keynes but the political will exercise on that and many other housing issue have get result the government will display the same degree of political will and we need to see it in local government too milton keynes set really good example it be troubling that many owner who accord to the act be responsible for fire safety in these block be seek to establish themselves in foreign jurisdiction often in tax haven how can the government take action to ensure that those who be responsible often those who be responsible for the defect in the first place and who be now seek to evade jurisdiction in this country can be bring to justice will the government have to appropriate these building to do the remediation work that be so badly need and not at resident expense this be on two track first we have deal with of the big developer to do those remediation the money be there and they need to get on with it significant majority if not vast majority of case will see that action that will cover most people as my hon friend say action be not as easy where firm have go bust disappear or choose more nefarious option to evade their responsibility we have set aside grant funding to ensure people do not suffer as result of that so hope that give an assurance that no matter the hoop or the attempt at evasion make by those who really ought to do well the government will stand by the people who be most affected rise an enviable choice of hon friend wish to intervene give way first to my hon friend the member for hitchin alistair strathern thank my hon friend for give way he be clearly very popular want to follow up on the compelling point make by my hon friend the member for brent west barry gardiner who say that lot of the issue we have talk about today be exacerbate by the fact that the owner of the building the freeholder in these case be not always willing to fulfil their obligation to do right by their tenant this government be commit to enact legislation to bring in the important reform need to truly bring an end to the problematic nature of leasehold relationship will the minister be work closely with other in his department to ensure building safety be at the heart of those regulation so we have join up approach to tackle the issue at its root will come back to what we be go to do about leasehold in more detail in second but the principle be exactly as he say we will be hold those principle in our head as we consider our response to the report to ensure our action legislative or otherwise meet the moment rise be about halfway through my remark about the maiden speech we have hear but assure colleague that have an awful lot to say on the substance of the debate hon member hear hear be keen to take intervention at that point but it would be great joy if they could let finish my remark about the maiden speech first my hon friend the member for penrith and solway be bear and breed of his community and obviously come from long line of people who have make difference to it his experience around leasehold will be useful for we in government as will his knowledge of electrical safety which be at the root of the issue my hon friend the member for halesowen alex ballinger talk about two predecessor who be distinctive one for their hair and one for their coat and wonder what his distinctive nature might be sadly it will not be his name as join he in that already but wonder if the distinction will be the extraordinary service in the armed force that he his brother and four generation of his family have give to our country his be staggering story of commitment to this country he be now enter different phase and type of service in which know he will excel and that he will find rewarding in different way serve his country and his community my hon friend the member for crawley peter lamb talk about first come here as year old and as result get taste and enthusiasm for the house wonder how many other member come here when they be young and be inspire in my case be but suspect that will be true for many other it speak to the responsibility that we have as parliamentarian to use the brilliant thing that parliament have to share and promote parliament and democracy to young people in our community commend my hon friend for his brilliant work on his borough council be not surprised he have make the analysis that he now want to come here and fight for his town because make similar analysis know it frustrate he when people say about his constituency that gatwick be distinctive of it but it be an important part of our country both for holidaymaker and for people arrive for the first time that first moment be so important to their integration and their life here my hon friend the member for edinburgh north and leith tracy gilbert share her story be sure many right hon and hon member would associate themselves with the challenge in childhood that inspire she to be here today she speak about housing be devolved issue and it be right that it should be handle appropriately but hope she have take some succour as have from the prime minister and deputy prime minister attempt to reset relation with devolved government on the issue of housing as on many other we can do good work she offer we all visit as well as the inducement of whisky and the edinburgh festival be sure the minister will remember from my speech the harrowing story of my constituent from tillicoultry who have suffer and continue to suffer from the horrible mental and physical impact of be evacuate from their home at such short notice will he agree to meet to discuss possible solution for my constituent bear in mind the resetting of relationship between this labour government and the scottish government and the fact that housing be devolved issue my hon friend make some very important point about reinforce autoclaved aerate concrete which shall address shortly on his request to meet let say that be always happy to accept such invitation as be the minister with lead responsibility for resilience it may be well if my hon friend the minister with responsibility for building safety take that meeting she be very keen to meet colleague to discuss what support we can offer as government finally my hon friend the member for isle of wight west mr quigley may be proud islander but can detect nottinghamshire accent from pace watch sherwood make my ear go know that he be proud islander but like his predecessor he have that connection with nottinghamshire he also have the accolade of be the first chip shop owner to enter parliament that again be very good inducement to get colleague and perhaps ministers to visit he we do recognise that life be different on the island and as result some of the challenge be different we in the ministry of housing communities and local government be ready to support he in his work in that space move on to the contribution of colleague who be not make their maiden speech that be probably well time because judge by the face behind my hon friend the member for sheffield south east mr betts be come to the end of his time as select committee chair he have show such incredible leadership he be great parliamentarian and have always be such good and kind friend to think it be safe to say that ministers who have be before his committee have find he tough and hard but also very fair he be also very kind man his service have be extraordinary let mention some of the point that my hon friend make he talk about what help can be give to resident who wish to legally challenge recalcitrant owner and developer regulator have power to act against such owner and we expect they to do so our department be responsible for hold to account developer who have sign the developer remediation contract so if resident be concerned about the progress of remediation of their building they should contact the regulator if they be concerned about the progress of developer lead remediation they should contact the department hope that address the hon gentleman point do not know whether my hon friend hear the example that give early of management agency not give the information to leaseholder to check whether they be be charge the right amount of money or even to seek legal redress there seem to be no power to force those agency to give that information my hon friend will be pleased with the answer that have to that question which with his forbearance will give once have deal with the next few question my hon friend the member for sheffield south east reference the morrell and day report publish last year to which the previous government do not respond the intention of this government be to bring forward proposal for system wide reform of the construction product regulatory regime which will tackle issue both in that report and the grenfell tower inquiry report we think that it make sense to do that as collective piece of work my hon friend mention product manufacturer and remediation cost which the shadow minister also talk about we be currently work on identify how we might strengthen the building safety act to ensure that such manufacturer can make contribution we have be take action already through the recovery strategy unit to hold those construction product manufacturer to account and to get money out of they for their share of the cost where the work have not have the result that we want we have write to institutional investor and encourage sponsor to reconsider their partnership which have result in the severance of two sponsorship deal as well as another to which colleague refer early we know that more may be need in this space so we will continue to do that will the minister give way will it be very hard not to have an intervention from jim shannon thank you madam deputy speaker outline the case for the legislation and for build safety and resilience go forward do the minister intend to share the finding with the region of scotland wales and northern ireland which represent so that the appropriate department in the northern ireland assembly can take the legislative measure forward constructively to ensure safety for we in northern ireland as well can give the hon gentleman that assurance we will absolutely share the good of our knowledge and insight be sure that will be two way process to ensure that we be do right by everybody across great britain and northern ireland thank the minister for his kind word about my chairing of the select committee be really pleased that he be now look at raise some money from product manufacturer they have escape their responsibility for far too long might suggest that he use some of the money raise to help with social housing provider give the concern that raise about their be treat differently in their access to the building safety fund my hon friend suggestion often come with smile but degree of force he will know that we be not very far from spending review and budget so will not make financial commitment at this point however that idea be well express and duly note as result be grateful for it endorse what the minister say about our hon friend the member for sheffield south east mr betts too have the great honour of serve on his committee many year ago and at that time the focus be very much on housing in relation to building safety in islington where we all live on top of each other in flat in there be dangerous block of flat which be terrify for my constituent many of whom be in fact private tenant not social housing tenant we do an audit in my office and have be push we now have only four block leave but it ought to be put on the record how terrifying it be over the year for those local resident who have to pay for fire watch could not sell their flat and do not know what be go to happen have not be know for praise the department over the year but we be very grateful in islington south for the support that we have be give by the department until now the right hon lady have put that on the record it speak to my early point about the importance of political will in this space if we just wait for something to happen we be not go to see it there need to be political grip at the national and local level and we will certainly play our role in that on her point about what her constituent live with she would have be sit on the opposition front bench seven year ago be behind she when everybody say never again what action can we take no job be too big or small but that be not what happen it be huge broken promise to the british people her constituent and beyond on the point about political will the leasehold system be unfortunately still alive and kicking know that many of we look forward to see that feudal system kick into the history book via oncoming legislation it seem that service charge have become cash cow for some interesting character in the industry what will the minister and his team do to ensure that we move thing forward and that commonhold be the de facto tenancy in this country for flat my hon friend hear what say about leasehold and what we say in the manifesto that we both stand on will get to service charge shortly because both he and our hon friend the member for eltham and chislehurst clive efford make that point very well think they will be glad to hear what have to say let deal first though with prosecution refer particularly to my hon friend the member for kensington and bayswater joe powell he have the close stake in this issue and speak today with incredible passion know that he will be an outstanding advocate for his community and be sure that he will bring forward lot of his frustration about the pace of change think that point be well make he have make multiple time the point about prosecution as my right hon friend the prime minister set out in his recent statement to the house those affect have wait too long for justice and those responsible must be hold accountable as the met police have say this will take time it be one of the large and most complex investigation that they have ever have to conduct with officer and staff dedicate to it we fully support the met and the crown prosecution service as they carry out their investigation they must be give space to do that we have be talk quite passionately in this debate but we often lose sight of the story of those who be actually affect think not least of woman she shall remain anonymous who buy her flat as way to ensure that she and her husband would be debt free in their retirement unfortunately her husband have pass away although they plan to be able to pay for the insurance and the service charge those cost have go up by she an elderly lady in her retirement be now accrue debt that she never want to pass on to her family that be an issue not of cladding but of wide thing for she the mess that have be leave and the lack of clarity around remediation mean that her daily life be now stressful situation do the minister agree that the secretary of state in the previous government who be responsible for this mess and misery have no place lead any political party in this country everyone will have be anger by what we see in the report all those who play part and make decision will rightly reflect on their role and responsibility in this and will assume make appropriate judgment in respect of the scale of the issue my hon friend talk about service charge so will turn next to that point before the minister move on to service charge remind the house of something that say last week follow the prime minister statement about similar fire that take place in irvine in my constituency in fire rip through storey block of flat lead to one fatality thank to the work of my predecessor sir brian donohoe building regulation be change follow that fire hope that the minister will consider those building regulation and the garnock court fire as he examine what go wrong in the terrible tragedy at grenfell be grateful for that thoughtful intervention can assure my hon friend that minister be indeed consider that as part of this whole process we need to learn those lesson on regulation my hon friend will know that sir martin moore bick report make very strong statement about the difficulty of reconcile the role of maintain standard with the competitive environment it be when building control cease to be the responsibility solely of local authority and become privatised building control function that thing start to go wrong what action will my hon friend and the government take to ensure that one set of standard be apply in one particular way and be not subject to trading say we will give you shortcut if you come to we be what go on but it be wrong and need to stop throughout the debate colleague have raise important and startling account of just that the way in which standard have be circumvent that speak to what my hon friend the member for sheffield south east say at the beginning about how the culture have fall into race to the bottom on the regulatory change that my hon friend the member for brent west barry gardiner want to see from the government we be look at the report and have make commitment to come back on it within six month we will give the chamber the chance to discuss the report in great detail hope he can give we the space to come forward with those suggestion and change but his point be well make the uk government have pledge to speed up the process of remove dangerous cladding from english building follow the publication of the damn grenfell inquiry report which set out series of significant failure do the minister agree that the scottish government must start treat the issue with the urgency it deserve the snp have already re profiled hundred of thousand of pound from this vital programme to plug the black hole it create in its own budget this can not happen again building safety can not be sacrifice to snp incompetence and financial mismanagement theme of this debate have be that we will not make the change we need to make or keep people safe in the way they should be able to expect without really strong political will at whatever level and whatever point politician touch the process it be incumbent on all of we to use all the lever and tool we have to ensure that we meet our responsibility where colleague have not do so they really must reflect on that frankly and change the minister be be very generous with his time wonder whether he will meet and representative from burnley council which have very good retrofit scheme that actually make profit for the council and seem to retrofit street after street of terrace house in burnley note with interest the comment make by the shadow minister about arm length company use under the previous labour government to precipitate retrofit programme in area such as burnley include burnley wood and trinity that approach work and actually bring great deal of investment into street that be quite frankly still in need of repair and retrofit be the minister interested in come to burnley to meet on that front and may praise he for his kind word about burnley padiham and brierfield early be grateful for that kind offer of course will readily accept visit to burnley perhaps through the lens of my role as the local growth and town minister we could have very interesting visit and would be glad to do it be conscious of the time be go to run out of it unthinkably we may have to pick up any further intervention in different form because want to get to the point about building insurance lending and service charge raise by my hon friend the members for runcorn and helsby mike amesbury for eltham and chislehurst and for newcastle under lyme adam jogee one thing we know be that there have not be enough change in this space over the past seven year but there have be change in the insurance bill that many leaseholder have be face we understand the financial and emotional impact that extreme insurance premium have be have on leaseholder affected leaseholder have be burden with pay too high premium for too long assure colleague that we be work actively to reduce premium for leaseholder and we be review how well to protect leaseholder from cost and push for fair premium for leaseholder in building with fire safety issue colleague have talk about buying sell or remortgage home we have see improvement in that space but we remain vigilant we will continue to hold particularly the large lender to account follow their commitment to lend on property even where remediation be not yet complete they must keep that report october vol correction on service charge by law variable service charge must be reasonable as colleague have raise that have be stretch significantly by some of the practice we have see the leasehold and freehold reform act contain measure to ensure that leaseholder get key financial and non financial information so that they can scrutinise and hold to account the organisation that they be work with on service charge not all of that legislation have be commence secondary legislation be require but we be work on that actively we just want to get it right my hon friend the member for read central matt rodda talk about the pace of remediation again we accept that the pace be too slow we have say that throughout and what we have see in dagenham and slough be horrific reminder of the risk that unsafe clad still pose to far too many people the deputy prime minister have be very clear on her intention to drive that forward again there be that political will and to get more action out of manufacturer freeholder developer and organisation with responsibility for make sure that building be safe too many building owner be still not act quickly enough so we will investigate pursue the most egregious actor who be create unacceptable delay and hold they to account the message from this dispatch box and from this government be clear use the route we have create to get your building fix and get on with it now turn to the point make by the right hon member for islington north jeremy corbyn and the hon member for coventry south zarah sultana about the inquiry the right hon gentleman express concern that the report would be shelve and the hon lady be concerned that it would just be word so again let make the commitment this speak to the response give to my hon friend the member for brent west barry gardiner that the report recommendation must be consider with the seriousness that this tragedy deserve we will look at all recommendation in detail there will be debate on the floor of this house we will respond in full within six month and we will be listen to the community throughout the process we will update parliament annually on our progress so that we can be hold to account but we will also get on quickly with the thing we can do whether that be speed up remediation or reform construction product the change have not be at the pace that it ought to have be but it will get well can commit that the report will not as the right hon gentleman have say just be shelve far from it the hon member for surrey heath dr pinkerton and for woking mr forster mention building under metre our approach to clad remediation have be to prioritise the risk of loss of life it be generally accept that the risk to life be proportional to the height of building so the risk to life be usually low in building under metre and they be very unlikely to need the same costly remediation build safety remediation work may be require in very small number of those building but so far our casework as department over the past couple of year show that of the more than case that have be raise only three have fall into that category as such we think that be an appropriate distinction to draw my hon friend the member for alloa and grangemouth brian leishman make point about raac this issue be different in scotland than it be in england scotland have its own responsibility which the scottish government must work within and as say to my hon friend we will work within the good practice too it be the duty of building owner include local authority if they be the owner to fulfil their duty to manage building safety and performance risk of all kind include raac in proportionate manner the shadow minister the hon member for ruislip northwood and pinner david simmonds talk about personal evacuation plan or peep we must ensure that the most vulnerable in our society be protect on september through write ministerial statement the government announce that the home office will bring forward in the autumn proposal to improve fire safety and the evacuation of disabled or vulnerable resident in high rise and high risk residential building in england those proposal will be call residential peep through they resident with disability and impairment will be entitle to person centre risk assessment to identify the appropriate equipment and adjustment to aid their fire safety and evacuation as well as residential peep statement that say what vulnerable resident should do in the event of fire the government have commit funding next year to begin that important work by support social housing provider to deliver peep for their renter the shadow minister also mention product hallmark we stand by what be say in the write ministerial statement would have hop that give enough confidence but for clarity this be about strong standard not weak standard hope the hon gentleman can take confidence from that will the minister give way very briefly would just like to press the minister for the assurance be seek that the government have take step to ensure that all product that meet the european standard and therefore be within the scope of what the hon member for bethnal green and stepney rushanara ali say in the write ministerial statement will also as minimum meet the post grenfell uk standard my colleague and hon friend the minister for building safety have hear that intervention as say everything that we have say be about high standard not less standard but my hon friend will write to the hon gentleman about the issue he have raise again hope that can assure he that this be about great standard not less one to conclude as the prime minister make clear the grenfell tower tragedy be the result of unacceptable inherent and systematic issue and decade of failure from both industry and government it be go to take political will to change that and we offer it question put and agree to resolve that this house have consider build safety and resilience speaker statement we now come to the result of the select committee chair election the result for the chairs who be unopposed be announce on monday the election for the contest post be hold by secret ballot today and member vote the successful candidate be business and trade committee liam byrne

he make the observation in soon after the country formation but it apply again since august after momentous event happen in that country no one see it come but the previous prime minister sheikh hasina who have look so entrenched be overthrow within day her replacement be professor muhammad yunus nobel prize winner for his concept of microfinance that do not happen without bloodshed hundred of student be kill in the struggle for the new bangladesh as people have call it and thousand injure bangladesh found constitution it be only young country stress democracy secularism and socialism but in recent year it have become synonymous with corruption authoritarianism and repression there be echo of saddam hussein fall when we see tv picture of statue of the first ever leader sheikh mujibur rahman topple with effigy of he burn and picture smash from the capital city dhaka to tower hamlets it be all because of his daughter the ex pm sheikh hasina who have rule in two burst for large percentage of the country existence it be she who ensure the omnipresent picture of her dad across the nation for it have echo of tiananmen square in although in this case the student win there may be fledgling interim government but feel they have very good intention and we should congratulate they rise rise will give way to the new chair of the defence committee thank my hon friend and congratulate she on secure this adjournment debate about democracy in bangladesh after the recent upheaval many of my constituent in slough and people across the globe be extremely concerned about not just democracy but the right of minority there have be many attack in particular on the hindu minority community do she agree that it be incumbent on the new administration to safeguard the right of all minority within bangladesh my hon friend always make excellent point when we be talk about minority such as hindus and buddhists there be various minority it be interesting to look at who be propagate the story there have also be picture of devout muslim student from the madrasa in their topi defend hindu home bbc verify have show that some of these attack have be on people associate with the previous regime sometimes these thing be bit amplify by people with agenda but my hon friend make great point commend the hon lady for secure this debate she be absolutely right to highlight the issue do she not agree that democracy mean the protection of human right and religious freedom declare an interest as the chair of the all party parliamentary group for international freedom of religion or belief we stand up for those with christian faith those with other faith and those with no faith the right to religious freedom and the right to practise faith or to have no faith there can never be true democracy in bangladesh until government and system be in place that do not penalise people base on how they worship or where they worship but that offer protection for people difference that be what society should be like totally agree with the hon member the uk have unique historical role in the colonial history and as head of the commonwealth he do great work on the appg we should be vigilant on all these thing congratulate the hon member on secure this important debate on the uk role be she aware that in may the previous uk government sign deal with the now depose bangladeshi government about fast track the deportation of bangladeshi asylum seeker presumably include those seek political asylum bangladesh be deem supposedly safe country do she agree that something have clearly be reveal to be wrong here both with the deportation policy itself and with the uk foreign policy objective have check and apparently some of those memorandum of understanding be be look at by the new government one by one to see if they be carry over the hon member make an excellent point let we have reset we have fresh government in this country and fresh one in bangladesh so it be time to look at these thing through new eye back in the summer in fact it be at the same time as we see race riot in this country there be footage of jubilant bangladeshis marching through the street of tower hamlets the hon member borough that confuse many people but it be in happiness they be not angry ethnic mob there be big global diaspora with in this country include the diaspora can be see across europe in some of the middle eastern emirate state the diaspora have supply cheap labour to build such thing as world cup stadium in qatar bangladesh be place that export people my hon friend be make an excellent speech about an important issue commend the work of the bangladeshi community in reading who work incredibly hard in our town they be visible in whole series of profession and business activity thank and commend my hon friend for secure this debate and for raise these important matter about the future of bangladesh across the house we all share concern about this wonderful country and we wish it the good with its new leadership my hon friend be so right do not see any demo in reading but do know that in all sort of european capital include paris and rome as well as in manchester and trafalgar square there be solidarity protest when these thing go on the diaspora have be active be london bear bangladeshi kind of know about the country from my parent tell that it be this paradise of coconut tree and those kind of thing only go as teenager more recently as an adult and as an mp have notice the slightly more sinister side with thing like enforce disappearance and extrajudicial killing every human right organisation amnesty international and so on have condemn those try to keep out of this subject do not have very bangladeshi electorate but be jolt when in hear from the family of shahidul alam photographer who be take picture of an early student protest that he have be bang up and torture then have to get involve be there as recently as may with the excellent all party parliamentary group on global sexual and reproductive health right it have be reconstitute just today for united nations development programme conference again realise that be in one party police state it be not quite right as one of the diaspora these human right crackdown come into my inbox and they reach fever pitch in july when hundred of brave student give their life in struggle before we break for recess have panel discussion with the panellist include toby cadman barrister who have defend people from the jamaat party that be ban by the previous regime it have just be unbanne and the head of amnesty international uk the discussion which we have in the grand committee room of westminster hall be so oversubscribed that people have to be turn away such be the thirst for information see the hon member for leicester south shockat adam in his place he be there and think that his defeat of jonathan ashworth may have have something to do with some comment about this subject but let we not speculate do the hon member agree about the positive contribution that the bangladeshi community have make to our country which have make it as it be today would like to take this opportunity to pay homage to the bangladeshi community of leicester south who be hard work entrepreneurial and philanthropic their commitment to use the political system to improve their community have make my city as great as it be today do the hon member also agree that the riot we see recently in southport after the devastating attack and killing of three innocent people emphasise how important it be that we do not single out community because that can have devastating effect do she agree that both side of the house should be much more responsible in the language they use to ensure that community cohesion ensue completely endorse what the hon member be say we do need to temper our language and be careful every member in this house have curry house in their constituency and that will not be an indian restaurant it will be bangladeshis who run it an enormous contribution have be make to our society with the thing we see this summer we should stamp on the misinformation that refer to in response to my hon friend the member for slough mr dhesi again those bangladeshi university student show courage and they be not just the elitist one from the capital city it happen all over the country at public and private university with boy and girl their demand be initially against corruption but they grow to wide pro democracy concern and the overthrow of the prime minister so far so predictable but then in the big plot twist since bobby ewing in the shower when all those tension be come to head we hear that the previous prime minister have suddenly scarper she helicoptere out regime so entrenched that it look like it would last forever suddenly collapse like pack of card in january there be an election in bangladesh we hear that of the globe be go to the poll this year although there be not any other real candidate in it so that be declare null and void we now have this caretaker government who be there to oversee fresh election we do not know exactly when those will be thank the hon member for secure this important debate she know that in the city of birmingham we have an extremely sizeable community that have bangladeshi heritage like the constituency of the hon member for leicester south shockat adam and the bangladeshi community in the curry house contribute some billion per annum to the to the taxman do the hon member agree that the recent disorder and killing of student in bangladesh have impact the bangladeshi heritage community here in the uk especially when we have lockdown of all telecom do she agree that the next step must be democratically elect government and that that must be expedite potentially with international observer to ensure that it be free and fair so that the loss of those hundred of student life be not in vain agree our loved one be worried and we do not know that be go on we be talk about country that can at will shut off the internet so that people can
