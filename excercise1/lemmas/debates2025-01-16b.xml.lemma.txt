that it be important that the church be hold to account the bishop of stepney the lead bishop for safeguarding and the director for safeguard both welcome the makin review when it be first publish

service team hope that will be okay the hyde park estate be an oasis of peace and tranquillity in the middle of the concrete and building and use daily by many what step will the church take to ensure that there be sufficient waste disposal and recycle bin across the hyde park estate for those with two leg and indeed for those with four leg be sure that those manage and maintain the estate be look at all those issue but would be happy to write to the hon gentleman with further information electoral commission committee the right hon and learn member for kenilworth and southam represent the speaker committee on the electoral commission be ask foreign donations to uk political parties if the commission will make an assessment of the potential merit of ban foreign donation to uk political party what recent assessment the commission have make of the adequacy of the rule on donation by non uk citizen to political party when establish the political finance regime parliament explicit intention be to ban foreign donation however limitation of the current law mean that it be possible for money from foreign source to enter the uk electoral system through donation from uk company for that reason the electoral commission have call for the law around company donation to be strengthen to ensure that party can not accept money from company that have not make enough in the uk to fund their donation or loan to impose duty to carry out enhance know your donor check and to improve transparency over donation make through unincorporated association in recent week we have see the unedifye spectacle of opposition party try to curry favour with one particular foreign billionaire however this issue be much big than elon musk transparency international uk estimate that in every in our million since come from questionable or unknown source when will these proposal come forward so that we can debate they in the house and tackle this threat to our democracy as the hon member will understand proposal to change the law must come from the government with whom gently suggest he have more influence that do but he be right that transparency be crucial it be important that we understand the source of the donation so that the political party that accept they can be properly hold to account surely even in these febrile time it should not be difficult to build consensus around the proposition that foreign money should not be in british politic can we not get the party together now to make the strong possible package of reform rather than react when it be too late as mention there be consensus in this house that foreign donation should not play part in british politic but there be gap in the law as mention the electoral commission believe that those gap can be properly close through further legislation it be speak to the government about that and know that it would be happy discuss the matter far with the right hon gentleman if he so wish church commissioners the hon member for battersea represent the church commissioners be ask church of england racial injustice what step the church be take to tackle racial injustice in the house of bishops create the archbishop anti racism taskforce follow by the archbishop commission for racial justice to continue the work of tackle racial injustice in the church and society last february the general synod vote unanimously to continue effort to address racial injustice across the church the church work to recognise the importance of diversity and on proactive anti racism be very welcome but what step be it take to address its historical link to the slave trade the church role in slavery be truly shameful it be only right that it take action to recognise its link to the transatlantic enslavement of africans no amount of money would ever be enough to repair the horror of the slave trade but the church commissioners project will set aside million over nine year for programme of impact investment research and engagement it be hop that this fund will continue to grow over time and will reinvest return investment in grant funding will be direct towards community that have be impact by the enslavement of africans business of the house will the leader of the house give we the forthcoming business the business for the week commence january include monday january general debate on the impact of food and diet on obesity follow by general debate on financial education the subject for these debate be determine by the backbench business committee tuesday january remain stage of the armed forces commissioner bill follow by motion to approve the draft deposit scheme for drinks containers england and northern ireland regulations wednesday january motion to agree money resolution relate to the terminally ill adult end of life bill follow by second reading of the bank resolution recapitalisation bill lords thursday january general debate on holocaust memorial day friday january private member bills the provisional business for the week commence january will include monday january general debate on the creative industry tuesday january remain stage of the water special measures bill lords wednesday january second reading of the arbitration bill thursday january business to be determine by the backbench business committee friday january the house will not be sit for the convenience of the house and in view of the three important statement that be take place today the motion on the draft deposit scheme for drinks containers england and northern ireland regulations will not be move today be sure that the leader of the house and every member will join in welcome the news overnight of ceasefire in gaza let we hope and pray that it be as effective comprehensive and long last as possible back at home all one can say be that it have be another extraordinary week for the government though possibly not in the way that they would have want we have have the government anti corruption minister herself be name for corruption by another country in the face of an international investigation into embezzlement of development and other fund we have have the unusually unlovely sight of the chancellor of the exchequer in desperate search for growth that have take she to beijing and back though with precious little result it seem the institute of chartered accountants in england and wales say this week that stagflation that toxic combination of recession and inflation be now live risk even the very very modest gdp growth report for november be below expectation at some point the government current spending splurge will doubtless start to nudge growth upwards over the come year but in the meantime we will have to look forward to the grim prospect of the national insurance change in april and the horror of the employment rights bill which even by the government own estimate will cost employer an extra billion year so dire have the chancellor position become that she have be force to ask cabinet colleague for idea of growth give the galaxy of business talent around the cabinet table how can that possibly go wrong meanwhile the prime minister have be force not only to express full confidence in the chancellor always death knell but to insist that she will remain in post for the full period of this government let we see how that work out it have be extraordinary in particular to see she attack by her own colleague who have say we go back to austerity in all but name luckily the government be able to announce some good news in the form of the late result of the national wealth fund which have apparently generate more than job and billion in private investment over the last six month except that the announcement be be afraid entirely disingenuous as lord livermore say in debate in the other house in october the national wealth fund be in fact the uk infrastructure bank with new name and bit more capital know something about the uk infrastructure bank because set it up in when be financial secretary to the treasury it have an absolutely world class leadership team and be not remotely surprised to see it do so well but the idea that its recent success be attributable to labour government who have do little more than rebrand it be an embarrassing joke its success have be power by good institutional design top team tonne of talented employee and more than four year of hard work one recall the government attempt to claim credit for billion of international cash in the october investment summit know the leader of the house be strong believer in transparency and accountability so will she have the treasury update the house on what form that investment have take how much of it have be receive and where it be be spend frankly it be more than doubtful that three month of post election chaos in the government have any such effect in boost investment but we will see when the government publish the number as be sure they will if it turn out like the so call national wealth fund we will know that the labour government be more than happy to take credit for at least some of the work of the previous government provide that they can put their own name on it too be sure that the whole house will welcome the development between israel and gaza over the past hour and day with long overdue ceasefire and the release of hostage now look like real possibility although that be still to be confirm this will hopefully now lead to much need aid get in usb the end of the killing the hostage be release and hope what will be the beginning of long term political solution for the region we will hear shortly from the foreign secretary with further detail on that first will explain one of the piece of business have just announce and set out why the government will table money resolution relate to the terminally ill adult end of life bill next week in order for bill committee to consider any clause that could have spending implication the government must first table money resolution that be not the government agree to fund the measure in bill it be purely to enable the bill to be debate in committee in the case of this bill this relate to one small component that be yet to be debate and agree without the motion be agree to that debate could not happen and that component could not remain in the bill the government have take the view that that would act against our commitment to remain neutral on the bill the house should debate and decide on these matter for itself hope that as with second reading colleague will focus on the substance and not the process of this sensitive private member bill it really have be quite incredible to watch the collective display of amnesia on the conservative benches over recent week it be like the past year do not happen see that the leader of the opposition be out today in what have be brief as she finally tell the truth about the conservatives record they do not have plan for growth they be not honest with the british people and they negotiate bad brexit deal however it sound like the right hon member for hereford and south herefordshire jesse norman do not quite get that memo it sound like the right hon gentleman do not get the memo about the conservative need to be honest about their record on standard either if he want to compare the previous government record on lose ministers be quite happy to do so boris johnson have of his own ministers resign in hour the high number on modern record even the very nice right hon member for richmond and northallerton rishi sunak lose four of his senior ministers in his first few month include his party chairman and deputy prime minister for break the ministerial code even when there be investigation on ministers they be often ignore this government have strengthen the ministerial code and now have an adviser who be able to initiate investigation we have bring in new rule for member of parliament on outside interest and we will go far the right hon gentleman obviously do not get the memo on the conservatives record on the economy and be instead try to attack our plan the leader of the opposition his party leader be now tell the country that they do not have plan for growth that be the truth of the situation be it the conservatives have year to do something about the fundamental weakness in our economy and they do nothing in fact they make those weakness even bad stagnant growth low productivity low wage low skill high mortgage high debt poor health poor housing woeful transport deep seat inequality and no ambition under the previous government to gain the job of the future we be begin to tackle those deep root weakness and that be the truth that he and his party leader should be tell the country community organisation be the backbone of many event in town and village across north west leicestershire for the past year the rotary club of ashby de la zouch castle have organise our annual charity santa fun run in ashby which have have the pleasure of take part in alongside hundred of local people last week the club present cheque to loros hospice rainbow hospice for child and young people and staunton harold sailability trust it be great to hear that the fun run have now raise over for local charity that support resident in need will the leader of the house join in thank the volunteer for their commitment to support our community and could the house be grant an opportunity to discuss what further support could be provide to volunteer to ensure that they continue to thrive will certainly join my hon friend in thank the volunteer in her constituency for what sound like fantastic local fundraising activity think she be go to ask to go on fun run to which the answer be go to be no but otherwise welcome her question call the liberal democrat spokesperson on the liberal democrat benches we have be delight by the recent groundswell of support from across the house for liberal democrat policy in particular cite the support for our youth mobility scheme eu countries bill the warm response for the sunshine bill the new homes solar generation bill from my hon friend the member for cheltenham max wilkinson which be come tomorrow and the house endorse fairer voting system will the government answer this clear yearning by member across the house for liberal democrat policy and provide parliamentary time to ensure those bill become law notice that this week there be further public support for the liberal democrats understand that of respondent to review of their general election campaign think their party leader eye catch campaign style be very effective concur so here to even more bungee jumping and paddle boarding but perhaps less of the tight wetsuit not sure really want to see those be pleased that we be able to support number of the measure come forward from the hon lady colleague look forward to continue to work constructively across the house with liberal democrats as the junction parliamentary champion report that resident across bolsover be really frustrate by congestion can we have government statement on what we be do to tackle congestion across bolsover my hon friend be absolutely right to raise the issue of congestion in bolsover and congratulate she on do so today she will know that this be one of number of issue the government be seek to tackle through their transport and road strategy will the leader of the house please ask the secretary of state for transport to come urgently to the house and give statement on the destruction of tree and vegetation along the liberty line which run from romford to emerson park in my constituency there have be an extreme lack of accountability and communication from network rail it have not consult local resident or elect representative despite promise to do so in when similar incident occur this be devastating for the local environment and wildlife cut down healthy tree be wrong and network rail need to be hold to account for its action be sure that many colleague across the house recognise that the felling of healthy tree cause great deal of local interest from constituent wherever it occur so the hon gentleman be absolutely right to raise it be not aware of the particular case he raise but will ensure he get ministerial response gary constituent of mine who live in thrapston have his drive licence suspend for six month due to medical condition during that time his employer support he get to and from work but shortly before his licence be due to be renew it be once again due to his medical condition suspend for further six month in the light of that and in order to continue to work gary apply for support from the access to work grant scheme follow his application gary be advise that there be week wait before his application would be deal with do the minister agree that the government have prioritise support people who wish to continue to work whenever they can and that delay in grant application like this be totally unacceptable and could lead to people lose their job can we get gary case look into as soon as possible it be completely unacceptable for people to have to wait as long as that this government be commit to significantly reduce the waiting time for access to work and other programme and will ensure that minister look into gary case and it be resolve as soon as possible call the chair of the backbench business committee thank the leader of the house for allow protect time for this afternoon backbench business debate and also for allow time next week for the annual holocaust memorial day debate in addition to the business that she announce

of the march must not go near any synagogue however the campaigner have say that they will defy the police and form up outside the synagogue again may we have statement from the home secretary reinforce the view that if that happen those individual should face the full force of the law and the cost of police the demonstration to ensure that public order be protect let first thank the hon gentleman for list number of future debate be pleased that after he have raise the matter with in during business question last week be able to protect time for this afternoon debate and that we be

other issue the hon gentleman will know that decision about the policing of protest and demonstration be matter for the police they be operational matter but he be right to say that public safety should be at the fore along with ensure that no one be subject to antisemitism or any other kind of hate as result of any demonstration may pick up some comment that be make little early many of my constituent have write to express their concern about campaign finance law follow medium report that certain foreign billionaire will be provide very large donation will the government introduce legislation to cap individual donation close exist loophole and enhance the power of the electoral commission my hon friend be right foreign money and foreign donation have no place in uk politic and be prohibit under current law but the exist legislation may need to be tighten as he will know we have manifesto commitment to look at donation to political party and we will be introduce bill on election probably in the next session yesterday along with many other member attend an oversubscribed debate in westminster hall lead by the right hon member for south holland and the deepings sir john hayes on compensation for waspi woman it be clear there be no consensus on the government side in relation to the outcome of the government decision give that the parliamentary and health service ombudsman send the report to parliament for parliament to decide when will the government provide time for debate and vote thank the hon member for that question as she say debate do take place yesterday and there be many mechanism for debate to be bring forward in the chamber or westminster hall know it be of great disappointment to people that the government have take this decision which be quite specific one about that report many woman be communicate with over that time and an apology be issue but we do not feel that the compensation be propose be proportionate or would be fair use of public fund at this time we have housing crisis across the uk and be pleased that the government have announce plan to build million more home do the leader of the house agree that council have an important part to play in fix this crisis by update their local plan and deliver the home that be so desperately need include social housing and affordable home without these plan our green belt space be at risk such as whyburn farm in my constituency which ashfield independents on the district council be fail to protect by have no plan do she agree that it be vital that council use their local plan to meet the need of community while also protect our green belt space my hon friend be absolutely right this country face housing crisis that be why this government have an incredibly ambitious target to build million home over the course of this parliament and we be change the national planning policy framework to ensure that local council have ambitious target for their own local area in order to meet that target in the new year honours list stuart hogg be award an mbe since then he have be charge convict and sentence for domestic abuse do the leader of the house and lord president of the council agree that he should be strip of that state honour thank the hon member for raise this important matter which know be of great concern to he and to many other member across the house let we be clear that domestic abuse be abhorrent we condemn it and it should not be or be see to be reward by any of we it be completely understandable and appropriate that he and other raise question about whether this honour should continue he will know that can not comment on individual honour however recommendation to remove honour be consider by the forfeiture committee which he might want to raise this with be deeply concerned about local decision by our hospital trust to cut the bus route between burnley general teaching hospital urgent care centre and royal blackburn teaching hospital which be huge loss to staff and patient will the leader of the house join in call on transport operator the county council east lancashire hospital nhs trust blackburn with darwen borough council and other to get round the table and find solution to save our shuttle bus and keep this vital service run shuttle bus such as the one my hon friend describe in his constituency especially those that go to hospital and other local service be vital for too long local area and community have not have say in the bus route they need in their area that be why we have bring forward the bus services bill which be make its way through the other house and will ensure that his constituent have more of say over the bus route in their area as be sure you know mr speaker my constituency be the source of number of globally significant chalk stream not least and most famously the river test number of members be press the previous government to bring forward chalk stream recovery pack to help get those river back to their good state of health so you can imagine our disappointment when we learn in the medium before christmas that this pack be be abandon as be subsequently confirm in ministerial statement could we have statement urgently from the secretary of state about what he will do to replace that pack and bring these river back to the state of health they should be in we have to help sir charles walker fishing come on leader of the house pride myself on know lot of thing about what the government be do but have to admit that this be not something be aware of or can offer the right hon gentleman any particular advice on right now however assure he that will raise it today with the minister and ensure that he get full response if that be not sufficient will ensure that the minister come to the house back in september hand deliver letter to the home office regard critical concern about our asylum hotel and about so many vulnerable family be put in such deprived area have hold response in october as do my council but can the leader of the house secure meeting with home office official to discuss this vital issue my hon friend consistently raise the issue of asylum hotel in his constituency and be really sorry to hear that he have not yet have response from the relevant minister will ensure that he get response and the meeting he have ask for my question be about rather disturbing matter and it regard the late issue of the house magazine on page there be an article entitle state of the union there be depiction of the united kingdom and each country have its flag the flag over northern ireland contrary to what the rest of the world know it to be be the flag of the republic of ireland as oppose to the union flag or the ulster banner this be absolutely outrageous and must be correct in suitably clear manner the flag of our nation my nation be precious when look at the red of the st patrick cross in the background of that flag think of the blood of those whose life be give in the defence of northern ireland and this great nation when see the publication mistake it grieve to see how we be regard by so many wish to make it clear that we do not live under the flag of the republic of ireland despite the view of those who do not take their seat here however it seem that their influence be great than that of those in this chamber the flag of northern ireland be the ulster banner or the union flag and it mean something to many people we can not allow this disgraceful incident to pass ask the leader of the house and you mr speaker to ensure that there be correction perhaps the staff at the house also need to be educate about the basic of the state of the union include its geography they need to understand the wee simple thing give that it purport to be political magazine that be focus on the business of this house will the leader of the house show her displeasure with the erroneous depiction may ask she to ensure that correction be make immediately and that geographic training for staff at the house magazine will take place absolutely share the hon gentleman displeasure and thank he for raise this matter today it be very disturbing mistake for the house to have make he will be aware that be not responsible for the magazine but hope that the editor and the editorial board be watch this exchange and can offer the hon gentleman full explanation and full apology they need to put this situation right with immediate effect give that have be bring into this matter reassure the hon gentleman that the house be not publication of the house but it do trade on the house name and use the house coat of arm there be question to be ask and the hon gentleman have raise very important question the leader of the house and will look at what we can do and what should happen next right across my constituency there be plenty of support for this government ambition to do far well when it come to transition to clean green renewable energy however there be also lot of frustration when my constituent see new house go up because we be not make use of rooftop and make sure that home have the high energy efficiency standard can we have statement from the housing minister about how we can make sure that we be far more ambitious than the last government in the requirement on developer my hon friend raise really important point solar panel on new home will be vital component in meet our clean energy superpower ambition he will be aware that the previous government actually pull back from include solar panel in the new building regulation have they do so we would already have much high level of solar energy come into the grid we be already put that right post office provide vital service in our rural community such as banking in my thornbury and yate constituency however there be concern about the future of the post office in tytherington community shop follow the announcement that its partner post office in cromhall will close at the end of february will the leader of the house agree to give we debate in government time on how we can support community post office in the future the issue of community post office regularly come up in these session and know it be matter of considerable importance to the house it would make for good backbench business debate and see that the chair of the backbench business committee be still in his place the hon member for thornbury and yate claire young be right to raise these issue know that colleague be concern about plan to close all the current crown post office too she should know that no decision have be make on that and would encourage colleague to raise the matter very strongly in the house with ministers and indeed with the post office itself sadly many place across england have be impact by flood in recent day the ground floor of meadow mill in my constituency be flood on new year eve which mean that resident in apartment be not only strand but leave without water electricity or heating thank all the emergency service worker and stockport council staff for support the resident can we have debate in government time on the impact of flooding on insurance premium and service charge cost for apartment block resident as near constituency neighbour of my hon friend be well aware of meadow mill and all the trauma and difficulty suffer by resident during the recent flooding many other colleague constituency be affect too this government inherit really poor flood defence system which be why we have put in place flood resilience taskforce my hon friend be right to highlight insurance cost and other issue and will ensure that the house be keep constantly update on flooding and its impact could the leader of the house use her great influence to improve the tone and quality of ministerial response in this place on monday the secretary of state for science innovation and technology respond to the question ask on behalf of the creative industry which be very worried about the government consultation on artificial intelligence and copyright by tell that do not understand the idea of consultation official report january vol hate to admit it but be long enough in the tooth to say that genuinely do understand what consultation be and how to recognise one that do not appear to be genuine and that have foregone conclusion the point be that we need to be able to articulate question on behalf of our constituent and on behalf of sector that contribute so much to the uk economy and receive response that have dignity and respect at its heart be sure the leader of the house agree that this place should be no place for mansplaining thank the hon lady for all the brilliant work she do on behalf of our creative industry as chair of the culture media and sport committee know that ai and copyright be to the fore among the issue about which the creative industry be concerned be happy to apologise on behalf of any minister who may have inadvertently not use the appropriate tone know that the secretary of state for science innovation and technology respect the hon lady greatly and be sure he do not mean to cause any offence be sure it be mean humorously which be obviously not how it have be take will ensure that the hon lady comment be pass back seemingly unending roadwork in rossendale and darwen be cause massive disruption to resident and business lane rental scheme in which company be charge for the time that their work occupy the road can be game changer yet highway authority such as lancashire seem to be unwilling to use the power available to they will the leader of the house agree to debate in government time on how we can get the action that we need to free up our road think we can all identify with the plight of constituent who be experience unnecessary and badly co ordinate roadwork and all the congestion and disruption they cause the government want to see more local authority introduce lane rental scheme and will ensure that the relevant minister support my hon friend call for such scheme in his constituency last week meet representative of the environment agency at knaresborough lido which be grant bathing water status last year thank to the hard work of local campaigner and the former mp andrew jones the environment agency have say that unlike other river with sewage and pollution issue which be usually due to adverse weather event and heavy rain the issue on the river nidd look to be continuous regardless of the weather it be particularly bad during dry spell which lead the environment agency to believe that it be down to housing development that might be inadvertently or deliberately in some case tap into exist sewerage network will the leader of the house speak with her colleague in the relevant department to ensure that when we look at the issue of water quality we also consider how it be affect by housing development the hon member be right to raise that issue core to the conversation that be happen between the department for environment food and rural affairs and the ministry of housing communities and local government be that nature include the issue of water supply sewage and so on be vital when we consider housing plan none the less will ensure that he get reply on the case that he raise the good news be that apartment

to under investment by the snp government in edinburgh there be concern about the capacity of the road network particularly the through selkirk to deal with the extra visitor and tourist would the leader of the house allow time for debate to consider how rural community can attract great investment when there be concern about the adequacy of the transport system and road network again think be be invite to center parcs be very partial to water slide should colleague ever want to invite to center parcs the hon member raise the serious point that when much need investment and great new facility or service come into constituency we need to ensure that we have the infrastructure and road to support they the snp government in scotland have just get record settlement in the budget so

the leader of the house write to the secretary of state for environment food and rural affairs to ask he to reconsider the formula and to provide for isolated community that be cut off but do not get

which we all hope will usher in sustainable end to the dreadful conflict in gaza it be conflict that we should never forget be trigger by the horrific hamas terror attack of october the bad terror attack in israel history and the most murderous pogrom against the jewish people since the holocaust we have in our thought today the victim of that appalling massacre those who lose their life include the hostage murder in captivity and those whose life have be change forever every single hostage must be return safely home and reunite with family and friend after month of the most unimaginable cruelty at the hand of hamas even in the midst of that unimaginable pain and anxiety the family of those hold hostage have keep the torch burn for their love one with publicity highlight their plight with such resilience and tremendous bravery we be join in the house today by the family of hostage who we know will not be eligible for immediate release recently meet emily damari mother mandy and dani miran whose son omri be also in captivity we all pay tribute to they all for their unceasing campaign to secure the release of their love one and all those in captivity this will of course be time of great emotion for they mixed emotion and in the come week we must continue to wrap our arm around those hostage family like the foreign secretary acknowledge the important role of qatar egypt and the united states in get we to where we be today in these talk we will all follow these development closely in the day ahead and we will expect the uk government to be fully engage and involve in the heavy lifting that be require at this crucial time to make this agreement work and last to that end can the foreign secretary to tell the house specifically what role the uk government have play in these negotiation and about their contribution to reach this agreement can he give assurance that the uk will help israel in any way possible to support the safe return of the hostage which will be so critical in ensure that the agreement endure can he inform the house it may yet be too early whether any of the palestinian prisoner be release be responsible for the death or injury of british national and about the step be put in place to manage the potential risk of dangerous individual be set free on the question of humanitarian aid to gaza what work have he undertake to unpick the awful bottleneck that we have see over month and month while we have see innocent civilian suffer will civilian now receive the vital aid that we have be tell will get through to bring essential relief to community across gaza on the future governance of gaza we have so far hear little about the day after plan but this be extremely important know the foreign secretary will come back to this house in due course but would welcome his thought on the matter be it the foreign secretary position that hamas must have no role in the future of gaza we want to see an end to the brutality with which they have conduct themselves do he agree that if the palestinian authority do indeed assume responsibility in gaza in order to have an endure and last peace they must undertake the most comprehensive reform in their history with serious shift not just in their behaviour but on education and welfare and that they must bring the course of democracy through to the end that we would like to see have he this week deliver that unambiguous message to the palestinian leadership the right people must be involve to ensure that solid foundation be put in place on which gaza can rebuild and to ensure lasting well future so that every generation can live their life in peace with the opportunity that have be deny to they for too long in the day ahead our focus need to be on secure the release of the hostage get the aid into gaza and work for that last peace however there be some related point that the foreign secretary will also need to consider on israel for example that include whether the change to the approach on the international criminal court arrest warrant will happen and what should happen from the government position it also include the arrangement for the future reconstruction of gaza he have just touch on this but what contribution do he think the united kingdom should make his thought would be welcome there be many complexity here will he also commit to insert the uk enthusiastic approach to fresh discussion on the abraham accord and the role that will play in the peace stability and prosperity in the region finally we have see for over year the world only jewish state be ruthlessly attack from all side from the hamas terrorist in gaza to the hezbollah terrorist in lebanon and the houthis in yemen from which iranian link militia in iraq have be direct their course of action while iran and its proxy have use innocent palestinian civilian as human shield without any care for their welfare or wellbee we need to know that this government will step up when it come to address the root cause which rest in tehran the government the international community and all of we will want robust strategy towards iran if we be to build lasting and sustainable peace in the middle east thank the shadow foreign secretary for her remark and for her tone do this role one understand the effort that one predecessor have put in so want to put on the record once again that the right hon member for braintree mr cleverly and for sutton coldfield mr mitchell and lord cameron before make tremendous effort on behalf of the uk government to get we to this point know that they like will sincerely wish that we could have reach this point soon this be indeed day on which we can be grateful for the uk diplomacy in get we to this point the right hon lady ask about the role that the uk have play she will know that it be quite right that qatar and egypt with their proximity to hamas should be central in bring about the ceasefire and that the united states with its particular relationship with israel should also stand alongside they but she will know because of our complex foreign policy relationship with all those party the tremendous effort that uk diplomat have put in to get we to this path indeed be with they in israel and in the occupy territory on monday this week it be very important to be with british hostage family in particular to assure they and counsel they that my judgment be that we would get to this point as fragile as it be want to emphasise the fragility at this time but also to be in the occupy territory the west bank and east jerusalem to spend time with president abbas to discuss with he what now need to happen in gaza in term of its reconstruction and the reform that the right hon lady rightly emphasise be essential for the palestinian authority the right hon lady know that we have sir michael barber work with the palestinian authority to lift up that capacity in the reform that will be necessary to play that role alongside other clearly in gaza when think of other think about the international community as well but alongside they it be important that the uk play its part will come back to the subject of reconstruction in moment the right hon lady rightly talk about the humanitarian situation in gaza we have provide million in this financial year include million specifically for unrwa we want to see the number of truck increase and the figure that have be set in the ceasefire agreement meet will say this though the situation will require proper governance in gaza if we be to achieve that at the moment we have gang there be possibility as the space open up that actually we will get an increase in gang and less aid to the people who need it this be the first phase of the deal there will still be hostage leave after the first phase and into the second phase and potentially into the third phase we know that able man be not part of the first phase they need humanitarian aid at this time and hostage family press to ensure that their loved one be get access to that humanitarian aid so this be fragile moment and the uk be press for political process because only political process will get not just the ceasefire but the long term stability that mean gazan can truly rebuild their life the right hon lady talk about day after plan the uk be ready to play lead role in this process with international and regional partner it should be predicate on tangible progress in our view towards palestinian state with gaza and the west bank unite under one government the palestinian authority role in gaza must therefore be front and centre planning need to advance security both for gazans and for israel and israel security will be fundamental if we be to bring this to an end that will take intense negotiation and discussion there clearly will be an important role for the international community in the come day but in this fragile moment of phase if we be to complete phase then we will need that intensity in term of negotiation my view be very clear there can not be role for hamas the terrorism must come to an end trust have to be rebuild there can not be role for hamas only with that candle that we keep alight for two state solution can we actually reach the normalisation that be at the heart of any building on the abraham accord and the relationship between saudi arabia and israel that can bring lot of prosperity for people in the middle east the right hon lady be right that iran remain malign force this week british diplomat be discuss with iran its nuclear programme and what need to happen if we be not to see the snapback of our sanction as consequence of the joint comprehensive plan of action later this year we will do all that we can diplomatically this be the moment when the iranians need to step up and do the right thing and know that be acutely in the mind of the incoming us administration call the chair of the international development committee thank the foreign secretary for his statement and support every word that he have say no one want ceasefire more than do can not describe the tear that and other in the house have shed for all the innocent civilian who have be murder and maim can not think what the family of the hostage be go through and to be honest do not want to think of what the hostage themselves have endure but the ceasefire be far from certain the peace follow it be far from certain and the two state solution be very far from certain what be certain be that on january the knesset legislation that effectively ban unrwa come into force and be unable to see how the aid the stability the health system and the school can be implement if that happen my committee will publish report on this subject tomorrow but can the foreign secretary speak now about what he be do to urge israel to ensure that that legislation do not come into force and that aid can flood in where it be need be grateful to my hon friend for all her endeavour on these issue on behalf her committee and on behalf of this country she be right that colleague in all part of the house in this parliament and the last have shed tear about this most heartbreaking of conflict in my year in the house have not see such emotion from uk parliamentarian in relation to this central challenge as for the position of the uk government in the midst of this conflict when there be so many child out of school so many child orphan and so many hospital lie in rubble when there be disease and famine we can not see how there can not be role for the central un agency at this time if this peace be to hold on monday make that point to the israeli government again along with my french and german colleague write to the israeli foreign minister make that point and press he on the winterisation plan that we believe must be implement the clock be tick down to that knesset legislation what we do not want be the undermining of the peace that begin on sunday by that legislation just few day into its passing call the liberal democrat spokesperson thank the foreign secretary for advance sight of his statement this ceasefire be welcome by all who have watch with horror as the suffering that begin on october have worsen for so many and add my thank to all those who have work so hard to deliver it be think today of the palestinians and israelis have meet whose life have be tear apart by this conflict and to whom this news bring moment of hope of the british family of israeli hostage who continue to live with uncertainty and fear about the fate of their love one and of the palestinians whose daughter son sister brother mother and father have lose their life and home the priority must now be ensure that humanitarian assistance flood into gaza and that all possible effort be make to secure the release of the remain hostage urge the foreign secretary to do everything in his power as he have just say to persuade israel not to implement the knesset resolution on unrwa which would do so much harm and would undermine the progress that be be make be grateful today for the fact that deal have be reach but be also angry that it have take so long in the month of delay there have be no relief for the hostage family so many more life have be lose and so much more destruction have be visit on people in gaza include further death even since the ceasefire deal be announce the block to progress have be extremist on both side the terrorist in hamas and the supporter of annexation in the israeli cabinet people who do not want peace but want to erase another population from the land so ask the foreign secretary these question will the uk government isolate the extremist and empower the majority of israelis and palestinians who want peace will he commit the uk to work tirelessly for last peace through two state solution with recognise palestinian state base on the border will he redouble effort in diplomacy and through financial measure against the backer and enabler of hamas to cut off their fund will he now proscribe the islamic revolutionary guard corps will he spell out to the government of israel and the united states that settler violence and illegal annexation in the west bank must stop and will the uk government now recognise the palestinian state be grateful to the hon gentleman for his tone and for raise those issue he be right about unrwa as have say this first phase be critical period and believe that withdraw unrwa would destabilise it would ask israel to think very carefully about how we can achieve surge in humanitarian aid if that be the direction of travel there be extremist on both side the hon gentleman be right this deal be substantially on the table last may put down by president biden it have take herculean effort it be important that president elect trump be there to apply pressure to get the deal over the line and think that all of we in the house would applaud the bipartisan spirit of envoy from both the current and future administration of the united states in qatar over the last few day to get it over the line however the hon gentleman know that the israeli security cabinet be meet over the next few hour to decide whether to proceed with this deal he know as politician that there be politician currently in the government of israel who be threaten to resign and bring down that government so he know how fragile this moment be urge our friend in the israeli government to do the right thing and get this deal over the line now and he know too that we applaud the work of egypt and qatar and their mediation with hamas but there have be problem between those outside gaza associate with hamas and those inside gaza associate with hamas and that make this first phase delicate as well of course we want to see two state solution my party be commit to palestinian recognition at the right point the hon gentleman be absolutely right to raise the challenge on the west bank the unravelling of unrwa would make the west bank even more fragile than it currently be be there on monday and security issue expansion and settler violence all get bad in it be the bad year on record for violence and expansion there be much to do thank my right hon friend for his statement and thank everybody who have be involve in get we to where we be now appreciate how fragile it be but it be still fantastic news particularly want to commend the dignity and grace of the palestinian and israeli family who have lose love one or be wait for news about they wonder what lesson we can learn from they in term of their commitment to peace their recognition of our common humanity and their desire to live alongside each other in peace my hon friend have be on this issue day after day can not think of colleague who have press more on it she be right to centre the family on both side and their dignity and grace and these historic people all of whom want home all of whom want security and all of whom have be horribly affect by this most horrendous of war our responsibility to they be to continue to press for the political process that get we to the two state solution that we all know be the only way to achieve last peace call the father of the house think the foreign secretary have speak for the whole house today with his tone be sure he would agree that it be possible to be four square behind the israeli government in their right to defend themselves and defeat hamas and at the same time to care about the suffering of the palestinian people will the foreign secretary use his charm or whatever influence he have on the incoming trump administration to persuade they to use their power to convince the israeli government that these illegal new settlement in the west bank must stop and the pressure on the palestinian people in the west bank must stop because it be fuel sense of despair and future extremism be grateful to the right hon gentleman for bring his tremendous experience in the house to bear he be absolutely right he will be pleased to know that when discuss these issue with president abbas on monday he be complimentary about the conversation he have have with president elect trump on these matter and of course he have an exist relationship with president elect trump that leave very hopeful indeed the right hon gentleman be right the expansion particularly undermine the settlement and it make it very difficult to achieve the two state solution those who try to thwart the possibility of two state solution be say that their belief be either in no state at all which be entirely unacceptable or it be in one state in which case they have well get on and ensure equality for all be sure the whole house will join in pay tribute to the incredible bravery of the hostage family we be join in the house by the family of tal shoham nimrod cohen ohad yahalomi omri miran and shay levinson meet with they this morning their suffering continue the uncertainty the sleepless night while they wait for final deal and to know whether their love one will be come home what reassurance can the foreign secretary give to they and to the house that the uk will do everything in its power to make sure that their love one come home that all uk relate hostage come home as matter of priority and that all hostage come home as soon as possible to end their suffering thank my hon friend for raise the issue of hostage pay tribute to the british national kill since the abhorrent attack on october our hope be that three of the uk and uk link hostage will be release in the first phase as they fall into the criterion for that release which we anticipate will be agree later today of course it be our sincere hope that as we get to the second and third phase all hostage will be release we continue to work with all uk link hostage family be with many on monday and our representative and diplomat have be in touch with they overnight and in the last few day this be the most difficult of time as they wait to see the fate of their love one my hon friend will recognise that there be fight yesterday in which nine israel defence forces soldier lose their life there be fight this morning and it be likely that there will be fight right up to the ceasefire on sunday this be the most challenging of moment as those hostage family wait and in the come day and week pray that their loved one be return would like to put on record my gratitude to the foreign secretary for his kind word about the work that be do prior to his party form government echo the praise that he have give to the us state department and the egyptian and qatari foreign ministers for the work they have do to get this deal over the line but as he say it be not there yet so want to ask two thing to ensure that the hostage be release promptly what can we do to make sure this deal get over the line sadly we have see too much aid divert away from the palestinian people in gaza and use to facilitate attack against israelis so what will the department do to ensure as good it can that the aid get to the people who need it and be not use to murder israelis the right hon gentleman centre the important work of the united kingdom in relation to humanitarian aid in particular at this time he will know that in order for the aid to get in we have to have security he will also know that there be critical role for the united nations which can achieve about truck it be my sincere hope that israel be able to restart the use of commercial organisation to increase that number even far but he will recognise that this present massive challenge as have be set out by the head of unrwa and the office for the co ordination of humanitarian affairs the challenge be that this be take place against backdrop of huge displacement of gazans over this time and of gang roam the street so there be worry that they could get access to the aid as the space open up there be lot to do and how we achieve that security with the israelis withdraw and how gulf state get the confidence to step in and begin reconstruction they do not want to put money in if it will all be tear down few week or month later be critical the uk have say that we be ready to play that role on the day after and in reconstruction we want to work alongside the region and the united states to co ordinate and build that he will also know that while lot of emphasis be place on the ceasefire when it come to what happen next there be much much more to do and negotiate as the foreign secretary say today there be the first ember of hope after what have feel like perpetual agony for the people of israel and palestine he mention that gazans have be trap in hell on earth and it have be living nightmare for the family of the hostage know that the foreign secretary and his team will not rest until we see all the hostage release and ceasefire take full effect he speak of the uncertainty around the path ahead what more can the uk government do to play our role in work towards the share goal of two state solution and when will be the right time for we to recognise sovereign state of palestine we hold out that two state solution must be the way forward we believe that normalising relation between israel and saudi arabia be key and that there must be palestinian component we will press to achieve that and we will work alongside president elect trump and his team in the come day to hopefully bring that about may thank the foreign secretary for his kind remark and applaud his expression of cautious optimism it be cautious because the agony of the hostage continue and the urgent need for quantum increase in humanitarian aid remain unrequited the deal must be implement in good faith and very much welcome his comment that hamas can never again govern that space pay tribute to his diplomat and official for their extraordinary hard work and effectiveness and underline that britain have very important role to play in what come next will he bear in mind that abject devastation can lead to unforeseen breakthrough follow the yom kippur war we see israel make peace with egypt and significant progress be make on the oslo accord follow the intifada the right hon gentleman bring to bear his tremendous experience of these issue which have be build up over many year and many different role in government and beyond he be right to focus on the fact that hamas can not play role but he probably agree with never believe as some in the israeli government do that they could eradiate hamas solely by military force what eradicate extremism be diplomacy political solution and political horizon that pull the rug from under the terrorist that be why it be hugely important that the uk now play its full role in reach political solution and political horizon that bring about peace not another generation of militant young man with terrorism and pain in their heart thank the foreign secretary for his statement have dare to feel some hope that this ceasefire could be the beginning of the end of israel month of pain and suffering since the appalling hamas attack and the end of month in which the entire population of gaza have wonder day in day out whether they will survive another day of bombing the humanitarian situation be dire staff at the al awda hospital the only partially function hospital in the north of gaza report that they have be entirely cut off from aid supply the long await and so far fail flood of aid be absolutely necessary but the success of aid effort must be measure not just by how many truck get in essential as that is but by how many life be ultimately protect and save what urgent measure be the foreign secretary take to ensure that that be the case half million people in gaza have receive essential healthcare as result of uk funding and it be very important to support uk med when we come into office over young people in gaza have receive food as result of our effort but there be tremendous amount to do as my hon friend know the threat to unrwa could thwart these effort in the come day it be about how we get the number of truckload up how we deliver security for the gazan people and how people can return to their home which be now the hope but she will understand that many of they be return to rubble actually they be return to camp in the surround of their home and they will need aid and support for many many year and probably for decade to come as we hope for this ceasefire deal and for the release of the hostage we continue to mourn all of those who have be kill since the vicious terrorist attack by hamas on october in that respect my mind be very much with the six little baby who do not see this proposal because they freeze to death in gaza just few short week ago the collective punishment of the palestinian people will not be forget by history just as all of those who sit silent and who encourage and armed extremist in the israeli government will be judge by history the ceasefire deal be not yet certain it have be widely report this morning that the israeli cabinet have not yet sign it off can the secretary of state please elaborate on what the consequence would be if either hamas or indeed the israeli government renege on this deal say to the right hon gentleman that the labour party have always stress the seriousness of israel security in the tough of neighbourhood because iran and its proxy have so much malign intent but we have always insist that what it do must be within international humanitarian law and we have raise our concern at every turn when we have feel that it be be breach as the israeli cabinet meet to approve the deal at this most serious of moment it be my sincere hope that they hear what president elect trump have say about his expectation of this deal that they hear the expectation of this united house of commons and that they do the right thing the foreign secretary rightly say that we must use this agreement to establish pathway to two state solution step along that pathway be set out in the advisory opinion of the international court of justice that be hand down last july and they would provide the reassurance and security to allow for reconstruction in gaza when will the government publish their response to that opinion be grateful to my hon friend for all his work over the last few month to focus on the plight of people in gaza know that he have tremendous legal expertise in these matter and assure he that this issue be be study in depth by the appropriate legal mind in government we hope to be able to say more when that process be complete every friday since october many people have gather in borehamwood in the heart of my constituency with simple message bring they home may urge the foreign secretary to use all the diplomatic effort of his majesty government to bring that vision to bear the first thing to do be to secure agreement from the israeli cabinet as he say the deal could go wrong at each stage of the process can we keep focus on bring the hostage home if we have an endure ceasefire as we all hope and pray will he update the house on the role that our friend and ally in the gulf state can play in rebuild gaza that will be crucial in ensure that peace endure be grateful to the right hon gentleman for bring the experience of his constituency to bear we have family of constituency in north london where candle have be light for the hostage every single friday include in the stamford hill area of my constituency which he know be one of the historical home of the jewish community many have migrate to borehamwood and hertfordshire over the year the right hon gentleman be also right to mention the importance of the gulf state they can do so much for the reconstruction and rebuilding of gaza they can do so much to support rehabilitated and reform palestinian authority they can do so much to support the monitoring and security arrangement that will need to be put in place if israel be to be assure that it can withdraw and that hamas will not attack again we should remember the rocket fire that israel have experience over many many year include of course the attack on october there be key role for the gulf state but they will not take up that role unless there be renew and continue negotiation beyond phase which begin in day time they will need political horizon too welcome the ceasefire after month of relentless bombing of hospital school refugee camp and woman and child for the ceasefire to last it be important that israel be compel to recognise that palestinians have right to freedom justice and self determination what step be be take to thicken the thin layer of ice on which this ceasefire agreement be skate will the foreign secretary tell we what step be be take to negotiate two state solution which go to the heart and root cause of this problem and to ensure that east jerusalem be the capital of palestine rise be conscious of how many member be on their foot will attempt to go little quick the palestinian cause be just cause two state solution be where we have to be political process be necessary will play my full part and reassure president abbas that we will do that over the come day and week we live in hope of ceasefire and the release of the hostage however we can not forget everything that have come before the mass atrocity on october be follow by month of destruction wag against gaza civilian by the israeli government the foreign secretary mention how we eradicate extremism extremism be also eradicate by justice only justice can redress crime what step be he take to support the international court of justice and the icc to hold all perpetrator of war crime to account will he publish the full record of the uk political and military involvement in the conflict so far we have always be clear about the importance of international humanitarian law and we have always be clear about the importance of its being determine by international court let be crystal clear many man and woman from this country die in the second world war to achieve the settlement that give we international humanitarian law and the architecture on which we all rely it be for that reason that the labour party will never renege on our responsibility in relation to international humanitarian law the foreign secretary rightly mention the houthis and their attack we must not forget that peace in the region will come about only if the yemenis receive the same privilege as the palestinians there have to be peace solution for the yemenis two state solution have also be mention my constituent and believe that these be only warm word do not believe that this government will recognise palestine as state in this parliament can the foreign secretary prove wrong the minister for the middle east my hon friend the member for lincoln mr falconer be currently travel to new york to meet the yemeni foreign minister to discuss these issue my hon friend the member for birmingham hall green and moseley tahir ali be absolutely right about the houthis their horrendous behaviour sabotage international trade and kill people in the red sea be entirely unacceptable this will be very interesting now that we have this ceasefire will the houthis hold to it in the red sea we will act where we need to to deal with the problem we be see in the red sea this be moment to have hope for those two state and to keep that alive with the incoming trump administration previous commitment to the abraham accord ask my hon friend to be hopeful about achieve that full recognition and those two state welcome the foreign secretary tone content and above all else caution there be clearly concern that hamas be try to resile from the commitment they have make in this deal in fact overnight their leader praise the event of october vow to keep repeat they until israel be eliminate and call upon all his follower to continue the fight equally the foreign secretary have not mention that part of this deal as understand it will see the release of palestinian prisoner who have be convict of terrorist offence the risk be that they will return and cause more problem what can he do to ensure that hamas be eliminate from government in gaza so that the palestinian authority can take control and ensure that peace be restore to the region we look forward to the release of the hostage and indeed the cessation of hostility the hon gentleman be right that over this period we could see up to prisoner release it will be weigh very heavily on the heart of many israelis that among those prisoner will be people who have commit murder and it will weigh heavily on their heart that those people be return to gaza our view be that we need political process if we be to undermine seasoned terrorist who by necessity be swap to get these hostage out this be delicate process there be process within israel in which some of the affected family can object but the hon gentleman be right to recognise the balance that have be strike to achieve the hostage deal and the necessary ceasefire over the come day as former aid worker be in gaza last april and witness the enormity of the horror and destruction for palestinians there the scale of the human trauma of the last month be gap wound on the conscience of the world israeli baby hold hostage some palestinian child kill the foreign secretary have make it clear that he agree that it be desperately important that this ceasefire agreement hold and go ahead and that the deal be implement in full include the reconstruction of gaza he be absolutely right do he agree that the palestinians of gaza include my friend and former colleague mahmoud mohammed moe fikr wasim and so many other displace within and outside gaza must have free movement to return to their home or what be leave of they and that this must include the reopening of the rafah crossing pay tribute to my hon friend who know have lose friend and colleague over the course of the past month also pay tribute to she for her work before come to this place and for her work now the rafah crossing with egypt must open that be part of this deal and it will allow million displace civilian to return home on foot via coastal road my hon friend know recognise the tremendous medical support that be still necessary across the country there be many many child without parent may say personally that as parent of an adopt child be particularly concerned about the many orphan and about how we provide for they in the come day and month let place on record my appreciation and gratitude to all the nation especially qatar that have participate in secure this deal last year along with member from both houses be in qatar during the doha forum we all know that there have be many deal and ceasefire that israel have withdraw from and that as the minister quite rightly say this be fragile deal other than urge israel what tangible step will the government take to ensure that it stick to the deal instead of go back to the mass killing of innocent palestinians be with the qatari foreign minister on sunday and we be in touch overnight of course thank he for his tremendous work to get this deal over the line think that while work together over the past few month we have become friend there be much that the uk government can and will continue to do as say on the radio last week diplomacy be fail until it achieve success the hon member will know from his experience and wisdom that success have many father and mother welcome the announcement of this long overdue ceasefire today my thought be with all those who have lose love one on and since october the family of hostage anxiously await news and the ten of thousand of family in gaza who have suffer bereavement displacement and destitution my thought be also with all those for whom the announcement be bittersweet think particularly of rachel goldberg the mother of hersh goldberg polin whom meet in east jerusalem in february she have campaign with such dignity for the release of her son who be tragically kill in august think too of the family in gaza who be lose their love one even now as this ceasefire be be announce but while the war have rag in gaza the settler have dramatically increase their activity in the west bank take land that do not belong to they in systematic attempt to undermine the possibility of viable palestinian state as our thought now turn to the peace process ahead and the aim of two state solution what action be the foreign secretary take to address illegal settlement without more robust approach two state solution simply can not be achieve may pay tribute to my hon friend we have work together over many year her constituency in so many way be not dissimilar from mine and know how heart rending this have be for her constituent also know the grace the manner and the fortitude with which she have represent their interest very strongly within the labour movement my hon friend be absolutely right to centre the west bank the expansion and the violence that undermine the two state solution it be very important for to be able to discuss these issue with president abbas one hugely important role that the uk government play be in relation to reform and support the palestinian authority that work must continue we stand by the border that we think can achieve the two state solution that be require we worry about the security situation in the west bank we worry too about the arm and the supply that be come in from malign force particularly from iran and some neighbouring state but we be also in an intense dialogue with the israeli government about what we think be breach of international law in relation to how the area be properly secure and police we certainly do not want to see the language the rhetoric or the behaviour that undermine the possibility of the two state solution the return of hostage and the end of daily massacre of civilian be profoundly to be welcome while the foreign secretary have attribute much of the work to diplomat it be obvious that whatever we think about he the critical intervention by all report have be that of president elect trump although he have issue public threat to hamas he have quite obviously again by all report outline series of consequence and accountability to the israeli government therefore as we look towards the worsen situation in the west bank can we find lesson here for british foreign policy talk as many of we in this house have urge over the past month do not work unless it be follow up with sure and certain consequence and accountability whether that be bilateral or indeed through international institution there will be no movement the right hon gentleman follow these issue very closely and have sometimes be lone voice on his own side he will know that the labour government have have to take very difficult bilateral decision because of our concern about breach of international humanitarian law my own reflection be that in some way this have be the most challenging of political environment for this conflict partly because there be an election campaign in the united states for much of have we be able to achieve more bipartisan approach soon we might have see the pressure that be necessary to bring both party to the deal that we have finally reach none the less be very pleased that the president elect envoy be able to work with joe biden envoy and bring this deal over the line but it be fragile and await the decision that will necessarily come from the israeli security cabinet at this time may thank the foreign secretary the minister for development and the under secretary of state for foreign commonwealth and development affairs my hon friend the member for lincoln mr falconer for all the hard work that they have do both in public and in private to secure today attempt at ceasefire to bring the hostage home and to get as much humanitarian aid in as possible tom fletcher the un under secretary general for humanitarian affair have say today that the deal could have be do year ago and that the ferocity of the killing by israel and hamas have be century atrocity do my right hon friend agree that there will be last peace in the middle east only if the israeli government and the international community treat all life palestinian child life and an israeli child life as equal be very grateful to my hon friend for the work that he have do on these issue both before come to this place and within the context of his new constituency thank he very much for bring to mind the role of my dear colleague the minister for development and the under secretary of state for foreign commonwealth and development affairs my hon friend the member for lincoln mr falconer let thank also previous colleague and shadow colleague with those portfolio many of we have play part to ensure that we get to this end my hon friend be right too that there will be time for lot of reflection on how we get here and why we get here but the critical thing at this moment be that the ceasefire hold that we get beyond the first phase to the second phase and that we get to the third phase the third phase it seem to can hold only if we have political process that be where attention must be pay to bring about last peace echo those who have thank the foreign secretary for the tone that he have take and the way in which he have reflect the relief of the whole house that there be at last some hope for the family of the hostage member of which be here today and for the population of gaza he speak of the need for political process to ensure that the deal succeed and of the hope that need to be part of eradicate extremism in the middle east do he agree that this be perhaps the appropriate time that he have talk about for hold out hope of two state solution and that now might be the perfect time for the government to recognise state of palestine the hon lady be right that two state solution be the only way to stable peace she know too that recognition in itself do not achieve that it have always be my view and that of important international partner such as france that this be an important issue if we be serious and achieve that political process recognition might properly be part of it to cement the two state that be necessary this government and suspect previous government fully understand the importance of the uk role in apply that at the appropriate moment precisely because we have the distinguished responsibility of have seat on the united nations security council know that for the next couple of day everybody in this house will hold in their heart my constituent sharone whose father oded be the old hostage we be await news on we hope to hear some this weekend oded be hold out hope for he because we do not know what have happen to he oded spend his life as peace activist campaign for two state solution and drive gazans to hospital in the spirit of oded and the work that he have do will the foreign secretary work with colleague in the department of health and social care to offer young palestinians who urgently need medical help the support that they need here in the uk be grateful to my hon friend for the work that she do and for our friendship over many year oded be retired israeli journalist who be take from his home his wife yocheved be also take but she be release in october oded daughter sharone be british national who reside in my hon friend constituency and she have tirelessly campaign for his release that be what we want to see over the next period there be role for our own medical service where appropriate and will continue to work with my right hon friend the health secretary on these issue my hon friend should be reassure that he raise the very same issue with this week on how we can do more in relation to that matter the foreign secretary be right that both israel and hamas must ensure that the deal be successful and stick to the term that have be outline but as the foreign secretary come to this house the israeli prime minister say that he want to delay vote in cabinet because there have be last minute change to what hamas be require have the foreign secretary be brief on what those perceive change or accusation be and could he outline some of they to the house bear in mind national security implication can he tell the house how he will make it clear to both side that it be this deal or no deal and that if they do not get the deal through we will enter further period of grave instability in the region and more life will be lose let be crystal clear the uk government position be that the deal be now final and need to be implement urge colleague in the israeli government to do the right thing in the hour available before sunday and get on and sign off the deal israel deny that it be hold dr hussam abu safiya the director of kamal adwan hospital only to confirm that it have in fact detain he there be report that he be currently be torture in prison the foreign secretary mention that the history of this conflict be litter with miss opportunity can he take this opportunity clearly to condemn israel indefinite incommunicado detention of palestinians en masse and without charge or trial what action be the government take in the light of the ceasefire offer on the table regard their close ally pattern of deadly attack on healthcare which be clearly part of an intention to destroy and degrade palestinians as group we have raise those issue with the israeli government and do so through the christmas period we recognise that there be pain and that there be concern about international humanitarian law but all of we in this house have responsibility to do all that we can to bridge the divide if we be to ensure that the deal hold and the people of gaza get the respite for which know the hon lady have be campaign for many month warmly welcome this ceasefire agreement and like colleague across the house fervently hope that the israeli cabinet will approve it but think we all recognise that while the ceasefire may bring an end to the current extreme of violence it will not end the conflict number of condition need to be meet for last peace so will the foreign secretary set out timetable for uk recognition of the state of palestine and the concrete step that he will take to end the occupation and ensure that all those who have commit war crime be hold fully accountable can not set out timetable because the uk government alone can not be responsible for timetable that will necessarily involve the israeli government the palestinian authority our friend in the united states and arab partner particularly it will not be possible for to set out timetable on these issue but ask the hon lady to have faith sit down with president abbas this week to discuss these very issue on the question that she rightly raise of accountability that must be necessary matter for our international court have set out from this dispatch box why we in this party hold dear the importance of international humanitarian law applaud the foreign secretary for today very welcome statement while brick and mortar be crucial to rebuild gaza what more can he say about invest in the democratic judicial and security institution to underpin the movement towards possible two state solution the united kingdom have unique capability and experience in governance issue particularly we have unique partnership with not just israel but the palestinian authority and arab partner and of course the special relationship with the united states so we be uniquely position for the next phase look forward to discuss these issue with the incoming secretary of state senator rubio in the come month to see what more the united kingdom can do may thank the foreign secretary for his statement and express hope that the ceasefire be agree and implement and that the humanitarian aid we want to see follow on from it in that light do he share my concern about the evidence that unrwa have be penetrate by hamas and that the curriculum in school run by unrwa have propagate hate do he agree that the job of reform of unrwa have not yet be finish and need to be look at so that unrwa do not act as place where terrorist can hide and hate can be promote be horrify by the allegation against unrwa and it be entirely proper and appropriate that the united nations get someone of eminence and importance to look at those issue know madame colonna and speak to she follow her review in re establish funding to unrwa we give million to the un to assist the implementation of her plan the hon member be right that the process be not yet complete but we hear again this morning from united nations representative that they be reassure that the process be under way and that unrwa can not and can never be hiding place for those who commit terrorism may bring the foreign secretary back to the issue of the recognition of the state of palestine because agree we have to maintain momentum of hope for all concerned although he can not give we timeline today could he set out the criterion that the government will use to judge that the time be right for the recognition of the state of palestine my right hon friend will know that in some way this be moment of peril for that political process on the one hand we have the potential for saudi normalisation and two state for the palestinian people on the other hand some in israel will never be commit to two state and talk instead of annexation those two be opposite and that be why the next few month be so important it would be folly for to stand at this dispatch box and give timetable obviously we hope that the israeli cabinet make rapid decision to support this ceasefire agreement but that be only ceasefire agreement and one hop it will be rapidly follow by the release of all the hostage and prisoner as agree however there have be some major development over the past two year particularly on the legal front where the international court of justice have recognise that act of genocidal nature have take place and have call for israeli withdrawal from the west bank and an end to the settlement policy will the foreign secretary commit the british government to demand that all the icj recommendation be carry out and that israel have programme of withdrawal from the west bank and an end to the settlement policy there can not be any peace for the palestinian people while they remain under occupation they have suffer so much lose so much and lose so many and the mental scar of the people of gaza will now be intergenerational they will need lot of support to get through this and above all international recognition of the state of palestine let begin by recognise the unique way in which the right hon gentleman have raise these issue in the house over lifetime of work and his commitment to justice and accountability in this era it be right and proper that international humanitarian law be follow and that the international court do their work let also be clear that this government do not believe in illegal occupation and be commit to two state repeat again we can not tolerate the violence we can not tolerate the expansion we recommit ourselves to continue to work with civil society on the ground in the west bank and the occupy territory that be document these thing both this government and the previous government have continue to support such organisation over many year clearly when we get to that settlement it will essentially come down to swap and very serious negotiation over that land on both side we recognise that and that be why expansion be so thoroughly unacceptable the ceasefire be good news it have be welcome around the world and it will be welcome by my constituent it be time of relief but also one of great grief for the many ten of thousand of life that have be lose in november visit the west bank and meet the director of unrwa who say he have no idea how aid would get into gaza if and when the israeli ban on unrwa pass what more can the government do to ensure that the ban be lift and aid get into gaza too meet the director of unrwa in the occupy territory this week he repeat that to and recognise his assessment speak to the israeli government about this issue and they say of course this be prior to the ceasefire be reach they believe that other un agency non governmental organisation on the ground and international party could step into the breach remind they about their legal responsibility as an occupy power about our long stand concern anyway about humanitarian aid and about the prospect of undermine an agreement that have hop would be reach when be with they on monday for all those reason do hope that they will reflect and step back from implement this knesset legislation the celebration in gaza that welcome the ceasefire be match only by the relief of the hostage family that their love one be finally come home in the hour that follow however score of palestinian civilian be kill and the israeli government declare that they will not meet today to ratify this deal in what be an unspeakably cruel blow to those seek peace and the return of the hostage my right hon friend the member for aberdeen south stephen flynn and the hon member for birmingham perry barr ayoub khan have both ask this question but in the absence of reply will ask it again if israel do not agree this deal and continue to prosecute this conflict as it have to date what will the consequence be for prime minister netanyahu and his government this be moment say this have meet those hostage family have pray for the life of emily damari in particular and have meet palestinians with family in gaza where insist from this dispatch box that will hold out for hope and for that deal be implement on sunday have be really clear about the responsibility that believe the israeli government need to meet we be meet here in this house on thursday so there be day before sunday believe settlement will be reach we will continue to work with the current administration in america and indeed the president elect administration he have make his view clear will not give in to the cynicism that we will not get to that deal on sunday and that this process will not begin trust the government will do all they can to ensure that the ceasefire lead to last peace peace base on two state solution that address the root cause of the violence and create future in which the right and security of people in the region be respect will the foreign secretary redouble his effort in urge his counterpart in israel to grant full access to humanitarian organisation such as the un that be urgently seek to deliver aid in gaza as well as to ensure that journalist have unfettere access to report on the situation my hon friend be absolutely right journalist now need to be able to get in and report on what be happen on the ground thank he for give moment to call to mind the many aid worker who have die in this conflict more than in any other conflict in history and to thank they for their humanitarian effort repeat again that part of the settlement that come out of the second world war be that there be deconfliction for aid worker work in the most severe of circumstance that be the expectation of the international community and we deplore the fact that it have not be meet so egregiously in this most horrendous of war be grateful to the foreign secretary for his statement and also pay tribute to all those who have help to bring about this agreement to stop the killing pray that israel accept and honour the agreement and subsequent stage the foreign secretary speak about darkness and october be indeed dark day for innocent israelis and palestinians and for humanity however it would be unjust not to acknowledge that the palestinians have be suffer dark day every day for over year with the uk and the international community turn blind eye and many aid and abet we all welcome the announcement of this ceasefire to suspend hostility in gaza although we hope and pray that the temporary pause will free all hostage on both side save palestinian and israeli life and alleviate some of the unspeakable suffering that the israeli military have inflict on gaza it mark the beginning not the end of effort to restore health dignity justice and freedom to the palestinian people who have suffer beyond word will the foreign secretary confirm that the uk will oppose any attempt by israel to annex or settle part of gaza or further part of the west bank will he confirm the uk commitment to end the long stand root cause of violence and humanitarian need in the occupy palestinian territories include israel illegal occupation blockade and widespread violation of international law suspect that the hon gentleman and might sometimes disagree on matter of politic but have always respect he in the short time that he have be in this house feel again today the humility and faith that he bring to the strength of his question let be absolutely clear we stand oppose to expansion to the violence that we see and to any talk of annexation which would breach international un resolution that successive uk government have support he be right that it be the case for some year particularly in the period after the abraham accord that this house have stop talk about two state solution but think members across the house recognise that that be the only way out of this crisis too thank the foreign secretary for his statement particularly his word about how we break out of the cycle of violence which many of we worry will be replicate in future and move towards peaceful future this be bitter sweet deal in many way because the reality be that overnight we have see hamas put their uniform back on wave their rifle and celebrate they be still there one of their leader say just this morning that they would do october all over again the international community must unite to ensure that they can not and to free the people of gaza from hamas what step can the government take to change the reality for hamas by stop weapon from iran and funding from state such as qatar and to promote genuine soul search and reflection among international agency on the ground to ensure that they be do everything they can not to repeat mistake or turn blind eye to collaboration with hamas it be important to continue to remember the tremendous trauma in israel as result of october the bad atrocity for the jewish people since the holocaust it be important to remember in the wake of this deal which we want to see over the line that yes hamas fighter have be on the street fire their rifle and say that they would do it again and that do not lead to context in which the israeli people feel safe in their own land my hon friend be absolutely right that iran continue to destabilise the region through its political financial and military support for hamas and other partner in the region very sadly if we do not do all we can to come together here in the united kingdom play our role internationally and get to that political process it be my judgment that in year time another generation of politician include some young politician in this house will be here again debate the same issue more violence more pain more loss of life and still no two state thank the foreign secretary for his sombre tone and for his soft but strong word we all appreciate they very much welcome the fact that ceasefire be imminent and that the hostage will soon be return home will the foreign secretary outline what discussion have take place with our american ally to ensure that aid get to where it be need in safe and concerted effort and what do he imagine our role to be in ongoing negotiation to support israel and find peaceful way forward be grateful to the hon gentleman who be always on top of these issue particularly terrorism conflict and peace have work very closely with the us secretary of state antony blinken and pay tribute to he suspect for the last time for all his work send he message last night say what pleasure it be to see he stand behind joe biden more than many know as do my predecessor how much work he put into get this agreement over the line also know how important it be that president elect trump and his team step up in the last few day there be critical role for the uk for the reason that have set out and we will play that role it have be long and painful road to get to this point but today welcome news of ceasefire deal be finally sliver of hope it have always be clear that the release of hostage and ceasefire be necessary step to pull the middle east from this abyss which have cruelly take so many life will touch on the point that the foreign secretary just make about another generation of politician include young politician in this house debate the two state solution in year time have say to he many time that the recognition of palestinian state be not by product but the route to resolution will he be brave will he be bold and will he so that we be not here in year time debate the two state solution recognise the state of palestine much quick than that be grateful to my hon friend for the way she have champion these issue press they again and again on behalf of her constituent there be real dilemma on palestinian recognition there be some who want recognition essentially because they believe that two state be year away and will never be achieve and they want the uk government to say we will do it put marker in the sand despite the fact that it be year away and will never be achieve there be other who recognise the importance of the uk role in relation to our responsibility as permanent member of the un security council and therefore understand that we will do that but we will do it when we know that it will happen and it be in sight this be one of those critical moment and believe will play my part yesterday on the street of gaza mother come out to celebrate the news of the impending peace deal today many of those mother be crouch over love one as news come in of further palestinians have be kill that is add on to the thousand and thousand who have already be kill but when it come to the number of palestinians dead that be all it seem to be number do the foreign secretary agree that no justice and no meaningful peace can be achieve if we continue to allow the cry of the oppress to go unheard ask this not as political rival but as fellow human being the palestinian people and indeed the family of the hostage have no more time for rhetoric platitude and word what be we go to do to ensure that this peace deal go ahead and justice be give beyond word so that no more innocent blood be shed the palestinian cause be just cause which be why we recommit to two state you can hold in your heart the pain of the israeli people and the plight of those hostage and their family and at the same time you can hold in your heart the awful damage pain and suffering that this have work on gaza with well over palestinian people have lose their life you can hold those two thing at the same time which of course be what the uk government attempt to do as they try to bring about conciliation and uphold international humanitarian law ultimately we want to get to process that bring about genuine peace where these two country can live side by side with security and peace thank my right hon friend for his statement the news of possible deal be very welcome indeed and associate myself with the hope of colleague across this house that the hostage will be release and return and that humanitarian aid will flood into gaza as soon as possible we know that the only way to ensure last peace be that two state solution so can my right hon friend outline what step the government will take to support the creation of an international fund for israeli palestinian peace we absolutely support that and we will continue to work towards it join in with the sentiment of relief and hope for peace after horrific month long ordeal however ceasefire can not take away from the fact that israel be on trial for genocide and its leader have arrest warrant in their name for their crime commit against the people of gaza ceasefire do not change that fact justice and accountability must be realise in the face of some of the most horrific war crime of our time will the minister therefore confirm that the government will stand by their commitment to treaty under international law and uphold the requirement of the arrest warrant already issue we be signatory to the treaty of rome and we will comply with our legal obligation not just because we should but because we believe in they will the foreign secretary confirm that the government will not lift the limited ban on arm sale to israel until he or another minister have come back to this house and explain why the danger of those arm be abuse have recede as my hon friend know that be quasi legal process that be go through with all sobriety examine the fact on the ground the ban be in place at this time arm be not currently be send to israel under export licence for reason that have be discuss at the dispatch box for many month suspect that until we get to secure and stable gaza it be unlikely the fighting have get to stop welcome the news of ceasefire deal after month of devastation destruction and loss of life the release of hostage be vital ensure their safety and swift return to their family there have be unimaginable suffering and the ceasefire must be turning point it be imperative that the uk leverage our diplomatic influence to ensure stability while urgently step up humanitarian aid in gaza food medicine and fuel must reach those who desperately need they without delay can the secretary of state tell the house what diplomatic contribution the uk will make to ensure the ceasefire stability when we move towards the latter and more fragile stage of multi stage agreement pray in aid some of my statement early in this session rise order urge member to make their question short or we will simply not get everybody in we all hope that the ceasefire happen and that it hold and we all resolve that if it do never again never again by anyone for the most part that mean accountability which be where the icc and icj come in journalist forensic expert and rescue team must be guarantee unrestricted access to investigate mass graf locate the miss and document the atrocity crime commit by israel so will the foreign secretary commit to support this otherwise impunity not accountability will reign which will prevent we from make sure that what we have see do not happen again we continue to support non governmental organisation and to call for journalist to be allow in of course it be important that the appropriate authority properly document what have happen and that where necessary people can be hold accountable the ceasefire deal give family in israel and palestine as well as their relative in my constituency hope for long last peace and security however there can be no security without accountability and there be no accountability without scrutiny scrutiny for example to ensure that the funding the government have pledge for unrwa reach its intended destination this war have be the deadly on record for journalist so what can the government do to ensure that all journalist in palestine include my former colleague can do their job without fear for their life my hon friend have represent the interest of those journalist very well in her question repeat again that deplore the number of journalist who have lose their life it be important that any democracy engage in conflict of this kind allow journalist to cover what have truly happen as we head now to this ceasefire and the stability that be require the time have come hope for journalist from all corner of the globe to be let in last november the international criminal court issue arrest warrant for israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu and former defence minister yoav gallant for crime against humanity and war crime include target civilian and use starvation as weapon of war the british public deserve clarity so will ask again will the foreign secretary confirm that should benjamin netanyahu step on british soil he would be immediately arrest yes or no say to the hon lady as think have be say before that we have legal process in this country be that to come to pass and that process be important ultimately it will be decision for our court so it be important that from this dispatch box leave that matter for they however have say in term that we be signatory to the statute of rome not just because we be but because we believe in it therefore as the hon lady would expect this government will comply with the law if that be to come to pass know that speak for everyone in my constituency when say that after so much death and unthinkable horror this ceasefire this peace offer hope for long term political solution security for the people of gaza and of israel two state solution and sustainable peace do the foreign secretary agree that what we now need be flood of aid to stop civilian suffer now in gaza also know it be very early day but what hope do he have for new normalisation deal between israel and saudi arabia go forward be grateful for the question have speak to the saudi arabian foreign minister at length on sunday and to the israeli foreign minister at length on sunday as well it be my sincere hope that we do get that normalisation deal there be many step before we get there but think this be critical moment and really hope we can achieve it after such unimaginable suffering welcome the foreign secretary statement however recognise the fragility of this moment not only the fragility of make decision around this deal but the fragility of life in gaza where the suffering continue at this moment will he ensure that we provide the very good medical support give that many specialty no long exist in gaza and that we use the expertise in our country to send team into the region and indeed into gaza to ensure that people with disease and infection and those who need urgent surgery have the very good service my hon friend be absolutely right to focus on medical support we will continue to support uk med and we make decision to give it more fund when we be just few day into office half million people have receive essential healthcare as result of that funding and uk med have support over people across gaza it be hugely important work and suspect we will have more to say in the come day about what more we can do thank my right hon friend for his very measured statement have meet dozen of constituent in rushcliffe who know will wholeheartedly welcome yesterday news however have receive lot of email specifically about the decimation of medical facility in the northern part of gaza can ask the foreign secretary what step be likely to be take to ensure immediate improvement to healthcare access as result of this week announcement be grateful to my hon friend for the reason have set out security will be essential if the aid be to get in and if international partner be to be reassure so that the reconstruction of hospital can properly begin pay tribute to my right hon friend and indeed to the under secretary of state for foreign commonwealth and development affairs my hon friend the member for lincoln mr falconer who have play such an important role in work tirelessly for justice follow on from the question from my hon friend the member for liverpool wavertree paula barker about recognition of the state of palestine what role will the british government play in create the condition that mean two state solution be finally in reach and we could declare that we recognise the state of palestine be very grateful to my hon friend for the question the role that we must play be the critical juncture between phase and then phase we will only really get to phase if there be proper political solution think the united kingdom have particular role to play because of our relationship with all the party and our unique role on the united nations security council alongside france she be absolutely right that there must be process that we must engage in that process and that recognition be key part of the process ultimately however that must lead to two state solution let say finally that in my discussion at the weekend in saudi arabia it be very clear to that we be no long in place where gulf colleague would satisfy themselves with some promise that feel year and year away or generation away we be really talk about the immediate lifetime of many parliamentarian in this house at this time and this be therefore very critical issue now really be the moment when we all do need some hope as the task of help people to rebuild their home and community be truly daunting to allow for reconstruction of hospital school and home to take place the supply of construction material into gaza will need to happen on huge scale can please ask the foreign secretary what discussion be take place right now to help facilitate that access for important material my hon friend ask very good question the world bank have be do lot of thinking about that with rapid need assessment of the material that be now necessary as the foreign secretary have say this be glimmer of light for the hostage their family and civilian in gaza many of they child live in hell and all our thought be with they we have speak lot about the importance of access for humanitarian aid but can ask the foreign secretary about volume can he update we on the funding for the un humanitarian appeal whether we be consider an uplift in our aid and what pressure we be put on other un member state to make sure they play their role in not only provide that aid but push for access my hon friend be absolutely right to put on record the issue of volume at the moment the agreement be for or so truck that be ambitious and the situation on the ground will need to change quite lot if that be to be achieve the need be absolutely there the un must play its part but think some of the decision that may come on unrwa would fundamentally undermine that think commercial truck have to come back in and the security have to be there clearly what we want to see and it be here in the deal be israel be able to draw back which raise further issue about security that be why say that this deal be fragile and that negotiation continue and there be much still to do she be absolutely right that we have to see the volume or think the people of gaza will say that there have be lot of fine word but thing have not actually change very much on the ground now that there be hope of ceasefire will the secretary of state redouble his effort to seek justice for the family of my constituent john chapman whom he mention in his statement who be murder by the idf last april when work for the world central kitchen will he meet to discuss what the uk government can do to hold the israeli government to account for their action be very grateful to my hon friend for ask that question raise this issue with the israeli foreign minister at the weekend we do want to see accountability and we do want to see process from the military advocate general in israel the loss of life break our heart have spend time with the family that have suffer so much as result of the atrocity against world central kitchen when there be tremendous loss of life there must be justice there must be accountability and there must be process it be now for the military advocate general in israel to do that and we will continue to press this issue of course or the minister for the middle east will meet he and his constituent we all welcome the announcement of the possible ceasefire and hope that the israeli cabinet ratify the agreement the toll on civilian have be horrific over palestinian civilian include child have be kill and israelis be kill on october and many hostage family be hop that their family member be return too pay tribute to british citizen john chapman james henderson and james kirby who be kill deliver aid in gaza the eu have announce million in new aid for gaza so will the uk announce further package of aid soon agree with the foreign secretary that palestinians must be able to return home safely what role will the uk play in that thank my hon friend for her question we will be make further assessment of the humanitarian need and what more we can do in the come week give the change circumstance let we get this deal over the line and let we assess where the uk can play particular role alongside other partner it be important that we co ordinate and it be important for to be in saudi arabia with kaja kallas the new high representative of the eu because we be able to travel together and to discuss these very same issue in addition to the appalling suffering of civilian due to this conflict for far too long there have be sense of hopelessness in the region which be mirror by sense of hopelessness here about what we can all do practically to help secure peace and rebuild gaza do my right hon friend agree that british company particularly those in construction and ngos should be at the vanguard of the herculean task of rebuild gaza as we get we hope towards phase on the future do he agree that make more information available about the support we can provide in this area will help the peace process because reconstruction be vital agree wholeheartedly with my hon friend on behalf of so many of my constituent in ealing southall may wholeheartedly welcome this news about potential ceasefire in gaza and the return of the hostage thank the foreign secretary and his ministerial team for all their hard work to get we to this moment of hope but this be only beginning can the foreign secretary tell how he will use our hard won experience of broker last peace in northern ireland through the good friday agreement to help achieve two state solution and long term peace security and prosperity for the people of both palestine and israel be grateful to my hon friend for mention northern ireland and the essential role that be play in particular by the last labour government she will no doubt have notice that the new national security adviser be jonathan powell who play such an important role in that our national security adviser always do lot behind the scene on these issue and look forward to work with he on this issue the foreign secretary be right when he recognise that this ceasefire although fragile offer real glimmer of hope he be also right to emphasise the need to go far to ensure two state solution with safe and secure israel live alongside viable sovereign palestinian state will he set out what he see as the next step in get we to the ultimate goal of last peace in the region as have be say there be two possibility here one be situation in which israel do not withdraw from gaza and there be still lot of fighting displace people would vaguely be able to return to their home but we would not see the reconstruction or the international community able to come back in because there would be no guarantee that the effort they put in will not be destroy in another or year time the other possibility be that we get to phase and we see not just ceasefire but political process that bring about stability and ultimately peace and alongside that we see saudi normalisation with israel and the prospect of two state we all welcome the news of the ceasefire deal after month of devastating conflict and suffering in gaza the foreign secretary know how important the recognition of palestine and the two state solution be to my constituent in luton south and south bedfordshire do he agree that in our government commitment to two state solution gaza must form part of future palestinian state with no reduction in the size of its territory no ongoing occupation of gaza and no forced displacement of palestinians from gaza be grateful for the work that my hon friend have do in her constituency and the manner in which she lobby hard on these issue when be shadow foreign secretary which she continue to do now can confirm that gaza must be part of the two state and home for the palestinian people it be with hope and fear that we await news of this ceasefire deal and that will be feel particularly strongly by the family of the hostage we have hear of the british hostage of emily damari avinatan or oded lifschitz and eli sharabi and the work of their family for they until they be hold their love one this deal will not be real or do can the foreign secretary please assure they that at each and every stage of this deal he will be press for the hostage release so that we can deliver that for their family bring this war to an end and bring the hostage and their family together emily damari be british national she spend her birthday in captivity she be take from her home in the kfar aza kibbutz emily enjoy watch football and be tottenham hotspur fan keep she in my heart every single day have plastic flower from her mother in my office remind of her plight pray and hope that see her emerge in the come day oded lifschitz be retired israeli journalist and we hold out torch for he eli sharabi be family man and his wife lianne british citizen and his daughter noiya and yahel be murder on october yossi sharabi be kill in captivity last year and we pray for his family at this time avinatan or be year old man and therefore will not be in the first phase of this activity but we want to see he free as we get to the second and third phase human right organisation such as gisha the association for civil rights in israel and physicians for human rights israel have be work hard to get more aid into gaza since the beginning of the conflict what step be the foreign commonwealth and development office take to support human right group to help rebuild gaza and the life of the palestinian people my hon friend be right to raise human right and human right defender particularly those on the ground she should be assure that the uk under this government continue to fund those important organisation they be part of the exercise of allow very vulnerable people to have their right advocate for and their dignity uphold in the most horrendous of circumstance those organisation be also part of the accountability mechanism we have sign up to and believe in my right hon friend be right that this be not day for celebration it be day for prayer prayer that this deal be see through and prayer that hostage and ordinary palestinians get chance to rebuild their life after the atrocity and horror of the past month my right hon friend be right to say that this peace deal be fragile but it be also right to say that many in the world include in my community think that the world community grasp on humanitarian value have be fragile these past month we have fail the hostage fail the palestinians and fail in the quest for peace by take so long to do that he will know that this issue be important to the community represent nearly two year ago the foreign secretary have lunch with and some of my constituent and we talk about previous crisis where we have solve the crisis but give up on the peace what reassurance can he give we that this time it will be different and the british government will lead the way once we get this deal in place to ensure that there be two state solution and that dignity and respect be give to israel and palestine eighty year on from the second world war my hon friend be right he be dear friend and know his constituency well have spend seven year of my life live in the great city of peterborough there be no doubting that when we look back on those year there be key moment that shake the foundation of the rule of law that man and woman in this country fight for suspect that people will look back on this war as one of those hugely challenging moment people who believe in democracy recognise that we be here as parliamentarian in one of the great home of democracy to fight to keep hope alive the palestinian cause be just cause the plight of the jewish people be also just cause and homeland for they think be right we have get to achieve that peace just as have for many year campaign for peace in country such as northern ireland and south africa we

inquiry also pay tribute to the family and friend who lose love one during the pandemic some of whom be with we in the gallery early this week visit the national covid memorial wall just across the river from here be grateful to the friend of the wall who have so lovingly care for it and maintain it over the past few year as say in my statement in july the government first responsibility be to keep the public safe that be why since we be elect we have take step to strengthen the uk resilience announce review of national resilience work on that review be proceed and will update the house on its conclusion in the spring the prime minister have establish single cabinet committee for resilience which chair which meet to ensure clear and rigorous ministerial oversight we have adopt the biological security strategy to protect the uk and our interest from significant biological risk in april the new uk resilience academy will be launch it will train over people in resilience and emergency role every year and help they plan for and manage range of crisis include pandemic should also acknowledge as do in my first statement back in july that in some area these improvement build on work carry out by the previous administration the improvement that we have make to our resilience have be put to the test over the last six month those include the prime minister chair number of emergency cobra meeting to address the violent disorder that occur over the summer and work across our four nation to anticipate and contain clade mpox case in the uk since july we have also send two emergency alert to provide advice to the public in life threaten situation during storm darragh because of very rare red danger to life warning an alert be send to over three million people in affected region more recently we issue very localise warning over flood danger the government will carry out full national test of the emergency alert system later this year that will ensure that the system be function correctly should it need to be deploy in an emergency the covid module inquiry find that year of under investment mean that pandemic planning be not sufficient priority that our health service be already suffer and beyond capacity and that there be high level of illness and health inequality all of that mean that the state be ill prepared to manage crisis on this scale therefore apart from the specific recommendation deliver on the government mission particularly in this context build national health service fit for the future will contribute in important way to the uk resilience pandemic planning and resilience be about not just specific resilience measure but ensure the underlie fundamental of our country be strong thank the devolved government for their co operation in prepare our response today we will continue to work together for the safety of the community we serve turn to specific there be three new commitment that wish to highlight first the inquiry recommend that the uk government and devolve government should together hold regular uk wide pandemic response exercise we agree and will be undertake full national pandemic response exercise later this year it will be the first of its kind in nearly decade it will test the uk capability plan protocol and procedure in the event of another major pandemic it will be lead by senior ministers involve thousand of participant and run across all region and nation of the uk alongside the health secretary have write to all cabinet ministers to ask for their commitment to full participation the exercise will take place in the autumn over number of day the government will communicate the finding and lesson of the exercise as recommend by the inquiry secondly the inquiry find that the pandemic have disproportionate impact on vulnerable group and continue to affect many people in those community new national vulnerability map create by the cabinet office with the office for national statistics will geographically map population number of those who may be vulnerable in crisis it will do that by share datum include age disability ethnicity and whether someone be receive care the map will improve the government understanding of the scale and location of disproportionately impact population ahead of and during crisis and enable targeted local support when require thirdly as the inquiry remind we the risk we face be change more quickly than ever before and we live in an increasingly volatile world it therefore recommend well approach to risk assessment across the board which we accept today be publish an update national risk register the public face version of the national security risk assessment which provide business and the voluntary and community sector with the late information about the risk they face to support their planning preparation and response we will ensure that it continue to be update regularly significant proportion of the risk will be subject to reassessment over the next few month and we will publish far update risk register as need once the process be complete want to mention two further recommendation where the government accept the underlie objective and propose to take they forward in specific way first the inquiry recommend cabinet office leadership for whole system civil emergency in the uk we agree with that as for whole system emergency such as pandemic the centre of government need to play lead role but for low scale emergency we believe that the lead department model still have value it remain important for departments with the day to day responsibility for an issue to lead the work to identify serious risk and ensure that the right planning response and recovery arrangement be in place therefore in some circumstance we will retain the lead government department model because in those case responsibility and oversight should sit with the body with the good understanding relationship and mechanism for delivery to identify and address risk there will be an enhanced role for the cabinet office to improve preparedness and resilience for large scale catastrophic risk secondly on the question of independent input into whole system civil emergency preparedness and resilience we agree with the need for independent strategic advice and challenge include the use of so call red team we be establish eight expert advisory group to combat group think in our understanding of risk alongside that through the crisis management excellence programme we will increase training in red teaming we want to work with the local resilience forum that exist around the country who provide critical knowledge and expertise the government be also committed to introduce duty of candour on public authority as catalyst for change culture in the public sector to improve transparency and accountability we also welcome and will draw on the expertise of multidisciplinary pandemic science institute that provide world lead academic and scientific expertise such as the excellent pandemic institute in liverpool which be pleased to visit yesterday in the end the government must remain responsible and accountable for the policy and resource allocation decision they take but we believe that the external input of those body can add value to that decision making the impact of the pandemic be unprecedented in modern memory it cause the loss of far too many life my thought and the thought of the whole government continue to be with all those who lose love one during the pandemic many of they feel not just grief but anger that as baroness hallett report sadly confirm the country be not as prepare as it should have be my department will monitor the implementation of the commitment make in response to the inquiry in all this we must remember that the next crisis may not be the same as the last there be need for flexibility in our planning and learning and we will build that into what we do the government also remain committed to engage fully with the inquiry and await baroness hallett finding and recommendation in subsequent module report as she continue her important work commend this statement to the house call the shadow minister thank the minister for advance sight of his statement and join his tribute to baroness hallett for her report we all know how challenging the pandemic be sadly far too many life be lose pay tribute to all the victim from across our country and the world that be why the conservative government put in place the inquiry and former ministers have be co operate with its work thank the chancellor of the duchy of lancaster for acknowledge that it be clear from the inquiry investigation and finding so far that response time and process be too slow and disjointed we recognise that but it be also clear that there be an incredibly challenging process and no easy answer module examine our country pandemic resilience and preparedness so will focus on that the government response have identify number of overarch implementation from the module recommendation we be broadly supportive of the government direction as the inquiry report note it be important to strengthen cross governmental communication and data sharing and communication and co ordination between devolved administration appreciate that the government recognise that and be take forward the recommendation to ensure that the cabinet office have clear and strong role in crisis and resilience co ordination the government have clearly signal their intention to build on the work start under the last government who put together the resilience directorate within the cabinet office with the goal of ensure clear accountability and leadership for long term resilience and crisis planning hope that the step that the government have set out will successfully build on that be also thankful that they be build on the last government work to lay the foundation of the resilience academy and look forward to track that progress it be important to note that the government intend to strengthen the articulation of requirement for resilience and emergency training qualification be thankful that they be build on the work that we implement to establish new national exercise programme and be plan full pandemic exercise for this year importantly we need to recognise that the risk that we will face will be dynamic because we do not know what the future will hold hope that the pandemic exercise will involve cross cut segment of microbial resistance and technology infrastructure which will be key challenge that continue to grow in importance the government have also emphasise the holistic work that can be conduct across all type of organisation as result of the highly transparent risk register that we first publish in appreciate that they be set out their intention to build on that and offer wide range of scenario and framework to the register in future however they do not seem to fully recognise that there be far too much complication in the system which risk mask fundamental matter of cross governmental co ordination with political measure recognise in the government response the desire to ensure independent input into the whole system civil emergency preparedness and resilience and in do so establish number of expert advisory group but caution they that that must be back up by real accountability and progress tracking to ensure that the work conduct by those team be enact transparently and for clear reason they must not be just talk shop the government have announce significant number of review consultation and taskforce but without real accountability and framework clarity they risk be only temporary solution to long term issue that be particular concern when it come to national resilience although we support the government direction want to raise couple of question on recommendation the minister mention mapping which be very welcome but will he expand little on the combined impact of different vulnerability for certain group and how they can be overlay in that mapping process on recommendation and on the whole system emergency strategy and crucially that datum element be there datum to support the strategy what confidence do he have in that at the moment will he use the uk biobank for that there be critical issue around academic freedom as we look into very complex issue and overlap issue within community across the country on recommendation what response have the minister have so far from the devolved government he say that they have be very positive but could he go little far in response to recommendation the red group sound good but be little worried when he say we be establish eight advisory group to combat group think that sound little like tautology want to ensure that those group will be properly independent and that the government be challenge on their plan on recommendation there be an important point around report back the finding of the nationwide investigation on the publishing and timeliness the report ask for three month publication will the minister speak to that the cabinet office say that it be scope and test solution to resolve multi agency report will he speak to that finally thank you for your indulgence madam deputy speaker we must not lose sight of the fact that there be shift landscape and our response will be long term thing appreciate the government response today but they have not yet respond to last year house of lords statutory inquiries committee report on reform the process by which public inquiry be conduct that be slightly overdue so if the right hon gentleman could update we on progress on that would be most grateful we must ensure that the tracker be in place so that on issue such as this the horizon scandal or the infected blood scandal we be always in the right place be grateful for the right hon gentleman response and for his broad support for our response include on the resilience directorate academy and the full pandemic exercise let turn to his question on mapping the data be get well the government ability to gather and use datum have improve over time and it be important that we do that as well as we can datum have be describe as the new oil and it be important that the government which have access to good datum around the country use that to map vulnerability and to make sure that the next crisis do not expose crack in our society as be the case the last time around the right hon gentleman ask about work with the devolved government around those table people be not always of the same political party or outlook but in my experience in the last six month the spirit have be good and one of co operation it have be underpin by the common understanding that on an issue such as public protection the public do not really care about political difference they expect all of we whatever our political stripe to work together for their safety and the common good that be what we should do red teaming and challenge be important but they have to be put into context the right hon gentleman mention accountability say in my statement that accountability for policy and resource allocation decision ultimately have to rest with the government we be all for challenge and all for independent input into that but at the end of the day that be where the accountability lie and that be who have to take the resource allocation decision we will publish the finding of the pandemic exercise want to see inquiry come to conclusion more quickly so that victim of injustice can get justice more quickly the final thing say in response to the right hon gentleman be that he be right to say that the future may not be the same as the past that be why flexibility have to be build into all this while listen to my right hon friend statement and the shadow minister response have be reflect on those friend who sadly die during the pandemic be sure everybody in the house will have their own experience my right hon friend mention the need for new national pandemic planning exercise after the last one one of the press report suggest that recommendation be for senior ministers to act quickly if pandemic hit we can he confirm that one of the way in which improvement will be make in our preparation on his watch will be that senior ministers will be ready and will make decision in timely fashion that will all be test in the exercise we have plan past planning exercise have sometimes plan for the wrong thing that be the danger that be why say all the time that we have to make sure that we learn from what happen throughout the pandemic of few year ago but not make the assumption that the next pandemic or the next crisis will be exactly the same that be what we have to do call the liberal democrat spokesperson the finding of the inquiry be harsh confirmation of what we already know they be that the uk be woefully unprepared for the pandemic the focus be wrong the leadership be lack and the lesson from past crisis be not learn be sure speak for all hon member when say that our heart remain with those who lose love one during that tragic time and thank the family member who be in the public gallery today to do right by they crucially we must ensure that this be turning point it be essential that the new government take swift and decisive action to prepare for next time therefore welcome the minister announcement of pandemic response exercise this autumn however will that be one off or be further exercise plan and if they be how frequently as well as the different more proactive approach to disease outbreak preparedness that baroness hallett cite in her report we must invest in public health rather than simply throw money at crisis when they materialise one of the key finding be that health inequality and less healthy population have leave the nation less resilient do the minister agree that public health should be priority and that the public health grant with proportion set aside for those experience the bad health inequality to co produce plan for their community would be step in the right direction we need to help more people live more year of their life in good health when think back to those covid year think of the appalling loneliness and isolation of those in hospital or in care home do the government agree that patient and care home resident should be give new legal right to maintain family contact in all health and care setting finally on resilience forum will the minister confirm what funding plan there be in future for resilience forum be aware before christmas that there be some lack of certainty about that certainly that be what be hear from my own sussex resilience forum we can not risk our country not be ready for the future and those be important question the most fundamental thing apart from specific recommendation or specific change be the underlie strength of the country and its service that be true nowhere more than in the national health service that be why the budget which have be attack lot put in the resource to begin to turn the health service around we can have the forum the structure and the process but the underlie strength of the country be the most important thing the hon lady ask about the exercise this autumn very much hope it will not be the last the inquiry recommend that they happen on regular basis it will be the first for many year and we want to make sure we learn as much from it as possible in term of funding for local resilience forum they play an important role and we be able to put some increase resource into local government in the next financial year that area like other will have to be consider in the round in the spending review that will be publish later this year be less sanguine about the report than my right hon friend the report or what be part of report it be difficult to assess when we do not know what the rest will say have be too expensive and have take too long to produce from read it it do not seem to to include some of the fundamental question that and my constituent would like answer what be the cost benefit analysis of the decision take during lockdown for instance what about lockdown itself be that benefit or disbenefit what be the cost of effectively close down the nhs apart from for covid patient where do the virus come from do it come from china which most of the evidence seem to indicate those question be not be answer furthermore do not believe that set up new quango in conjunction with the cabinet office which have no experience of service delivery will be the answer to any future epidemic the report do not answer the question would like answer hope my hon friend do not think be sanguine be not sanguine at all anyone who read the national risk register should not be sanguine because as say in my statement we live in world of risk and vulnerability as for the inquiry work the inquiry be independent and be not instruct by the government on the specific area it go into it have module as decide by the inquiry because it be independent may echo the sentiment of the hon member for blackley and middleton south graham stringer by express concern about the inquiry the minister have be clear that he wish it be not take quite so long it be take far too long what can we learn from other country about how they have conduct their lesson learn exercise in order to make sure that the people watch the proceeding who lose their love one feel that something have be do and do in good time this be by no mean the first public inquiry that have take too long the right hon gentleman be in the great position of not be responsible for set up the inquiry will he set out what he think we should learn from failed and lengthy inquiry to make sure we do these urgent lesson learn exercise much more quickly the next emergency could strike tomorrow we do not have time to hang around and have these long blame inquiry with criminal lawyer ask gotcha question to get headline the shadow minister in his response also ask about the general question of inquiry believe there be legitimate question to be ask about whether there can be quick way for the state to admit when it be wrong and get justice for the victim however it be important that in the process we set up we do not lose the valuable question of independence and the valuable capacity these inquiry have for the victim to have voice which have sometimes be deny in other area we have to have system where the state can admit when it get thing wrong and which get justice for those who have feel the consequence of that be cabinet member during covid responsible for public health as listen to my right hon friend statement feel so relieved that we be about to replace the chaos experience by and so many people across the country at that time with forward look orderly and strategic approach among the many thing that have be mention be particularly pleased by the idea of create national vulnerability map that be hugely need on hear that the department will monitor the implementation of the commitment make in response to the inquiry will my right hon friend come to the house regularly to update on that implementation this be just module there be other module to be publish and will update the house in some form when the government respond to those of course on top of that there be regular opportunity to question and the ministers in the cabinet office either at oral question or in front of select committees associate myself with the observation of the hon member for blackley and middleton south graham stringer and my hon friend the member for harwich and north essex sir bernard jenkin the fact be that we have an absolutely urgent imperative to address the dysfunction of the british state that be expose by the covid inquiry agree with everything that have be say about how bad thing be in early welcome what the right hon gentleman be say about the importance of strong centre and more accountable cabinet office think that be the right direction to be go in however do he also recognise that the part of our society that do not fail in be the part very far from whitehall local government the private sector and our community themselves do he agree that while the focus need to be on improve whitehall response we also need to think about the resilience of local community and ensure that they can play their part in the next crisis the hon gentleman make very good point my experience in wolverhampton which represent be that the local authority do great job of look out for vulnerable people an inquiry perhaps by definition place the emphasis on thing that go wrong but there be great deal of experience during the pandemic that show the good of society with people look out for one another and help those who be vulnerable we should draw on the thing that go well as well as those that go wrong in my previous role in health scrutiny in lancashire get bit feed up of hear from conservative politician that no one could have see covid coming as if global viral pandemic have not be top of the nhs risk register for year and as if epidemiologist have not warn authority that it be matter of when not if do my right hon friend agree that it be disgraceful abdication of responsibility for the former government to plead ignorance to the well know risk of global viral pandemic thank my hon friend for her question there be always risk of plan for the wrong thing which be risk be very aware of as we try to do this forward look exercise be encourage by what see yesterday in liverpool at the pandemic institute where the scientific expertise that we have in this country be try to take the learning from that in the past and ensure that we do not assume that the next situation will be the same as the one we go through several year ago it might be something similar but it might also be something very different which be transmit differently and create whole different series of question and requirement for the government of the day be delighted to hear that relation with the devolved administration be now on collegiate basis have to say that my experience as lowly special adviser with the scotland office at the tail end of the pandemic be nothing like that at all it be very very difficult we face constant battle with the scottish government who want to put their oar into area that really be nothing to do with they and constantly want change for the sake of change be therefore relieved to hear that the cabinet office seem to be take lead in this heaven forfend we face another situation like the covid pandemic but we probably will can the right hon gentleman assure that we will have chain of command that make it clear who be in charge which must be this sovereign parliament say that co operation be good on this issue of course we live in world where that might not always be the case on everything however do think that when it come to public protection people should leave their politic at the door and ask themselves just one question how do we protect the public and get the country through this declare an interest as the chair of the all party parliamentary group on vulnerable group to pandemic welcome my right hon friend statement today one of the most striking conclusion of the covid inquiry be that it be the most vulnerable people in our society who be hard hit whether that be because they have pre exist health condition or because they be on some of the low wage in this country will he tell the house what step be be take to ensure that in the event of another incident of this nature support reach the most vulnerable people in our community much more quickly than during the covid pandemic my hon friend be right crack in our society be expose this do not affect all part of society equally we have to learn from that and respond to it the very concept of have society should mean that in an emergency we pull together and try to overcome it together the map we be produce will help we somewhat in identify where those risk be however as say in my statement the most important thing be the underlie strength of the country and its institution and in this context specifically that of the national health service itself in cheltenham in sandford park we have an avenue of tree that be plant in honour of the covid hero and the many victim that our town lose during the pandemic not far from there there be playground and that playground be shut there be nothing more dystopian for child than see the playground that they cherish shut child do not often have voice in these kind of discussion can the right hon gentleman confirm that the next time there be pandemic we will take much more reasonable approach to risk as raise in the module and that child will have big voice so that they will not suffer the mental health problem that we know so many have suffer as result of the pandemic this be something the inquiry intend to look at in the future but let we state the obvious parent of young child in flat with no outside space have very different experience of the covid pandemic compare with someone with nice big garden that be true totally understand the public health decision that be take but they do not affect everybody equally that be something to ponder for the future welcome my right hon friend statement today to be honest as former public health consultant look on in amazement at what happen during the pandemic therefore welcome the fact that the report acknowledge and recognise that exercise alice and cygnus be ignore that that contribute to our lack of preparedness and that we have decline national health and exacerbate health inequality another point that be raise in the report and in the film the unequal pandemic be the fact that there be such low awareness around the function of public health which be be reinvent at the centre none of the legislation and regulation on public health protection be know have hear that report back from director of public health who go into cobra meeting where there be total absence of understanding of basic legislation in this regard can my right hon friend reassure on the relationship between the centre and local public health team which be decimate because there be such lack of understanding of public health as whole but particularly about their health protection role and that this issue of reinvent the wheel will not happen again thank my hon friend for her question specifically mention local resilience forum in my opening statement for good reason as say moment ago think it be really important that we recognise that in an emergency the centre local government and the devolved government have to work together in the good interest of the public endorse what she say as have say few time today about the importance of the underlie strength of our health system in such an emergency want to begin by say that although the loss of every single life be of course tragic and see that at first hand when volunteer it be important to note that despite repeat political attack at the time suggest that we have the bad death rate in europe now when we look at the figure properly we see that we actually have low death rate than spain and italy and that we be broadly in line with europe caution against diminish the result of national effort which be actually broadly in line with other country in desire to make political attack on the conservative party as exhaustive as the inquiry proposal for thing to look at be to my mind see big gap which relate to the decision making of mps the inquiry do not seem to cover that those of we on the government benches equally it could be say of those on the opposition benches be often face with very difficult vote that be expect to go down to the wire and be ask to make very difficult decision mp access to independent advice and scientific briefing be nowhere near like it should have be if the right hon gentleman agree that that be not part of the current inquiry can he at least accept that it be task for the cabinet office to think how we can well equip mp with the information they need to make decision on important vote of that nature thank the hon gentleman for his service to the public during the pandemic and anybody who work or volunteer in the nhs or in other way for what they do of course mps and the government must have access to the good information they can but remind he of something else say in my opening statement in the end the accountability for policy and resource allocation decision lie with the government of the day do not say that in partisan way it be important to establish it as an understanding of how we deal with these thing in future pass the national covid memorial wall every day on my way to this place it and the inquiry be reminder of what happen when government get thing wrong absolutely welcome the announcement of national pandemic response exercise later this year but the inquiry find that similar exercise take place in scotland under the control of the scottish government before the pandemic and that they fail to implement its conclusion first can the minister reassure we that any outcome from such an exercise will be report to this house and that we will have oversight of the implementation of any recommendation secondly know it be outside the remit of the minister statement but can he give we an update on the recovery of any money lose through dodgy contract to the mate of the previous government let repeat the praise give to the volunteer who maintain the national covid memorial wall hon member may not be aware of it when they look at the red heart but over time they fade they fade to pink the reason they be keep red be that there be group of volunteer down there overpainte the heart to make sure that the wall do not fade away and that the memory of the name record do not fade away the conclusion of the national pandemic exercise will be report prediction be dangerous game but let make one there will be thing that go wrong shortfall will be expose and not everything will go right but that be part of the purpose of do an exercise like this be happy to assure he in term of learn from it and the conclusion thank the minister for advance sight of his statement also completely agree with he that in these matter the public do not care about party political difference note his commitment to an independent whole system civil preparedness and resilience process go forward be just look for some reassurance that the devolve government will be consult and fully involved like the hon member for edinburgh south west dr arthur want to press the minister on recovery from some of the very wasteful ppe contract that be award during the pandemic the hon member will know that we have appoint covid fraud commissioner to try to recover as much as possible of the money that go wrong have seek not to be partisan today but do believe that the system in place be wrong and that there be some abuse and significant loss of money when we be in situation where we want value for money for the public we want to recover as much of that as possible repeat that relation with the devolved government on this kind of issue have be good so far hope it be the case that that be maintain through the national pandemic exercise that we be plan we all live through the pandemic and we all come to see the immense value of our key worker the bus driver who have to continue to make essential journey the carer who have no choice but to continue to provide close quarter care and the postie some of whom meet recently in welwyn garden city at their delivery depot on bessemer road they tell that when they have socially distance conversation on the doorstep with lonely resident it be often the only human interaction they have all day will my right hon friend the minister reaffirm how important the government believe the role of key worker be and that critically for the next pandemic we have measure in place to make sure they be protect and support my hon friend raise an excellent point let echo his praise for all the key worker he mention when the chip be down we find out who be keep the country go let from this dispatch box thank each and every one of they for what they do to keep the country go during those very difficult time the minister quite rightly express sympathy for the victim of which be something we all share but he have not mention anything about the victim of vaccine of whom there be thousand we know that those people do the right thing and take the vaccine but they be not warn of the risk the minister have be talk about risk assessment there be lack of risk engagement and now we find that the compensation scheme the vaccine damage payment scheme be in place but not operate effectively or fairly the health minister keep talk about possibly amend it but every time he mention that it cause immense harm to all those who be still suffer as consequence of have do the right thing and take the vaccine when many of they now wish they have not let say to the hon gentleman that believe the production and distribution of the vaccine be one of the thing that go well and which this country contribute to and that the availability of vaccine help we to overcome the pandemic in those case where there be adverse reaction there be scheme in place as he say my right hon friend the secretary of state for health have meet people affect of course we want to help people affect through the kind of scheme that exist first thank the minister for comment on the importance of multidisciplinary research from my own previous research know that that be very important particularly in the development of ai algorithmic risk prediction model also have the pleasure yesterday of speak to professor tom solomon the director of the liverpool pandemic institute which the science innovation and technology committee have the pleasure of visit recently he impress on the value of physician researcher in conduct groundbreake research do the minister agree that it be vital we provide the time and fund to researcher such as professor solomon to help build our national resilience to future pandemic let echo my hon friend praise for professor solomon and the work that he and the pandemic institute be do he be right to underline the value of research as be my hon friend as have be point out throughout these exchange the next crisis that the country face may be very different from the last so it be important that we use one of this country great asset its tremendous research institute and research capability to scan the horizon as well as we can and to be as well prepared as we possibly can have serve on the frontline during covid be acutely aware of the sacrifice make by clinician patient and staff however when it come to prepare for any future pandemic part of the solution be ensure that we have robust epidemiological research could the minister tell we in rather more granular detail what assessment he have make of the current project commission by the government the hon gentleman be right about the need for robust research do not analyse the research project one by one but thank he for his service and underline what have say few time today the good insurance that we can have in respond to another crisis like the one that we go through some year ago be the underlie strength of the country and the nhs that be why we have make the decision to put resource into the nhs to help to turn it around and make it strong in the future than it be today spend the pandemic as trade unionist at the tuc support france now baroness in her fight for the right to safety of work people the covid inquiry hear time and again about the impact of the pandemic on those with low wage and insecure work people who have to go into work even when it be not safe because otherwise they could not feed their family and who be disproportionately from black and minority ethnic background will the minister ensure that the new national vulnerability map treat insecure worker as vulnerable for the purpose of crisis planning and resilience and will he ensure that the union be key stakeholder in build that resilience in the uk my hon friend be right to underline the need to thank the key worker many of whom be low pay and many of whom do come from ethnic minority background they keep the country go and sometimes have to put themselves at risk to help and protect the rest of we thank my hon friend and those who represent work people for the work that they do during the pandemic may ask about the specific of the government response to module be interested to hear about the national vulnerability map which could help with range of matter include digital exclusion as well as public health but let ask the minister two question first have he take into consideration the finding of chris whitty report on coastal community and their specific vulnerability secondly while this be obviously hugely valuable undertaking do not want we to create one trick pony so could the minister try to seize the big opportunity to build well system for store and use citizen datum that could benefit everyone and give all sort of people the support that they need when they need it as say while ago datum have be describe as the new oil and there be good reason for use it the government and the state have duty to try to use datum to secure the good outcome for the public and one example be use it to map our vulnerability have be praise people for what they do during the pandemic so let now praise sir chris whitty the chief medical officer for what he do then and what he continue to do today the country be very lucky to have he and thank he for everything that he do it be source of national shame that our country be so underprepared for the covid pandemic and the conservatives need to take their fair share of the responsibility for that we all worry about where the next pandemic will come from and be particularly concerned about the risk pose by dengue fever for those who be not aware of it let explain that it be disease spread by mosquito it have be travel close and close to the uk in recent year owe to rise temperature and climate change and have most recently be find in paris as one who represent constituency on the south coast be especially worried about the warning that it could be within the uk within year there be currently no cure but there be vaccine go through trial thank to international collaboration of which our country be part may ask what step the government be take to improve our preparedness for the next pandemic wherever it may come from and however

of the exercise will be make public and let repeat my prediction they will probably show thing that have go wrong and area where we need to improve anyone who carry out such an exercise and do not expect that will face nasty surprise one of the positive we see during the covid pandemic be an outpouring of neighbourliness church and faith community play key role in mobilise support for those most in need deliver meal shopping and prescription medication to those who be advise to stay at home will the minister join in pay tribute to all those volunteer and assure the house that faith community and other community organisation will be involve in the local resilience forum so that they be integral to both the resilience planning and incident response my hon friend be absolutely

terrible crime of child sexual exploitation and abuse include mandatory reporting new victim and survivor panel an overhaul of datum and police performance requirement tough sentence for perpetrator

morning with survivor from oldham early this week she and meet professor alexis jay who chair both the seven year national independent inquiry into child sexual abuse and the first local independent inquiry into groom gang in rotherham professor jay strong message to we be that the survivor who bravely testify to the terrible crime commit against they must not be leave to feel that their effort be in vain because despite all the inquiry no one listen and nothing be do follow those discussion want to update the house on our next step to take forward the inquiry recommendation and to go far in tackle sexual exploitation and groom on the street and online in order to keep child safe the independent national inquiry into child sexual abuse complete its final report in it take seven year hear personal testimony and consider million page of evidence there be devastating account of brutal rape sexual violence humiliation trauma and the betrayal of vulnerable child by those charge with protect they and account of people in position of power who shamefully put the reputation of institution before the protection of child the inquiry include separate detailed report on organise child abuse in residential home and school and on abuse and cover up in the catholic and anglican church two year inquiry into child sexual exploitation by organise network and groom gang publish in february examine over recommendation make by previous inquiry and serious case review as well as take further evidence of its own there have be further report since then include on telford and on police performance however despite all the national inquiry report and hundred of recommendation far too little action have be take and shamefully little progress have be make that have to change before easter the government will lay out clear timetable for take forward the recommendation of the final iicsa report four of those be specifically for the home office can confirm that we have accept they in full include on disclosure and barring and work be already under way cross government ministerial group be consider and work through the remain recommendation and that group will be support by our new victim and survivor panel in addition can confirm today that the government will implement all the remain recommendation in the child abuse inquiry separate stand alone report on groom gang from february include update key department for education guidance let turn to the area where we need to go far as say last week the most important task should be to increase police investigation into these horrific crime and get abuser behind bar we will introduce strong sentence for child groom by make organise abuse and exploitation an aggravating factor and today can announce new action to help victim get more investigation and prosecution under way be extend the remit of the independent child sexual abuse review panel to cover not just historical case before but all case since so that any victim of abuse will have the right to seek an independent review without have to go back to the local institution that decide not to proceed with their case today be write to the national police chiefs council to ask all chief constable to look again at historical gang exploitation case where no further action be take and to work with the child sexual exploitation police taskforce to pursue new line of inquiry and reopen investigation where appropriate these new measure will be back by million of additional funding for the taskforce and the panel and all police force will be expect to implement the recommendation from his majesty inspectorate of constabulary and fire and rescue service include produce problem profile on the nature of groom gang in their area have ask the inspectorate to review progress this year as well as review past case we need much strong action to uncover the full scale and nature of these awful crime the child sexual exploitation police taskforce lead by the national police chiefs council have estimate that of the child sexual abuse offence record by the police in around involve more than one perpetrator of those around involved abuse within the family and over involved abuse in institution and the taskforce identify report case of group or gang relate child sexual exploitation however we know that the vast majority of abuse go unreported so we expect all those figure to be significant underestimate the taskforce report that major police investigation across police force be currently under way into child sexual exploitation and gang grooming many major investigation have involve pakistani heritage gang the police taskforce evidence also show exploitation and abuse take place across many different community and ethnicity but the datum on the ethnicity of both perpetrator and victim be still inadequate as say last week we will overhaul the datum that we expect local area to collect as part of new performance management framework have also ask the child sexual exploitation taskforce to immediately expand the ethnicity datum it collect and publishe so that data be gather from the end of an investigation when full picture be available not just from the beginning when suspect may not yet have be identify to go much far have ask baroness louise casey to oversee rapid audit of the current scale and nature of gang base exploitation across the country and to make recommendation on the further work that be need the specific iicsa report on gang exploitation conclude an accurate picture of the prevalence of child sexual exploitation could not be glean from the datum and evidence it have available this audit will seek to fill that gap the audit will look at further evidence that be not previously available include evidence collect by the police taskforce and the new problem profile compile by police force it will also include an equivalent audit of child protection referral it will properly examine ethnicity datum and the demographic of the gang and their victim it will look at the cultural and societal driver for this type of offending include among different ethnic group and it will make recommendation about further analysis investigation and action that be need to address current and historical failure baroness louise casey be the author of the no holds bar report into child sexual exploitation in rotherham and have therefore ask she to oversee this rapid three month audit ahead of the launch of the independent commission into adult social care in many area across the country the focus must now be on further police investigation and implement recommendation to improve service but we will also provide strong national backing for local inquiry where they be need to get truth and justice for victim and survivor last week the prime minister and meet survivor from telford who have enormous praise for the way that local inquiry be conduct after there have be failing over many year that inquiry lead to tangible change include pilot the introduction of cctv in taxi and appoint child sexual exploitation expert in local secondary school as we have see effective local inquiry can delve into far more local detail and deliver more locally relevant answer and change than lengthy nationwide inquiry can provide tom crowther kc the chair of the telford inquiry have agree to work with the government to develop new framework for victim centre locally lead inquiry where they be need as first step he will work with oldham council and up to four other pilot area this will include support for local authority that want to explore other way to support victim include local panel or draw on the experience of the independent inquiry truth project the government be already draw up duty of candour as part of the long await hillsborough law we will also work with mayor and local council to bolster the accountability mechanism that can support and follow up local inquiry to ensure that those who be complicit in cover up or who try to resist scrutiny be always robustly hold to account so that truth and justice be never deny this new package of national support for local inquiry will be back by million of additional funding to get further local work off the ground because at every level get justice for victim and protect child be responsibility we all share finally we can not ignore the way in which child exploitation be change as offender exploit new technology to target and groom child we should all be deeply worried about the pace and growth of exploitation that begin online we be therefore bolster the work of the home office fund undercover online network of police officer to target online offender and develop cutting edge ai tool and other new capability to infiltrate livestream and chatroom where child be be groom further measure will be announce in the crime and police bill to tackle those organise online child sex abuse nothing matter more than the safety of our child yet for too long this horrific abuse be allow to continue victim be ignore perpetrator be leave unpunished and too many people look the other way even when these shocking crime be bring to light and national inquiry be commission to get to the truth the result report be too often leave on the shelf as their recommendation gather dust under this government that have change we be take action not just on those recommendation but on the additional work that we need to do to protect victim put perpetrator behind bar and uncover the truth wherever thing have go wrong this be about the protection of child the protection of young girl and the radical and ambitious mission that we have set for this government to halve violence against woman and girl in decade hope all member will support that mission and support the measure that we have outline today to help achieve that aim commend this statement to the house call the shadow home secretary let we start by remember the victim of this scandal thousand of young girl often in their early teen be systematically rap by gang of man predominantly of pakistani heritage those in position of authority the police local council and the crown prosecution service ignore they and in some case even cover up these horrendous crime because of absurd concern about so call cultural sensitivity ten day ago the prime minister compound this by say that it be far right bandwagon to raise these issue and call for proper inquiry let say this it be not far right to stand up for rape victim and smear those who raise this issue be exactly what lead to the order the shadow home secretary will be hear smear those who raise this issue be exactly what lead to the victim be ignore and the crime cover up in the first place therefore will the home secretary apologise on behalf of the prime minister for his language last week it be not true to say that the previous government do nothing follow the iicsa report they set up the grooming gang taskforce follow the iicsa report which lead to arrest of perpetrator in the first year alone and be glad that the new government be continue that work in april the data collection on the ethnicity of perpetrator be initiate but the initial publication of that think last november show that the collection be incomplete will the home secretary ensure both that the police follow through on the work initiate in april and that the data be collect more comprehensively the mandatory reporting recommendation be introduce as an amendment to the criminal justice bill which fall due to the early general election be glad that the government say that they will now pick that up and take it forward previous report and review do not go far enough the iicsa report itself be mainly not about these rape gang in fact it barely touch on the issue and look at only six town we now believe that as many as town could have be affect so the iicsa barely scratch the surface the home secretary just announce government support for only five local inquiry that be wholly inadequate when we know that up to town be affect have some serious question for the home secretary first how be the other plus town suppose to get answer to the question that they have and how will these initial five town be choose secondly the home secretary say nothing in her statement about the power that these local inquiry will have it seem that they will not be statutory inquiry under the inquiries act that mean that these local inquiry will not have the power to compel witness to attend to take evidence under oath or to requisition write evidence if that be the case how can they possibly get to the truth when face with cover up it be precisely that problem the lack of power that reportedly lead the chair of the manchester local inquiry to resign last year they be not give the information that they need by public authority and do not have the power require to force its release so they resign legal power be need because these crime be deliberately cover up in some case we hear just week or two ago from the former labour mp for rochdale simon danczuk who say that the then chair of the parliamentary labour party tell he not to raise these issue for fear of lose muslim vote truly appalling not single person have be convict for cover up or ignore these crime in my view the criminal offence of misconduct in public office might apply moreover those vile perpetrator who can be deport should be deport every single one of they change the law if that be need to do it and use visa sanction on country such as pakistan to ensure that they accept eligible perpetrator what the home secretary have announce today be totally inadequate it will cover only fraction of the town affect and it appear that the inquiry will not have the legal power they need that be why we need proper full national public inquiry cover the whole country and with the power under the inquiries act that be need to obtain the evidence require it be not just who think that in the last week or two the labour members for rotherham sarah champion and for liverpool walton dan carden have call for full national inquiry as have andy burnham the labour mayor of greater manchester commend those member and andy burnham for their courage in speak out recent polling show that the vast majority of the public want full national public inquiry include of labour voter most importantly so do victim jane be groom and abuse at the age of just she be gang rap repeatedly she tell the police and she tell her social worker at one point the police even find she be abuse by an illegal immigrant but instead of arrest he they arrest she jane still do not know if any of her abuser have be jail or if any of the public official who let she down so badly have be hold to account jane now want proper national public inquiry home secretary why do you these be the most vile crime against teenager child and young girl very often they involve sadistic abuse rape and the most appalling trauma that can last for many year the independent inquiry into child sexual abuse run for seven year and take evidence from victim and survivor across the country too many of those voice and the bravery that those victim show have just be ignore the right hon gentleman say that he take action but be afraid the conservative party have year to introduce duty to report child abuse make it responsibility of professional to report it and make it an offence to cover up child abuse be call for that year ago the prime minister be call for it year ago the right hon gentleman fail to do it and we have lose decade as result the independent inquiry into child sexual abuse also run two year investigation of child sexual exploitation and groom gang one of the shocking thing that it find be that less be now know and understand about the prevalence of this appalling crime than prior to in the period to even after we know about what have happen in rotherham and baroness louise casey have identify its impact and the failure to address issue of race and ethnicity the previous government go backwards on gather datum and information and the need for proper evidence that be why this government have commission baroness louise casey to instigate rapid review to uncover the prevalence of this appalling crime across the country with no hold bar in the way that we know she will conduct this inquiry to fill the gap in the evidence rather than rerun the same question without the evidence and datum that we badly need also point out to the shadow minister that his party weaken the disclosure and bar rule in again make change that and the policing minister my right hon friend the member for kingston upon hull north and cottingham dame diana johnson oppose at the time and that the independent inquiry rightly recommend reverse in order to keep child safe again his party fail to act hope the action we have announce will be support right across the country it include the duty to report child abuse proper penalty for cover it up strong sentence for groom gang new right for victim to get an independent review on reopen their case new action to reopen historical police investigation new standard for the police to meet new victim and survivor panel new audit of the scale and nature of child sexual exploitation and grooming gang lead by someone who uncover lot of the problem in rotherham include the failure to confront pakistani heritage gang the gathering and publishing of new ethnicity datum which the shadow minister fail to do new national support for local inquiry include the telford model victim panel new work on accountability link to the hillsborough law to hold failure to account because we will strengthen the law to do so and proper timetable for take forward the independent inquiry because this have to be about action and protect child and keep they safe think hear the home secretary adopt my five point plan so thank she for that and thank everybody across the house who have be campaign on the issue if could ask for some clarity do the home secretary say she will adopt all of the iicsa recommendation or just those in the grooming gang strand do local authority as well as police force have to do review into their case of cse she cite telford which be victim focused that be why it be so important because we must have those victim and survivor voice but what telford and greater manchester say they lack be the ability to compel witness big strand of what we need to do be ensure that there have be no cover up and we can only do that if requirement be on statutory footing with respect telford cost million and the home secretary say she be provide million for the whole inquiry across the country why do we need another inquiry in telford when we know this be happen nationally can she assure we that there will be transparency of the finding of all the inquiry review and audits be it possible that the inquiry could be uk wide because do not believe this be only happen in england and wales it need to be across the whole of the uk thank my hon friend for her question to go through they in turn we will set out before easter the timetable for take forward the work around all the recommendation from the main independent inquiry into child sexual abuse she will know that some of the recommendation raise complex issue and considerable work will need to be do on some of they we recognise that and have discuss that with professor alexis jay there be other recommendation we can take forward swiftly and those cover and lead by the home office be be take forward swiftly the work be already under way include on disclosure and barring and on the duty to report which will be include as part of the legislation on the local inquiry we be not redo the telford inquiry my hon friend be right that in telford the extensive inquiry that be conduct involved crucially victim and survivor throughout they be involve from the very beginning design the inquiry in the first place the inquiry have lead to substantial change and there continue to be far follow up work on it that be the effective model we need local council police and crime commissioner mayors and the government to work together on they so we be provide the additional million tom crowther will work specifically with the first five local authority that want to do such work draw up an effective model that can be use in other area on the ability to gather evidence and ensure that there be proper accountability there have to be clear accountability this process can not be way in which area or institution can avoid scrutiny obviously the work in telford and the original work in rotherham by baroness casey manage to uncover truth in different area but there also need to be other new arrangement on accountability we be work with the cabinet office mayors and council to draw up new accountability arrangement that will ensure either proper follow up or as part of those initial inquiry that proper accountability framework be in place we will link that to the duty of candour part of the hillsborough law unlike the previous government who frankly never take seriously issue of candour responsibility and accountability in the year that they be in power and refuse to bring in hillsborough law we will bring in such law because we be clear that there must be proper accountability for the failure to tackle this abuse call the liberal democrat spokesperson survivor be tough as know from my own experience of abuse as child about which have speak in the chamber survivor have be subject to intense impact and blister climate but like blade in the blacksmith forge each strike have strengthen many survivor character mettle and spirit even though those be experience that should never be undergo in the first place each shock have embolden our resolve to be the very sword carry by lady justice herself or at least to see it wield with strength to see action take and justice do however too many survivor story have be characterise by be ignore hide or gaslit recently too many survivor story have be shamefully use as political football in some corner of this house and beyond survivor experience be litter with gut wrench instance of power holder miss glare opportunity to take action against child sexual abuse and exploitation history must stop repeat itself we can not afford for professor jay finding or those of the inquiry announce today to gather dust atop power holder bookshelf to get lose at the bottom of in tray or to be banish to the depth of filing cabinet in line with the courage that it have take so many survivor to speak out on this issue we liberal democrats and many other know implore those in position of power at all level to step up too that mean that those weaponise this issue for party political gain must stop now it mean that professor jay recommendation must be implement from now and it mean that the work to get the local inquiry set up must start now survivor need assurance that beyond the area that have be announce today they will be able to get justice in their case as well will the home secretary share the plan for the area beyond those she have announce today what legal power will the inquiry have to ensure that they have tooth and justice can be deliver we must all dignify survivor experience with action we must honour all survivor story with reform lady justice demand it and so do the temper sword that she wield welcome the hon member point on this extremely serious issue he be right that many victim and survivor need proper police investigation to go after the perpetrator prosecute and hold they to account and get justice and put they behind bar that will help to protect other young people as well one of the most important change be that we be make it easy to get investigation reopen where they have be close down for the wrong reason and justice still need to be do we will give victim strong right to review they will be able to go to an independent panel with their case and have it independently review so that it can be reopen we be also ask police force across the country to review the closed case and pursue new line of inquiry with the taskforce support to ensure that they can do so tom crowther who do the telford inquiry will work with five area on the kind of inquiry that they may want to take forward involve victim and survivor it be crucial to involve victim and survivor in the design one telford survivor give evidence to both the national inquiry and the local inquiry and she find that the local inquiry be far more effective at get change in that area and it be easy for she to give evidence to it that be why we need area to be able to learn from what telford do effectively but also to be back up by strong arrangement for accountability strong mechanism for hold local organisation to account if they be not comply however we also expect local organisation to comply and to be part of find truth and justice for survivor welcome my right hon friend statement and the measure she have include in it and thank she for her promptness in do that also thank her team especially the minister for safeguarding my hon friend the member for birmingham yardley jess phillips for listen to and provide support to constituent who have go through such horrific abuse how will my right hon friend ensure not only that the individual responsible for this awful abuse will be catch and convict but that those who fail to protect and support these vulnerable young people it be not just young woman who have be affect in oldham but also young man will be hold to account my hon friend be right to raise those important point and know that she have work on this issue for many year one of the thing we need to do be strengthen the law in this area we need to have much strong legal framework to ensure that there be proper accountability not just hold to account and properly punish the perpetrator of appalling abuse but hold to account institution and individual who fail to take the action need to protect our child that mean the duty to report make it an offence to cover up child abuse duty of candour to comply and provide the information and transparency in these case and look at the other local mechanism that need to be in place in area such as my hon friend and across the country enable we to ensure that there be proper accountability when thing go really badly wrong call the chair of the home affairs committee welcome the statement which my committee will look at carefully professor alexis jay will be in front of we next tuesday and be sure that we will come back with further point but have two point today the first be about the duty to report in many case report be make but the victim be simply not listen to and not believe so what can the home secretary do to ensure that change secondly since be not clear from her answer so far will the local inquiry have statutory power to compel witness yes or no on the right hon lady first point she be right that report be often not listen to and not follow up in some area what that mean be that although recommendation be make there be never any follow up there be never the proper implementation of standard to be able to do so for example in police we have never have proper performance management framework to ensure that standard be be meet and that there be proper follow up we need that strong performance management framework in place those who conduct the telford inquiry be able to make progress and get to the truth use an exist local inquiry framework that be able to be extremely effective in other area we have need to have other action include for example action by inspectorate to follow up so there be different approach that we can take we believe that the current system be not strong enough that be why we have set out work that be under way involve the cabinet office and local mayor and local council to make sure we can strengthen the accountability arrangement to be able both to follow up and support local inquiry where they be relevant and to use exist power that be in place as barrister and former crown prosecutor for year who deal with sexual abuse and rape case can tell this house that sexual abuse and assault occur throughout the united kingdom and be not specific to any gender race or religion we just have to look at the pelicot case in france however there be one group of victim who be often not speak about which be young boy and young man the level of sexual abuse that relate to they be completely under report think it be cultural thing the idea that boy must man up and must not show their feeling can therefore ask the home secretary that when she be look at these thing she ensure that those undertake such inquiry look into fact about the abuse of young boy my hon friend be right to raise this point in fact it be one of the issue raise as part of the independent inquiry two year review of child exploitation the review identify that teenage or young boy be be exploit and that there be often pattern of that start with online exploitation what start as online abuse and grooming then lead to contact abuse and rape and the most appalling violation she be right to highlight this issue and it be extremely important that this be take into account and be part of the way in which local council and police force need to respond the house will be well aware that have be consistently campaign for rape gang inquiry into child sexual expectation across keighley and the wide bradford district for far too long so welcome some of the point that the home secretary have make particularly on the implementation of the recommendation from the iicsa report unfortunately do not feel that she be go far enough and would like to make few point in particular have serious concern about the ability of inquiry at local level to compel witness to give evidence and about the amount of funding that will be make available will the local inquiry that the home secretary be advocate be truly independent not just local authority mark their own homework and will they lead to conviction local authority leader in bradford district have consistently refuse to back my call for public inquiry as have the mayor of west yorkshire and the deputy mayor for policing alison lowe how on earth be we mean to get across this barrier of local leader refuse to have an inquiry on this issue without the government step in and give the statutory authority that we on this side of the house be demand it be obviously really important to ensure that there be independent scrutiny the hon member will be aware that the inquiry in rotherham lead by baroness louise casey use inspectorate power but it be clearly independent and it manage to uncover serious problem that have go wrong in rotherham at that time so there be different way of do this the telford inquiry be fund locally but it manage to involve victim and survivor and it also manage to shape the inquiry in the way that victim and survivor want which be also important for all area right across the country the most important thing be still to get police investigation go after the perpetrator get they before the court and get they behind bar whatever else happen get strong police investigation in order to pursue perpetrator must remain at the heart of what happen child sexual expectation and abuse be the most sickening appal crime perpetrate against some of the most vulnerable youngster in our community so strongly welcome this comprehensive new national plan of action to put victim first and welcome the appointment of baroness casey to conduct rapid review of the scale and nature of these grooming gang can also urge cross party consensus on this issue rather than the game playing and misinformation we have see over the past week the home secretary the safeguarding minister and have all be consistent in say that we should put the victim at the heart of everything we do my constituent in rochdale know that this issue be too important for political point scoring and we should put victim at the heart of everything we do that be not just for the victim of the past but for the victim of the present thank my hon friend for his question know this be an area on which he do lot of work he be right that the purpose of national audit by baroness casey be to identify the scale and look properly at the characteristic of these appalling crime right across the country and then to make further recommendation about further work and further investigation that may be need anyone who have work with baroness casey will know how independent and determine she will always be my hon friend be also right that this must still be about victim and survivor and crucially protect they for the future because we still do not have strong enough standard and strong enough protection in place unless those change be make we will continue to let child and young people down thank the home secretary for her statement and for the step the government be take to address this serious issue appreciate that the timetable for the implementation of the iicsa recommendation can not be immediately share but wait until easter mean there be big period when we need to take some action will she explain what immediate step the government be take to ensure that all allege victim who come forward be treat take seriously and listen to and that immediate action be take to address their allegation so as to serve justice and protect these child can assure the hon member that we be already take forward some of the recommendation some will be in legislation and will take time to pass through parliament because legislation also need to change we be also take immediate action to change the victim right to review so that if victim have be to the police or to local authority this include parent who have be worried about their child and they feel that nothing be be do they will have right to review that will be an independent right to review not just to go back to the same police force or the same crown prosecution service but to go to an independent panel on child sexual abuse to get that independent look so that we can get more case reopen and get urgent action take which be what we need to keep child safe welcome this action from government who see violence against woman and girl as the national emergency that it be with prime minister home secretary and safeguarding minister with record of take action to deliver for victim like and many in my constituency give birth as result of groom be story that far too many of we share there be so many reason why child and the woman that they grow into do not speak out want to share one particular story today it be about the victim who tell that the perpetrator have threaten that if she speak out he will have access to her child which be something he have not do so far that mean she have to work so hard to hide his crime in order to protect herself and her baby will the home secretary meet and other victim to discuss change the law in order to protect child bear of rape thank my hon friend for that incredibly important point and also for the shocking and disturbing story she have tell of victim continue to be silence have already be through the most traumatic experience they be then continue to be silence to protect the child even though what actually need to happen be for perpetrator to be hold to account and to face the full force of the law she be right that we need to ensure that family court can not be use by abuser and rapist to persecute victim will happily meet my hon friend and know that the safeguarding minister will too this issue be also be take forward by the ministry of justice the house should be generous towards the home secretary as she have travel long way since last week by recognise that there be requirement for far more inquiry into the town affect and we should thank she for that however one crucial thing still lack from her statement today be whether these new inquiry will have the power to summon witness and require the production of paper only the home secretary or secretary of state or minister can set up statutory inquiry in fact the minister specify an inquiry could set the term of reference decide whether it should concentrate on certain town set the timeframe and set the budget she could appoint as many people as she want to the panel so that different part of the inquiry could run in different part of the country concurrently be she really rule out that any of these inquiry should be statutory inquiry victim have the real freedom to speak out only in this parliament as we have just movingly hear or in statutory inquiry where they be legally immune from consequence for anything they say why can not she provide the victim with those protection the strong protection for victim continue to be through police investigation and of course the police have full power to pursue investigation wheresoever they may be find series of local inquiry have be hold in different way the inspector investigation into rotherham where baroness casey be the lead inspector do have power to get to the truth whereas the telford inquiry do not have those power but still manage to uncover serious problem and make serious recommendation there be different way in which to do this we have make it clear that we want to strengthen accountability power and the ability to ensure that answer be give to local area and that be alongside the work we already have under way as part of the hillsborough law on the duty of candour that we need to implement across the board thank the home secretary for the really important step that she have announce today nothing must come in the way of victim get justice or be listen to or of we learn all that we can about how we protect future victim if lesson come out of the individual local inquiry repeat across the country that would enable we to well protect victim in the future how will we co ordinate that turn to the previous question will she explain why she believe that the statutory footing be not the right way to go and that the localise way will ensure that we get to the truth my hon friend be right that we need to ensure proper follow up where there be recommendation there have be over different recommendation predominantly around child sexual exploitation with many more around child sexual abuse much more widely there be currently not proper process to be able to follow they up that be one of the reason why the independent inquiry talk about strengthen child protection arrangement through for example child protection authority and have strong arrangement in that way it be also one of the reason why we have say that we need new performance framework for police to be able to have proper follow up obviously we have already have statutory seven year inquiry into child sexual abuse and statutory two year investigation into child sexual exploitation and groom gang those report come out with really important recommendation but one of the thing that they identify be that there simply be not enough evidence or datum on the gang in particular to be able to do further work and further investigation that be why the next step must be to have the rapid national audit that we have ask baroness casey to undertake to get much more extensive assessment of the prevalence and nature of child sexual exploitation across the country the right hon lady will know that would not for one moment question her integrity and certainly not her intent however be perplex by the methodology baroness casey have one or two other thing on her plate at the moment but if she be able to deliver this audit in three month that can only be good thing in her statement she say that tom crowther have agree to work with the government to develop new framework for victim centre locally lead inquiry where they be need five pilot scheme that in itself will take time and it be kick the can down the road we all know that the select committees of this house can take evidence generate report and publish it in short order it do not have to take seven year it can take less than seven month have hear everything that the right hon lady have say can not for the life of understand why she be so resistant first to broad base national inquiry rather than narrow five town inquiry and secondly to statutory measure that will allow that inquiry to compel witness and evidence as the right hon gentleman know the importance of any independent inquiry be the independence of the decision make by the chair about how it should be pursue the inquiry lead by baroness jay into child sexual abuse take seven year that be decision make independently by baroness jay and the panel they take evidence from victim right across the country they pursue detailed investigation in different area include into church religious organisation residential home and school the inquiry into child sexual exploitation and groom gang on our street take two year first we want rapid audit that fill the gap that be leave by the independent inquiry such as on the scale and characteristic of child sexual exploitation across the country that work will rightly be do by baroness casey secondly we want more police investigation under way include the victim right to review thirdly we want tom crowther to be able to work with other area where there be local failing and problem to pursue successful local inquiry such as telford to get to the heart of local failure and make sure that there be accountability remain shocked that only two mp step up and attend and participate in the alexis jay five year inquiry into child sex abuse my hon friend the member for rotherham sarah champion and lord mann when he be the bassetlaw mp as its new mp it be my duty and responsibility to carry on that fight for justice where grooming gang have be operate whether they be white pakistani origin or church gang or take place behind the closed door of private home the bright light of an inquiry will expose who they be where the cover up be and who be responsible every single perpetrator should be hunt down and jail have no time for the grandstander or the people who turn blind eye this be the big challenge of our parliament find it stunning that the shadow justice secretary the right hon member for newark robert jenrick be not in his place for this critical statement inquiry in area where the gang operate will give sick and evil perpetrator no place to hide national oversight for government be essential ensure swift legal action and the mapping of gang their link and their co ordination when and where they be ferry girl across county line do the home secretary agree that we need to end this tyranny of child abuse and put word into action agree these terrible crime have be ignore for too long there be currently major police operation under way on child sexual exploitation and gang grooming across different police force the independent inquiry identify that child sexual exploitation happen across all police force area and all community all area should ensure that they have the proper system in place to follow up on what be happen to miss child such as the vulnerable kid who stay out overnight or those who go miss from residential care home too often that be still not happen and too often we still get report even though those be basic thing that all police force and local authority should be do that be why we have strengthen the power for victim to get review and that be why we be require police force to look back at historical case because we know that case be not be report and not be investigate that be where the fast action need to be to go after the perpetrator who be still on our street and still get away with it they will continue to do so unless police force and local council work together to put perpetrator behind bar refer the house to the register of members financial interests and particularly to the fact that be director of whistleblowersuk not for profit organisation be the last remain mp of the seven members of the house of commons who originally call on theresa may to hold an independent inquiry into child sexual abuse my experience be also on the record therefore particularly welcome the acceptance of professor alexis jay recommendation and baroness louise casey rapid review into child sexual exploitation may however draw the home secretary attention to my concern about police investigation she have refer to the matter of the national police chiefs council and to reopen case but be concern about people mark their own homework and we know that there be an institutional resistance to be find lacking and to deep scrutiny one of the primary whistleblower with whom be involve have wait year for the truth to out and senior police officer have threaten to sue she it would appear that complaint can only be make about junior officer who be call and investigate and that there be no ability to complain about senior officer ask the home secretary to look at the independent police complaints commission and the independent office for police conduct report whether they have be publish or not particularly where they have not be publish and where there have be threat as understand it from the police to sue member of those organisation about their finding it be incredibly serious that we have organisation such as the ipcc and the iopc order call the home secretary be happy to follow up with the hon lady about the very serious issue she raise she be right that this can not be about institution just mark their own homework that be one of the reason why we have make the right to review an independent one for child sexual abuse case where victim feel that they have be let down by police force or the crown prosecution service they should be able to take that right to review not back to the same police force but to an independent child sexual abuse panel to get right to review in order to see whether they can get their case reopen and properly investigate and see perpetrator pursue the hon lady will also know that there be other route to hold police force to account include the police inspectorate although it can currently make recommendation for example it have just find serious failing in cleveland police response to child sexual exploitation too often those recommendation be not follow up because there be no power to do so that be why we will also be change the police performance management framework to strengthen the ability of the inspectorate and the home office to ensure that action be take to improve performance and implement recommendation for improvement where serious problem be find be happy to talk to the hon lady about the wide policing reform need to make sure there be accountability welcome the statement from the home secretary pay tribute to my hon friend the member for bolsover natalie fleet who be not in her place for share her story know it be very difficult to do and for her continued work to support victim it be really important that we finally act for victim and survivor and welcome that the home secretary will be act on the inquiry recommendation urge she to make public the monitoring of the progress of those action and to return to the house to provide regular update on those action my hon friend be right we will need process to keep the house up to date on the next step and action that be take forward we will do that through the victim and survivor panel that will be establish by the safeguarding minister my hon friend the member for birmingham yardley jess phillips and through regular update on the work of the cross departmental group of ministers to pursue and take forward the recommendation welcome today announcement it be great to see some progress will not cover what have be say about the legal power but be interested in the funding when lead commission in plymouth the money to pay for it come from the local authority in year budget appreciate the million in total that have be announce however the home secretary have talk lot about the police what additional funding will they receive to do this work on local level what additional funding will there be for the practicality of hold these inquiry outside the five initial local authority what funding will come forward for the intervention that might be recommend follow the inquiry we know that local authority be incredibly cash strapped and this could potentially disincentivise they to follow through on these local inquiry finally be that million new money go into the violence against woman and girl budget or be it money that would have be spend elsewhere on the funding to support the various measure we be take forward we have identify up to million for additional investment to support further action however can not stress enough that this have to be part of the mainstream work that agency police force and local council do because tackle child sexual exploitation and abuse can not just be an add on it can not be something that be do only if there be particular announcement from the government it have to be do as part of the core responsibility of police force and local council and include in their funding that be why we want our mission to halve violence against woman and girl to be the central mission right across agency and right across the government as well appreciate that this be very sensitive subject but if the question be long and the answer be just as long we will get very few people in chris murray show we how it be do thank you madam deputy speaker in her report alexis jay note that one in boy and one in six girl in the united kingdom be estimate to be victim of sexual abuse we have have scandal after scandal of groom in care home council school and church for decade welcome the appointment of baroness casey on the rapid review into grooming and welcome that it will be rapid because these victim deserve justice it be unbelievable to my mind that groom be not an aggravate factor in the sentencing of child sexual offender will the home secretary restate her commitment to make it an aggravating factor and commit to that be do quickly and by force so that child sexual offender be properly punish by the law my hon friend be right the inquiry identify that half million child be victim of sexual abuse every year the majority of case be sadly within the family betrayal by those from whom child should be able to expect protection however as he say there have also be huge betrayal in residential home and other institution include faith institution the church of england and the catholic church as well as wider groom online and on the street as part of these terrible crime so yes we will change the law strengthen sentencing and make groom an aggravate factor because the punishment should fit this terrible crime there be much to welcome in the home secretary statement but she have resist six invitation from hon member to confirm that the government support local inquiry will have statutory power instead she be rely on the duty of candour responsibility and accountability so let try it different way be the home secretary certain that the duty of candour responsibility and accountability be equivalent to statutory power what we need to do be to ensure that the crime be investigate and that there be proper follow up in those area where thing have go badly wrong and we know that there be some area where thing have go badly wrong the first stage have to be for the police to have full power to pursue these crime and to follow wherever the evidence take they in order to put perpetrator behind bar frankly that be where they should be to protect child and keep they safe we also need to ensure that where thing have go wrong there be sufficient power to be able to get to the truth and sufficient ability for local organisation to do that so that no one can hide from accountability run away or obfuscate or use bureaucracy to get away with provide the answer the justice and the accountability that victim need that be why we have set up new programme of work to look at how we can strengthen the power available and the accountability available part of that have to be the duty of candour it also have to include the duty to report because there have to be strong responsibility on people to report child abuse in the first place and we have to make it criminal offence to cover it up if the law be not strong enough we will not get the accountability or the action encourage opposition members to heed the appeal from the hon member for eastbourne josh babarinde to stop score party political point on such an important and sensitive subject welcome the home secretary announcement in particular the government commitment to take action to protect victim and secure justice by accelerate investigation and prosecution can the home secretary confirm that the support be there so that police force such as west yorkshire have the resource they need to investigate and prosecute the perpetrator of these horrible crime we have increase the resource for police force across the country by up to billion next year it be really important that all police force see these kind of crime against some of the most vulnerable people in society as part of the core work that they must do on public protection and keep people safe start by pay tribute to my hon friend the member for keighley and ilkley robbie moore for his persistent campaign to get an inquiry into keighley and bradford scotland be not immune from groom gang indeed survivor expert fear that groom gang be operate in every town and city in scotland what discussion have the home secretary have with the scottish government to ensure there be unified and co ordinate approach across the united kingdom lastly just to add my voice to those of other in the chamber why on earth can the inquiry not be back by statute the inquiries act give all the accountability and assurance that victim and community need to ensure process be follow properly the hon gentleman be right to talk about the child sexual exploitation and abuse that take place in every corner of the united kingdom obviously on the issue that involve police force the home office have responsibility for the police force in england and wales therefore some of the change we be make around the review panel and around performance management and proper datum in these area will apply to england and wales police force however we be also work with the national police chiefs council which as he will know work very closely with police scotland to ensure there be national approach would also say that we have the nationwide inquiry into both child sexual abuse more widely and child sexual exploitation it be really important that we fill the gap in the evidence and that we take forward those recommendation alongside support those area where there have be particular problem to get to the truth welcome today news that baroness casey will conduct rapid review of the scale and nature of groom gang offence have serve as deputy police and crime commissioner on the frontline in lancashire know that much exploitation and abuse go unreported and unidentified in town such as blackpool and that the figure be significant underestimate what will the government do to ensure that system be in place that enable these crime to be report and command the confidence of victim and survivor my hon friend be right to say that it should be easy to report crime but also think there should be proactive duty on police force local authority and child protection authority to pursue the evidence of where these crime be take place even when they be not be report if kid be go miss from home and particularly from residential care home they may not be report crime partly because they be be groom and exploit as well as make it easy for victim to come forward and disclose the terrible thing that have happen to they we should ensure that those authority have responsibility to pursue crime wherever they be find be usually measure when come here but it worry that the labour government seem to be play we for fool today the home secretary have pick five out of town and provide no statutory power she have announce review by the incredibly able baroness casey but baroness casey be already conduct review of social care and this review be not review it be an audit be not the truth that the good member on the other side of the house go back to their constituency and there be many across the country and recognise the strength of feeling among the public about the need for national inquiry member on this side of the chamber get it and most of the back benchers on the home secretary side get it why do she not swallow her pride and launch national inquiry let just say that be one of those who call for the independent inquiry into child sexual abuse very many year ago and that also support the two year investigation by that independent inquiry into child sexual exploitation as well as some of its other investigation however we also have responsibility to act when more than recommendation from inquiry be just sit there with dust gathering on they we have to ensure that we get action include the audit that we need from baroness casey who will be proceed with that for three month before the commission on social care get go it be also important for we to have strong police investigation because if the police investigation do not happen no one will get the protection they need and for tom crowther to work with the first local area that want to take forward local inquiry in order to develop model and programme that can be use in other area wherever it be need child sexual exploitation be without shadow of doubt the most disgusting degrade crime imaginable and we must at all time have the victim at the forefront of our mind when conservative member table amendment to important legislation that they know will not result in an inquiry but will block child protection measure and then spend the subsequent day spread misinformation they be let victim down welcome the national audit of groom gang and welcome the reopening of the police investigation to ensure that criminal be bring to justice but may check one point with the home secretary she say number of time that the five local area she have identify be initial pilot area be it the ambition that wherever these crime be take place local inquiry can take place my hon friend be exactly right wherever there be serious problem or failing and it be believe that local inquiry be need we want those area to be able to conduct the kind of effective local inquiry that telford be able to conduct rather than have to start from scratch tom crowther will work with five area so that he can draw up conclusion about how we can most effectively learn the lesson of what happen in telford where victim and survivor feel support and also feel that they deliver change that thing have actually happen as result rather than have inquiry whose recommendation just sit on shelf let everyone down as well as withhold court transcript have be push the ministry of justice for datum on the following how many pakistani or other foreign rapist have be deport be still in prison do not serve custodial sentence be back in the same community as their victim have previous conviction or have reoffende with full nationality breakdown of those involve in the gang the response be that the request information be not centrally identify in the data system relevant to these question if this be state inquiry into the private sector it would be accuse of negligence my view be that we need full national inquiry this be rotting stain on our country and it need to be exorcise in full it can not continue to be kick into the long grass the british public want transparency and they want to know why this have take so long to be deal with we do believe that well more comprehensive datum need to be collect that be why have say that the overall datum on child sexual abuse need to be overhaul with immediate change to the gathering of datum on ethnicity of both perpetrator and victim because the system we inherit from the previous government simply be not strong enough we will need further change as well on the issue of foreign national offender where foreign citizen have commit sexual offence in this country they have no right to stay in this country and we have to increase return that be why rightly this government have increase return of foreign national offender by over since the election welcome the announcement the home secretary have make today disclose abuse be very difficult thing to do many victim speak out but too often their word be not hear they be not take seriously or they fall between multiple agency will the secretary of state investigate how we can assist victim to disclose in the first place and ensure that agency act on those disclosure my hon friend be right to make that important point by establish victim and survivor panel to work with the safeguarding minister and other ministers on take forward recommendation around sexual abuse we want to make sure we be recognise those experience and exactly how difficult it can be to come forward people need to have the confidence that if they do come forward to do something incredibly difficult they will be listen to they will be take seriously and investigation will follow thank the secretary of state for her in depth explanation of what the government be and will be do to ensure the safety of our child in the face of the most heinous crime since the vote on the amendment to the children wellbeing and schools bill last week and the subsequent attention that it attract in the medium many of my constituent have write to upset angry and in fear over the grooming scandal all the correspondence have receive demand public inquiry into this scandal to determine the failure both historical and present of the institution involve that allow these heinous crime against vulnerable child to go on for so long and so widely without be stop and without the victim be safeguard and protect sufficiently finish by ask the home secretary to confirm whether in northern town like my blackburn constituency crime of this specific nature and grooming gang continue to haunt our street and vulnerable child can she confirm that further public inquiry and report be need to find out why this have go on for such long time we need to provide my constituent and everybody across the country with solace the independent inquiry into child sexual abuse and the two year inquiry into child sexual exploitation conclude that child sexual exploitation be happen right across the country and that action be need across the country the taskforce report that there be currently major police operation under way on child sexual exploitation and gang groom across police force that be why it be so important that recommendation from those inquiry be implement and that we get action to protect child and young people who too often be let down when inquiry recommendation be ignore rise order need member to work with so that we can get in the final question otherwise there will be lot of disappointment if member have not be here and bob throughout there be no point in they try to catch my eye now welcome the home secretary statement which be full of action be pleased that last week support the children wellbeing and schools bill so that we can start implement much need safeguard measure unlike some conservative members who attempt to wreck the bill and spread misinformation which lead to online abuse towards many member do the home secretary share my concern about the most rapidly evolve form of child sexual abuse take place online include through artificial intelligence facilitate child sexual abuse material can she outline what plan the government have to strengthen the law in this area my hon friend be exactly right in addition to the measure in the children wellbeing and schools bill include on the proper identification of child to strengthen child protection which be crucial we need much strong measure to tackle online abuse and exploitation be really worried about the pace at which this problem be escalate about the fact that it involve online grooming abuse and indecent image and about the impact of draw young people into contact abuse we will bring forward new law in this area can my right hon friend confirm that the new victim and survivor panel will have representation from region across the country to ensure that victim voice be hear loud and clear do she agree that we need to dial down the political opportunism that we have sadly see from some member on the opposition benches yes the victim and survivor panel will include people from right across the country the inquiry into child sexual abuse have cross party support and really hope that there will be cross party support for implement the action that we need which have set out today as my hon friend the member for rugby john slinger point out the victim and survivor panel really need countrywide representation give that be welsh mp can the secretary of state confirm that welsh voice will be hear loud and clear we will ensure that welsh voice be hear loud and clear many of my constituent have contact to share their concern about child abuse and child exploitation they will be relieve that unlike the previous government this government be no long allow this matter to be kick into the long grass and be take action not least through baroness casey rapid review think my constituent will be concern that the official figure woefully underestimate the scale and nature of groom activity how can the home secretary reassure the house and my constituent that in future the reporting system will be such that they can guarantee the confidence of victim and survivor my hon friend be right some of this be about give victim and survivor the confidence to come forward and report abuse some of it be about get agency and organisation to take seriously the risk factor so that they identify potential crime and pursue they and some of it be about make sure that we have much strong datum requirement on police force and local authority so that we collect information and datum that be the first recommendation of the independent inquiry and we be take it forward it have not be take forward for far too long be grateful to the secretary of state for her statement there be victim and survivor in many community include in my constituency and welcome the step that she have announce commend the contribution from my hon friend the member for bolsover natalie fleet and the hon member for eastbourne josh babarinde do the home secretary agree that the voice that matter when we discuss how we tackle these issue be not those of billionaire politician or talk show host seek to weaponise the pain and suffering of victim and survivor above all we should be listen to victim and survivor themselves my hon friend be right we need to make sure that victim and survivor be at the heart of this issue seven thousand victim and survivor give evidence to the independent inquiry which be really hard thing to do we owe it to they to make sure there be action as result of their testimony rather than just leave the inquiry to sit on shelf number of constituent have contact on this serious issue and have make it clear that would welcome any further inquiry that be able to command the support of expert and victim and to build on the recommendation of the jay report rather than choose to ignore they or delay action will my right hon friend confirm that that be exactly what she set before the house this afternoon do she believe as do that on this basis these measure should command support from across the house hope these measure command cross party support because ultimately we need strong action from the police and local authority from across government and from across community to do the thing that for more than year we have be tell need to change and yet for too long simply have not change that be why we urgently need this action to keep child safe welcome the home secretary statement on the action she will take to implement professor alexis jay recommendation professor jay make another set of recommendation on which my constituent have be campaign those on safeguarding in the church of england professor jay call for an independent process for the oversight and operation of safeguarding in the church the synod be discuss this next month but do the home secretary agree that measure must be bring forward to be approve by the house without delay my hon friend be right to point out that there be many further inquiry as part of the overarch national inquiry into child abuse include on church and faith organisation some of the recommendation be for those organisation to take forward they need to ensure that they do that they be respond and that they have strong enough child protection arrangement in place we will be monitor and look at the recommendation of all those report thank the home secretary for her answer which have clarify number of the question would have want to raise with she be also grateful for her victim centre approach one of the challenge be that when child be be groom for sexual exploitation they do not always know that they be victim until they be an adult live haunt by the past what more can be do to help child recognise what be happen in their life welcome my hon friend important point part of our wide work on tackle violence against woman and girl be to ensure that child and young people have the confidence to be able to recognise abuse and exploitation know the education secretary take this immensely seriously and be look at how to take it forward child sexual exploitation be vile crime that violate the trust safety and dignity of child perpetrator of such despicable crime individual or group no matter their race religion or creed must face the full force of the law commend the home secretary for her statement and the step it set out especially on victim right to review so many victim feel that the authority have neglect their position can the home secretary please give timetable even an estimate for the duty of candour be sure she know that justice delay be justice deny work be under way on draw up the hillsborough law which be part of the king speech to be take forward as priority in this session that work be be do across the cabinet office with ministry of justice support and it be part of the wide work on make sure there can be proper accountability where thing fail and where people be let down alongside both the duty of candour and the duty to report well do to everyone who keep their question short we get everybody in thank the home secretary backbench business medicines and healthcare products regulatory agency beg to move that this house note that the medicines and healthcare product regulatory agency mhra continue to need substantial reform as recognise by the independent medicines and medical devices safety review immds with patient safety concern persist and exacerbating since the review publication in believe that the mhra expert working group report on primodos be deeply flawed with immds later conclude the drug have cause avoidable harm further note that the yellow card system for report suspect adverse drug reaction be fail with no process for follow up on serious or fatal reaction and conflict of interest with of the mhra funding be derive from industry fee concern raise in the fourth report of session of the health committee the influence of the pharmaceutical industry hc publish on april also note the mhra delay response to report of myocarditis pericarditis and vaccine induce thrombotic thrombocytopaenia follow vaccination despite action from regulator in other country and call on the government to fully implement the recommendation in the immds review and to acknowledge the harm do to patient and the financial burden on the healthcare system as result of the mhra widespread regulatory failure thank the backbench business committee for grant this debate and the many colleague from across the house who support my application for it especially the hon member for blackley and middleton south graham stringer and also the hon member for bolton south and walkden yasmin qureshi and for great yarmouth rupert lowe the medicines and healthcare product regulatory agency be the body responsible for ensure the safety and efficacy of medicine use in the uk its job be to oversee medical product medicine medical device and blood component for transfusion the responsibility it have be extremely important as it come with the potential not only to change people live for the well but to cause serious harm even death if poor decision be make or safety signal be miss the mhra be require to scrutinise application from the pharmaceutical company for new product and device and to remain ever vigilant over exist drug should safety problem arise post authorisation it have to weigh up the argument for and against these product and device after all the company try to get these product on to the market and to keep they there be drive as all industry be by commercial success it be up to the mhra to balance that with the health and safety of the uk and the public alarm bell rang for many of we when in march dame june raine the chief executive of the mhra boast of the agency transition from watchdog to enabler twenty year ago the health committee report the influence of the pharmaceutical industry find that the mhra be unusual in be one of the few european agency fund entirely by fee derive from service to industry not much have change since with the mhra continue to get of its funding from the pharmaceutical industry in this context the agency transition from watchdog to enabler do little to quell suspicion of conflict and the implication that have for patient safety one of the most worrying issue be the mhra mismanagement of the yellow card system establish in the system be way for patient relative and healthcare professional to report suspect adverse reaction to drug or medical device the reporting scheme should be valuable source of information about possible harm and act as an early warning system but there be gross under report to it as the immds review put it the system be too complex and too diffuse to allow early signal detection under reporting be big problem because it make it difficult to spot safety signal and assign causation that then translate into unnecessary harm or death with devastating side effect from treatment go unnoticed for year month or even decade that be recognise by the immds review lead by baroness cumberlege in the case of primodos sodium valproate and surgical mess mean to say mesh though perhaps the word should have be mess accord to research from bangor university in potentially avoidable adverse drug reaction cost the nhs billion year in hospital admission in the mhra estimate that only of serious reaction and between and of non serious reaction be report more recently it have claim that report rate for covid vaccine be well due to high public awareness but it have not be able to point to publish evidence to back up that claim the yellow card be currently voluntary scheme that doctor and member of the public can report to but echo call from the sling the mesh campaign and other for the uk to follow the example of denmark and sweden by make it mandatory for all healthcare professional to report suspect adverse reaction let turn to the mhra failure to act promptly on evidence of adverse reaction we have see that historically for example sodium valproate be know to cause harm to unborn baby in the yet the mhra do not establish valproate pregnancy prevention plan until the known harm to unborn baby be allow to persist for over year more recently in the mhra react slowly to strong signal that there be serious problem with the astrazeneca vaccine cause an autoimmune condition call vaccine induce thrombotic thrombocytopenia denmark and other european country suspend the vaccine for all age group on march the mhra by contrast only start to restrict the vaccine in some age group nearly two month later on may yet there be signal in the yellow card report as early as february how many people be needlessly expose to risk my right hon friend hit on an important point what action do the mhra take to apologise for or explain its failure to give adequate and timely warning to potential patient do not believe that the mhra have take such action we be probably still wait for it hopefully that will come out people be also either not get compensation quickly enough or not receive compensation that be commensurate with the illness and damage cause to they it be worth note what happen when the daily telegraph report on the potential causal link between the astrazeneca vaccine and blood clot in march the journalist who write the story receive threatening call from the mhra warning that the telegraph would be ban from future briefing and press notice if it do not soften the news an extremely defensive approach for an agency whose no strategic objective be to maintain public trust through transparency and proactive communication do that sound like an agency that be do its good to maintain public trust let alone patient safety it be clear that the system do not work we have good evidence that suspect adverse reaction be under report but what about the one that be report we know from freedom of information request that the mhra do not have process for investigate and follow up individual yellow card report we know that the retrieval of follow up information from the yellow card database still require manual extraction and that only of death report as possibly link to exposure to one of the vaccine be follow up by the mhra that be extremely worrying or as matt hancock infamously describe it in whatsapp message shonky the chief medical officer chris whitty reply to that message by say that the system need to get well another long stand problem with the mhra be its lack of transparency take foi to the agency as an example between and only of request be successful in be answer outside the work day statutory response time culture of delay and secrecy have emerge and mhra behaviour around the commission on human medicines meeting for the vaccine benefit risk expert working group show that beyond any doubt minute of the meeting be publish just last month four year after they take place why the delay they be stuff full of redaction that leave we with many more question than answer particularly as to why the new vaccine be continually describe as safe and effective in the meeting on november the expert work group ask if pfizer be require to respond to the question ask by mhra in response the mhra confirm that there be no formal obligation to reply why be there no formal obligation to reply surely it be essential when make such an important decision as to whether to allow new vaccine to be roll out to the nation to have those reply the minute do not specify the question indeed they do not appear to have be mention again ask write question last week to see whether in the spirit of openness and transparency the mhra would publish those question and any answer receive from pfizer the response be that the mhra do not intend to publish those question or any subsequent response why not be this not matter of public interest those issue be not resolve before the mhra give the green light to start the vaccination of the nation particularly worrying be the issue of lymphopenia where blood do not have enough white blood cell which be report in phase of the trial and then go away not because they fix the problem but because testing for the condition be not conduct in phase or in summary the failure to act on the weakness of the mhra will lead only to more harm and further damage to the public trust in the pharmaceutical agency and those task with regulate it my hope be that the debate will help bring those wide range issue far to light and focus the minister mind on find solution will end on the word of dr tom jefferson of the university of oxford you can not support both secrecy and vaccination request datum be not sign of be against drug or vaccine it show that you favour transparency those who try to keep datum confidential and criticise those who ask for evidence be anti an evidence base approach how can you have inform consent if you do not know precisely what be happen on that point do my right hon friend accept that one of the consequence of the lack of transparency have be public distrust of vaccine which be spread rapidly as consequence for example there be less take up of mmr vaccine than there should be and use to be and that be because of lack of trust in the system my hon friend make good point if people lose trust in vaccine the pharmaceutical industry and the regulatory agency that be precisely what happen we know that these vaccine be essential to many people so we do not want that happen we want to ensure that new vaccine and medicine come into use be thoroughly test and that along the way we keep an overall watch on whether they be work correctly it be pleasure to follow the right hon member for tatton esther mcvey agree with every word she say it be late in the day for thursday so will try not to repeat many of the piece of evidence and argument that she propose but they be all valuable contribution to this debate will start by talk about the attitude of member of parliament and politician to regulation in general long time ago have responsibility in the cabinet office for deal with well regulation travel around the country to look at business that complain about regulation and see how those regulation could be make well that be month of my life that will never get back come to number of conclusion after that politician have knee jerk reaction when it come to regulation if child die if there be fire or if there be another disaster of some sort there be cry from both side of the house for more regulation not necessarily well regulation and enforcement but more regulation when in many case regulation be already there but inspection and enforcement have not take place the other knee jerk response which my government be give at the moment be to say regulation be burdensome so we will try to get rid of some of they do not think that either of those response deal with the issue we set up regulator this afternoon we be talk about the mhra but by and large once they be set up mp and ministers abdicate responsibility and do not consider they until there be crisis when have that responsibility go to see the european medicines agency this be some time before we leave the eu one of the surprising thing find or maybe it be not so surprising be that be the only minister who have be anywhere near the place it be the major european agency that this country get after the maastricht treaty it have wide range and important power to deal both with the market and with regulation but nobody bother with it if there have be crisis however ministers and shadow ministers would have be queue up to go there if there be lesson particularly in relation to the mhra it be that we should look at regulator be they water medicine or other regulator all the time we can not as government and mps abdicate our responsibility because we then come to crisis and the electorate say well what be you do and the answer be not lot we have pass that on those water regulator or medical regulator might be as the right hon lady show pretty useless we should be look at they all the time be member of the science and technology committee in partly because of that experience and partly because there be lot of press discussion and debate about metal hip that be squeak and not work very well when they have be implant and about breast implant that be fall apart potentially damaging and poison the recipient we have an inquiry that report in october of that year will read out some of the comment from the witness we hear from about the mhra because they be be repeat now they be very similar to what the right hon member for tatton say about the mhra response secretive and slow for instance there be evidence that there be problem with metal hip for four year before the mhra take any action whatsoever nearly year later it still have the same problem ask dr heneghan from the centre for evidence base medicine at the university of oxford who have authorise those metal hip his answer be extraordinary nobody know do know nobody know it be different regulatory regime then because we be part of the european union anybody who have the competence or at least the authority in any country in the eu could give authorisation but nobody know which body have do it and whether that body be compose of competent people and what evidence they have use to do so however when the mhra find out it do nothing for four year that be disgraceful and there be all sort of comment that can give the house one be from dr stephen at the institute of physics and engineering who say that the mhra be overly bureaucratic relative to other competent body inefficient and difficult to deal with as the right hon member for tatton show the mhra do not answer foi request and it do not tell we what be go on the lancet say about the breast implant which will talk about next that the mhra be in paralysis and in need of reform again that be long time ago it be different issue with the breast implant because the mhra be deal with fraudulent product the product that have be authorise be not the product that be be sell to surgeon to be implant in woman however the committee ask for there to be random and regular testing of the body that be responsible for manufacture those implant do not expect the minister to know at this time but will she check whether the authority have do any of those randomised test on those body that be the history the right hon member for tatton have basically analyse what be go on now but will just talk about what we learn during the covid period we learn that many of the nhs constituent part although not the clinician be secretive early today in the chamber we talk about the government response to the first part of the covid inquiry at the present time that inquiry be not get to part of what go wrong during covid which be the fact that the nhs do not tell we what be go on and there be also restriction on political debate if we be to get the good policy in any crisis and in the regular turn of event outside crisis we need transparency so that we know how thing can be improve and what we can criticise the right hon lady make the excellent point that keep thing secret encourage people who do not trust vaccine and have odd theory about how society be control not to take the protection from vaccine we know that no medicine be safe and there be no point in pretend they be safe but vaccine have save many life over decade more than decade over century and it be good for society and for individual that people understand that and they will be less trusting if we do not tell they what be go on as recently as few minute ago get an email tell that the uk health security agency be still refuse to release the cost of the bird flu vaccine it have purchase what possible reason can there be for not say how much public money have be spend on good cause have vaccine ready for any flu epidemic be good thing because it save people life as we have be discuss why should it be keep secret could the minister to respond to that be there any member in the house who think that turn the mhra in the right hon lady phrase from watchdog to an enabler be good idea or even know what it mean and what be be enable certainly do not know what be be enable but one of the thing we should remember be that the mhra and the whole of the health industry be swim in sea of pharmaceutical shark pharmaceutical company produce some extraordinarily wonderful product that keep we safe but they also produce huge profit and sometimes they get their product on to the market by tell lie or certainly by sin of omission everybody know about the thalidomide case and how long it take to prove it and to get compensation for the victim almost at random have pick two other case with paroxetine think that be how to pronounce it gsk hold back information because it do not release the test that do not show positive benefit it also keep back test that show that paroxetine increase the chance of child commit suicide and it take lot of investigation to get that order mr stringer assume you be come to conclusion soon be have one sentence be sorry do not realise have speak for so long lastly reboxetine be another example of where the information give out to doctor be inadequate because it do not show the negative test use those two example basically to show that the mhra should not be enable these thing it should be much more vigilant and it should be ask for power to demand the right to know all the information that drug company have before it say those drug be as safe as they can be rise order to enable we to get everyone in hope all member will be mindful of those who be to speak after they shall try to be brief madam deputy speaker follow the hon member for blackley and middleton south graham stringer by refer to quote from hayek book the road to serfdom do not claim credit for identify it myself it be quote in the other place by lord hannan of kingsclere on january in the context of the football governance bill he be talk about the growth of the administrative state about which the hon gentleman be speak at the beginning of his speech hayek say the delegation of particular task to separate body while regular feature be yet only the first step in the process by which democracy relinquish its power that be in chapter of the road to serfdom from so not much have change the mhra be an example of what happen if we in this house transfer responsibility to unelected and unaccountable organisation it so happen that on the order paper for tomorrow be my vaccine damage bill which be sponsor by former attorney general that bill call for an independent review of vaccine damage it call on the secretary of state to appoint current or former high court judge to lead an independent review of disablement cause by vaccination administer in the united kingdom and the adequacy of the compensation offer to person so disabled we know that more than people have already be tell by the agency responsible at the department of health and social care that they have suffer disability as result of vaccine large number of they where the disability be in excess of have be award wholly derisory payment of each my bill go on the review must consider the rate and extent of disablement cause by each type of vaccination offer in the united kingdom relevant to this debate the review must also consider the effectiveness of medicines and healthcare product regulatory agency monitoring of such side effect and national health service and government response to such monitoring as well as the adequacy of compensation offer to person so disabled there have always be an agreement basically that if something go wrong for people who undertake vaccination voluntarily or be in receipt of other medical product if they be do the right thing by the country at large and they have an adverse reaction they will be able to look to the government or the taxpayer to pay they some recompense under the scheme to which have refer if causation be establish the trust build by that scheme have be undermine by the long denial of the previous government and to an extent the current one that any adverse reaction have be cause by the vaccine other than the most minor disablement it have also be undermine by the fact that so many people have apply for review of their case some people think more than thousand have be wait more than month for decision that show that this be low priority for the government hope that when the minister respond to the debate she will be able to explain why the government will block my bill again tomorrow if they be take this issue seriously as they should be they would be open to and supportive of the establishment of an independent review of disablement order be set five minute time limit thank the right hon member for tatton esther mcvey for secure debate on what be an incredibly important campaign in support of the reform to the mhra would like to make clear my interest as an officer of the all party parliamentary group on primodos will focus on the human case for reform would like to share part of speech deliver at recent appg meeting by jason farrell journalist who have be instrumental in communicate the campaign for some time and who powerfully put into word the experience of marie lyon and other victim he say in october in billinge maternity ward in wigan woman give birth to girl the baby be quickly rush out of sight and later bring back swaddle when marie lyon unwrap her daughter she discover half her baby arm be miss meanwhile in portsmouth shirley gubbins give birth her daughter be so damaged medic put she in cupboard assume she will be dead within minute shirley husband demand to see his child and discover the baby back be twist her face disfigure and one eye be miss when she eventually allow to see her baby shirley react in exactly the same way as marie do she beautiful she mine as relatively new mp first meet marie lyon campaigner in chief and chairwoman of the association for child damage by hormone pregnancy tests just few month ago at the request of constituent marie have meet many mp in her year campaign for recognition and justice for mother and child affect by hormone pregnancy test have not meet many campaigner like she before and have certainly never meet leader with such reserve of stamina and such profound sense of injustice speak here on the shoulder of victim family activist mps scientist and academic who have call for substantial reform of the mhra and for the government to acknowledge the harm do to patient and to implement the recommendation of the immds the harrowing story of victim of this scandal after decade of fudge obfuscation and inaction that have hinder their pursuit of justice must be hear again and again in the chamber the evidence be clear the time for talk have long pass it be time for we now to act will be as quick as can be madam deputy speaker want to talk about over prescription and the vaccine acknowledge my role as the co chair and past chair of the beyond pill all party parliamentary group which the hon member for stroud dr opher chair in this parliament thank the secretariat for the great work it do to support the group we have crisis of over prescription in our country with the rate of prescription drug be give to people go up vertiginously prescription have double over the last year nearly million people one in five adult be on antidepressant which be way too high figure many people should never have be put on these drug they should have be offer non chemical alternative and they should be support to withdraw very much hope that the mhra and the government more widely will heed the call we be make on the appg for well training of gps well labelling of these drug and withdrawal service for people who want to come off they in addition to social prescribing which be sure the hon member for stroud will talk about from his experience want to mention the important potential role of digital therapeutic which be not properly commission by the nhs but could be big part of the answer want to talk briefly about the role of the mhra in over prescription particularly with respect to anti depressant we know from evidence from anecdote and from coroner report that ssri selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor can cause people to take their own life there be dozen of document case the most prominent of those recently have be the tragic case of thomas kingston whom know and whose family have be speak to since his death tom shoot himself last february after be put on ssri in fact he be put on that ssri after another ssri cause he to feel absolutely awful so he be put on two in very quick succession the coroner for gloucestershire who conduct the inqu recommend much clear communication of the risk of these pill and she be not the first coroner to make that recommendation pay tribute to the times for its campaigning to highlight the fact that so many coroner report have not be heed by the authority wish they have be as it might well have save many life the number of people who have take their life after come off ssris show that it be not one off or rare there be many people include one of my constituent age only who take her life congratulate my hon friend on raise this issue what more can we do to raise awareness of the effect of withdrawal from these antidepressant the tragedy that we read and hear about be bring to light the chronic problem of over prescription in our society be afraid that the mhra be to blame review be under way but it do not sufficiently recognise the direct harm that these pill can induce in people hope that through well labelling and regulation and well culture of alternative prescription we can reduce the tragedy that we be so familiar with let quickly comment follow on from my hon friend the member for christchurch sir christopher chope on the experience of the mhra during the covid epidemic the vaccine be develop at frantic rate we can be very impressed by the speed of the taskforce and pay tribute to the work of the private sector particularly our world lead research base the government manage to act at great speed largely because they bypass whitehall but significant question remain which my hon friend raise about whether the vaccine be genuinely safe and effective it be right that people ask question about the datum on excess death and wonder if there be connection with the vaccine that be not inappropriate ultimately there be only one way to answer that question to have the datum however we do not have access to that datum the government hold it and extraordinarily they have make it available to the pharmaceutical company that produce the vaccine but not to researcher individual level death datum that show who be dose with what vaccine and which of they die in debate in the house last april and previously in correspondence with ministers clearly and simply ask for that datum to be make available to researcher anonymise as appropriate the uk health security agency have admit that the data exist but have refuse to release it almost unbelievably because of the risk to the mental health of the relative of the dead that beg the question do the datum show link between the vaccine and those death the information tribunal be due to rule on that matter shortly and fervently hope that common sense will prevail and the datum can be make available to disprove the link so that our mind and those of our constituent can be put at rest there be also case with the information tribunal about the datum hold by the mhra on the vaccine safety for pregnant woman again the agency have be withhold that datum for two year let finish by observe in the light of the comment make by hon member across the house that we have genuine problem with the regulation of the medical industry and of medical product very much welcome the appointment of kennedy to the role of health secretary in the united states he will shake thing up over there perhaps the minister can be our own rfk over here and bring some genuine transparency to the health system thank the right hon member for tatton esther mcvey for secure this important debate and be very happy to be call to speak on such an important issue as chair of the first do no harm all party parliamentary group be very interested in the need for mhra reform in the context of the mesh primodo and valproate scandal however for time sake will focus my remark on mhra reform and the mesh scandal in particular not least because the right hon lady open the debate so well and my hon friend the member for bolton south and walkden yasmin qureshi will speak about the primodos scandal and do not want to steal any of her thunder want to start by pay tribute to all the campaigner we have work with over so many year on the first do no harm report scandal especially kath sanson from sling the mesh marie lyon who have be mention from the primodos campaign and janet williams and emma murphy from the valproate campaign also must pay tribute to baroness cumberlege who recently retire from the other place who be the author of the independent medicine and medical device safety review and the former co chair of the first do no harm all party parliamentary group she have be great support to over the year thank to her invaluable hard work highlight key recommendation to prevent future health scandal include vital mhra reform we know what we need to do now we must get on with the job as we have hear colleague here today be in agreement that the mhra be in need of urgent and substantial reform one area in particular be the need for mandatory reporting of adverse event to the yellow card by healthcare professional contrary to response receive when ask question on the topic in the house which argue that the current system work it do not it be break let be clear the current voluntary system which doctor enjoy enable they to choose whether to log side effect and complication to the mhra yellow card be simply unacceptable this voluntary system have lead to many adverse event go unreporte the system must be make mandatory but that fix alone will not work if the data be there but be not use the information must be track and assess in real time by the mhra to spot trend of harm so that treatment can be stop immediately if need to prevent the repetition of mistake and in turn to prevent their escalation into further health scandal as we have see with mesh valproate and primodo comparison of dataset conduct by sling the mesh find that whopping two third of mesh complication some as serious as slice into bladder bowel or through vaginal wall be not log by healthcare professional to the mhra yellow card if these excruciating example be not interpret by healthcare professional as worthy of reporting what reason do we have to trust that healthcare treatment be safe we need to see the mhra at the heart of patient safety properly and efficiently regulate and recording and not just nod treatment through like tick box exercise mesh for example be allow from the onwards on the basis that it be equivalent to hernia mesh without any post market surveillance by the mhra it be allow to be aggressively sell free rein in the uk this ultimately lead to thousand of woman include my very own mam be irreversibly harm have reporting be mandatory the sheer scale of woman impact could have at least be reduce through spot clear pattern of harm and put stop to it it be clear that we need to change the current system and fast most of the scandal we be talk about today affect woman so woman voice must be take seriously we should not have to wait until medium coverage publicly sham health scandal or documentary force account ability and answer upon we the mhra need to be function and not just respond to treatment cause harm but regulate and prevent they in the first place surely this be the absolute least we should expect from regulation agency that be suppose to ensure the safety and effectiveness of patient and the medicine and medical device that they receive hence first do no harm should start by alert people to my declare interest relate to the pharmaceutical industry all of we familiar with the growth of the quango will be aware of how these unelected unaccountable organisation have come to control and dominate british public life not we the democratically elect member but the quango failure be reward and never punish no organisation encapsulate that point as comprehensively as the mhra its role be essentially to ensure that medicine and medical device be safe and effective where have we hear those word before how can it possibly be trust to regulate properly when it be fund largely by the company it be task with regulating it be simply human nature for conflict like this to impact on the decision make process the big challenge in the mhra history be the covid response and it fail it enable the big assault on civil liberty and economic prosperity in my lifetime which be lockdown the great scandal of they all it be quite simply the most disgraceful period of recent history the mhra insistence on vaccine for all enable lockdown restriction to continue for as long as they do it must take part responsibility for the consequence vast nhs backlog mental health issue rife soar alcohol relate death obesity booming child development wreck long term illness mount increase substance abuse domestic violence on the rise unnoticed child neglect father miss the birth of their child and elderly love one leave to rot and die alone we be not even allow to mourn the dead properly the wicked list be endless none of it be base on any science and certainly not the vaccination of almost the entire population include disgracefully young child this be hideous dereliction of duty by the mhra it be not just child it force the covid vaccination on but ten of million of people who have absolutely no need for it whatsoever there be clear risk from take the vaccine not just the initial two dos but the booster follow they the evidence for the vaccine be simply not there particularly consider that by that stage almost the entire population have actually catch the virus which give far more effective natural protection than any man make intervention the mhra know that but it fail to act why be it under political pressure not to undermine the wretched covid response have it be honest about the real need or lack thereof for population wide vaccination the whole case for lockdown would have collapse as of november there have be adverse reaction report from vaccine in the uk those be just the report issue what be the true number when individual after individual report feel far bad after take the vaccine than they ever do after the virus should we not question whether that vaccination be necessary the mhra fail this be simply not vaccine that be need by the entire population we be feed the lie that take the jab would protect vulnerable love one which be disgraceful dishonesty the vaccine do not prevent transmission we know that now and we know that then it should always have be fully free and informed choice if an elderly man in his believe that the virus pose more of threat than the vaccine then let he take it for almost everyone under that be risk analysis that fall firmly in the camp of not have the vaccine do even get start on the abhorrent vaccine passport policy one of the most evil policy devise by government in live memory the mhra should have provide full and transparent datum so that educate adult could make their own decision for themselves and for their family it must act as an independent barrier against both political expedience and corporate profit protect public health above all else the question be who regulate the regulator who protect against regulatory capture how do the mhra allow politician celebrity and even its own agency to describe these vaccine as safe and effective when yellow card datum clearly show it be not universally safe and certainly not universally effective how could mhra ceo june raine say she have transform the mhra from watchdog to an enabler of the pharmaceutical industry an oxymoron for watchdog that be mean to safeguard public health it be parliament duty now to exercise its sovereign power to ensure that we learn from the myriad of mistake rise we be go to have to drop the time limit to four minute call dr simon opher thank you madam deputy speaker have quite lot to say here but shall squeeze it into four minute first of all have regulator fund by drug company be genuinely case of mark one own homework and we need to change that straightaway think we need reform there from clinical experience would also say that the yellow card system do work but that we never get any feedback from it that be one of the problem the other problem be that clinically one be often not sure whether or not something be an adverse effect we need very easy system that can just be fire off the right hon member for tatton esther mcvey mention low white blood cell for example and whether that be reaction then when number of different doctor get it we can accumulate that information if may want to say few thing about vaccination vaccination save far far more life than they cause damage every medicine that have ever be invent have side effect and do not deny vaccine side effect however the vaccine save hundred of thousand of life run the covid vaccination service in our area in dursley at the height of the pandemic if we inject people over we save life that be incredible compare to that the side effect rate be incredibly small it do exist and we need to look at it but let we not get on the back of vaccine vaccine have save more life than anything else really want to talk about antidepressant on which the hon member for east wiltshire danny kruger have already say few word we have problem with over prescribing in this country some million people be on antidepressant my hon friend the member for blackley and middleton south graham stringer speak about paroxetine cause increase risk of suicide we need to wean ourselves off medication national institute for health and care excellence guideline say that for mild to moderate depression we should not start tablet yet they be start that be because people have become bit over medicalise we have minute appointment and no psychological therapy we must also make use of social prescription available to the nhs where we can prescribe to patient something that be not medical we need to de medicalise what be go on that can include lot of different thing such as exercise and be very creative in fact yesterday go with the lord mayor of westminster and lu jackson to st john wood library for comedy on prescription event make people laugh can avoid the need for medication we need to look at those thing much more seriously and get people off tablet the right hon member for tatton esther mcvey say that one of her constituent take their own life when they be try to get off antidepressant medication the mhra need to put warning on the packet but it have fail to do so we also need support mechanism for people come off tablet of the million people on antidepressant about million be try to get off they so it be major problem gps actually be not that well informed about this there be some very strong maudsley guideline base around micro tapering so that people can come off slowly and safely some kind of support service might have help her constituent and stop they take their own life in conclusion we have pandemic of over prescription and we need to start look at that as chair of the beyond pill all party parliamentary group with the hon member for east wiltshire we be try to reduce prescription and make it safe for people to come off antidepressant before be elect to this house work for nearly year in the pharmaceutical regulation and compliance industry know from first hand experience the critical role that the mhra must play in protect the public and its indispensable role in ensure public trust in the medical sector my comment therefore come from place of want to ensure that that trust so painstakingly build up continue to be strengthen recent survey by the association of the british pharmaceutical industry find that of respondent feel the mhra lack of capacity be undermine industry trust and deter domestic investment problem compound by brexit which have create obstacle to co operation in the european union face with large backlog of clinical trial application one would imagine the obvious solution be to make more resource available to recruit and train new staff and to rebuild relationship with our european partner however the prime minister seem more determined to demonstrate his commitment to slash red tape and the need to as he say regulate smartly and regulate creatively must admit get very nervous when hear that kind of language use in relation to the pharmaceutical industry because it be normally code for measure that threaten safety standard even far the need for openness transparency and regulation be probably great than ever before recently have have constituent raise with why the animal feed additive bovaer which be give to cow to reduce methane be not test or approve to mhra pharmaceutical standard and why it be not even list on milk carton constituent have raise concern with about the use of carcinogenic chemical in our food we know that host of chemical that be ban from be use in food in the european union be permit in the united states it be perfectly understandable for people to fear that amid the bonfire of red tape that the government be plan to set alight some thing that well protect we might go up in smoke constituent have also raise question with about the late impact of the vaccine before anyone start accuse of be an anti vaxxer take both covid vaccine and agree that they save many life but it be also the case that legitimate concern have be voice about long term side effect we now know that in the large vaccine study to date two very rare side effect neurological disorder and inflammation of the spinal cord have be detect other study have confirm side effect include inflammation of the heart muscle and the lining around the heart particularly in young male as well as blood clot in the brain venous sinus today we stand united in our commitment to safeguard the health and wellbeing of our citizen the motion highlight critical issue within the mhra that demand our immediate attention and action the independent medicines and medical devices safety review have shed light on persistent and exacerbate patient safety concern since its publication in and it be our duty to ensure that the mhra undergo substantial revision to address those issue the safety of our citizen must be paramount and we can not afford to overlook the shortcoming that have be identify in conclusion let we not forget that our primary responsibility be to the people we serve we must act with urgency and determination to rectify those issue with the mhra by implement these recommendation we can work towards safe more responsive healthcare system that prioritise patient safety and trust above corporate profit and interest thank the right hon member for tatton esther mcvey for secure this important debate my interest in the issue stem from the fact that one of my constituent barbara manning be affect by primodos and along with the tireless campaigner marie lyon who have already be mention today have be seek justice ever since for the benefit of members who do not know this let explain that between and primodos be hormone pregnancy test that be give to about million woman in the form of pill it be take off the market in amid concern about the effect on the unborn child of those who be pregnant but the link have never be formally recognise by regulator or the manufacturer some research at the time suggest that there might be an association between the drug and miscarriage and baby bear with shortened limb abnormality in their internal organ brain damage and heart defect many of those child die before reach adulthood and of those still alive some be blind deaf and brain damage in report from an expert working group of the commission on human medicines conclude that there be no causal association between primodos and severe disability in baby but there be real concern about the conflict of interest involve some of those on the expert working group and their connection to the big pharmaceutical company involve in the scandal on july baroness cumberlege publish she in depth finding on how the health system respond to report from patient about harmful side effect from medicine and medical device on the mhra she say regulator must work both for patient and with they this have be the case in the past we be recommend that the regulator of medicine and medical device be overhaul it need to change and radically improve the way that concern about medicine and device be detect and act upon the regulation of device in particular need urgent change the mhra need to engage more with patient and track how medicine and device improve or fail to improve patient health and quality of life it need to raise public awareness of its role and it need to ensure that patient have core role in its work the review also conclude that the state and manufacturer have moral responsibility to provide ex gratia payment to those family who have experience avoidable harm due to their failure to remove primodos from the market the duty of the regulator be to protect woman it choose to protect the manufacturer instead thousand of woman and unborn child be expose to risk that be widely acknowledge at the time that should not have happen it now fall to we to put right that injustice to persuade the manufacturer to pay compensation to those affected family and to reform the regulatory system so that it protect patient in the future my interest in this matter arise as chair the appg on primodos and it be campaign that and many other mp have be work on for the past year on one occasion after big debate the minister order an expert work group to be set up the mhra be suppose to examine the evidence we the campaigner and member of parliament think that all the document we have would be look at by the mhra but clearly it do not look at they the mhra be suppose to engage with the victim and their family but they be not speak to or deal with properly and there be no thorough examination in fact some of the member of the expert working group which be set up by the commission on human medicines have connection with pharmaceutical company we want the mhra to look at the document which show very clearly that in the it be accept by the then committee on safety of medicines that this drug be cause deformity however the chief medical officer at the time collude with the manufacturer destroy the evidence and refuse to help we have document that show that the manufacturer know there be cover up and yet the mhra refuse to look at they subsequently professor carl heneghan from oxford university look at the same material the ewg have look at and come to completely different conclusion he say the evidence show that there be connection the ewg be ask to look at whether there be causal connection and it change its recommendation again the former prime minister mrs may be also not convince by the expert working group we persuade she to set up review chair by baroness cumberlege who say there be avoidable harm and that the victim should be compensate throughout all those year the government of the day do not want to communicate with we and they have not be deal with this issue properly they have always rely on the expert working group report which have hold the victim back and hold we back from pursue possible legal claim we say to the government now that the ewg report need to be relooke at and professor carl heneghan study of it should also be look at scientific evidence have be produce use an experiment on zebrafish which show that there be link with this drug and we have send this to the commission on human medicines for the department to look at we must remember that this drug be time the strength of the morning after pill woman be give this pill and tell it have no effect other than to see whether they be pregnant and it then cause this damage ask the minister today with the new government now in place to please relook at this the report by the ewg which be set up by the mhra have be discredit so please stop listen to it call the liberal democrat spokesperson thank the right hon member for tatton esther mcvey for bring forward this really important debate and for her excellent opening speech which be very informative in the interest of time will keep my remark brief the medicines and healthcare product regulatory agency be task with vital work and we all agree that it be there to protect and promote public health as number of member have set out it be concern that despite the mhra obvious importance it clearly face number of challenge that need to be address the cumberlege review highlight conflict of interest because the mhra rely on fee income from pharmaceutical company as the hon member for stroud dr opher say this be case of the agency mark its own homework it be not great way to set up its funding the hon member for dewsbury and batley iqbal mohamed make really important point about brexit which be the elephant in the room as with so many part of our economy brexit cause major disruption to the pharmaceutical industry among other thing the loss of the prestigious european medicines agency from london to amsterdam damage trust in the uk pharmaceutical investment space will the hon lady give way in the interest of time will not brexit cause significant confusion for company look to sell product from great britain to northern ireland it have also slow down the time in which novel medicine and treatment can be approve for use as pharmaceutical company have understandably prioritise obtain single approval allow access to market via the ema meanwhile strict affordability model impose by the national institute for health and care excellence mean that company face further hurdle before their product can reach patient again that diminish the attractiveness of the uk market post brexit to help address this issue the mhra introduce the international recognition procedure year ago to streamline the authorisation process by incorporate assessment from trust regulatory partner worldwide include the ema however that rely on those partner have already approve the product so uk patient will inevitably still have access to medicine later than people in other country include eu member state when meet representative of roche diagnostics base in burgess hill in my constituency they tell about the industry serious concern that the additional gb specific conformity check require could be prohibitively expensive and lead to significant delay as thing stand the forecast be look gloomy my liberal democrat colleague and be commit to address these issue head on and to help the mhra become world lead first we be push to expand the mhra capacity by halve the time for treatment to reach patient suffer from illness such as cancer secondly we encourage the government to fully implement the recommendation of the cumberlege review include on compensation corrective surgery and psychological support for those who be fail and who suffer from faulty device and drug thirdly this be vital the government should actively seek comprehensive mutual recognition agreement with the ema to promote fast access to new and novel medicine and medical device that would reduce red tape cost and friction provide hope for those who need access to these lifesaving and life enhance medicine and device call the shadow minister congratulate my right hon friend the member for tatton esther mcvey on secure this debate and on give member from across the house the opportunity to raise issue such as primodos breast implant mesh ssri vaccine and mmr as clinician have see patient who have be affect by all these issue and know the heartfelt difficulty that they have face not only in what have happen to they but in try to resolve the problem it be testament to she that she have give the house the chance to debate these issue and be not sure that the public have ever pay so much attention to regulator even in the financial crisis the mhra have suddenly become something that people know often use to explain to patient that regulator should be like good referee we should not see they but they should be there to hold people to account and know the rule however modern refereeing be about more than that referee have already meet the player beforehand and speak to the public about how thing work they help to shape the way in which the rule should be interpret allow we to improve the game the hon member for great yarmouth rupert lowe ask who regulate the regulator and the answer be that this house be accountable that accountability be key what be the function of the mhra they be to ensure that medicine medical device and blood component for transfusion meet applicable standard of safety quality and efficacy to secure safe supply chain for medicine medical device and blood component to promote international standardisation and harmonisation to ensure the effectiveness and safety of biological medicine to educate the public and healthcare professional about the risk and benefit of medicine medical device and blood component lead to safe and more effective use and to enable the development of innovation and research that benefit public health welcome the mhra new chair professor anthony harnden who be appoint at the start of the year hope he be listen to this debate as it will be important for he in set his priority pay tribute again to my right hon friend the member for tatton because whether or not the mhra know this debate be happen notice during my research that all the guidance be update on the mhra website only yesterday that be testament to the power of this place even if inadvertently the last government do lot in this space particularly focus on patient safety and access they introduce new regulation on medical device with the classic example being diabete monitor but they also set out to attract innovation their reform have help to make the uk an attractive market for medical technology be pleased that both side of the house agree that this be great place for the uk to find growth these development be base on consultation lead approach follow the change we have have since when there be consultation on the future regulation of medical device this lead to proportionate and phased approach that minimise supply disruption and support system readiness under the last government road map for implementation be set out on january again be pleased to see that the current government update the road map in december this have the regulatory aim of adapt new technology strengthen patient safety and provide clarity for manufacturer that be try to bring product to market all these significant change try to balance medical technology advance market capture patient access affordability and clinical outcome however as we have hear in this debate this be all well and good but perception versus reality come to mind we arguably have one of the good regulatory regime in the world and post brexit there be real opportunity to lead the way counter to what the lib dem spokesperson the hon member for mid sussex alison bennett say it be because of brexit that we be able to regulate around our vaccine as have be say today there be still serious concern about the system surveillance and resource give the medical tech boom this be wide debate so will focus my remark on three area the current medical market the emerge medical market and communication with the public perception and belief when it come to the system for current medication we need only consider what we hear early about ssris and particularly their impact on sexual dysfunction happen to have that casework on my desk at the moment do the government believe that the yellow card system work or will they consider review when it come to emerge market we have to remember that the mhra have statutory role not only in regulate but in the advertising and promotion of medicine in the uk we have see thousand of online advert for weight loss injection such as ozempic the times find approximately advert that mention on meta ad library between january and the end of june and sky have report that accord to simple online pharmacy which have access to wholesale figure people in the uk be currently use thing like wegovy would be grateful if the government could set out what support they be offer the mhra to ensure that it can fulfil its role and function properly give that it have to manage promotion safety and supply in all these area be there any plan to review whether the mhra be able to meet these condition in change medical world finally and most importantly if be to be critical of the mhra would say that the key thing miss on the list of objective as set out by the new chair be communication let finish where start regulator have never be more in the public eye as clinician know how difficult it be to wade through complex medical datum that be both conflicting and opaque as my right hon friend the member for tatton point out freedom of information request and transparency be key to our understanding of this area will the government look to review how the mhra interact with the public how it communicate with grassroots professional and what it can do to explain the hugely important work that it do to conclude as my hon friend the member for christchurch sir christopher chope and the hon member for dewsbury and batley iqbal mohamed point out this be all about trust think it be reagan who say trust but verify that seem particularly apt for this debate for that be the role of regulator but it be also the role of the government and the public we must build regulatory system that all can trust and do so inherently but that be also easily verifiable at any point if we can achieve that we can build trust ecosystem that be good for innovation good for the economy and most importantly good for the people call the minister congratulate the right hon member for tatton esther mcvey on secure this debate and thank she and all those who have speak for their contribution we have hear some powerful story of failure as well as some useful experience have to thank my hon friend the member for stroud dr opher the hon member for dewsbury and batley iqbal mohamed and the shadow minister for share their expertise have hear many of these story before in my year in this place sadly have also have constituent who share her experience with for which be grateful frankly those experience shock and my staff congratulate my hon friend the members for camborne and redruth perran moon for washington and gateshead south mrs hodgson for poole neil duncan jordan for bolton south and walkden yasmin qureshi and many other who have bring their experience to this place shin light on the issue it be right for we to debate this matter six month into the job and be still learn madam deputy speaker so be grateful for be able to take part in this debate can assure my hon friend the member for blackley and middleton south graham stringer that can not answer everything and be glad that he recognise that the right hon member for tatton have focus my mind for which be very grateful if do not do justice to the point that have be raise will write to member about specific thing be meet representative from the mhra and will be very clear about our expectation it be absolutely the role of parliament to be the ultimate monitor of its work the mhra play vital role in fulfil the government health mission balance its responsibility to maintain product safety and championing innovation will if may be clear about the role of an enabler it be about enable innovative product to reach patient without compromise patient safety and without unnecessary delay it be thank to vaccine and medicine such as antibiotic and modern surgical procedure that we be live long healthy and more active life no medical product be completely free of risk the main objective of the safety monitoring process be to identify any new risk that may emerge when that happen the mhra must take its responsibility seriously rigorously and transparently when balance population risk and benefit of each medical product take prompt and decisive action whenever that be need on support safety the mhra recognise the need constantly to seek to improve its safety monitoring system to deliver well result for people recent improvement include implement the new safety connect it system follow recommendation from the cumberlege review this it system will improve the efficiency of reporting and processing of yellow card report much of which we have hear about today support the prompt identification and assessment of new safety concern in addition the mhra make use of real world datum via the clinical practice research datalink which collect anonymised patient datum from network of gp practice across the uk encompass datum from million patient include million currently register patient the mhra have recently launch pilot in partnership with genomics england to create rich source of genetic information to investigate the role of genetic pre disposition in the development of serious adverse drug reaction the aim be to establish yellow card biobank to reduce the number of harmful side effect cause by medicine step towards personalised prescribing the cumberlege review also highlight the need to improve the regulation of implantable medical device in november last year the government introduce new regulation to strengthen the requirement for manufacturer to proactively monitor and report on medical device once they be on the market which be note by my hon friend the member for washington and gateshead south we plan to lay further reform before parliament this year include unique device identifier and implant card to improve the traceability of implant device as well as increase the classification of device to ensure that they receive the high scrutiny throughout their lifetime finally the mhra have make some progress in response to the wide set of recommendation set out in baroness cumberlege report it listen carefully to the people who give evidence and to the review finding and be commit to bring about those change it be our job to ensure that that happen the yellow card scheme provide the backbone of our safety monitoring system the scheme rely on voluntarily report from patient parent caregiver and healthcare professional the mhra also collect report of suspect safety concern involve defective falsified or fake healthcare product last year it assess more than report and identify safety signal but take onboard the comment make today when safety signal lead to confirm risk the mhra can introduce specific risk minimisation measure such as introduce particular warning about the risk of side effect in the product information restrict the use of the medicine or medical device or suspend or remove the medicine or device from the market the mhra will continue to proactively encourage the reporting of adverse effect through improvement such as those within the new safety connect system and will ensure that there be well connection between clinical system work with the wide healthcare system the mhra recognise that there have be delay in some of the regulatory service that it provide include licence application for innovative and generic medicine variation to licence and inspection of manufacturing and laboratory premise since september all new application for marketing authorisation of establish medicine be be assess within expect timescale that element be therefore improve but we will keep close eye on it reiterate my thank to the right hon member for tatton this have be an informative and bizarrely wide range but focused debate trust be really important patient have to be at the heart of our work and that of the mhra patient safety be the foremost priority the mhra be continue to work on improve engagement and involve patient in decision make throughout the life cycle of the product that it regulate it will continue to work to facilitate patient access to new medicine and medical device in collaboration with health system partner across the uk the regulator maintain its focus on continuous improvement and have implement new way of work to maximise productivity in way that put patient and public health outcome first take the point make by the shadow minister the hon member for hinckley and bosworth dr evans that communication around that be key the mhra have turn around performance on clinical trial and be on track to deliver all regulatory service within statutory timeline by the end of march later this year as part of its programme of reform we will introduce new point of care manufacturing legislation that will make the mhra the first regulator in the world to introduce tailor framework for innovative manufacturing method take the manufacture and supply of medicine to patient it be truly an exciting development and pay tribute to those involve the process for recruit the new chief executive be well under way we welcome professor anthony harnden his strategic focus be on help the organisation to protect patient safety through robust surveillance system embrace risk proportionate regulation and foster an inclusive workplace where people flourish without put he on the spot we should think about organise parliamentary event of some sort to bring people together to discuss matter with the mhra and build that trust be pleased to support its work it be internationally recognise as regulator we want to do well the government will ensure that the mhra be well thank all member who have stay late to speak today many of they recount the deeply move and harrowing experience of their constituent all contribution reinforce the failing of the mhra in fact listen to member the verdict on the mhra be guilty as charge confirm that it be in need of substantial reform feel sure that the minister will ensure that that reform start here and now question put and agree to resolve that this house note that the medicines and healthcare products regulatory agency mhra continue to need substantial reform as recognise by the independent medicines and medical devices safety review immds with patient safety concern persist and exacerbating since the review publication in believe that the mhra expert working group report on primodos be deeply flawed with immds later conclude the drug have cause avoidable harm further note that the yellow card system for report suspect adverse drug reaction be fail with no process for follow up on serious or fatal reaction and conflict of interest with of the mhra funding be derive from industry fee concern raise in the fourth report of session of the health committee the influence of the pharmaceutical industry hc publish on april also note the mhra delay response to report of myocarditis pericarditis and vaccine induce thrombotic thrombocytopaenia follow vaccination despite action from regulator in other country and call on the government to fully implement the recommendation in the immds review and to acknowledge the harm do to patient and the financial burden on the healthcare system as result of the mhra widespread regulatory failure uk air defence motion make and question propose that this house do now tami be grateful for this opportunity and declare my interest as reservist the father of two servicewoman and the brother of serve admiral among the many issue that should be keep ministers awake at night be two tech base conundrum that particularly worry one be future access to critical mineral and their product which have speak about in the past the other related issue be the patchy nature of the protection of these island against missile and drone that be what want to raise this evening everything cost and it be easy when one be not in government to wish the end without the mean at the moment defence be spread too thinly and what be suggest would spread it even more thinly whether the uk should be globally deployable or focus on the defence of the homeland and its euro atlantic neighbourhood be moot the likelihood be that we will soldier on make do and mend we always have but the scene be set for the big retrenchment since suez wish it be otherwise but it fall to this government to make the call their attempt unforced surrender of the chagos island be perhaps an indication of where their thinking lie in the us president tell his national security council that european nato member be not pay their fair share john kennedy say we have be very generous to europe and it be now time for we to look out for ourselves on monday the and president will likely be say the same thing clearly american frustration with europe enjoy the insurance policy without pay the premium be nothing new what be new be the american willingness to strong arm europe into change its way forget or say he want of gdp spend on defence by all nato member and here be the kicker he want tariff on all good import to the us combine the two and it be not stretch to imagine he slap tariff on european good unless europeans step up to the plate ultimately the single most important reason trump can do what we fear he be about to do be that america be no long principally compete with europe proximate threat russia vast but thinly populated nation of million bust economy and military whose weakness have be generously display for all to see since february be not perceive by washington as main threat an america emerge from the bush counter terrorism era be back to face off with great power once again but the great power be not russia it be china as the us pivot european state of all size must step up to defend their homeland and safeguard the north atlantic there be no free pass israel be small state but its military capability be unmatched in the middle east its layered missile defence system the famous iron dome david sling and arrow and its formidable fleet of aircraft demonstrate how small state with little help from their friend can punch way above their weight several of those small state will provide the first line of defence against putin russia the bulk of the cruise ballistic and hypersonic missile that putin would fire at britain as proxy for the us will be intercept by exist defence system and fighter aircraft station in the baltic state the czech republic slovakia or poland while our geography as so often in our history give strategic depth and protection from long range attack we can have less confidence in deal with proximate threat from sea and subsea platform and with threat to deploy and overseas asset such as cyprus that fall well within the scope of short range missile and drone from russia iran and their proxy in any event some missile direct at the homeland would get through in the event of full on attack right now by the russian federation that have be our blind spot the public would expect that missile evade the first line of integrate missile defence would be destroy close to their target the type mount sea viper and the ground base sky sabre be exquisite example of air and missile defence system but there be simply not enough of they not enough missile ready to go and not enough industrial capacity to enable resilience in anything more than the very short term russia war on ukraine have helpfully make we alive to our vulnerability russia as we have see in ukraine and throughout its history be capable of take long term pain in way that it seem unlikely we would as thing stand the capital be particularly vulnerable to russian missile attack unless we park all our type those that be operational on the thames happily unlike israel and ukraine we be surround by friend it make sense to be full part of and contributor to nato integrate air and missile defence but european iamd and its suppression and destruction of enemy air defence system be currently completely reliant on the us in any event the suspicion be that full on attack by russia right now would find too many hole in the patchy architecture that have evolve to protect against missile germany have recognise that threat it have own the consequence of do nothing it have establish the european sky shield initiative and have begin procure trust system such as patriot and arrow the uk have be consider join essi where be we with that what about off the shelf system such as arrow thank my right hon and gallant friend for that point it be interesting that the arrow project he mention be joint project between boeing in america and the israeli defence machinery be there something in the innovation offer by patria finnish company which be offer to help we build armoured vehicle here in britain but base on its design do we need less of reliance on domestic system and to consider as he say off the shelf system from elsewhere there be great deal in what my hon friend say historically buy off the shelf have prove to be somewhat more cost effective than design exquisite system of our own hope very much that as we go far into this process we can partner with other to ensure that what we buy be both integrated and cost effective would be interested to hear the minister thought on essi ukraine have show the limitation of the just in time not just in case policy that have drive our failure to stockpile the materiel of war in recent decade in the the shadow factory initiative fit commercial premise that typically produce car for reconfiguration as armament factory in case the need should arise which it do car worker would switch to become the basis of the skilled workforce necessary to create materiel for prosecute the war effort that then happen to the point that in this country be outstrip germany in the production of fighter aircraft with every respect due to the few the battle of britain be win in britain factory and on its production line as much as in the sky victory hinge just as much on logistic now except the timeline be far short the defence ecosystem in the us national defence strategy have more than whiff of the in advance an intertwine commercial military co operative in good light we can see shadow factory in the thematic approach to missile defence take by the defence science and technology laboratory missile defence centre crucially it be industry partner base with heavy focus on grow suitably qualified and experienced people of whom we be desperately short the mdc be now year old what assessment have the minister make of it and what change do he propose to its structure and remit to help plug hole in our missile defence architecture in the light of prevail circumstance will he consider upgrade the mdc so that it have the salience and clout approach that of the pre war directorate of aeronautical production then it be spitfires and hurricanes today it be missile defence sdead suppression and destruction of enemy air defence and drone then it be preparation for the total war to come now god willing it be deterrence there be those who say that the solution to our vulnerability to missile attack from the east be simple it be israel iron dome the close in element of the layered missile defence system use successfully to thwart iran in april however israel be small country with small population concentrate in small number of city with limited critical national infrastructure it be surround by hostile happily none of that apply here our missile defence must be fully integrate with nato partner nato need european leadership as the us pivot and we must not encourage those whose primary interest in defence lie in extend the remit of the institution of the european union rather than the defence and security of europeans we do not need the distraction of separate compete eu defence architecture nato be our strength and our stay and we must use our status as the continent lead military power to ensure it remain so in particular we must articulate clearly the case for layered missile defence and sdead within nato construct as the us pivot towards the indo pacific the uk and europe need nato integrate air and missile defence that incorporate close in system to guarantee major centre of population defence asset and critical national infrastructure crucially member state must not give an aggressor capable of wag an attritional war ground for believe that the west will exhaust its ordnance in the first few hour or day where be we with the versatile and scalable very short to medium range modular ground base air defence system envisage by nato defence ministers at their meeting in october what application might that system have to provide the last arrow in our quiver one that will destroy missile that have evade intermediate layer and be about to land on critical site in the uk for country with no money direct energy weapon offer potential solution for deal with drone and missile albeit in line of sight and in good weather be dstl dragonfire weapon still on course for service with the royal navy in and what export opportunity be minister explore do they expect that type type and any type will carry dragonfire or successor direct energy weapon will they be fit as standard or as expensive retrofit do we really need sixth generation manned or even hybrid fast jet to replace typhoon would it not be well to rely on the airframe with mid life upgrade in future that be surely progressively unmanned the lineal if less romantic descendant of the few will be tech geek gamer coder and those who provide human interface with artificial intelligence what be we do to grow they and will the minister visit the techtrowbridge initiative that start in wiltshire county town which be once centre for spitfire manufacture he would be warmly welcome on his way to his constituency the reason that grisly artillery war have play out in ukraine be because nobody have be able to command the airspace happily and to our surprise russia have be unable to suppress or destroy ukraine air defence in the future unmanned combat aerial vehicle configure to shoot the archer not the arrow will do that would be very surprised if lord robertson be not cast critical eye over the global combat air programme and compare and contrast its cost and effectiveness with those of unmanned combat aerial vehicle appreciate the deep cultural difficulty of envisage an unmanned future battlespace it be deeply unsettling for those of we steep in the tradition of the armed force but while there will always be need for sufficient booted and spur combat troop ready to close with and kill the enemy and hold the ground as the member of parliament for garrison town be not for one moment suggest further reduction in headcount this country will never again be able to expose itself to attritional warfare of the sort we be see be play out in ukraine politically and societally that would be impossible and unconscionable that mean integrate missile defence sdead drone and command of the electromagnetic spectrum once again at dreadnought crossroad britain must configure the force at its disposal for the long term in all domain and take lead as what be still the principal military power in its euro atlantic voisinage early pointer suggest that this government be take the right fork in the road would include difficult and unpopular decision such as stand firm on the deep space advance radar capability envisage for cawdor barrack on the st david peninsula which be bottle by previous government as we chop to an unmanned future those pointer would for example and very painfully include consignment of the raf red arrows aero acrobatic team to the historic flight this government have four year leave to run the time the directorate of aeronautical production have to fit out this country with what it need to prevail recent event have reveal the fundamental truth that we be vulnerable now as we be then and the shift geopolitical plate will likely make we more so the public will never forgive an administration of whatever colour who muddle through leave they open to the predation of putin advance missile programme thank the right hon member for south west wiltshire dr murrison for call this debate and for the seriousness with which he have approach it share his general analysis of the context that we live in more difficult unsettled and challenging time that be the reason why on come into office the prime minister commission lord robertson to begin the strategic defence review to look at our capability and to set those against the threat we be face as country will return to some of those area and indeed to the question the right hon gentleman ask there be real challenge when it come to integrate air missile defence the threat from drone and the threat from one way effector and long range strike as we have see every single day in ukraine with the brave people of ukraine be on the receive end of onslaught from putin illegal invasion those be the lesson we be seek to learn in the strategic defence review to make sure not only that we can support our friend in ukraine with the equipment they need but that we can adapt our own way of war fight and defend to deter aggression if at all possible and to defeat it if necessary the right hon gentleman have raise number of issue and will come on to those in my remark if can but be sure he will keep honest if have miss any by the time reach the end of my response to he his analysis of the context of the political challenge in this debate be certainly true when he be defence minister and be on the opposition benches the current defence secretary and make that argument have hear from the government dispatch box that defence have be hollow out and underfunde we argue that we need different approach do not like the approach the right hon gentleman mention of have to make do and mend we always have recognise it but do not think we should accept it especially in more difficult time precisely because of that the sdr need to be bold and that be in effect the remit give to lord robertson fiona hill and richard barrons by the prime minister and the defence secretary the right hon gentleman be right that it fall to this government to make those decision and we have already make number of decision about retire old platform that be sometimes difficult and he raise the interesting challenge of how we renew technology without offend or upset the established norm as an example watchkeeper year old drone system use by the british army have be retire because it can not keep pace with the modern challenge of electronic warfare jamming and other thing we would be ask it to do if it be to be deploy on frontline that be certainly something we feel incredibly strongly about have just return from the defence ministers meeting that take place in warsaw in poland and it be clear to that our nato ally be all take integrate air and missile defence seriously if we look at the experience of the nation on nato eastern flank particularly poland and the baltic state which the right hon gentleman mention we be see very real concern about protection of their airspace protection be be build up through what they be seek to procure and the support they be ask for from ally in provide protective bubble over their country britain island geography may have deter aggressor throughout much of our history but it be no shield against sophisticated weapon and modern air warfare and for that reason the sdr have be commission thank my right hon and gallant friend the member for south west wiltshire dr murrison for bring this important debate to the chamber from the discussion the minister have at the conference do he think our ally be confident that we be play our part in air defence thank my fellow devon mp for that question he will be able to read the joint statement by the uk italy france germany and poland when it be publish on the ministry of defence website on the conference conclusion make the point clearly in the press conference afterwards that the uk be call on all nato partner to increase their defence spending we have plan to increase our defence spending from to where any increase defence spending go matter because it need not only to deter aggression but to defeat it and perhaps most importantly and relevant to this debate to be interoperable with our ally we need to ensure that any investment in defence have an increase in our deployability and our lethality as we fight together it be the assumption of this government with declare nato first policy that we will be support our nato ally in any defensive measure that be the reason we have the british army in estonia with operation cabrit it be the reason we have nato air police in variety of state along nato eastern flank integrated air and missile defence be an area that all nato member need to develop there be not one answer that everyone have reach for yet it be difficult wicked problem that require investment and change in strategy that be part of the reason why that be be address by the sdr that be long answer to the hon gentleman question but hope it provide he with the clarity he need the minister represent city and football club that be close to my heart also thank the right hon member for south west wiltshire dr murrison for bring forward this important debate be hearten to hear that the minister view the interoperability of our workforce and our asset alongside our nato ally do the government view the defence of uk airspace not singularly but as do as the western front of european air defence would certainly be happy afterwards to take up any discussion about plymouth argyle and post wayne rooney world it be certainly true that the united kingdom commitment to nato be not just in secure northern and western flank and deal with the north atlantic and the high north we also have responsibility to our nato ally on the eastern and southern flank part of the challenge we have with integrated air and missile defence and the threat that the uk and our ally face be that the definition of what be the close and the deep have fundamentally change because of the experience of the ukraine war recognise that there be member in this house and this debate who serve in our armed force and they will be familiar with the broad definition of close and deep it be certainly true that what we previously regard as close and deep have fundamentally change the distance have increase enormously we be see that in ukraine and that mean we have to re imagine and re define the strategy and capability we need to be able to operate in those environment have the ability to project power and fire at distance be one reason that we have support ukraine with so many weapon system it be also the reason why the sdr be look in particular at this area and how any force and capability can meet the threat we be face in that respect hope that the hon member for tewkesbury cameron thomas understand that the sdr will address many of the answer to his broad question our responsibility be more than just secure the uk homeland they be about support our ally and indeed it be our ally role to support not only their own country but their nato partner include the uk the threat pose to our security continue to proliferate and converge with technology rapidly develop protect britain and our ally from attack become ever more complex and challenging let be absolutely clear adversary must be in no doubt that the uk possess formidable capability contribute to our integrate air and missile defence along with the will and the intent to protect the uk and our ally we have typhoon aircraft on alert hour day day year be sure that the right hon member for south west wiltshire have see the quick reaction aircraft as have operate out of raf lossiemouth and see the incredible speed dedication and professionalism of our team there respond to threat approach the united kingdom our radar at fylingdales provide continuous early warning against ballistic missile and the royal navy prove the effectiveness of the type destroyer against different air threat in the recent operation in the red sea in particular that include shoot down drone similar to those use by russia against ukraine in relation to the specific of our capability have have the privilege of visit uk force station forward in poland use the sky sabre system support the nato logistic hub that support so much of what we provide to ukraine operation stifftail have now conclude and that mission have be success thank all those member of the royal artillery in particular who support that mission the sky sabre system that be in poland have be return to the uk and be be reconstitute the sky sabre system that we have in the falklands provide continuous air defence to the island protect the sovereignty of the falkland island have see that system up close and personal on my recent visit to the falklands thank those member of our armed force protect the sky above the falklands we will need to ensure that integrate air missile defence be more than just bubble over poland and protection of the falklands think that be at the heart of what the right hon gentleman be seek to raise in the debate it be also one of the challenge that the strategic defence review seek to answer will not steal lord robertson sandwich in term of what expect to see in the strategic defence review but certainly enhance our capability to meet threat be one of the core challenge of the sdr and would expect he and his review team to be make recommendation about how that should be do in the sdr when it be publish in the spring the right hon gentleman will also know that the time on the path to get to of gdp be spend on defence will also be publish in the spring hopefully that will enable we to look at those two part together to ensure that we be in his word meet the challenge of step up agree that there be no free pass and as nation we have rely on our strategic depth for great many year but we can not rely on that alone today that be why our capability need to match that challenge our nato first approach mean ensure that we deliver not only on the article responsibility in the nato treaty to protect our own homeland but on article and be able to support our nato ally that be why we will continue to support our deployment around the nato area of operation as country we be lead the way with initiative such as diamond deliver integrate air and missile operational networked defence which will improve air defence integration across europe and strengthen nato air and missile protection the uk have also launch the nato multinational procurement initiative on missile capability which be catalyst to mobilise the euro atlantic defence industry in support of ukraine and address the burgeon security threat to nato member as well we be also forge deep relation with individual european partner hon member may have see the landmark trinity house agreement sign between the united kingdom and germany which will see we turbocharge series of major project across air land and sea work in partnership to strengthen air defence and well protect european airspace we be also work more closely with france with our most recently sign letter of intent
