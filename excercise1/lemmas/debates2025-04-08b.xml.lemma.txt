june we have announce the roll out of an additional place in construction skill so that we can build the home and infrastructure that our country desperately need to drive progress on our growth mission and get the most out of taxpayer money it be vital that department work collaboratively and not at odd with each other will the chancellor outline how she be promote cross departmental working and planning as part of the spending review the chief secretary to the treasury be work closely in constructive way to bring together cluster of colleague to discuss some of the press issue that span departments and that no one department can address on its own whether that be reform of special educational need and disability provision for early year or tackle issue around homelessness and the

significant as the financial crisis of or perhaps as covid and in those instance the state unleash everything it could to try to resolve those issue be the chancellor consider change any of her rule to ensure that everything that the state can throw at this problem be be do it be incredibly important to retain cool head at this moment the tariff have be impose and we be work closely with our

trading relationship with some of our big trading partner around the world of course as we do yesterday we be look at some of the sectoral response include on life science automotive and steel but the fiscal rule be very important for give our country the stability it need we see what happen when the previous government lose control of the public finance it result in interest rate go through the roof mean high cost for business and for work family we will not make those mistake that be why the fiscal rule be non negotiable and stability for this government be sacrosanct be now not the right time to start try to make our own luck in that light would it not also be the right time for the chancellor to give the green light to the upgrade of the between penrith and scotch corner some of traffic on that road be freight which be twice the average for road across the country and it be outrageous that so much of the road be single carriageway would it not be great for the economy as well as save live if the chancellor give the upgrade the green light today impressive we will be consider all such scheme as part of the spending review but agree with the hon gentleman that we need to go far and fast to grow our economy that be why we be spend billion more on capital investment in this parliament compare to the plan that we inherit which mean that we can upgrade more road rail line and energy infrastructure and build the million home our country need too call the shadow minister two week ago the spring statement rush through change to disability benefit or pocket money to the chief secretary to the treasury to help plug the billion gap in public finance create by the first labour budget now we be already in the office for budget responsibility scenario on tariff and the chancellor be once again forecast to be out of room on her fiscal target what do she plan to ask the chief secretary to the treasury to do to update departmental budget in his multi year spending review in order to avoid punish business and people once again with further taxis the hon gentleman be jump the gun somewhat we deliver the spring statement just two week ago in which we be able to restore the fiscal headroom after the change in global bond yield we will set out the budget in the autumn move to one fiscal event year which be very different from the multiple budgets we have from the previous government we have set the spending total for the spending review and we will be set out the departmental allocation on june second home what assessment she have make of the potential impact of her tax policy on investment in second home while short term let and second home can benefit the tourist economy we recognise that they can impact the availability and affordability of main home in some community that be why we have enable council to charge premium of up to on the council tax bill of second home increase the high rate of stamp duty land tax on the purchase of second home and abolish the furnished holiday let tax regime be grateful to the minister for that response but believe we can go far because this be not about the politic of envy but about the politic of social justice in cornwall it can not be right that through the small business rate relief system over million of taxpayer money have go into the pocket of holiday homeowner in the last year many of those homeowner have flip their second home into the small business rating system to take advantage of that loophole will the minister meet so that we can find more equitable way of spend public money that go into first home rather than second home thank the hon gentleman for his remark agree with he about the importance of take the right action to tackle second home understand he have meeting with the minister for housing and planning last week and would be happy to follow up any item that arise from that our plan to build more home include new home in every year in cornwall and hope he will support those building plan too wish to add my voice as an mp from cornwall to say that some of the action the government have take so far on second home have be really helpful the renters rights bill will help with those eviction when people be flip their house also ask that we look at the loophole between council tax and business rate and at the registration or licensing scheme on second home which the government will hopefully bring in soon appreciate the concern that second home owner may move to the business rate system emphasise that there be requirement that must be meet before property can be assess for business rate those have recently be strengthen but we will keep they under review new homes affordability what step she be take with cabinet colleague to increase the affordability of new home the prime minister and the deputy prime minister have set out our ambition to build million home during this parliament as part of our plan for change at the spring statement announce step towards that ambition with an additional billion investment in social and affordable housing next year as down payment on further investment at the spending review in june welcome the chancellor build build build policy but with temporary housing in london cost million day soar rent and frozen local housing allowance it be no wonder that london council fear go bankrupt and have to rehouse people from outside the capital where only of home be affordable in the comprehensive spending review will my right hon friend look into possibly uprate this stingy tory legacy so that londoner be not force out of london the key thing we need to do be build the home our country desperately need that be why put million of investment into create additional place for people to learn the construction skill we need and into good job pay decent wage and build the home we need that be also why we be reform the planning system so that we can actually get those home build we be back the builder not the blocker which be what the conservatives do at the weekend the times reveal the problem in the retirement housing market in term of both new build and resale and many of my constituent have be experience loss on the house and flat that they have inherit do the chancellor consider the housing market to be adequately provide decent affordable home for those who be downsize as well as first time buyer would be very happy to arrange meeting for the hon lady with the relevant minister to discuss some of those specific issue around retirement property she make really important point we need to make it easy for people to downsize to free up those property include in the private sector so that more home be available for family economic growth north east what step

north east combine authority with an integrated funding settlement from and work with it on its local growth plan the combined authority have identify key growth corridor sweep across my constituency but historical lack of investment to upgrade the moor farm and seaton burn roundabout cause relentless disruption and hold back growth investment and opportunity there be business plan in the north east growth plan and in the road investment strategy do the minister agree that that be exactly the sort of scheme that this labour government should support to boost economic growth in every region the government be commit to improve road we agree billion settlement for national highways and fund million uplift for local road in this financial year funding for the programme which my hon friend mention will be consider in phase of the spending review and encourage she to continue to engage with the minister for road on this issue rise presume mr lamont think it be north east scotland rather than north east england this government decide to cancel the upgrade which will harm the economy not just in the north east of england but in the south of scotland what economic impact assessment do the government make before decide to cancel that vital road link nice try in term of north east growth have already say that we be work very closely with the mayor of the north east combine authority suggest that the hon gentleman ask question about road relevant to his part of the country at transport question now call the minister to answer alistair carmichael question on the potential impact of change to agricultural property relief and business property relief on farmer which be omit in error from early version of the order paper farmer tax relief if she will meet farming representative to

asset of over million which would raise over billion at the autumn budget last year the chancellor announce series of reform to fix the public finance in as fair way as possible and make sure that the wealthy in society pay their share of tax the welfare reform announce in the spring statement be principle reform to help get people back into work because work be the good way out of poverty the reform also provide support for those who need it and make sure that the system be sustainable for the future early this year speak to member of my local christians against poverty debt support team in guildford and they explain to that they support many low income individual out of debt but they be no soon out of debt than they start accrue it again because universal credit be insufficient to cover their basic need due to the cost of live in area such as guildford what work have the minister do to assess whether universal credit level be sufficient to cover the varied and increase basic living cost across the country and to prevent people on the low income from get far into difficulty and debt the government have already take action on the fair repayment rate lower the cap on deduction from universal credit to be before the autumn budget last year that will benefit million household by an average of year and of the poor family with child will benefit call the shadow minister business have just be hit by the chancellor billion job tax which will cost work family also business rate be nearly double for hospitality and retail business how do impose taxis that the office for budget responsibility say will result in low wage high price and few job help growth and those on the low income and will the chancellor keep she promise not to come back with more taxis in this parliament the shadow minister talk about business rate support remind he that if we have carry on with the plan inherit from the conservative party business rate relief would have end entirely this month it be only thank to decision of this government that rat relief be continue for this year ahead of permanent reform that will permanently lower tax rate for retail hospitality and leisure premise on the high street from april that be thank to decision this government make wealth tax potential merits what recent assessment she have make of the potential merit of introduce wealth tax if she will make an assessment of the potential implication for her policy of the finding of oxfam poll on taxation publish on march this government be commit to ensure that the wealthy in our society pay their fair share of tax the chancellor announce series of reform at autumn budget to help fix the public finance as fairly as possible those reform include increase the rate of capital gain tax increase air passenger duty for private jet and raise stamp duty for buyer of second or more home analysis from number of disability group show that the pathway to work green paper will have detrimental effect on more than million people while polling from oxfam show that of the public would rather the uk government increase taxis on the very rich than cut the benefit of the poor in society should we not be look at raise fund from those with the broad shoulder as make clear early the government have already make change to make the tax system fairer and to ensure that the wealthy pay their fair share the reform to the welfare system be principle reform to tackle perverse incentive that encourage inactivity we need to support those in most need get people back into work wherever possible and protect the sustainability of the welfare system let we be frank and not spin it for year we see austerity that rip the heart out of community we then have global pandemic during which inequality be accelerate and we be still feel the effect of cost of living crisis that be make ordinary people poorer the public do not want cut or austerity they want an annual wealth tax on the very wealthy in society be it not time we have government who do something different give people what they want and be willing to redistribute wealth for the benefit of many in society and to improve living standard politely suggest that if my hon friend think we be impose austerity he have not read the budget very carefully it contain increase to revenue spending in all departments across the public spending envelope and an increase in capital investment we be ensure that we build for the future while protect our fiscal rule let be clear those fiscal rule be not nice to have addition to the way we approach the economy fiscal irresponsibility have huge cost as we see under the previous government we support the government in try to determine fair level of tax especially for the very wealthy however will the minister establish if he can the number of people who might leave the country as result of wealth tax and therefore pay no income tax whatsoever the hon gentleman make an important point we need to ensure that the wealthy in society pay their fair share while also attract talent from around the world to the uk to work invest and help to grow our economy it be on the back of that investment and economic growth that we will make people across the uk well off and get more money into their pocket banking services what step she be take to ensure rural community have access to banking hub what step she be take to help protect in person banking the government understand the importance of in person banking to community and be work closely with the industry to roll out banking hub across the uk more than hub have already be announce of which more than be already open rural community such as settle in north yorkshire be really struggle with the loss of face to face banking service link hub be one route for they to replace the bank that be close urge ministers to do what they can with link accept that it be an independent organisation to help it to relax the criterion for rural community allow they more face to face banking service would be very happy to meet the right hon gentleman if he want to discuss specific banking hub that be be consider we work very closely with link as he will know his government pass the financial services and markets act under which the financial conduct authority link and the financial service sector ultimately have power over the criterion which be not something we be plan to change how do the minister plan to make it easy to establish banking hub in community that have lose all of their bank do have meeting set up with the previous minister but she leave government before that meeting could take place will this minister agree to meet so that can discuss the establishment of banking hub in the town of cheshunt in my broxbourne constituency be always happy to meet colleague and will be happy to meet the hon gentleman the criterion apply by link be too strict and bank be be able to walk away from their customer in eltham we have have salami slicing process of bank gradually leave the high street but because we have building society we can not ask for hub will the minister undertake to review link approach because it be make it difficult for customer to carry out their banking business as say in my previous answer we do not have any plan to change the link criterion those be matter for link however there be some flexibility in the way that it apply the criterion depend on the local population travel time to nearby bank branch and indeed the number of small business in an area would be happy to meet my hon friend if that be of concern to he topical questions if she will make statement on her departmental responsibility mr speaker you shock by move to topical question so quickly but have now find my page and be ready to answer they you need to get new watch from ferry to the national care service we have see failure after failure from the snp in scotland include track record of waste in contrast this labour government be tackle waste and invest in frontline service such as our national health service which have see waiting list fall for each of the past five month in england we hope that the people of scotland will soon have the opportunity to experience such transformation the chancellor set out in the spring statement clear plan to drive well value for taxpayer include through the transformation fund which will transform frontline delivery while make saving in the long term do he agree that that be in stark contrast to the snp scottish government record of waste as my hon friend know we have give the scottish government the large increase in spending since devolution begin the people of scotland expect that money to be spend well which we be do in england by transform public service and improve the national health service however give that snp members be not present in the chamber today the people of scotland need to know that they will have to elect labour government in scotland later next year for that to happen call the shadow chancellor it be obvious to many before the emergency budget that the president of the united states be go to be slap tariff on our export may therefore ask the chancellor why it be that she come forward at the emergency budget with recklessly slender slither of headroom the same headroom that she have at the time of the autumn budget which prove then to be entirely inadequate she blow that headroom and more due to her disastrous economic choice be sorry to disappoint the shadow chancellor but be afraid that because of the ordering of question he be stick with to answer his question he will have see at the budget that we increase the fiscal headroom back to our agreement of billion which be more than the headroom that we inherit from the conservative party the key difference be that this be government who take economic and political stability seriously because when government lose control of the economy they lose control of family finance and ultimately end up in opposition just to correct the record the order paper have not change at all in topical you be quite right about that mr speaker as you be about everything indeed the right hon gentleman be completely wrong when he say that he inherit less headroom than be the case at the autumn budget he inherit on the current budget billion and he take it down to billion to be precise he also loosen the fiscal target which be why he be not underwater already on the target that we have when we be in government may ask he this the fiscal target be look like they will be under great deal of pressure come the autumn there be great deal of speculation and uncertainty among business as to whether this will lead to tax increase can he take away that uncertainty now particularly give the tariff and all the uncertainty that be vest in that to make it clear at that dispatch box that there will be no further increase in taxation on business this parliament my apology mr speaker it be our ordering that cause the problem not the ordering of question in the house the right hon gentleman know that tight decision be take at the budget but we have be very clear that we be work hand in glove with business to be able to bring growth back to the economy and to ensure that investment private sector and public sector be come forward as he will know from his time of swim underwater this government be take different approach to fiscal discipline and he should welcome that the defence sector be vital part of our local economy in derby particularly with the landmark billion deal strike with rolls royce which be support the royal navy submarine and provide major job boost do the chancellor agree that national security go hand in hand with economic security and in turn financial security for household the first duty of any government be to keep the nation safe that be why we be increase defence spending as share of gdp to big sustained increase in defence spending since the end of the cold war derby have vital role to play within the uk defence sector particularly in nuclear engineering and aerospace as demonstrate by the landmark billion deal with rolls royce which will create up to job in the city and protect thousand more call the liberal democrat spokesperson welcome the fast action by the government to convene the automotive industry in reaction to president trump damage tariff but the measure in and of themselves will not create new export market or stimulate demand here in the uk will ministers look at liberal democrat call to reintroduce the plug in car grant and equalise vat for electric vehicle pavement charging will the government instruct the valuation office to scrap business rate for ev charging bay until the transition be complete the support that we announce yesterday on the phase out of internal combustion engine car be very much welcome by the automotive sector it will give much more flexibility around the allowance and around plug in hybrid vehicle all of that be welcome but we be keep watching brief as well as try to ensure that there be new market for car make in britain in other country around the world by secure more trade deal what be the chancellor do to support business and boost wage in town such as burney padiham and brierfield which be forget for year under the previous government my hon friend be do great work support local business in burnley include the digital marketing start up which know he have be champion have be contact by many local business include the cross keys pub in the holt heath nature reserve and the bear café in wimborne they be two different venue in two different location but both tell that these be the most extreme trading condition ever see in hospitality with national insurance minimum wage and energy and food cost will the chancellor consider reduction in vat on hospitality sale to protect high street and local producer and to save our community be unclear give the hon lady remark whether she be oppose to the increase in the national minimum wage but she should know that we have extend support for business in business rate relief this year which would have be end entirely under the plan we inherit from the previous government and there will be permanently low multiplier for retail hospitality and leisure premise on the high street from april as north london mp know that tackle the high housing cost in this city be priority for my constituent it be my belief that one route to that be invest in the country as whole so that we be not just fly on one london shape engine to that end do you know mr speaker that leeds be the large city in western europe that do not have tram or mass transit system that be damn indictment of decade of economic failure will the chancellor do all she can to ensure that the leeds tram be build as fast as possible so that her constituent and mine can be well off hear hear have well declare an interest as proud member of parliament for leeds west and pudsey west yorkshire combine authority be receive million for transport spending through round of the city region sustainable transport settlement that include million for the development of mass transport system for too long leeds have lack this this government will put that investment in and get those tram run with the job tax and the increase in business rate and as result of us tariff it be vital that we stimulate the uk economy what be the chancellor plan and can she expect we to see interest rate fall perhaps if she be listen to the question she would be able to answer think that be question about business rate reform as the right hon lady will know we publish discussion paper on transform business rate be sure that the right hon lady will have read and respond to that so will look out for her consultation response in what we have receive transform business rate be about

emission from long haul flight as well as support investment into decarbonise surface transport to help people get around the country and to their airport opposition members might want to welcome investment into this country as oppose to talk it down will the minister introduce month delay to the incoming change in taxation for double cab pick up truck the manufacturer and their commercial customer feel that they have have insufficient time to adjust to the new change this month can he share with we any impact assessment work carry out on the reclassification of double cab pick up and what effect it would have on the sector in britain we have engage with the automotive sector on this issue and there be generous transitional arrangement in place to mitigate the impact the government have have to take difficult decision but at the autumn budget we prioritise long term support for growth drive sector include more than billion over five year to support the automotive sector ineffective energy trading with the eu be major barrier for global investor accord to energy uk we be lose out on billion of investment in interconnector alone what will the government do to improve our energy trading with the eu to unlock this vital opportunity the prime minister plan for change set out our ambitious but achievable target of clean power by the clean power action plan demonstrate

world trade system in particular what will they do to challenge china status as develop country at the world trade organisation that be the mean by which china dodge so many of the rule impose on country such as britain and other in the west trade issue be for the secretary of state for business and trade but will say this there be rightly concern about global trade imbalance but the response of the united states by put tariff on all country include the uk which do not have trade surplus be disproportionate response to genuine problem of global trade imbalance very much welcome the

mental health be estimate to cost this country up to billion year in lose economic production yesterday the prime minister announce reform to speed up clinical trial to ensure that the good new drug

desperately need and which be shatter by the previous government thank my hon friend for his question and for the invitation to join he in his constituency very much enjoy the regional reception with business leader as have do in every region and nation across the country during the spending review we will continue to work hand in glove with they to unlock investment create job and create growth for everybody across the whole country early when the chancellor be talk about the impact of tariff she pledge that the government would act in our national interest how can it be in the whole national interest so long as the trade law govern northern ireland be not the trade law of the uk but those of foreign jurisdiction namely the eu we have an urgent question shortly we inherit the settlement make by the previous government as the hon and learn member will know there be summit between the uk and the eu on may where we will be look to reduce the barrier to trade between the whole of the united kingdom and the european union we recognise the specific issue around northern ireland particularly in regard to the response to the tariff and we will continue to work with the executive there to ensure that we get the good outcome for the people of northern ireland eu tariff united states and northern ireland economy urgent question to ask the secretary of state for northern ireland if he will update the house on the likely impact on the northern irish economy of eu tariff on the us be grateful to the hon gentleman for his question as the prime minister have say tariff be not good news for anyone and no one want trade war the government be do everything possible to keep britain secure during this new era of global instability and we will always act in the good interest of business in northern ireland as part of our custom territory and internal market northern ireland exporter be face general us tariff and tariff on steel aluminium and car like other exporter across the united kingdom northern ireland be not therefore uniquely disadvantaged we be of course prepare for the eu next move and any possible retaliatory tariff that it may or may not introduce as well as consider the impact that new eu tariff would have on northern ireland business import from the united states of america because under the windsor framework the eu tariff would apply as hon member will know however because of the windsor framework business can reclaim any such tariff through the exist duty reimbursement scheme in case where us import into northern ireland do not then enter the european union the custom duty waiver scheme also allow duty to be waive entirely subject to an overall limit these scheme work in our national interest and his majesty revenue and customs be continue to talk to and support any business that might be affect to help they understand how to use the duty reimbursement and custom duty waiver scheme the minister for the cabinet office have talk about all this with eu counterpart in recent day because the government be fully aware of how sensitive this issue be for business in northern ireland what we need in these circumstance be calm and consider response and that be what the government will continue to provide call the shadow secretary of state thank you very much mr speaker for grant this urgent question it be incredibly important that this house have the opportunity to question the government on this issue before the easter break and before the implementation of these tariff have enormous respect for my opposite number in the northern ireland office but it be totally unacceptable that we should have get to this stage in proceeding without minister come to the house to update we on the likely impact on business in northern ireland of this emerge tariff war between the us and the eu as the house will know this come off the back of the considerable damage do to the economy in northern ireland by the budget last year by the increase in national insurance contribution and by the change to the national minimum wage which have completely undermine business confidence and which be drive unemployment in the region ask the right hon gentleman to answer the follow three question first week on from the united states announcement and some time after the eu publication of page draft of its tariff response have the government now do an impact assessment of what this mean for the northern irish economy and for business in northern ireland and will he publish it secondly he rightly mention the duty reimbursement scheme which would allow business take good from great britain to northern ireland and have to pay the eu tariff to reclaim that tariff that scheme be now go to be put under enormous pressure it be go to have to deal with volume not foresee when it be originally put together do the secretary of state have complete confidence that it will be able to reimburse business in timely fashion so as not to disrupt trade thirdly and finally because northern ireland remain within the eu custom code affect northern ireland business buy affect good will have to pay eu tariff but the same competitive business in gb will not what be the government go to do to ensure that such business be not leave disadvantaged and that we do not see serious distortion of trade with that in mind will the secretary of state confirm to the house that in the event that we see major diversion of trade his government will be prepared to use article of the windsor framework which allow the government to take decision to ensure that business in northern ireland be not damage it be incredibly important that business hear from the secretary of state that the government be prepared to protect they in the event that this tariff war create diversion of trade for business there be grateful to the hon gentleman for his question be slightly surprised by his initial comment because of course we touch on this matter in northern ireland oral question only because raise it indeed but we touch on this matter in northern ireland oral last week and the business secretary make statement to the house last week to answer the hon gentleman question of course the government have be prepare for and look at all eventuality but until we know what the eu retaliatory tariff be it do not make much sense to publish speculation about their potential impact on the duty reimbursement scheme have meet hmrc official because agree with the hon gentleman that it be important that the scheme work effectively depend on the number of northern ireland business that be affect to reimburse tariff would just say however that northern ireland import about million worth of good from the united states of america which be about of northern ireland total purchase that impact upon his third question we be go to have to take this stage at time the prime minister have make it quite clear that he will do what be in the national interest to protect our business our company and our economic future but it be precisely because of the windsor framework that the duty reimbursement scheme exist call the chair of the select committee the eu be currently consult its member state on the good that it may target in response to the us tariff the secretary of state have speak about there be no need to make an assessment yet but in advance of the eu impose retaliatory measure have he make any assessment at all if there be any point be he engage with the european commission to ensure that the interest of northern ireland business and consumer be fully take into account in determine how the eu respond to the us tariff as indicate in answer to the opposition spokesperson of course the government have be prepare for all eventuality but as also indicate there be no point in publish something that be not base on the actual tariff that the eu decide to impose therefore it be sensible to wait until that moment arrive secondly the eu will take such action as it determine to be in its interest in response to the tariff that the united states of america have impose on the eu in addition to the tariff on steel aluminium and car let we not forget that the windsor framework give northern ireland business unique access to the european market which be not something that be enjoy by business in great britain call the liberal democrat spokesperson as the financial times report at the weekend and as think the secretary of state have just confirm in the event of eu retaliatory tariff good import from the united states into northern ireland will by default be effectively force down the red lane that of course mean additional custom check time and red tape and in the event of their imposition eu tariff rate for good come into northern ireland irrespective of their ultimate destination that risk scenario where northern ireland importer be penalise more than almost any other business in either the uk or the eu first at the border and then in administer the reclamation of those cost let we be clear this chaotic situation be entirely the consequence of donald trump destructive trade war what be the government do to ensure that president trump and the us administration be alert to the deeply destabilising effect of their tariff policy on the good friday agreement and the prospect of peace in northern ireland what active step be the government take to mitigate the potential disruption to northern ireland business that be now unwittingly catch up in donald trump trade war the single most important thing we can do for those business in northern ireland be as indicate moment ago to ensure that the duty reimbursement scheme work speedily and effectively provide that those business can demonstrate that their good be not move into the european union for the obvious reason that otherwise northern ireland would become back door for good seek to avoid the retaliatory tariff the government will take all necessary step to protect british business in the very difficult circumstance that we be face include by continue to seek to negotiate an economic deal with the united states of america which we have be engage in for week now what come out of that remain to be see but it be part of the government calm and consider approach the complexity of trade relationship on the island of ireland be result of brexit work north south be as important as work east west do the secretary of state agree that strengthen relationship not just with the european union but with the republic of ireland government can put northern ireland into pivotal position to navigate this new uncertainty we be all have to navigate this new uncertainty as result of the decision that the us administration have make it be certainly true that leave the european union have create new complexity the reason why there be windsor framework be that there be two entity the united kingdom and the european union with different trading rule but an open border and some method therefore have to be find to deal with the consequence of that as have say to the house before try to wish away that basic fact have not really work it be important that we keep cool head there will be attempt subsequent to my question to relitigate the brexit war the fact of the matter be that the brexit deal and the windsor framework give northern ireland unique competitive advantage export and access to the single market will the secretary of state consider rapid automatic reimbursement scheme as the shadow secretary of state allude to that scheme be at the centre of ease tension should there be retaliation on the eu side the right hon gentleman be absolutely right about the benefit that the windsor framework have give business in northern ireland in term of access to the eu market would just say to he that in the event of eu retaliatory tariff rapid automatic do not quite square with the need of business in northern ireland that import american good because they have to demonstrate that those good be not then move on to the european union that require they to provide evidence to hmrc in order to get the tariff reimburse thank the secretary of state for his initial response to the urgent question of course this situation be reminder that the people of northern ireland be absolutely right to oppose brexit in that referendum be really disappointed that the shadow secretary of state start his supplementary question by complain about the lowest pay worker in northern ireland get pay rise absolutely incredible the secretary of state touch on the trade negotiation between the uk and the united states can he reassure we that the situation in northern ireland be absolutely at the heart of those negotiation be very happy to assure my hon friend that the interest of all part of the united kingdom include northern ireland be uppermost in the mind of all ministers in try to deal with the situation we now find ourselves in the secretary of state say that the eu will take action on tariff in its good interest but business in northern ireland expect the government to take action in the good interest of the united kingdom include northern ireland which be part of the united kingdom he talk about how this can all be resolve by the reimbursement scheme the fact of the matter be that the reimbursement scheme have fail business have to produce mass of information and there be delay in payment some business have to wait for hundred of thousand of pound to be reimburse in taxis that be not the answer surely the answer be for the uk to collect the taxis that we impose on american good and leave the eu to collect the taxis that it impose what the right hon gentleman propose ignore the reality that face northern ireland as result of the united kingdom decision to leave the european union and the fact that there be problem that have to be solve the duty reimbursement scheme owe its existence to the windsor framework it be important as have say to the house that the scheme work effectively but business do need to provide information to demonstrate that the good have not subsequently move into the european union for reason that think he understand be particularly concerned about the cash flow of small business in northern ireland in the event that the eu increase its tariff in his discussion with hmrc have the secretary of state establish what the average waiting time be for the duty reimbursement scheme to kick in be there any prospect of shortening that time if the amount of money out of the door increase in the event of eu tariff the hon gentleman raise an important point for business in northern ireland as he would expect have have precisely that discussion with hmrc the honest answer to the question of how long it take be that it depend on how quickly business provide the necessary information to demonstrate that good have remain in the united kingdom and have not move to the eu once that information be provide the scheme should work effectively it may help he if point out that the customs duty waiver scheme separate scheme allow up to per company over three year rolling average which will obviously benefit small business if they come within that heading they do not have to pay the tariff up front sadly have hear nothing today that will give business in my constituency any reassurance that the uk government be prepared to protect they recognise that it be not good practice to comment on speculation but it be and would be good practice to leave business in no doubt that the government their government to whom they pay hefty taxis will protect they from eu tariff we can not be leave in scenario where business be reliant on duty reimbursement scheme that do not work it take month to get repayment will the secretary of state give more clarity to business in upper bann that he will protect they have do my level well to set out the situation we all understand the reason northern ireland gain from the windsor framework because of its well it do gain from access to the eu market that other part of the united kingdom do not enjoy but there be consequence which be what we be discuss in relation to the imposition of tariff by the united states of america that be decision that the us administration have take and we all have to deal with the consequence hmrc have of course already be talk to business that might be affect to ensure that they understand how the tariff reimbursement scheme and the customs duty waiver scheme work the government advice to northern ireland business seem to be keep calm and carry on well that create an awful lot of uncertainty for small and medium sized enterprise in northern ireland will the secretary of state put little more meat on the bone in relation to what the government be do as he say the eu will take action in its interest but that action may not be in the interest of northern ireland business or consumer what will the government do in the circumstance in which this country and many country around the world find themselves we be have this discussion because of decision that the united states administration have take we do not control that what we do have to seek to control be our response to it have try to lay out for the house today what the position be and what be available to support business that may be affect by the eu tariff once we understand what those be we will see how extensive they may or may not be and then business will start to work out for themselves what be the consequence and how we can use the mechanism of the reimbursement scheme in the windsor framework to get back the money that they have to pay in tariff business require clarity and certainty will the secretary of state undertake to come back to the house as soon as we have that clarity and certainty will he ensure that the eu understand that the open border he keep talk about be an unclosable border and try to give business more certainty so that they can develop in the future notwithstanding what we have be discuss today northern ireland import about million worth of good from the united states of america which be about of the total purchase make by northern ireland the of the purchase be unaffected by any eu retaliatory tariff relate to good bring into northern ireland as travel round northern ireland see that there be great business opportunity and lot of investment come in as say to the house last week northern ireland have high rate of growth than the uk as whole and the low unemployment as secretary of state for northern ireland be the right hon gentleman not embarrass that he and his government have no control over the tariff in respect of good import into northern ireland be the obvious and inevitable answer not to repatriate to the united kingdom control over trade law what happen if northern ireland be use as conduit by the republic of ireland or the eu to export good to the us who check those good and where as think have say to the hon and learn gentleman before would not have start from here myself in relation to the cause that lead eventually to the negotiation of the windsor framework which be huge improvement on the northern ireland protocol we do not control the decision that the united states administration have take what we have to do be make sure that we stand with business include in northern ireland to provide they with support and mechanism that allow they to reclaim the tariff be the most practical step we can take it be already in place because of the windsor framework the secretary of state have outline the case but be afraid he have not give any answer and that be disappointing the promise be make to northern ireland mp that we would not be disadvantage by any eu retention that be clearly not to be the case and government need to address that directly will the secretary of state set out when discussion to extricate northern ireland from eu rule will begin and when we can expect to see our interest look after as be promise by both the prime minister and the secretary of state be here

forward new mandatory duty to report child sexual abuse for individual in england undertaking activity with child and crucially new criminal offence of obstruct an individual from make report under that duty mandatory reporting will create culture of openness and honesty rather than cover up and secrecy it will empower professional and volunteer to take prompt decisive action to report sexual

scheme or compensation to victim and survivor who be affect we continue to support those scheme as recognition by those institution that they badly fail child in their care on the iicsa proposal for wide national redress scheme for all victim and survivor of child sexual abuse in institutional setting the scale of that proposal demand that it be consider in the context of the spending review later this year and we will make further update at that stage one crucial area where we want to make immediate progress be the provision of therapeutic service for victim and survivor of child sexual

therefore remove the three year limitation period on victim and survivor bring personal injury claim in the civil court and shift the burden of proof from survivor to defendant thereby protect victim from have to relive their trauma to get the compensation they be owe today update build on the measure that the home secretary announce in january demonstrate this government steadfast commitment to tackle child sexual abuse the measure we be implement will protect more child find more criminal and deliver support and justice to more victim and survivor but this be not the end point it be just the beginning we will continue to drive forward reform to protect more child from abhorrent abuse and support more adult survivor of those traumatic crime as we pursue our safe street mission we will use every available lever to drive progress on these issue across government and beyond want to finish with word for the victim and survivor no one should go through what they do while the failing of the past can not be undo we can we must and we will strain every sinew to prevent they from be repeat commend this statement to the house call shadow minister katie lam thank the minister for advance sight of her statement in january the home secretary say that the government would conduct five local inquiry into the rape gang who have terrorise so many innocent child more than three month since the government announce those local inquiry tom crowther kc barrister invite by the home office to help establish they know almost nothing about their progress and neither do we why be the framework for local inquiry now be lead by ministers rather than by independent voice such as tom crowther why be the million set aside for inquiry no long be allocate but instead deliver on an opt in basis what do the government intend to do about local leader who say there be no need for an independent inquiry as they do in bradford and in wales the girl we be talk about be predominantly white the man who prey on they be predominantly muslim generally either from pakistan or of pakistani heritage one of the victim from dewsbury be tell by her rapist we here to fuck all the white girl and fuck the government do the minister accept that in many case these crime be racially and religiously aggravate how without national inquiry can we understand what part those factor play there be no question but that the state have fail these child time and again take the case of anna from bradford vulnerable and in residential care at the age of she make repeat report of rape and abuse to social worker who be responsible for she just the follow year age she marry her abuser in traditional islamic wedding ceremony far from step in to stop it her social worker be guest the authority then arrange for she to be foster by her abuser parent the ringleader of the rochdale rape gang shabir ahmed be employ as welfare right officer by oldham council yet not one person not one have be convict for cover up these institutionalise rape why have ministers refuse to establish dedicated unit in the national crime agency to investigate councillor and official accuse of collusion and corruption be sorry to say that that unit must also investigate police officer in one case the father of an abuse victim in rotherham be arrest by south yorkshire police when he attempt to rescue his daughter from her abuser he be detain twice in one night while on the very same evening his daughter be repeatedly assault and abuse by gang of man it be clear that these criminal be unafraid of law enforcement in kirklees judge marson say you be see with your victim on at least three occasion by the police none of that deter you and you continue to rape she how without national inquiry can we know how and why these monster enjoy effective immunity for so long and how can we be sure that it will not happen again conservative members have vote for national inquiry and table amendment that would guarantee the publication of ethnicity datum on quarterly basis terminate the parental right of convict sex offender and make membership of grooming gang an aggravate factor during sentencing so that offender get the long harsh sentence that they deserve will the minister commit to accept those amendment to protect our child finally would like to read to the house one particular ordeal just one example of what these child have suffer must warn colleague and especially those in the gallery that this be extremely graphic but we must not look away or sanitise this evil sentencing mohammed karrar of oxford to life in prison judge peter rook say you prepare be his victim year old girl for gang anal rape by use pump to expand her anal passage you subject she to gang rape by five or six man at one point she have four man inside she red ball be place in her mouth to keep she quiet when she be after rap she she threaten you with your lock knife your reaction be to pick up baseball bat with silver metal handle strike she on the head with it and then insert the baseball bat inside her vagina this be not about the minister the home secretary or any hon member in the chamber it be about the little girl up and down our country whose brutal and repeat rape be permit and hide by those in the british state whose job be to protect they they deserve justice in five town those child and their family may get partial answer but have mention five town in the past few minute alone and there be at least more in those place child and their family will get no answer at all so what do the minister have to say to they the british people deserve to know the truth what dark truth do the suffering of those girl reveal about this country and why will the government not find out thank the hon lady think it be shame that she refer to only one sort of child abuse victim when the statement be clearly about all child abuse victim there should be no hierarchy we be also talk about child rap by their father or rap in other circumstance such as in child home and institution over many year it be shame that she do not speak about any of their experience notwithstanding the very graphic and upsetting story that she do tell obviously have work for many year with the exact girl that the hon lady talk about much of what she already know be because of the inquiry that have already occur such as in rotherham and in rochdale she do not refer at all to the two year inquiry that be part of the iicsa panel that be statutory inquiry that look into lot of area and wonder if she maybe want to reacquaint herself with the page of that report understand the hon lady sense of anger and urgency about the issue none of this be her fault she be not here at the time but she work with the then minister who sit in office where now sit and do not lift single finger on any of the recommendation contain in the jay inquiry the shadow home secretary the right hon member for croydon south chris philp spend almost two year as minister for crime policing and fire during his time in that role he hold external meeting include separate meeting on the policing of protest but not once do he hold discussion on groom gang or what the police be do to investigate they he do not have one meeting with the police victim local authority or alexis jay who have some choice word to say about some of the special adviser do not know if the hon lady know who they be in the department when alexis jay be try to get her requirement across the line today the government have publish detailed and systematic action plan for the future it be not about headline it be about the frontline it be about how these thing be go to take time in lot and lot of area of our country this do not happen overnight because somebody win political argument it be go to take work and very much welcome the hon lady join unlike in the year when be the opposition spokesperson when the current shadow home secretary never bother to involve welcome today action plan particularly welcome the creation of new child protection authority and the doubling of funding for group who be help survivor and victim of child abuse up and down the country the independent inquiry into grooming gang in rochdale commission by greater manchester mayor andy burnham be detailed and thorough and find serious failing by the statutory authority the priority for my constituent be to ensure that we be protect woman and girl in the here and now as well as convict perpetrator of past crime few people know that there be no specific criminal offence of grooming so may thoroughly welcome the government decision to make groom an aggravating offence in child sex abuse with long sentence that be long overdue as it be recommend in alexis jay inquiry but ignore by the previous government have enjoy work with my hon friend and other people in rochdale over the year on these issue hope that place like rochdale where there have already be independent inquiry will be able to access some of the flexible fund to do victim lead follow up work on where we be now look forward to work with my hon friend in the future and yes too be pleased that grooming will be an aggravating factor it be recommendation from jay in fact it be recommend even before the final iicsa recommendation call the spokesperson for the liberal democrat party thank the minister for advance sight of the statement and for the progress update to parliament as promise we welcome the progress that be be make by the government on this issue which tragically continue to blight our society as the minister say child across this country be still victim of these abhorrent crime and survivor await justice from previous abuse and exploitation the liberal democrats believe as member from across the house would echo that no child should ever be subject to sexual abuse or exploitation and it be clear that real action be need to prevent such sickening act from occur we have make it clear that step must be take at all level of government to well protect child from sexual abuse and exploitation in the future and to fully deliver justice for survivor and victim in particular we welcome the government announcement of new child protection authority and extra funding for national service that support adult survivor of sexual abuse in fact my hon friend the member for twickenham munira wilson table an amendment to the children wellbeing and schools bill to establish child protection authority and know she be delighted to see that come forward today the lib dems be commit to work proactively and constructively with the government and the whole house to support and protect vulnerable child at risk of exploitation and abuse unlike the conservatives sadly who be still shamefully use the victim of groom gang scandal as political the liberal democrats continue to commend the work of the independent inquiry into child sexual abuse by professor alexis jay we continue to call on the government to urgently implement all of her recommendation that as the minister have mention the conservatives fail to act on in government the minister have speak about some of the recommendation today namely national leadership learn on child protection and safeguarding and mandatory duty to report but can she commit today to implement all the report recommendation in so do can she confirm that the new child protection authority will act as national oversight mechanism to monitor the implementation of the jay review recommendation across all relevant agency and departments if not will such mechanism be bring forward the lib dems support anything that will deliver justice for victim and help to prevent these sicken crime from happen in future thank the hon lady for her comment and the hon member for twickenham munira wilson for her work in this area be always keen to encourage cross party work on these issue and recognise that the child protection agency have be push for previously consultation will be launch on exactly what the oversight mechanism of the cpa will look like it will initially be part of the national panel and that will then be build on the consultation will take time rather than up end an entire system that will be the process that we will go through and would very much welcome help from member across the house in that process on the implementation of all the recommendation in the jay review detailed plan have be publish today as part of this announcement invite hon member to look at that and to push for more as would do if be not in my current ministerial position when alexis jay appear before the home affairs committee early this year she be clear that at no point in seven year under seven conservative home secretaries do anyone say that her inquiry be either too broad or too narrow and nobody suggest to she that there need to be further inquiry beyond what she produce welcome the minister announcement that the three year limitation period will be lift because we know that the average length of abuse for child be four year and the average length of time that it take someone to disclose their abuse be year will the minister set out how the child protection authority will work in practice what will the funding situation be and what discussion have the minister have with the treasury what be the timing to get it up and run as soon as possible and may ask for guarantee that the voice of survivor will be central in the establishment of the authority agree with my hon friend that the voice of survivor have to be part of absolutely everything that we do go forward the cpa will immediately form part of the panel and extra funding will be provide in this year funding to build on the analytical resource that it need the consultation will be ongoing with expert include the like of alexis jay who have be very involved in the conversation finally unfortunately she have previously be leave out in the cold and we will look at what the good model will be along with survivor and expert in the field have to say that be completely infuriate by today statement here we be on the very last sit day before the easter recess and the government have all but admit that no real progress whatsoever have be make on their promise to launch five local rape gang inquiry before easter it get bad for more than five year leader at the very top of bradford council in my constituency have deny refuse and cover up every single time and victim survivor and their family have call for full rape gang inquiry across keighley and the wide bradford district yet the minister and this government refuse to face the fact bradford leadership simply will not act by itself so why be this government let the very council that fail victim decide whether they want to be investigate when will this government step up use their statutory power and give the victim and survivor in area such as keighley and the wide bradford district the full inquiry that they have want for almost two decade first and foremost pay the hon gentleman absolute credit for year he have speak up about this issue be actually surprised that we have not have close conversation would very much welcome some time with he to understand exactly what be go on in his local area think that be actually be arrange from the letter he have send to be more than happy to sit down with he absolutely nothing that have say today suggest that bradford would not be able to access funding from the home office just as oldham have to undertake the work that might be need there would very much welcome conversation with he about that welcome the minister statement and the progress that she be make thank she for her very long and deep commitment to this issue and to see justice for victim will ask she about the version of mandatory reporting that she propose to introduce my understanding be that the mandatory reporting duty will apply in situation where person have witness abuse or receive disclosure of abuse which seem to be quite high bar there be many example of abuse take place in school and in child home for example in which it emerge later that suspicion of abuse be very widespread but nobody witness the abuse receive disclosure of it or report their suspicion allow the abuse to continue be my hon friend confident that the version of mandatory reporting that she be introduce be at the right threshold will she commit to review the impact of the new measure once it have take effect and to strengthen it in future if need praise my hon friend for her commitment to these issue over the year she be right the threshold for mandatory reporting be finely balanced tool we have to land on the criminal justice outcome for the most egregious case as other member have mention where it seem that social worker be directly cover up and where there be professional sanction when people just fail to report she talk about the issue of sign very much hope that that will be deal with in the training and the roll out of this measure but when any new law come into place and we roll out training we will absolutely review it as we go along welcome the mandatory reporting progress it be worth acknowledge the bill that lead through the house which have now pay out million in northern ireland to survivor of institutional sexual abuse during the progress of that bill and the discussion have the mealy mouthed apology from institution be abhorrent may urge the minister to push very hard on church institution and other institution to ensure that they pay and they apologise absolutely some of the change that the right hon gentleman will read about in the document that will be publish subsequently concern that exact issue of an apology and the limitation of mealy mouthed apology what that mean to the victim be so awful so will absolutely commit to push the institution to do exactly what they need to do to make honest apology have to say that in recent week and month we have not always have the good example of that on display the victim of child sexual abuse be badly let down by institution we must recognise that this continue and that it be the responsibility of we all to act so warmly welcome the commitment to introduce mandatory reporting it have take too long to get to this place will the minister say little more about the training that will be available to professional and volunteer so that they can spot the sign and indicator will she say more about how we will ensure that local victim panel be resource adequately in answer to my hon friend first question at the beginning of next month we will publish exactly how local panel can be set up and the work that can happen in local authority area alongside the mandatory duty legislation there will be write guidance and training will be provide when we talk about people who work with child we often think of teacher or social worker but we be also talk about sport coach people in the clergy and lot of other people so the guidance will have to be both quite widely draw and specific welcome the minister statement share her disappointment that the conservatives have seek to pick out one particular community day after day in this chamber they vilify muslims as somebody who have muslim family and brown skin say that we feel increasingly uncomfortable in our own country give the attack that we hear day after day from the conservatives on all muslims it be an absolute disgrace welcome the child protection authority on the fact that the conservatives do not introduce it when they be in government and able to do so professor jay tell that they claim that they do not have legislative time we all know that they do press the minister to give her personal assurance that she will work with her colleague in the department for science innovation and technology to ensure that we strengthen our online safety regulation and do not water it down in any way because professor jay be very clear that online sexual exploitation and abuse be huge and grow absolutely agree with the hon lady even in the two and half year since alexis jay publish her review we have come to know even more about the harm occur online the online safety act finally come into force only last month but the government have make it clear that where there be need to go far on various issue such as on the recommendation make by alexis jay we will absolutely look at that as many have say any time we look at child sexual abuse in this place and beyond we must always put the victim first welcome the statement by the safeguarding minister and the emphasis that she have place on support police investigation across the country to get justice for victim and to ensure that those responsible be put behind bar the grooming gang taskforce contribute to arrest and we have hear today that there be arrest in the last month of will she give we further detail on how the new measure will ensure that we can truly work collaboratively across government police force the public sector and local authority to protect all child from sexual abuse and to ensure that as government we do not allow the shameful failure of institution that protect themselves before they protect our child my hon friend be absolutely right really work in partnership and not just say that we be be important at the high level here in these building and in whitehall we have set up an inter ministerial group be member of it together with the under secretary of state for education my hon friend the member for lewisham east janet daby to ensure that we be work together the level of engagement from ministers and secretaries of state work through the cabinet office have make it pleasure to produce these document we have to make sure that this work be also happen locally measure in the children wellbeing and schools bill to improve multi agency working and the reform of social work will be vital to our finally get grip on this issue know that the minister will join in pay tribute to child sexual abuse specialist prosecutor who deploy their considerable expertise to put together case that can be base on complex and as we have hear very distressing evidence will the minister make sure that fair share of resource reach those prosecutor she will recognise that just as the public expect child sexual abuse to be detect they also expect it to be effectively prosecute the right hon and learn gentleman make really good point the legal process be forget part of the system have work for many year with nazir afzal for example who be the prosecutor on the rochdale case can say that those prosecutor can really be forget we have ask the joint inspectorate to look specifically into the justice system and what need to be do but there be undoubtedly case wait in the long backlog because the prosecutor defence and court space be not available deal with that have to be part of much big piece of work but will absolutely take away what the right hon and learn gentleman have say thank my hon friend for her statement and pay tribute to she for her considerable expertise in this field the victim survivor of childhood sexual abuse have spend far too long wait for justice as my hon friend say childhood sexual abuse know no hierarchy it also know no border we have different legislative system within this country and we can not allow action to be take in one area only with victim potentially be leave out what discussion be my hon friend have with the scottish government so that we can take this work forward on joint basis we have have discussion with our scottish counterpart on some of the legislation that we be currently pass include the legislation on child sexual abuse online artificial intelligence and some of the danger that alexis jay rightly point out in the final recommendation of her report we have those conversation obviously issue of child protection be devolve to scotland but we can not do this work in isolation especially because child be traffic across the border be always very happy to work with counterpart in the scottish government to drive progress and frankly to learn from they sometimes share the anger and frustration express by my hon friend the member for keighley and ilkley robbie moore about the lack of progress on inquire into the rape gang and be incredibly disappoint by the minister failure to answer single question put to she by the shadow minister my hon friend the member for weald of kent katie lam include the refusal to acknowledge that these crime be racially and religiously aggravate will repeat just one of those question in many of the rape gang case councillor council worker and police officer be complicit and often corrupt so why be the government refuse to set up specialist unit in the national crime agency to investigate those who should have protect those innocent girl but instead participate in and facilitate their abuse to answer the hon gentleman question if criminal case can be bring against any of those people be more than happy to speak to the taskforce that be work to improve the number of arrest as say we have see an increase in arrest and see where criminal case can be bring against they be more than happy to see those people lock up for as long as they deserve however we be leave for some decade without mandatory reporting duty on the statute book one that would enable we to take to task through the criminal justice system the people who cover this up we will rectify that thank the minister for her statement do not think there be anyone who could lead more credibly on this issue it be absolutely disgusting that the last government have week to implement the recommendation of the jay inquiry but implement absolutely zero of they yet conservative members come here today to grandstand on this issue decade ago the director of public prosecutions recommend mandatory reporting he happen to be our prime minister now of course so it have take year for this to happen what have be lose in that time and what can be gain in the come year unfortunately what have be lose in that time be the ability to hold people to account even if in statutory inquiry information be find out for example about councillor that would not lead to their arrest that be not what statutory inquiry do nobody be in prison as result of any of the statutory inquiry we have have so we want to focus our attention on criminalise those people be afraid to say that in the absence of mandatory reporting we have see lot of people get away with cover up in the intervene year what hope for the future be not that see lot of people lock up who be bad but that this change create culture of openness and transparency in child protection service that be what should be celebrate not the reputation of the organisation my blood be boil as listen to the stuff come from conservative members if they have read the independent inquiry into child sexual abuse they would recognise that there be hundred of thousand of people alive today people just like white girl who suffer at the hand of white man who have get clean away with it because nothing be do for so long welcome today statement think it be absolutely brilliant and be very glad to hear that it be the start of plan not the finish of course this be not rocket science recognise the value of mandatory reporting and the importance of criminalise those who obstruct reporting by individual but could we step that down little bit and say that those who coerce people into not report or gently discourage they from do so should also be criminalise as the minister know have be work on an amendment to clause of the crime and policing bill that would cover religious institution and faith base organisation there should no long be convention of absolute confidentiality for those who take confession in religious setting there be conflict and tension there we need to make sure in some way that it be make explicit that no one should be exclude from mandatory reporting thank the hon lady for her question we now have many law on coercion in our country pass law on coercion be something that the previous government do do if it can be evidence that anybody coerce somebody into not report or gently try to cover something up that would be see as criminal and consider to be cover up obviously this will all be test when such case come to pass funnily enough the crime and policing bill committee which be also mean to be on may get up to clause today we will get back to that committee immediately after this statement be more than happy to have conversation with the hon lady but the church faith leader and faith group be absolutely within the purview of the measure make sure that we do not create workaround for certain thing be in everybody good interest the shadow minister my hon friend the member for weald of kent katie lam give very graphic and disturbing example of horrific abuse suffer by just couple of the young lady affect by these grooming gang she ask important question about the gang and be disappoint that instead of answer her question the minister talk about the number of meeting that her predecessor have have and about the fact that many girl be abuse by people who be not in groom gang of course that be true but both be important the minister in answer to an early question invite another member to push for more as would do if be not in my current ministerial position why be the inquiry limit to only five area what about those in the other area do she not recognise that give people choice on whether their area be investigate or not be an incentive for those who wish to cover up either to not bid or to not bid well for those inquiry above all who or what be prevent she from deliver the more that she would push for if she be sit here absolutely nobody be stop from push for more as be sure all my ministerial colleague would tell the hon lady have be in meeting with think this be about the point of view of parliament parliament be here to strength test the thing we do and welcome that to the point that the hon member for wells and mendip hills tessa munt make this be just the beginning not the end as say in my statement the detail of how local area can bid into that scheme will as have say be publish by the end of the month mention groom gang victim many many time throughout my statement also mention other victim in the many other inquiry that have go on only wish that people be quite so well verse in some of the other area my only criticism of the shadow minister on the shadow front bench be that she only mention one mention many know the minister be passionate about this issue and commend she for her effort would she not agree that the sentencing for these most abhorrent crime need to truly reflect the seriousness of the offence do not think anyone can sit in this house today and not be break or feel sick to the pit of their stomach when we hear account from the front benchers anyone who take away the innocence of child must serve the tough of sentence after all these child have be subject to lifetime of trauma as result of these horrific act the hon lady make good point because for the victim have work with over the year it be life sentence it be not something that go away that be one of the reason feel strongly about try to improve the level of therapeutic support for child and adult and that have be real priority for she be absolutely right on the sentencing the government be undertake sentencing review in the broad sense and we be put groom as an aggravating factor into sentencing and into the law be mean to be in two place at once and in fact that clause be probably be discuss in committee literally right now welcome the government statement and the progress they be make on implement recommendation from the jay review and be deeply disappointed that the conservatives have choose to respond to the statement in this way and refuse to acknowledge any progress that the government be make after year of inaction on the conservatives part as the minister know before be elect to this house be the chief executive of devon rape crisis and sexual abuse services an organisation that support victim of child sexual abuse know how vital these support service be to rebuild the life of those who have be shatter by abuse help they to become adult who can live more settled and fulfil life that organisation be deal with funding cut of around third and it have already have to close its helpline know that many other similar organisation across the country be face similar cliff edge due to funding cut as well as pressure from inflation and national insurance increase warmly welcome the minister announcement of doubling in funding for adult survivor of child sexual abuse what step be the government take to ensure that child who have be victim of child sexual exploitation and grooming can receive timely access to appropriate victim support and trauma inform service specifically on victim of groom we will set out the commissioning for the new service across england and wales for the independent child traffic guardian as say in my statement child who access through the national referral mechanism as traffic victim lot of british child who be groom access through that system will be able to access support through that service as be lay out in the document improvement be need in child sexual violence therapeutic support anyone who have work on the frontline would know that as would anyone who have try to make referral through the generic service it would be disingenuous of to stand here before the comprehensive spending review and make commitment be not sure the chancellor would thank but one of the major recommendation of iicsa be about child therapeutic support which be very much at the front of my mind while we go through the comprehensive spending review thank the minister for her answer and her commitment to bring justice for the victim no one deny that the hon lady have big heart and real determination to get the answer we all wish to see with sexual offence at an all time high in northern ireland know that she have an interest in northern ireland and with some such incident record between april and march which be an increase of some on the previous year it be clear that the protection of child our most vulnerable people need to be priority what discussion will she have with the northern ireland assembly to ensure that northern ireland have the support need to address these horrifying figure we have to understand that every incident report sit against those that be not we be perhaps just not get to the real figure agree with the hon gentleman that although we have argument in this house about datum what datum have not be collect and what progress we have make the reality be that we will never know about the vast majority of datum because we do not ever see it that be something we should all strive to overcome visit northern ireland recently and go to the police service of northern ireland and work specifically with the team deal with online child sex abuse we look at the process they be undertake through undercover action on that particular issue that will continue and not just because part of my heart be in northern ireland through my father have work with the psni and meet those in the executive know that there be real determination in northern

office update with your permission madam deputy speaker wish to make statement on the post office horizon redress and post office finance we inherit post office in crisis it have grim past poor commercial track record unstable leadership and its record on compensation be widely perceive as legalistic slow and adversarial since this government come into office the total amount of redress pay

million have now be pay to more than claimant we have also establish new compensation scheme so that those postmaster who finally have their conviction overturn by parliament last year get redress we be work on our approach to redress for postmaster who fall victim to the flaw in the capture system unlike the previous government we set out clear forecast for compensation within the autumn budget of billion from as the house will know the government previously commit to provide the majority of group litigation order claimant with substantial redress by the end of march can confirm that as promise of those who submit claim for compensation have receive substantial redress all those who submit claim before christmas have receive an offer or in one case substantial interim payment instead we will also take further step to increase the pace at which claimant challenge can be resolve fairly facilitated discussion will be reintroduce to the glo scheme for this purpose most recently we announce that from june my department will take over responsibility for the overturn conviction scheme from the post office we have also welcome fujitsu commitment to contribute to the government compensation for the victim of the scandal during meeting between the secretary of state and fujitsu chief executive officer in march an agreement be reach on begin talk ahead of the conclusion of sir wyn williams inquiry the house will be aware that the secretary of state announce the government intention to establish an appeal mechanism for claimant who be unhappy with offer that they have receive under the post office horizon shortfall scheme today we be publish the guidance and principle for the hss appeal and by the end of this month we will begin to accept application from eligible postmaster who be currently involve in the post office dispute resolution process the document set out the underlie rule that will govern the assessment of appeal and also provide information on for instance the eligibility criterion to help postmaster and their legal representative make their claim we develop this in consultation with the horizon compensation advisory board claimant lawyer and representative of postmaster organisation later this month we will begin write to the legal representative of potentially eligible postmaster who be currently involve in the dispute resolution process invite they to transfer their claim to the new hss appeal scheme if postmaster do not have legal representative we will write to they directly shortly after that we will open the scheme to all other eligible postmaster as with the glo scheme my department will aim to respond within work day of the submission of substantially complete appeal in at least of case we will encourage postmaster enter the process to engage legal adviser and we will meet their reasonable legal cost through tariff that we have agree with claimant lawyer postmaster will not have to pay penny of income tax capital gain tax national insurance contribution corporation tax or inheritance tax on any compensation that they receive through the new process as we look to the future we will also continue to address any concern about the post office past behaviour be therefore pleased to be able to provide an update on the government fund post office process review scheme which will provide redress for postmaster who lose out financially owe to issue connect with post office product policy or process those issue be unrelated to horizon but be part of the company effort to rebuild trust with its postmaster and ensure that past failing be fully address the scheme be due to be launch in the next month and the post office will write to all of those potentially affect with further detail include information on how postmaster can apply we will consider carefully the condition and recommendation of sir wyn williams inquiry when it be publish while tackle the awful legacy of the horizon scandal the government be also determined to make the post office more sustainable for the future and we remain committed to publish green paper to consider its long term future in particular look forward to hear the vision and idea of stakeholder include key trade union sub postmaster and other it have be apparent for some time that the post office be heavily reliant on government funding its chair transformation plan be announce in november with the aim of put the company on path towards financial stability and deliver new deal for postmaster the plan require the company to make difficult decision about for example the need to look seriously at efficiency in its headquarters and the branch network to ensure that it be fit for purpose today the post office have announce that it would be move to fully franchise network as part of those plan that will realise significant saving potentially amount to million over the duration of the current parliament before this announcement many member write to express concern about their local directly manage branch and we have hear those concern the post office will therefore ensure that each directly manage branch will be franchise either on site or in location nearby so that service provision will remain in place in community make those change will ensure that the company be more sustainable to support post office provision in every community across the uk the government plan to provide up to million of subsidy next year that be up from the million provide under the last government and be in addition to the uplift that we provide in the last financial year the post office need to transform the outdated technology on which it depend and we therefore plan to provide up to million of funding for its new future technology portfolio in the financial year over the next five year this work will address technology need across the business which will include replace horizon reduce central cost and ensure that postmaster have the tool they need to serve their customer to enable the post office to continue to administer redress payment to postmaster and respond to the post office horizon it inquiry the government will provide up to million of funding these funding stream be subject to the subsidy control act and referral to the competition and markets authority an announcement on banking framework have not yet be make but be hopeful that there will be positive announcement soon as post office continue to provide vital banking service in every community up and down the country together these step will help to pave the way towards more sustainable future for the post office during my engagement with the national federation of subpostmasters concern have be raise that the post office may have act improperly in the course of the network transformation programme during the there be claim that the post office and its representative put undue pressure on postmaster and may have give unregulated financial advice to encourage they to move on to contract that be ultimately not in their good interest those allegation must be take seriously be therefore commission an independent review of the conduct of the programme to establish whether there be any improper or coercive behaviour and will update the house on the scope and timing of the review in due course it remain our priority to speed up the delivery of fair compensation to all the victim of the horizon scandal and to secure and strengthen the post office for the future there be more to do but commend this statement to the house thank the minister for his statement and for advance sight of it also thank the campaigner on this issue with whom work for more than five year both as back bencher and as front bencher and indeed thank lord beamish and lord arbuthnot for their work on the horizon compensation advisory board which we establish on cross party basis during our tenure agree with the minister that although good progress have be make there be much more to do it be good that million have be pay to sub postmaster tenfold increase on what we see only couple of year ago it be clear that most of that have go out of the door because of what this parliament do last june when it overturn the conviction by statute and because of the introduction of fix sum award which have revolutionise the ability to pay compensation quickly be proud to say that we do all that in the house on cross party basis and it be the right thing to do work with the then shadow secretary of state for business and trade and with this minister and other in their former role and our work be strongly support by the then prime minister my right hon friend the member for richmond and northallerton rishi sunak the then business secretary who be now leader of the opposition and the then chancellor and his ministers be therefore little disappointed that the minister have seek to suggest that he take over crisis we have make much progress on this matter on cross party basis and my remark today will continue to be make on that basis but for all the progress the minister talk about in his statement do not hear about single aspect of the horizon programme that be not already in train under the last government in conjunction with the then opposition the minister mention three and half fold increase in july which welcome but as he will no doubt concede it happen as result of the overturning of the conviction by parliament and the introduction of the compensation scheme the redress scheme for example be set in train by the last government with the co operation of the then opposition as be the investigation of capture the minister say that the compensation be not budget for but that be not right last year budget simply say that the money have be reallocate from departmental expenditure to annual manage expenditure he imply that the money be not there to pay out to postmaster when the work have be do on cross party basis it be absolutely wrong to give that impression to people out there who be still wait for redress the hss appeal system be something that we advocate for and put in place as be the fix sum award for overturn conviction and the horizon shortfall scheme the minister talk about the unstable leadership of the post office we think it be right to put new chair in place and we have every confidence that nigel railton whom we put in place will do fantastic job we support his transformation plan and the move to fully franchise network which we think be the right thing to do will ask the minister some question if may it be not clear what he will do about victim of the capture programme even though it have be acknowledge that the post office be at fault in some of those case will he bring forward legislation to overturn their conviction by statute know the advisory board believe that that be the right way forward on compensation when be in the minister role say that name individual should oversee the compensation scheme and the business and trade committee have advocate for that there should be one individual to oversee all the scheme who will put their reputation on the line for deliver compensation although the fix sum award be work the full assessment route still have problem something that the minister do not mention in his statement but which we look at be pilot of more tariff base scheme whereby people who have suffer from mental health difficulty could be pay more rapidly rather than go down full assessment route the minister mention the timescale currently there be time parameter of day for response from the department to new claim but the clock be reset when the claimant say that the claim be at the wrong level will he look at that what progress have the minister make on an interim payment from fujitsu what progress have be make on establish what ernst and young should have do in when it be aware of the huge liability that the post office have on its book due to this particular problem will he be ambitious on the banking framework to make sure that postmaster get good deal and what progress have the chair make on his commitment to reduce the highest pay role in the post office central management tier to make sure that more of the revenue that flow into the post office flow out to postmaster thank the hon gentleman for his comment and join he in commend the work of all those who have campaign and who continue to campaign for the victim of this horrendous scandal pay tribute to the noble lords arbuthnot and beamish in spirit of cross partisanship pay tribute to the hon gentleman for his work in the past know that he work extremely hard to try to move thing forward and very much respect the job that he do let attempt to do justice to the detailed question that the hon gentleman ask on capture we be actively work on redress scheme we have have series of meeting with some of the sub postmaster who be affect by the problem in the capture software and their legal representative he will be aware that number of case with the criminal cases review commission relate to capture and we think it be appropriate that the ccrc be allow to continue to review those case as outline in my opening remark the secretary of state recently meet the global chief executive of fujitsu during his visit to japan have meet the chief executive of fujitsu in the uk and say to he that an interim payment would be significant step in the right direction the hon gentleman ask about the post office accountant he may be aware that the financial reporting council be look at this issue and have be talk to the horizon compensation advisory board it be an independent body and be sure that he and the house will recognise that it be right that we respect the right of that independent body to do its work the hon gentleman say quite rightly that the full assessment of claim occasionally have problem that be one of the reason why refer to the fact that we be bring back facilitated discussion particularly on the glo scheme although there have be significant progress in settle two third of the glo claim that have be put in we think that those facilitate discussion will help to make it easy for fair compensation to be allocate in timely way to those victim of the scandal where case for interim payment be make to we we always encourage our team to make such payment in order to try to ease the financial pressure and therefore the trauma that victim still experience the hon gentleman will know that there be concern in the past about the letter request further information have see some previous example of those request and can well understand the frustration of sub postmaster their lawyer and campaigner when we request further information it be to make sure that we can offer an increase payment to sub postmaster go forward however recognise that there will be some scepticism because of the history around request for information we will continue to do everything we can to get payment out to people as quickly as possible and we have take further step to work with the post office to identify victim who have not previously come forward some new claimant have now come forward and we be try to process their case as quickly as we can welcome my hon friend statement particularly the reference to the discussion with fujitsu the horizon software be still be use by the post office network and understand that the contract with fujitsu be worth about billion over its lifetime we should not lose sight of the fact that fujitsu be heavily involve in support the post office prosecution of innocent sub postmaster can my hon friend say exactly how he will ensure that fujitsu pay the appropriate amount of money to compensate for its role in this affair recognise the concern across the house my hon friend have follow this issue for long time and recognise his continue interest he will forgive if do not give running commentary to the house on the negotiation that we will have with fujitsu we be obviously wait for the conclusion of sir wyn williams inquiry and his judgment about the level of responsibility that fujitsu must accept as allude to in my answer to the opposition spokesman an interim payment by fujitsu would be significant step forward call the liberal democrat spokesperson we liberal democrats welcome the progress that the government have make but the redress payment process be still too slow first victim claim under the horizon shortfall scheme continue to face significant up front complexity without legal advice welcome the minister announcement that the government will be write to that group but could he please outline time by which they will receive those letter secondly the minister announce that any compensation will not be subject to penny of income tax capital gain tax inheritance tax or other taxis could he confirm whether that will require primary legislation if so will it be limit to this scandal or apply to other scandal as well be think in particular of the cross party campaign on philomena law because some victim of that scandal be struggle to access their compensation thirdly this scandal have involve many individual work at the post office fujitsu and other the government have commit to bring forward statutory duty of candour they initially say they would do so by april which be the anniversary of the hillsborough disaster at business question last week the leader of the house cast doubt on whether that deadline would be meet because the government say they will take whatever time be necessary to get the issue right we liberal democrats want the drafting to be do correctly but be there any update on when we can expect the statutory duty to be bring forward fourthly the evidence of whistleblower at fujitsu be crucial in expose the lie about horizon we liberal democrats have repeatedly call for an office of the whistleblower and we have put down amendment to the employment rights bill to strengthen protection for whistleblower would the government work with we on that issue finally be surprised to see the announcement about directly manage post office the minister will be aware that cross party group of members have be infuriate by the poor communication from post office boss on this process recognise that today announcement state that the post office will move to fully franchised network but that still provide no guarantee about the range or quality of service that will be available no guarantee on the definition of nearby no guarantee that there will not be break in service and no guarantee that those post office will not eventually be close if the franchise do not work will the minister please set out the next stage those will affect my constituent in st albans and many constituent represent by member here be grateful to the hon lady she be absolutely right to reflect the view of the whole house that there be still much more to do on compensation we as the government be very clear about that ourselves and we be work at pace to try to step up even far the rate at which compensation payment be make we think that in just the first nine month of this government we have make significant progress increase by three and half time the amount of compensation that have be pay out but completely accept that there be more to do we think that the launch of the horizon shortfall scheme appeal process will help to address number of case in the hss where sub postmaster be concerned about the offer they have have the hon lady ask when letter would be go out set out the broad timescale in my statement and simply say to she again shortly we want to get this up and run as quickly as we can the hon lady ask whether new legislation would be require to implement the commitment on tax that set out no it will not be require on the issue of the duty of candour do not have anything to add to what my right hon friend the leader of the house say however the hon lady question be an opportunity to underline that we expect number of significant issue to arise from sir wyn williams inquiry and we as the government and be sure the whole house will want to reflect on the conclusion and recommendation that he come up with the hon lady mention the issue about the decision to franchise the remain directly manage branch as set out in my statement have hear the concern from across the house they be particularly significant on the labour benches but recognise those from the opposition side as well about the impact of lose post office service in the community where those directly manage party be that be why we have make it clear to the post office that franchise post office service have to remain in those community we expect the post office to work from the starting point of those service be what be call main franchise franchise that as well as provide the more traditional post office service such as stamp and parcel will also provide government service such as passport and drive licence the equivalent of what be available in those branch at the moment expect that in the first instance those franchise service will continue to operate in exactly the same place where they do at the moment before decision be take about where they should be locate in the slightly long term the hon lady ask what guarantee there be that service will continue to be provide in that space she will know that access criterion have already be publish that commit the government to provide post office the decision on directly manage branch do not change those criterion and the post office be commit to continue to provide service in those community would also expect the post office to talk to local stakeholder include member of this house about the continued operation of post office service in their community salford precinct busy crown post office be vital lifeline for resident and business alike especially for those who collect their pension and benefit in person put simply close it in favour of franchise would cause local economic and social devastation especially if service be reduce and staff be let go it would also put that service at the whim of the franchisee which as we know from the recent case of wh smith cause great uncertainty and insecurity what be the minister do to guarantee that salford retain all its exist post office service and staff in this geographical location and what alternative have he consider or will he consider in favour of shelving franchising know that my hon friend have always be great champion of salford like other member she have make it very clear to how significant the post office be in her community the vast majority of post office branch across the country be already franchise both main and local franchise be often open long than directly manage branch my hon friend ask what guarantee there be as have set out we have make it clear to the post office that we want every directly manage branch to ensure that there be main franchised operation in those community recognise that there will be concern while that change take place but if she or any other member have concern about aspect of that transition as it move forward in their constituency will obviously be very happy to meet they to discuss those as member of the business and trade committee should remind the house that in march we recommend that the government should listen hard to our recommendation be glad that that seem to have be take on board but be slightly concerned that lot of back patting seem to be go on particularly about fujitsu do the minister not agree with that he should be tell fujitsu what to do not ask it this government seem overly deferential to lawyer he be in charge of this can he not get the pace move because lawyer be get their money their fee but postmaster be not get their money at the rate they should the hon gentleman be absolutely right to want progress on fujitsu which be one of the reason why have make it clear to fujitsu that an interim payment would be very welcome and significant step forward we have say that we think it be important that we hear the view of sir wyn williams who have be look in detail at the responsibility of both fujitsu and senior leader in the post office during this scandal we need to recognise that there be process but we be absolutely clear about our responsibility to move the negotiation forward thank the minister for his statement and for all the work he be do to redress the injustice of the horizon scandal can he confirm that the communication workers union as well as the national federation of subpostmasters have be involve in decision making have lobby he very hard about my post office in cricklewood so he will know that we want to and must maintain those service go forward think lot of the problem stem from the separation of the royal mail and the post office follow privatisation so would he consider discuss the possibility of joint venture again know from the conversation have have with my hon friend just how much she and her constituent value the post office in cricklewood as have set out our starting point be that main franchise offer the same service as currently enjoy by the resident of cricklewood will be provide hope her constituent will not see any significant disruption go forward but be very happy to have conversation with she about that have have many conversation since come into this role with the leadership of the communication workers union who have be very direct in their view about directly manage branch on the question of their have view and say in the future of the post office as have make clear we be determined to publish green paper which will allow all those who be interested include the cwu to give we their vision of the future of the post office and view about the various question about its future do the minister acknowledge that among the horrific impact of the horizon scandal be the massive brand damage to post office ltd and its management among not only the sub postmaster who be currently employ but the potential workforce of the future our community in the lake in hawkshead staveley and grasmere be currently without an operate post office and have lose those service will the minister give attention to and push post office ltd to provide package that not just encourage people to remain within the post office but attract new people acknowledge that it will take more effort than normal to attract people into the sector on the issue of franchise service our post office in kendal share space with the royal mail and any change of site for our post office could threaten both be he cognisant of that and will he do something about it the hon gentleman rightly underline the significance of the post office in particular in rural community and the challenge on occasion of find sub postmaster to run franchise post office in those area hope the uplift in postmaster remuneration that come just before christmas will help to address that particular challenge we have make clear to the post office leadership that fundamental change in its culture be need to place sub postmaster at the heart of the operation go forward which they accept they have therefore set up consultative council to ensure that sub postmaster have direct input into the future direction of the post office they be also do more through postmaster panel to bring in postmaster to understand the different process use and to rebuild confidence in how post office management handle some of the big challenge that the company face will happily consider any request or point of concern that the hon gentleman raise about kendal if he be not satisfied with progress in address those point he be very welcome to get in contact with far down the line be very proud of the local campaign have be involve in alongside councillor and resident to save chester le street post office although it be disappointing that we be lose the post office in its current form be relieved that the service have be save recognise that the market for traditional post office service have be in decline for some year do the minister share my disappointment that post office management do not have the commercial imagination to find new business stream utilise their brand and network of prominent high street location commend my hon friend for his campaign recognise just how much the chester le street post office be value by his constituent as he have make clear to number of time in his representation on the commercial future of the post office it be absolutely true that postal service in this country as indeed in number of other country be face significant pressure and it be therefore imperative that post office management here in the uk look at what they can do to capitalise on new opportunity particularly in term of banking the post office chairman and chief executive nigel railton and neil brocklehurst completely get this point and we be actively talk to they about what more we can do very much hope we will hear positive news on banking framework which hope will be significant step forward in this regard however there be more that can be do in this space third party litigation funding play key and controversial role at the start of this crisis follow recent supreme court judgment that access to justice that postmaster have at the start be under threat what discussion be the minister have with his colleague about how third party litigation funding work in this situation and what need to improve as it move forward the right hon gentleman will have to forgive have be very focused on the effort to increase compensation for the victim of the horizon scandal which have be the immediate challenge face the government in this policy area it be something we hear loud and clear in opposition and we want to see progress on it as allude to early suspect that the recommendation in sir wyn williams inquiry will range quite widely and if it touch on the particular issue that the right hon gentleman have raise we will look at that extremely carefully more generally suspect that my right hon friend the secretary of state for justice will be interested in his question thank the minister for his statement and for the update on the redress scheme for victim of the horizon scandal also thank he for listen to my campaign to save the kings square post office in gloucester and for maintain so many vital service for gloucester resident with today announcement that they will be franchise and continue will he meet to discuss the merit of the new franchise stay in its current location king square have fantastic future with the opening of the university new city campus later this year and the forum new office hotel and leisure facility which will be fantastic it would be great for the new franchise to be an important part of that future be grateful to my hon friend for his continued representation of his constituent interest he have make number of very clear representation to on the importance of the gloucester post office and would be very happy to meet he to discuss its future as it transition to franchise run operation should make it clear that the post office very much want these franchise to be in key location that be important for our community because that be obviously where the commercial income will come from so it will be keen to meet with stakeholder such as member of this house and other local stakeholder if my hon friend would like to meet to discuss this issue far would be very happy to do so where post office branch that be currently directly manage be not stay in its current premise will there be proper formal scheme of community engagement to give the community some control over ensure that what be provide in its place will be at least as good community simply do not trust the post office at the moment to make that judgment for itself the right hon gentleman make completely fair point that the post office suffer from significant lack of trust for all the reason we know completely understand why he would want to press the particular point that his community should be involve in discussion about their post office service go forward as allude to early would expect the post office to engage with local stakeholder include the right hon gentleman as the local member of parliament if at any point he be concerned about those discussion he be very welcome to get in contact with and will happily meet he my constituent be serve by crown post office in brixton and east dulwich both just outside my constituency boundary and both in area that have see the near complete withdrawal of high street bank branch leave resident and business dependent on the post office for banking service as well as for the wide range of other service that they provide the minister know that the big difference between crown and franchise post office be that no one in the public sector have any say in the public interest over whether franchised post office remain open or indeed whether franchisee can be secure what assurance can my hon friend give that post office franchise open in place of crown post office will remain open for the long term recognise the significance that the two post office have to my hon friend constituent and recognise too that there will be concern in her constituency about the long term future of those post office although she be not the constituency member of parliament for the area will ensure that she be consult about the future of those post office recognise that particularly in urban area such as the one that she and represent people outside the immediate constituency be reliant on those post office as have say post office will want to ensure that in the long term it be locate at the heart of the commercial activity in community because its future income depend on that however give what have be say about the lack of trust in the post office it be important that there be conversation with local stakeholder include member of this house moreover give the point that she have make will make sure she be include in conversation about those two particular post office more than resident have sign my cross party petition oppose the closure of the bexhill crown branch it be fair to say that this whole situation have be make bad because the minister have allow the post office to put the cart before the horse with the decision take on closure ahead of clear guarantee on what will come next for all of our constituent notice that in his answer the minister have talk about should expectation and starting point but those be not cast iron guarantee can he give cast iron guarantee that he will veto any replacement of the crown service in bexhill if it do not provide exactly the same service as the current branch be provide recognise from the meeting that have with the hon member and also with bexhill labour councillor how strong the feeling be about the threat to the post office in bexhill have make it clear that the post office should replace the directly manage branch with main franchise that be what expect it to do also expect there to be consultation with local stakeholder in bexhill include with he as the member of parliament if he have concern about that process he be welcome to get in contact with thank the minister for meet to discuss the directly manage branch on kensington high street in my constituency of kensington and bayswater more than resident join my campaign to save the service at the branch today news be welcome for they but can the minister give we some reassurance on when the transition will take place from the current system to franchise model and what guarantee he have on continue service level welcome my hon friend question recognise that he have campaign and make representation to on this issue as he have set out as have say to other member today he and other local stakeholder should expect to be involve in discussion about the future of post office service in kensington and the transition to franchise we have the expectation the post office have accept this expectation that it will be main service as oppose to local franchise which provide government service such as passport drive licence and so on can not give he an exact timeframe for when those discussion will begin but the post office have already begin to have conversation with staff and potential franchisee would expect they to start get in contact with member of parliament over the next few month tony hibberd former sub postmaster from colyton in east devon be year old four year since he submit his claim and year after his wrongful dismissal there have still be no meaningful progress towards fair and final settlement that reflect the loss to tony reputation follow the statement from the dispatch box on december write to the minister about tony case and the reply that receive refer to an offer make to tony in december but no such offer have be receive the minister refer to new horizon shortfall appeal scheme with turnaround time of two month but again say that tony be year old will the minister urgently review tony case to ensure that he finally receive the compensation that he deserve the hon member will understand that do not have the detail about tony case to hand but he have ask to review the way that the case have be handle be happy to do that be keen that complex case be resolve fairly and as quickly as possible recognise that many sub postmaster have be wait long time for compensation we have make progress but recognise that there be more to do will happily look at tony case after this and write to the hon member thank the minister for his update on the progress to redress the victim of the horizon scandal as well as the commitment to invest in new technology in light of the sudden closure of post office in coalville in my constituency what reassurance can the minister give to current and prospective new postmaster that the horizon system which be still be use in post office be now fit for purpose we be clear that we need to replace the horizon system as the whole house would expect the post office be not take any criminal action when there be shortfall there be process for resolve issue around shortfall in the horizon system indeed reference the postmaster panel and the way in which the post office management be work with sub postmaster to help they to understand how shortfall in the system be be deal with go forward so hope that slowly we be take the first step to rebuild that trust be sure the minister remember that on december raise the case of donna from mid dorset and north poole who be bankrupt for quarter of million pound due to the horizon scandal the bankruptcy be cancel but not before most of the interim settlement be deduct by the post office receiver be therefore shocked to receive reply from the minister in which he confirm that the glo approach be to deduct interim

post office base in the waverley station complex the centre of scotland capital be to close have be campaign hard to ensure that resident commuter and business see no diminution in service and for fair treatment for post office staff can the minister confirm that thank to this government franchise post office will be establish in the area mean continuation of service for local resident when do he expect that transition to take place and will he ensure that both mp and member of the scottish parliament be consult on where the post office will be recognise the point that my hon friend make

number of bank branch closure over bank branch close under the conservatives who do next to nothing to ensure that they be replace by any sort of alternative service the post office be often the last opportunity for people to access banking service on many high street that be one of the reason why we remain committed to have post office and to the access criterion which will help ensure that every community in the uk include the people serve by the cosham post office have access to post office service will of course continue to meet my hon friend if that be what she require thank the minister

campaign work have do along with councillor stephen jenkinson that the post office be use by people well beyond wester hailes so it be important that we take any threat to it really seriously the situation be make all the bad by the fact that the bank of scotland branch right across from it be close next month be slightly concerned that what be describe as new deal for the post office might be bad deal for wester hailes for it to be good deal the consultation have to be right it have to be meaningful and tailor to the people of wester hailes can the minister reassure we that this will be meaningful consultation that will reach into wester hailes and understand the need of the community know from conversation have have with my hon friend the significance of the post office to his

we now come to the select committee statement on behalf of the defence committee mr calvin bailey will speak for up to minute during which time no intervention may be take at the conclusion of his statement will call member to ask question on the subject of the statement they should be brief question not full speech emphasise that question should be direct to the select committee member and not the relevant government minister front benchers may take part in questioning be proud to present the defence committee fourth report of this parliament which be evidence of how hard the committee have be work on behalf of parliament and the british people in these highly volatile and uncertain time thank the committee the staff in particular george james and my hon friend the member for slough mr dhesi for his leadership be pleased to share the armed force covenant report as the house know the covenant be our society commitment to the armed force community commitment to recognise and reward their service and ensure that they be not disadvantaged in civilian life as result of that service the government say in their manifesto that they would strengthen the covenant by put it fully into law our report do two thing it look at the covenant today to examine how well it be live up to society commitment to the armed force and it look at how the government should make that commitment strong when they bring forward legislation we hear that they plan to do so through the armed forces bill next year we decide that the good way to understand how well the covenant be work be to ask the people it be design to help so we invite serve personnel their family and veteran to share their experience with we we be hugely grateful to everyone who take the time to write to we their powerful contribution help we to get to the truth on where the covenant be succeed and where it be fall short we be so grateful to the secretary of state for give his permission to serve personnel to send we their story as well as to the organisation who provide evidence directly to our inquiry the evidence paint mixed picture of how the covenant be work today we hear some positive story include from an individual who say that cite the covenant to their local nhs trust help they get timely mental health assessment for their child but unfortunately such story be in the minority most of the story we receive come from people who have expect the covenant to help they but find that it be ineffective or bad disregarded one person who be on waiting list for nhs treatment be tell that their position on the list would transfer when they move from scotland to the south of england on service but after they move they find themselves at the back of the queue when they raise that with the trust they be tell that the trust do recognise and therefore follow the armed force covenant we hear many story like that it be hardly surprising that those people view the covenant as gimmick with no real substance or as something that look good on public body website but in practice mean nothing at all the government be therefore right to recognise that the covenant need to improve their proposal be to extend its scope so that more area of central government be subject to it we welcome that and we recommend that the covenant be apply to all government departments with that we expect to see department pay well attention to the need of the force community when they make policy and we expect to see the covenant apply to area of life that the exist duty do not cover and area in which the force community experience disadvantage such as employment social care welfare and immigration in particular for non uk passport holder however we be clear that legislating be only part of the solution our evidence show that one of the big issue be that the covenant be not consistently apply either because people be not aware of it because it be not well understand or because it be not give high enough priority that be why we hear that the armed force community experience of the covenant vary massively depend on where they live if the law be not consistently apply amend the statute book will make little difference that be why our report say that the government need proper plan for implement the covenant in tandem with introduce new legislation that need commitment from all government departments and we should not underestimate the scale of the commitment necessary get this right be as important as update the law if not more so the armed force covenant be noble proposition but sadly we do not always live up to it as society we want to get to place where our service personnel and our veteran can be in no doubt that when they deal with their local council doctor or employer the covenant will support they new legislation will help but it be not silver bullet we also need to embed the covenant more deeply in our institution and particularly across government and in wide society rise order there be no intervention during the statement as we say in our report the covenant give we all duty to our servicemen and woman we must take it as seriously as they have take their duty to we commend the report to the house call the shadow minister welcome the report and congratulate all member of the committee and the witness who play their part in the inquiry overall may extend the opposition good wish to our veteran to our armed service and to our serve man and woman who deserve our respect and utmost gratitude every day thank the hon gentleman for outline the content of his report as he will know we sit on the armed forces commissioner bill committee together what role do he think the armed forces commissioner could play in uphold the armed force covenant could they have an independent role in assess how government department do if that be not the right mechanism do he or his committee have view on some independent scrutiny to assess whether the government and all departments be adhere to the covenant have they look at how that could be uphold thank the hon member for his point join he in thank our servicemen and woman for their service and recognise their sacrifice on the role of the armed forces commissioner the report state in part that there have be no recognisable measure of success the minister and his department will have to take that on and bring forward some answer it be probably within that framework that the armed forces commissioner will have some role however it be critical failing of our application of the armed force covenant that success be not measure so it be not monitor almost anywhere thank my hon and gallant friend for represent the defence committee labour commitment to fully enshrine the armed force covenant in law be vital step in recognise the sacrifice make by our service member and their family however our report examine some significant gap in coverage in particular highlight the treatment of non uk personnel and their family unlike other route the immigration status give to serve and recently discharge personnel do not allow they to work or access social security will my hon friend join in urge the ministry of defence to resolve this issue with the home office well in advance of the covenant expansion thank my hon friend for raise such an important point she do great job in represent the home of the british army and raise the issue consistently both with the all party parliamentary group on the armed force community and on the defence committee indeed she do so throughout the inquiry my hon friend point be powerfully make because it support what the force family federation bring forward in their evidence they point out that there be no other immigration route in which someone legally in the uk be allow to work or claim benefit whilst their application be be decide that be massive travesty and failure and an example of the armed force face unique disadvantage it be exactly the sort of anomaly that an update covenant should attempt to address want to put on the record my thank to the hon and gallant member for leyton and wanstead mr bailey for bring the report to the chamber today the government must urgently reconsider the propose change to the application of inheritance tax on certain armed force death in service payment the forces pension society have describe that as direct breach of the armed forces covenant warn that it will have corrosive impact on serve personnel and undermine trust in government do the hon member agree with that and what step do he think the government need to take to rectify the situation as quickly as possible thank the hon member for his intervention and for raise valid and valuable point that the government must take forward and consider it be not part of the armed forces act but it be the type of thing that other government departments should be look at series of question about that have go to the department to see whether it be something that could be tackle know that the minister for veterans and people my hon friend the member for birmingham selly oak al carns who be here on the front bench be work on that we must remember however that there be difference between death in service and death while serve there be an important distinction there because to not recognise that can create whole load of complexity that people who have serve will understand probably more uniquely than other thank my hon and gallant friend for bring this important report to we today and for the committee work north lincolnshire council have establish physical armed force hub dedicate to provide comprehensive support to all member of the armed force community offer assistance on health and housing doncaster city council have the veteran innovation fund which provide fund of up to to help with barrier that impact individual wellbee that be all amazing but if our veteran do not know about it in the first place it can not help they they deserve our respect and they deserve our support particularly when they come out fight for each and every one of we do my hon friend agree that as we go into the easter recess there be need for we to make priority of promote the armed force covenant in every one of our constituency be aware of the work that my hon friend be do to support the armed force community in lincolnshire particularly in donny which be an old and well love raf station bring back job to the community that will provide opportunity for veteran be very important agree with he that we all need to go out and champion the armed force covenant because it impact we all if we do not get it right we will adversely impact recruitment and retention and therefore our armed force ability to serve we do the hon and gallant member think that our northern ireland veteran and specifically our former special force member be under attack from the very state that they serve do he think that they deserve protection under the armed force covenant as the hon and gallant member know this matter be not raise correction he indeed raise the issue and receive response from the minister about how our veteran be be handle and the complexity involve do not agree that they be under attack believe in justice and the rule of law and that those have be equally apply the government approach be valid and honest and it will do right by our veteran in the end thank my hon and gallant friend and indeed all member of the defence committee for an invaluable report during his contribution he mention one example of soldier move cross border and that cause problem with nhs appointment do the committee recognise that soldier and veteran can be disadvantage by difference in policy between the nation of the uk how do we think the government can well go about address those problem concur with my hon friend and be sure that other example of that will be bring forward the difference in application across england be quite stark but when we extend into scotland they can be mark and almost unjust the only place in the world where our service personnel be apply differential rate of taxation be in scotland it be in scotland that our service personnel have different access to provision of family support in particular childcare and it be only when our service personnel be post to scotland that they receive differential treatment in term of their education the report highlight that and think it will be quite challenge for the devolved government to say that they be they be actively meet the armed force covenant until those thing be address each branch of our uk armed force face challenge in maintain personnel strength with each below target and experience net loss in train personnel will the hon and gallant member share what impact the committee feel the covenant be have on retention how do the committee see the covenant dovetail with the recommendation of the haythornthwaite review on armed force incentivisation thank the hon member for her powerful and incisive question the armed force continuous attitude survey consistently show that the armed force feel as though the covenant be not apply two figure that just fall out of the report be that about of our service personnel feel as though the covenant be not be apply to they in term of the nhs and about feel the same in term of education the net upshot of those failing be the continual erosion of the feeling among service family and service personnel that they be be support by the state and broad society one in three people who enter the military do so as result of meet someone in the military if we apply those figure to that number of people we must expect that they be not pass on good story that will continue to erode people ability to join the service which be why this be so important order ask that the final few question and answer be bit short thank my hon and gallant friend for his statement on behalf of the select committee read the report this morning and some of it make for quite shameful reading want to touch on the childcare issue again someone serve in the military who have young pre school child be well off in england but if they have old pre school child they be well off in scotland this issue be raise with my directly when recently meet battalion the rifles who be base in my constituency captain shaun swift be very clear that this cause friction for movement and make it hard for spouse to maintain job be this issue be raise directly with the scottish government and can we encourage the uk and scottish government to work together to address this issue in short yes the covenant be go into law the report show the stark contrast between governance in the uk and in scotland only last week speak to serve constituent who highlight the issue he have have regard the selective application of the armed force covenant by university there be university that have sign the covenant but offer no additional dispensation regard study break for service personnel who be undertake course but be subsequently deploy deployment be often for week not include pre deployment training or post tour leave whereas the maximum study break be around week in two term of eight week this may lead to the service person drop out of the course and the forfeiture of their enhance learning credit through no fault of their own can ask the select committee member or indeed the minister to take this into account in order to facilitate the resettlement that service personnel depend on will as someone who be impact thus myself this be something be aware of and will take it back to the defence committee for response as the mp for portsmouth north and for the family and friend of those who currently serve and have serve understand the sacrifice that they be make the committee will know that one of the main reason for service personnel leave the armed force be the impact on their family do my hon friend agree with and with the naval children charity that the opportunity for child to receive priority in year school admission to secure school place and the timely transfer of education and healthcare plan when relocate between local authority would be welcome addition to the armed force covenant my hon friend be great champion for the royal navy community in her constituency and she raise an apposite question that go to the heart of an area where the armed force covenant have be overlook which be education be sure that the minister for veterans and people will take this on as part of his deliberation one of the report recommendation be that the covenant should be apply consistently across the united kingdom the hon and gallant member will be aware of my party submission which point out that op fortitude which be design to support homeless ex service personnel be effectively non existent in northern ireland and that veteran in northern ireland face barrier in accessing specialised healthcare service such as the veteran orthopaedic service at the robert jones and agnes hunt orthopaedic hospital be he confident that should there be plan to implement the covenant and legislate for it it will cover all part of the united kingdom equally will he and the committee continually review that situation thank the hon member for raise that incisive point the covenant must be consistently apply across the uk and think that be go to be big challenge to the government and to the regional government it will take review and that be something that the defence committee have agree to do once the armed force bill be be consider and be under way commend the defence committee for talk to the family of service personnel as well as directly to soldier sailor and airman if think back to the people with whom serve they tend to be phlegmatic about make the ultimate sacrifice but they care great deal about the satisfaction of their immediate family their spouse their partner and their child could the hon member talk little bit more about what the committee learn from the engagement it have with the family of service personnel about the armed force covenant thank the hon and gallant member for his question which focus on what the committee learn about armed force family and their service what strike be the amount of unseen trauma the family suffer as result of their movement there be some very upsetting tale of how people have be force to move around the country and not receive adequate support from other government departments that would allow they to have normal existence or an existence that would be consider normal to anyone that be not in the military it be those thing that we need to go after and it be those thing that the armed force covenant should protect would like to thank he for his service as well on point of order madam deputy speaker want to correct the record when ask my question do not refer the house to my entry in the register of members financial interests which indicate that be trustee of the armed force parliamentary scheme apologise for not do so thank the hon gentleman for his point order the record will now reflect that fact energy social tariff motion for leave to bring in bill standing order no beg to move that leave be give to bring in bill to require energy company to provide social tariff for low income customer and for connected purpose last week we see people energy bill go up by another as ofgem raise the energy price cap again mean that typical household now face bill of not far off year my argument for social tariff be bear out of career spend grapple with britain energy market include in my work with the current secretary of state for energy security and net zero in the old department of energy and climate change where we see through the global financial crisis the need to well protect consumer from volatile energy price watch he try to convince energy company to lower their price as the country face spiral cost and economic chaos convince that social tariff be the least labour government could and should do to protect the most vulnerable much have change since then there have be significant success in shift to clean power as result of political consensus hold across this house until recently on the need to decarbonise our energy system to tackle climate change this labour government mission to achieve clean power by be part of our long term solution to bring energy bill down for good people see increasingly that there be further benefit to such shift great energy security from generate our own energy rather than be expose to the whim of petrostate and dodgy regime as well as reduction in the cost of generate that power some of newly instal solar and wind capacity have low generation cost than natural gas however consumer be not feel the benefit of cheap cost as much as they could partly because our energy price be set by global oil and gas price as an mp the reality of fuel poverty be frequently ram home to on the doorstep where concern be raise about the rise cost of energy and the pressure that they put on household budget especially among those on low income remind the house that east thanet be not leafy affluent community of the kind that many people associate with the south east it be coastal community with high level of deprivation much low pay and insecure work many elderly resident many family with disabled member and many cold old and draughty home in thanet quarter of all working age adult claim universal credit and over of people claim at least one form of benefit from the department for work and pensions these be the people who suffer most from increase energy bill and who often have to choose between heating and eating social tariff that support the most vulnerable with their energy bill and prevent they from fall into fuel poverty would protect they from some of the failure of the current energy market and shield they as that market be reform to make the most of leave fossil fuel behind the energy market need to change so that the effort the government be make to decarbonise our energy system truly deliver benefit for consumer the reform of retail price will need to be part of that as member of the energy security and net zero committee have hear witness grow call for such change the vast majority of home be heat by gas while electricity be much more expensive the cost of shift to clean power have be load on to electricity bill create disincentive for many to choose to shift to electric heat we artificially make electricity more expensive which make it impossible for some to move to clean power it be those who can not pay who be least prepared rapid change have always be associate with upheaval and risk social tariff work as part of the welfare state can support people as we make these change this be the right thing to do from not only fuel poverty perspective but decarbonisation one modern welfare state have do this before and it can do it again the labour party be the party that create the welfare state and on these benches we understand why have strong social safety net be vital but energy be an area where the safety net have gap hole in it that be why targeted social tariff be need so that we can provide vital support for those in the great need there be also an increasingly chronic problem with consumer energy debt people owe more than billion in energy bill debt and that figure have double in the past three year alone those in debt then become stuck in cycle where they face an increase in energy bill while also try to pay off the debt they have build up that be not sustainable for those consumer or even the energy retailer which have to deal with the fallout from fuel poverty debt the warm home discount be the most prominent current scheme to help with this issue but it be simply not sufficient for the scale of the challenge it have not scale with retail price as energy bill have increase by hundred of pound the warm home discount have increase by only since its introduction the discount be also limit to household receive mean test benefit mean that many family live in fuel poverty miss out on this vital support social tariff should build on the warm home discount but not replace it the purpose of the bill be to enshrine in law the principle that social tariff should be provide by all energy company to ensure there be no supplier lottery for those who need support it should be additional to exist and plan support it should be target and it should be sufficient enough to reduce cost to an affordable level national energy action have argue that we need to aim social tariff at people on low income people with disability carer household with low energy efficiency off gas grid home and household with prepayment meter there be far too many complaint by energy company that they can not identify the people who need this support these category tackle that problem because we already have the datum we know who be in receipt of universal credit disability benefit and carer allowance we know those on prepayment meter and the home with poor energy rating these be people who face huge financial pressure and who be at the forefront of the cost of living crisis these be the people who be most at risk of fuel poverty and crucially we can find these people so that those who need the support get it this government have rightly establish child poverty taskforce to tackle the scar on our society of child grow up poor social tariff can be part of wide approach to tackle this moral outrage by ensure that the family who be most in need have to worry less about their energy bill child who grow up in household that struggle to pay their energy bill be more likely to struggle at school and more likely to end up struggle in life however simply protect people from fail energy retail market be not sufficient we should be develop package of measure that prioritise shift the most vulnerable on to the clean cheap and more secure energy that we be generate ourselves there be always risk that the case for such market intervention be make simply by talk about protect people from the bad extreme of the market but it be also important to say that such measure increase economic security and be therefore good for economic growth it put money in people pocket money they be spend on excessive energy cost be money they be not spend in their local economy with this relief they can be part of the economic revival of the place in which they live this be not new idea social tariff be already work in many other country for example spain have tariff that provide discount for vulnerable customer and discount for severely vulnerable customer have spend lot of my career work on how energy can be generate supply and consume in way that do not cost packet or the planet for far too long energy company have urge consumer to engage with the energy market that in my view have always be base on failure to understand that for most people energy be means to an end it be not exciting and it can be stressful especially for those who be struggle we should be in the business of reduce that stress so that people can spend their time and energy do thing that be more interesting and fulfilling the very least we can do for those who already struggle to do exactly that because of limited mean be to protect they from the market that be why social tariff should be part of our plan for change and our national mission to transform this country for the well question put and agree to order that ms polly billington yuan yang torcuil crichton andrew pakes pippa heylings luke murphy wera hobhouse and mike reader present the bill ms polly billington accordingly present the bill bill read the first time to be read second time on friday april and to be print

up it have be say that level one award such as the victoria cross be give only when the chance of death be or more report from brigadier calvert date june say there can only be one explanation why colonel mayne be not kill by what have already prove deadly and concentrated fire the sheer audacity and dare which he show in drive his jeep across field of fire momentarily bewilder the enemy he continue colonel mayne from the time he arrive dominate the scene that be the man he be he be there and he have no fear his cheerfulness resolution and unsurpassed courage in this action be an inspiration to we all that be an account from the soldier who watch that colossus of man jump out and rescue they and win the day for the ally in their advance in germany undoubtedly it seem suicidal mission to rescue his comrade and ensure that the enemy retreat far but colonel mayne mission be complete success in the word of brigadier calvert not only do he save the life of the wounded but he also completely defeat and destroy the enemy lieutenant colonel mayne story be the stuff of which legend be make legend that we know to be true when we be boy in newtownards and ballywalter many year ago we look to be that person it be the stuff of which many of we dream as young boy and act out in our garden blair mayne be certainly hero of mine as young child many year ago his action be those of man who put other first and who go above and beyond the call of duty there be absolutely no doubt that his action on that day be heroic and worthy of recognition and commendation that be why brigadier calvert recommend that mayne be award the high award the victoria cross mayne be inform that he be to be grant that well deserve accolade and he inform his mother accordingly which make she even more proud who be more proud of anyone than their mum mum think that whatever their child do be brilliant my mum be the same hope that be true by the way have tell that war story because it be factual historical account the bbc sas rogue heroes dramatisation about found member of covert special raid squadron hero many time over repute to have single handedly destroy enemy plane and commend for the high military award be global success however six month after he be recommend for the award terrible mistake happen that mistake strip blair mayne of his hard win honour and much of his self esteem the award of the victoria cross by the royal warrant be bestow upon those who display act of conspicuous gallantry and for signal act of valour in the presence of the enemy paddy mayne have more than attain that standard but the mistake lie with the word signal define in the oxford english dictionary as an event or statement that provide the impulse or occasion for something to happen in other word signal event be not planned event mayne certainly qualify for the award but the word signal be misread as single it be clerical error and we be very clearly put forward that viewpoint mayne have be accompany in the jeep by lieutenant scott who provide cover fire therefore mayne have not act single handedly which mean that he be deem to be ineligible for the award that change have be query on number of level over the year and yet it appear that that alteration result in mayne be strip of the award instead he be give third bar to his distinguished service order have see the evidence that lieutenant colonel blair mayne be suppose to get the victoria cross on his citation vc be mark but stroke out for the commendation that be important evidence team of historian have be work hard on source those document which make available to the minister this morning although to be fair think he have they beforehand so he now have two copy put on the record my thank to damien lewis to patric mcgonigal who be the grandson of one of the sas original and to david robinson among so many other local historian invest in this issue brigadier calvert recommend that mayne should be award the vc for his action in rescue his man he submit sign statement from three officer who witness those action lieutenant scott lieutenant locket and lieutenant surrey dane calvert refer to the difficulty of assess the military significance of mayne action in relation to the overall thrust of the canadian division enclose citation for the vc for paddy mayne have go into this thoroughly with his officer and think it be an outstanding piece of work one almost expect these thing from paddy the main point be however as to how much it affect the battle simonds agree with he major general vokes also write in support of the citation in his opinion mayne spirited leadership and dash be most important contribution to the success of the operation he say observe the very marked respect and regard in which he be hold by his officer and man in my opinion this officer be worthy of the high award for gallantry and leadership be not sure whether the tv programme sas rogue heroes really portray blair mayne in the way that it should have he never use bad language for instance but he be portray as leader of man nobody can be in any doubt that he be man who lead his soldier show leadership and give confidence and encouragement to those around he the citation be sign by brigadier calvert major general vokes lieutenant general simonds general crerar the commander of the canadian army and field marshal montgomery of the army group the documentation that have clearly outline that official oversee the matter misinterpret the vc rule as need single act of valour whereas they in fact need signal act of valour the difference be in that wording we be not here to throw aspersion we be here to outline the system and how it work and how clerical error lead to this happening that mean that the denial be base on procedural error or an error of understanding and that wrongdoing need to be readdresse properly one historian have note it be clear that vc have be mark out because of that clerical error it be important to note that do not ask the ministry of defence or his majesty government to overturn the entire apple cart on no retrospective reconsideration we be simply ask for an error to be correct in this specific and singular case we be all aware of other posthumous vcs be grant for instance private richard norden be posthumously award the victoria cross for australia for his bravery during the vietnam war specifically for his action during the battle of fire support base coral in the basis be that an error occur that can be correct we be not the only people who can not understand why the medal be not award king george vi ask how it be that the victoria cross elude paddy and inquire why the award be downgrade when the king ask winston churchill to explain the demerit he be say to have be shock and sadden by the glare omission inquiry be also make by several officer who could not understand what have happen they do not have the access that we now have to the file which clearly show the intent and the redirection in short while signal act of valour be originally specify single act of valour never be that clerical error be the reason and the thrust behind what we be ask for by the time of world war two the vc would be award for most conspicuous bravery or some daring or pre eminent act of valour or self sacrifice or extreme devotion to duty in the presence of the enemy what man what hero and courageous person with bravery such as many will never witness as wee boy that be just what wish to be all that be confirm by the witness involve in report on blair action at oldenburg furthermore the vc can also be award posthumously those be the three reason give the word single the fact that the vc would be award for conspicuous bravery which be never in doubt and the fact that the victoria cross can be award posthumously there be no other record reason why the recommendation to award vc be not action her late majesty queen elizabeth uncle major general sir robert laycock be at the time serve officer in the force he write letter in which he state that blair mayne deserve victoria cross he earn it with his bravery and would have receive one have the proper authority know their job say that very respectfully always do that as consequence blair mayne do not receive the great honour that this country can bestow no matter how much be award the high french accolade mean be give and then strip of his british honour haunt mayne for the rest of his life the memory of blair mayne live on and not just through the bbc series many in my town argue that while he be rough he would never have curse in front of lady and his comrade do not fear he instead they revere he his memory be cherish in the heart of ards people and there be statue of he in newtownards town centre his image adorn wall that once boast mural depict paramilitary paraphernalia blair mayne history his service in uniform his bravery and his conviction be on the wall of newtownards include many of its community centre when the council decide to build new leisure centre it be name the blair mayne leisure centre because his sporting prowess be matter of pride to we all when coffee shop open couple of year ago in newtownards town centre it be call colonel paddy because we all revere he by the way its coffee be excellent live on coffee and fried egg his legacy be important to the people of our wee town member may be aware that rule of the civil procedure rule explicitly permit fix clerical mistake in judgment or order or error arise from any accidental slip or omission as long as the intent of the original decision hold that be really important it be the thrust of the debate the original decision be to allow the vc and the law allow for slip of the pen to be correct let an error stand as in this case perpetuate an injustice especially if the mistake skew the outcome which it have be very conscious of the time limit that you madam deputy speaker and other have ask to conform to so will conclude it be say that king george vi ask paddy mayne how it be that he have not receive victoria cross and he answer in manner that sum up this courageous and honourable man serve to my good my lord my king and my queen and none can take that honour away from today in this house we have the chance to restore what be his it be time that the memory of man who live for his colleague and his country be restore to its full glory through the restitution of the victoria cross thank the hon member for strangford jim shannon both for secure this debate and for open it in the way that he have well do know that this be an incredibly important subject to he and during his retelling of paddy activity in war could almost see the commando comic from my childhood before do not intend to speak for too long this will be really just long intervention when the hon member for strangford ask to support this debate do not really know who paddy mayne be while the hon member be lovely guy his politic can sometimes be little bit dodgy so rather than say yes on the spot decide to do some homework could see quite quickly that the case be strong and feel bad for even have to research it when get home that week speak to my son who quietly point out that we have watch the tv programme about paddy mayne together and that he have also buy book about paddy mayne for christmas have still not read it do not tell he the week after that visit redford barrack in edinburgh south west meet serviceman there from northern ireland and take the opportunity to ask he what he think he be offend that even have to ask he about it because he feel the case be so strong while do not speak for he he be little bit upset about the way in which paddy be depict in the second series of sas rogue heroes and make the point about the language specifically have ask resident in my constituency what they think about today debate and what the trajectory should be and overwhelmingly people get back to say that the case be strong there be real feeling that paddy be overlook because he be sometimes forthright in his opinion because he sometimes challenge authority which be not always good thing in the force guess and above all because his face sometimes do not fit one of my constituent say to that paddy deserve the victoria cross and if he win it that will be victory for all the people who be overlook because they go to the wrong school or come from the wrong background and have that count against they agree with my hon friend about the need to do research the podcast we have ways of make you talk give much well introduction to paddy mayne do my hon friend agree that we need to look at the rule of recognition for those serve in the special force and ensure that some of the difficulty that will arise in publicly recognise those very brave troop be take into account will try to listen to that podcast on the train home this evening the issue about those in the special force often come up but have absolute trust in they to follow the rule of engagement and the rule of war at all time and respect they and all our armed force for the work they do to conclude we be not here to demand that paddy get vc or to demand that he get it on behalf of all other who have perhaps be overlook particularly not this year the anniversary of the second world war we be say that it be time to look at the issue with fresh eye that should be do through formal process not here in this house but by people who understand the matter much well than we to ensure that fair decision be reach the hon member for strangford have be clear about what that fair decision should be rise to support the hon member for strangford jim shannon in his call for posthumous vc for blair mayne we be speak about man whose courage and leadership help shape one of the good fighting force in the world although the name of lieutenant colonel blair paddy mayne of the sas be etch into military history one honour that he do not get be the victoria cross and today debate be an opportunity to look at the circumstance and potentially correct that mayne as the hon member say be soldier of rare calibre as one of the found member of the sas he lead countless raid deep behind enemy line in north africa and europe often at great personal risk he lead from the front destroy enemy aircraft supply line and infrastructure often with nothing more than small group of man and his sheer willpower his character and courage be legendary but those have as have already be mention be colour and to an extent misrepresent in the recent bbc series through use of artistic licence while we consider the merit of award blair mayne posthumous vc want the house to reflect on the citation from his distinguished service order award he be first award it on february for his leadership during raid on the tamet airfield in libya the citation say the task set be of the most hazardous nature and it be due to this officer courage and leadership that success be achieve the first bar to the dso be award on october in recognition of his action during operation husky in sicily the citation say in both these operation it be major mayne courage determination and superb leadership which prove the key to success the second bar to his dso be award on march for his command of the sas regiment in france which co ordinate operation with the french resistance the citation say it be entirely due to lt col mayne fine leadership and example and due to his utter disregard of danger that the unit be able to achieve such striking success as be vividly recount by the hon member for strangford mayne be recommend for the victoria cross for his action in germany in april where he rescue wounded man and eliminate enemy position under heavy fire although the recommendation be downgrade the subject of this debate it do result in the third bar to his dso that citation say that lt col mayne be in full view of the enemy and expose to fire from small arm machine gun sniper rifle and panzerfausts he then seize bren gun and magazine and single handedly fire burst after burst into second house kill or wound the enemy there if that do not meet the standard for the victoria cross we need to seriously ask what do some say that it be too late and we can not rewrite history this be not about rewrite history but right wrong awarding blair mayne the vc posthumously be not just about medal it be about honour man whose valour be undeniable whose action inspire those around he and whose legacy live on let we act today not for glory but for justice and for paddy mayne let first draw member attention to my membership of the writers guild of great britain be delighted to have be call to speak in this debate about the merit of award posthumous victoria cross to lieutenant colonel robert blair mayne well know as paddy mayne know that the hon member for strangford jim shannon feel passionately about this issue and he speak about it very eloquently be member of the backbench business committee which hear application from back benchers for debate on all kind of topic and have to say that this application catch my particular attention be television screenwriter before be proudly elect to this place and be huge fan of the hit television drama sas rogue heroes create and write by steven knight it be vivid retelling of the story of the formation and achievement of britain special air service which be form by david stirling as the ultimate military disrupter in the second world war the sas change the nature of the fight against the nazis in africa and beyond the drama be among the good illustration of why the united kingdom be powerhouse of the creative industry the writer cast and crew of sas rogue heroes work for the production company kudos create hit show that capture the irreverence humour and bravery of the sas and retold the story of those brave man for new generation be sure that as make this speech bot will be crawl over steven fantastic script to train artificial intelligence model just as they have crawl over my script and those of thousand indeed million of other screenwriter they will be steal copyright material hard write and hard win by real human scrap it from under our nose without permission to make money for their ai company if only we have the ai equivalent of sas rogue heroes and the like of paddy mayne to protect we we will just have to rely on something that be little more tame but still have tooth and that be good legislation paddy mayne be unforgettably play in the series by jack who bring the character to vivid life the producer of the show stephen smallwood tell that shoot in the sahara desert in july at make and the other actor think that they be just as hardcore as the sas until they be remind that they have an air condition hotel and cold beer to return to that night the condition in which paddy mayne and his colleague operate be truly beyond anything that we can imagine now the raid that paddy lead in libya be follow by legendary outing in italy and sicily before he demonstrate outstanding courage by rescue wound man trap in nazi ambush clear machine gun position and clear path for the ally advance that be truly the stuff of legend that outstanding bravery earn he citation for victoria cross but it be downgrade to distinguished service order his fourth which have cause puzzlement ever since although lieutenant colonel mayne be one of the very few recipient of rare third bar to the dso my hon friend the member for strangford be not alone in think that that be not enough and that he should be posthumously award the victoria cross understand however that it be key tenet of the british honour and award system that such honour be not grant retrospectively so that decision make by peer and commander at the time be respect how and why the citation be overturn may never be fully understand but let say to the hon member for strangford that although the pen stroke of bureaucrat may be lose in the mist of time paddy mayne legacy live on in the democracy and the value that we now take for grant but which be win by the sacrifice of mayne fall colleague and the wide armed force his legacy live on in the celebration next month when we will mark the anniversary of victory in europe ve day and then in august when we will mark the anniversary of victory in japan vj day commemorate the end of the second world war be sure that if he be alive today paddy mayne would be look to we in this place to do right by the man and woman who serve and risk their life for this country be proud to be part of government who be committed to strengthen support for our veteran and armed force community by put the armed force covenant fully into law and ensure that veteran have secure home million of people around the world have now learn about paddy mayne courage and leadership through the tv show seventy year after his untimely death paddy mayne have officially pass into legend and his phenomenal bravery will live on forever in the motto of the sas who dare win rise to speak about man whose name be etch into the very dna of the british special force man of exceptional courage legendary leadership and unrelenting service to this country lieutenant colonel robert blair mayne affectionately know as paddy mayne commend my hon friend the member for strangford jim shannon for secure the debate there be no well man to take this issue forward and to try to right the wrong that be do to paddy blair mayne mighty man have come from newtownards in the form of paddy blair mayne and my hon friend in northern ireland we talk about rough cut diamond and paddy blair mayne be just that he be certainly not perfect none of we be but when it come to his service he certainly lead from the front and be mighty man he be one of the found member of the special air service and help to build it into the elite force that we know and revere today his leadership during world war two change the course of modern warfare he be warrior in the true sense fearless inventive and utterly devoted to his man mayne be award the distinguished service order not once but four time an honour that be almost unheard of he be man who lead from the front and who raid behind enemy line with such ferocity and tactical genius that even his enemy respect he he destroy over aircraft in dare mission across north africa he risk everything time and again not for medal or recognition but because it be his duty however despite the eyewitness account of unimaginable bravery under fire and the legacy that he leave behind in the sas and british military history he be deny the victoria cross and this wrong have never be make right it be lingering and grave injustice the victoria cross be the high award for gallantry in the face of the enemy it be mean to honour the most conspicuous bravery or daring or pre eminent act of valour or self sacrifice paddy mayne be the very embodiment of those word however this be not just about right wrong from the past it be about recognise what he give and what he give up he lead from the front while other hesitate he put his own life on the line so that his man could return home and his example have inspire generation of servicemen and woman this be matter not of sentiment but of principle it be time that this country honour paddy mayne not just with word statue or story but with the medal that he so clearly earn urge the minister to reconsider this case with the seriousness and urgency it deserve lieutenant colonel paddy mayne be national hero he give his all and now his country must give he the long overdue recognition he deserve the victoria cross thank the hon member for strangford jim shannon for secure today debate the award of the victoria cross have an extraordinary impact on individual and their family friend and community will give an example of my own from the town of hatfield woodhouse where we be proud to have produce corporal john william harper vc corporal harper serve in the battalion of the british army york and lancaster regiment during the second world war and on september he lead his section in an assault over open ground against fortified position he lead from the front and repeatedly move forward alone to establish the way forward before expose his own comrade to danger unfortunately corporal harper be fatally wound in the assault but his action secure the success of the attack hatfield remember corporal harper by maintain twinning arrangement with the town of merksplas in belgium where his gallantry take place memorial to he can be see at the local st lawrence church and at the site of the war graf and local child still learn about harper vc at school in merksplas and donny today even in the last few year new extension to the hatfield area be name harpers heath in his honour show that the memory be still important to the people of the town this be important as part of today debate because as time move on and new generation be bear the story of the victoria cross and the legend who receive it mean we never forget their gallantry and we never forget the gallantry of all the people who have serve we that be why this award of victoria cross could make all the difference in recognise hero such as blair mayne who sacrifice so much for other but also for the pride it bring to the community regardless of what the minister say be so pleased that the hon member for strangford whom call my friend have be able to raise this today and blair mayne effort will be recognise in the chamber and remember forever congratulate my neighbour the hon member for strangford jim shannon on secure this important debate we could almost smell the cordite in his opening remark my first encounter with the special air service be when just as we be get to the good bit the john wayne film on tv be interrupt and it be over to kate adie as man in bug eyed respirator end the iranian embassy siege on may amid the thunder of flashbang and the staccato rattle of small arm fire as journalist later meet john mac mcaleese who really be the man on the balcony not hate to break it to member that bloke down the pub mumble about the colour of the boathouse at hereford as walter mitty character do also become friend with colonel clive fairweather second in command of the regiment sadly both man be no long with we but in life one thing be obvious neither be reckless psychopath they be hard man yes of course for theirs be lethal business but rather more planning and preparation go into tier special force than novel and tv would have we believe controversy reign over television brilliant sas rogue heroes and blair paddy mayne depiction but it be nothing new there be all sort of claim about the book bravo two zero when it emerge after the first gulf war be it fact or fantasy peter billy rat ratcliffe former regimental sergeant major of sas tell life in the regiment be not really about garrotte sentry you know but you do know how to garrotte sentry do you ask in his salford accent he tell oh yeah but rather shoot you from mile away less chance of be compromise that be uncompromise but careful thoughtful and cunning too as such these man be surely the inheritor of the spirit of blair mayne for certain he could be wild man especially in drink there be cottage on the isle of arran pockmark yet by round fire from his service revolver after surfeit of whisky but it fall to mayne to protect and indeed nurture the nascent sas when its founder sir david stirling be prisoner of war in italy and the infamous colditz if mayne be as unhinged as he be portray he would not have be able to apply the quiet discipline need to forge bunch of rogue into an effective and elite fighting force it strike that the only recklessness blair mayne display be for his own safety never that of his man his blades as sas trooper be know concern we today be the action at oldenburg on april but let be clear that this be not football style var for gallantry medal we be not reopen case by the dozen just this oddity we may never know what precisely happen there almost year ago to the day we do know that mayne be recommend for the vc and his audacity be the only thing say to have keep he alive we may also never learn what make the authority downgrade that vc be it professional jealousy special force face that today the sobriquet the hereford hooligan be unfairly append to the sas in many mess and sf officer who ought to be general somehow do not make the cut mayne hand shape the sas and the regiment have in turn guide special force around the globe us major charles blisters beckwith raise the delta force he promise it will get you medal or body bag maybe time spend with the sas mayne legacy be secure and there be no doubt his courage we be not here to critique sas rogue be fun and it have great soundtrack and great acting although the accent be as sketchy as the history instead we should coolly examine the real major mayne and ask why the vc be approve by all who matter but rescind in murky circumstance be student of military history have undertake distance learn ma with the excellent university of birmingham one of the first lesson learn be that history be not fix it be not preserve in aspic but shift and change as new detail and perspective open up look at the so call château general man who in life be highly rat by their troop only later to be accuse of be donkey lead lion aside from the few who think that blackadder go forth be documentary that trope be happily be revisit we should have courage enough today to look again at the mayne case too eighty year on we can sense something odd about the lack of rather than single perhaps the military be split in two into ratcatcher and regulator and we need both we need regulator with their rulebook and procedure in time of peace and we need maverick ratcatcher in time of war mayne be fine ratcatcher and regulator then and now should not stand between he and this country premier gallantry medal begin by simply acknowledge the hon member for strangford jim shannon for table an early day motion and securing today important debate the hon gentleman have support so many new starter in this house since we join parliament so it be pleasure to support he in his advocacy of this important cause today as we have hear from member across the house with his courage and bravery robert blair paddy mayne stand alongside the great soldier of our reckoning past or present and the heroism that he demonstrate during the second world war be rightly celebrate however want to take moment to shine light on lesser know but remarkable chapter of his life the work he do with the falkland islands dependencies survey this chapter reflect his unwavering dedication to service and duty but it also hold special resonance for personally as recover academic with strong interest in the uk overseas territory an observer of the falklands referendum and former shackleton scholar have have the privilege of visit the falkland islands on numerous occasion most recently in during those visit have see for myself the pristine wilderness and unparalleled beauty of the island wildlife but above all the unwavering strength of the people who call the falklands home in the aftermath of the second world war one might have expect robert blair mayne have give so much in battle and skirmish to have seek the comfort of home family and well earn rest but that be not the direction he choose instead of step away from public service he delay his return to civilian life and join the falkland islands dependencies survey precursor to what be now the british antarctic survey the organisation which begin life as naval operation in under the codename operation tabarin have an important strategic purpose while its official mission have be to monitor enemy shipping its true goal be to counter argentine and chilean territorial claim in the antarctic and assert british sovereignty by establish manned basis in the region when the war end the operation transition into the falkland islands dependencies survey in late three former sas member include lieutenant colonel blair mayne join the expedition lead by naval surgeon commander bingham with mayne appoint second in command this be no ceremonial visit to the southern hemisphere blair mayne fully embrace the challenge of the mission he be active on board the ship on the ground and on the ice participate in the full scope of the expedition lead dog team survey wildlife and camping in some of the harsh most isolated condition imaginable mayne journal and photograph offer rare glimpse into the life and work of british explorer surveyor and scientist in the southern hemisphere and antarctica during the immediate post war period reveal not only the isolation of the vast icy landscape but the camaraderie he share with his comrade recurrence of the same camaraderie he demonstrate during his active service in europe and north africa it be only recur back injury one sustain during his wartime service that force mayne early return to the falklands for medical treatment nothing could be do to ease the condition or the pain from which he suffer from port stanley mayne be transport back to england and thence to northern ireland in the spring of the injury that cut short his antarctic service would trouble he for the rest of his life still in his and resettle in northern ireland mayne former british and irish lion be say to live with such profound and chronic pain that he be unable even to spectate rugby match from the terrace at ravenhill for year mayne supporter have remain acutely aware of the injustice that deny the victoria cross to this extraordinary man and undisputed national hero blair mayne legacy be not only of valour in battle but of unparalleled leadership courage and sacrifice under the severest of condition colonel david stirling who himself know something of courage and leadership note of mayne that he have marvellous battle nostril he could really sense precisely what he have to do in situation it be sheer courage it be sheer technique today debate be not about rewrite history it concern the righting of historic wrong one that be evident at the time of its making in and one that have become only clear with the passage of time and the application of clear eyed historical lens on the anniversary of mayne recommendation for the victoria cross and in the anniversary year of mayne untimely death in there could be no well or more appropriate moment for his majesty government to take up the cause and finally award lieutenant colonel robert blair mayne the victoria cross recognition earn in which be now year overdue but we hope not for much long have not intend to speak in this debate madam deputy speaker so forgive for not be as eloquent as other contributor it be an honour to follow the hon member for surrey heath dr pinkerton he mention david stirling and it would be remiss of not to mention particularly while wear this tie that david stirling be of course scots guard my own regiment in which spend year congratulate the hon member for strangford jim shannon on secure this debate for something that be year too late it be timely he have to be perfectly honest when he say that the king be confused and disappoint that mayne have not be award the victoria cross he have when he say that winston churchill be equally confused discombobulated and disappoint it be the mention of churchill that put in mind of particular churchill quote about medal medal glitter but it also cast shadow that have be go round my head as have listen to hon member so much so that go and find the whole quotation it be from speech give in this place on march quote the object of give medal star and ribbon will not do an impression by the way be to give pride and pleasure to those who have deserve they at the same time distinction be something which everybody do not possess if all have it it be of less value medal glitter but it also cast shadow official report march vol the way to get rid of shadow be to shine light welcome the fact that the hon member for strangford be shin full beam light on the case of paddy mayne today invite the minister to continue to shine that light with review of this case in the cold light of day such that the ministry of defence can reconsider and award blair paddy mayne the victoria cross he so richly deserve that bring we to the front bench contribution call the liberal democrat spokesperson thank the hon member for strangford jim shannon for secure this debate on may this house together with the whole country will celebrate the anniversary of victory in europe this important milestone provide we with renew opportunity to reflect on the sacrifice and struggle of that great generation who fight to protect britain and preserve our freedom and democracy in the face of fascism and tyranny it be our duty in this house and in our community across the uk to recognise and celebrate the contribution make by our incredible service personnel to the security defence and prosperity of this country that must include reflect on the service of all current military personnel who protect we today the live veteran who have finish their time in the armed force and the servicemen and woman from previous generation who be no long with we they be all of they bind together by thread of service and sacrifice for this country we must continually renew our gratitude and remembrance of that service therefore welcome today incredibly valuable debate it shin spotlight on the gallantry and heroism of one of the uk most decorate servicemen blair paddy mayne whose propose recognition with posthumous victoria cross warmly support as the premier operational gallantry award it be worth while remind ourselves of its requirement it be award for most conspicuous bravery or some daring or pre eminent act of valour or self sacrifice or extreme devotion to duty in the presence of the enemy it be clear that blair mayne personify the high standard of bravery in the face of the enemy and across his career in the special air service and on that basis merit the award of victoria cross blair mayne be one of the first leader of the sas follow its formation in it be design with the intention of conduct guerrilla warfare against the axis power which be at that time on their march across europe africa and asia the sas role in the second world war be unconventional but crucial its work to disrupt operation behind enemy line particularly through its use of small scale raid intelligence gathering and support for network of resistance group against the fascist occupier be vital in undermine the axis political and military strength as part of the then regiment mayne show extraordinary valour and heroism while carry out dangerous and daring raid in north africa italy and france harass nazi and fascist supply line indeed in november may ne lead one of the first sas mission consider to be major success an attack on libyan airfield which see dozen of enemy aircraft destroy in january follow the capture of colonel david stirling mayne take over the command of the sas go on to lead his man in campaign in sicily and italy before the sas take part in the day landing these be just few example of the conspicuous bravery display by mayne in his leadership of the sas it be important to remember too that for mayne and all the member of this elite regiment be apprehend by the nazis from onwards would likely have mean their summary execution at the hand of their captor consistently operate under such condition require without doubt exceptional bravery mayne be already one of our most decorate veteran he be one of only eight people during the second world war to be award the distinguished service order on four occasion at the time the second high gallantry award behind the victoria cross this serve as an important testament to the consistency of his bravery leadership and resolve often in the face of odd stack against he it be only right and fair that we honour that courage today through the award of posthumous victoria cross indeed the award of victoria cross would honour not only mayne but in many way the role of our special force writ large both historically and to this day for many people their knowledge and understanding of the sas will have be inform by the bbc dramatisation of the regiment found in sas rogue heroes which member have already extoll the series have have an important impact highlight the enormous contribution of the sas in secure the freedom we celebrate today and protect it still it have also highlight the important work of the bbc in bring story such as these to the public attention impress on all of we the sacrifice and courage of our armed force there be now only few living veteran of that great generation who can recall their story and remind we of the price that they and so many other pay to defend our way of life just last month we say goodbye to another paddy group captain john paddy hemingway who be the last surviving pilot of the battle of britain and who as part of the raf defeat the luftwaffe and defend our country from invasion we have responsibility to champion their voice and their deed and to continue to recognise act of outstanding valour and heroism in our armed force that be why warmly support the award of posthumous victoria cross to blair mayne the decoration that king george vi say have so strangely elude he but be within our gift to correct call the shadow minister like everybody in the chamber thank the hon member for strangford jim shannon for secure this debate on the final day before easter we have really enjoy listen to the story he share as well as those share by many other across the chamber although have never want to be commando have many of they as constituent who call friend and there be many hon and gallant members across the house who be also my friend refer the house to my entry in the register of members financial interests as will refer to the commonwealth war graves commission during my speech think that would start my remark by mention the one victoria cross that have direct interaction with albeit posthumous one while work for the war graf commission in an australian ordinary seaman the great thing about the victoria cross be that it know no record of rank it be open to everybody be award that posthumous vc by the late queen what be lovely about it be that when the naval memorial be undergo renovation year later the initial vc be add after the name to be able to watch the lettering be create and solder into place be particularly move that be another example of posthumous award that have be give what be strike about the comment make by the hon member for strangford for south antrim robin swann and for upper bann carla lockhart be the repetition of the word leadership anybody in the chamber who be like would have be think gosh this man be brilliant example of some of the thing that we need to show as politician feel quite inspire listen to the thing that paddy mayne do as the hon member for strangford say he be leader of man he be bear for that time he dominate the scene and none of the enemy remain we do not want to be too political but perhaps those be some great mantra for we as we head into the local election he defeat and destroy the enemy indeed however we be here to talk about he particularly enjoy the more modern reference to screenwriting and to our journalistic colleague from the hon member for scarborough and whitby alison hume and my hon friend the member for dumfries and galloway john cooper as well as the link to the falkland islands make by the hon member for surrey heath dr pinkerton it be particularly important to understand what paddy mayne do after he leave the sas we also hear reference to corporal john harper vc and that reminder of winston churchill word and indeed the king word from my hon friend the member for spelthorne lincoln jopp may take this opportunity to place on the record my and his majesty official opposition unwavere support for our special force as they exist today they continue to play vital role for our country while we will always respect the requirement for operational secrecy be sure that hon member on both side of the house sleep soundly know that we have such highly trained and brave set of soldier protect the nation it be real honour to speak in the debate represent as do constituency that be home not just to many veteran but to many serve personnel some of whom know take part in the most daring and dangerous mission the life story of robert blair mayne or paddy mayne be as we have hear by all account exciting brave and just little controversial he operate in some of the most unforgiving location in the world for example north africa and the normandy landing highlight the vital work of the new elite commando force the special air service that come into be during the second world war of which blair paddy mayne be such an important member it be in no doubt that lieutenant colonel paddy mayne serve gallantly and with distinction that be something that his military record clearly highlight have receive his distinguished service order and three bar even if one of those be the whole point of the debate as well as officer of the legion of honour from france and the croix de guerre from belgium however evidence may now exist to suggest that that third dso bar should indeed have be vc all along know how important secure the appropriate level of honour for paddy mayne and other be to many today those who be still alive and serve at that time and those who fight on their behalf indeed have spend hour with one of my constituent ivor foster who believe deeply that his service as part of bomber command should be recognise with distinct medal rather than with clasp on the star even though do not entirely agree with he to this day he will not apply for the clasp such be his desire to be recognise for his work in contrast it seem that reopen paddy mayne case may indeed be in order that specific case aside our overarching position as party be that we continue to support the independent medallic recognition process it be an independent honour and awards committee job to decide the nature of gallantry award in the case of the victoria cross it rightly remain in the gift of the sovereign equally remain reluctant about the process become politicised or there be precedent towards either overlook history or second guess it hon member will be unsurprise that have work for the commonwealth war graves commission be particularly interested in the historical fact that we need to ensure that we follow have spend six year work for the commission across the south west want to touch on one story that think be helpful to what we be discuss this afternoon anyone familiar with the iconic cwgc headstone may be aware that many have small inscription at the bottom always worth look if hon member be ever in cemetery it be know as the personal inscription unfortunately do not think to write any example down in my speech but there be brilliant website where they can be find the inscription be institute as way for family to personalise headstone interestingly they come about after much debate in this place about the uniformity of the headstone decide on at the end of the first world war and the lack of choice for family in how their love one be to be commemorate that be definitely story for another day but recommend deep dive into hansard if hon member be at all interested as the work of the commission have continue over the decade in some case headstone have have to be replace due to wear and tear with that often come contact with the descendant of the casualty who by definition generally do not know the person and often do not know their relative either the commission have therefore set in place policy for what to do when modern day relative wish to add personal inscription to replacement headstone essentially they be not allow to add one if there be none or change what be put there at the point of the original installation the decision be reach that there be reason why the family at the time choose not to inscribe or indeed choose the form of word that have be there for decade and because the commission do not have record of why an inscription be add or not add or change it in the commission belief would alter the integrity of the commemoration share that story as believe it have some bearing on how posthumous gallantry award be consider it be my view that something that significant must reflect historical fact television show such as sas rogue heroes as we have hear much about this afternoon and indeed the late must see on very different topic do so much to bring untold story to the fore and get the country talk about issue that have previously not be discuss even though such story can promote debate the policy and decision make around the issue they raise must be evidence base and consistent and must not set an unhelpful precedent however in this case it seem that compelling new evidence be come to light that prompt rethink at its core this debate be about an individual soldier northern irish soldier from newtownards who step up when his nation need he mention his birthplace because be sure it will not go unnoticed by those in the chamber that while we stand here today celebrate the heroic action of one sas veteran many veteran of that service be currently live in fear of vexatious legal action most recently the clonoe verdict have shine spotlight on our northern ireland veteran again and take this opportunity to place on the record my thank to the minister for veterans and people for his support for judicial review of the clonoe inquest protect our veteran be something that hope carry unanimous support and know the minister be passionate advocate for veteran affair hope that his experience and judgment be already be seek by his colleague in the northern ireland office perhaps he may advise they to reconsider their plan to repeal the northern ireland troubles legacy and reconciliation act as already mention this debate also provide another opportunity to discuss our country record on veteran affair the previous conservative government set new standard for support veteran with the creation of the office for veterans affairs veterans minister around the cabinet table the introduction of veteran id card and op courage to support mental health service for veteran no doubt many of whom would have be the colleague of paddy mayne have that service exist back then our backing of those who stand up and serve be matter of public record and welcome labour commitment to much of that work however before conclude want to highlight just one issue relate to these second world war veteran that the government might like to give some attention to as we approach the anniversary of ve day and vj day it be vital that we keep in mind the few than veteran of world war two who survive unlike some of the colleague of paddy mayne and who be still alive as we know these man and woman be likely to be fast approach or indeed to have reach the incredible age of that bring back to my constituent ivor foster just few week ago visit ivor at his care home as he remain exercise about the cost of his social care have live to the ripe old age of year and eight month he be spend month to live in local care home there be range of reason for that but believe that ahead of may ivor case highlight that we be fortunate enough to be live in the midst of man and woman who as in the case of ivor not only live through the war but take part in active combat fortunately survive and then contribute to society afterwards gently ask the minister in slightly cheeky way what consideration have be give to how we will acknowledge and show our gratitude to those few than individual who be still alive as we mark the anniversary of the liberation that they and paddy mayne fight for be grateful to the hon member for strangford for the opportunity to contribute to this debate give both my constituency link to our commando force as the home of royal marines commando and my previous career with the commonwealth war graves commission be passionate advocate for veteran affair so it have be an honour to stand at this dispatch box and debate such an important topic case such as this rightly cause debate and be pleased that we have be able to have this conversation today not least because it have give we another opportunity to express on the record the commitment and gratitude that we share across this house for the brave man and woman who serve and have serve our country in the armed force we owe it to all serve personnel and veteran to ensure that gallantry medal and award at all level be present where the evidence be irrefutable to ensure that their intrinsic value be maintain it seem that the story of paddy mayne may do just that and await the minister response with interest thank the hon member for strangford jim shannon for bring this important debate to this place today it be really important that we shine light on this issue have the great respect for the sustained and passionate advocacy in support of posthumous victoria cross for lieutenant colonel robert blair mayne would also like to fully associate myself with the powerful tribute the hon member have pay as have many in the house today to lieutenant colonel mayne who be without doubt one of the great hero of the second world war his legacy live on in the spirit of the special air service today and his courage and accomplishment be rightly celebrate for our generation by the portrayal slightly dramatised perhaps in the recent bbc drama sas rogue heroes it be particularly pertinent that lieutenant colonel mayne be recognise for his bravery at the time he be one of the very few recipient of the rare third bar to the distinguished service order only have one he have three in recognition of his action as commander of the sas regiment during operation howard in april it should be remember that this make he one of the army most highly decorate officer of that time while it be possible to give gallantry award posthumously it be key tenet of the british honour and award system that they be not grant retrospectively this ensure that award be timely and clearly link to specific action or activity and in particular that they be award within the context of the time as have mention many time specifically when talk about northern ireland and various inquest and inquiry it be the responsibility of those investigation to understand the context of northern ireland at the height of the trouble it be also up to we sit in this warm place on these wonderful benches to understand the context in which the senior general make those decision around gallantry medal for gallantry award as well as for civilian and military honour the guide principle be that they will not be consider more than five year after the incident in question it be worth recall that all significant battle and operation that take place in the second world war be discuss in great detail in the context of medal recognition at the end of the war it be worth note that out of all the year of war it be only in that more victoria crosses be award posthumously than to those live after year of war many have see conflict courage and commitment to service and while it be not necessarily fact the bar no pun intended for vcs be statistically high at the end of the war it be worth note that it be recommend in june that no further recommendation for gallantry award should be consider after from what we know from the paperwork that exist about lieutenant colonel mayne recommendation for victoria cross there be lot of speculation that appropriate process be not follow or that an administrative error take place the evidence we have suggest that lieutenant colonel mayne citation pass through the correct chain of command and be properly consider by succession of senior officer all of whom have lot of combat experience in leadership and in the field and be experience in the consideration of medallic recognition and gallantry award after many year of hard fighting during the second world war think it might be worthwhile bring forward some of that correspondence certain correspondence hold by the canadian national archives from the deputy military secretary to his counterpart in the first canadian army reveal some doubt about the vc in the discussion between member of the vc committee it state that the vc committee consider it not quite clearly up to vc standard and that it be not single handed act of heroism that go to the point about single or signal in the letter the deputy military secretary also suggest the award of the third bar to the dso it can not be know for certain whether that be the reason why the vc be amend to dso in third bar form but it be likely it be clear that at some point in the process it be consider more appropriate for lieutenant colonel mayne to be award third bar to his dso which be itself an exceptionally high honour that decision be sign off by field marshal montgomery who have considerable combat experience throughout the whole of the conflict we also know that it be not uncommon at the time for the recommend level of award to be change as the citation go through the consideration process today the process remain relatively similar sit on many such honour and award committee in my time in the military such committee at unit brigade and division level will rank award against the context from their own particular perspective unit may have to deal with brigade and division we do not necessarily know the totality of the picture at the time lieutenant colonel paddy mayne citation be consider at each level there may have be stiff competition across the military particularly in the army fully respect all those who disagree with the decision make in relation to lieutenant colonel paddy mayne however believe it credible to conclude that he be war hero of the high order while also conclude that in some case it be not appropriate for officer official or ministers work today some year later to overrule the decision make by senior officer at the time who be steep in wartime experience and have contemporary appreciation of the brave action of lieutenant colonel mayne and importantly his peer fantastic point have be make in this important debate winston churchill cast shadow over those who perhaps do not get medal for everybody who do get one there be probably if not who do not get one but definitely deserve to interestingly the australian precedent be mention twice include by the hon member for strangford however australia separate honours system do not have any impact on uk policy australia not only bestow one vc retrospectively for vietnam but as be rightly mention second retrospective vc to ordinary seaman edward sheean who be kill in that speak to the vc have no boundary across service or domain the remark about the falkland islands be news to be sure that paddy mayne enjoy the isolation and camaraderie of small team wander around those pretty barren but amazing place the bomber command medal highlight how divisive the medal and honours system can be be sure that those with military service can remember multiple conversation about who get award and who do not as we talk about honour those who serve in the second world war it be worth note that many world war two veteran be up on the main screen of piccadilly circus today for thousand to see honour their service during that war combat can bring the good and bad out of we as have say several time in the house courage be decision not reaction it be clear to that lieutenant colonel mayne make multiple decision that be deeply courageous rather than just reaction or habit indeed they probably become habit because he make they so often to conclude be extremely grateful to the hon member for strangford for the opportunity he have give we all today to mark and lionise the incredible bravery leadership and spirit demonstrate by lieutenant colonel mayne some year ago robert blair mayne be simply one of the great from our great generation man of audacity ingenuity and fearsome courageousness whose raid behind enemy line and courage in rescue injure comrade under fire be the stuff of military legend man whose spirit live on in the who dare win motto of the sas the proud history of the sas mark it out as one of the most battle harden and professional organisation of its time and the very tip of the spear paddy mayne be not only hero within his regiment but national hero and he remind of the saying in time of peace we must protect the maverick it be recognise that clerical mistake in judgment or order or error arise from any accidental slip or omission in language can explicitly be fix and there be no time limit for do so as long as the intent of the original decision hold as member of parliament who have mention in dispatch military cross and dso will take note of the new evidence that have be highlight its context and the exceptional circumstance of this debate and will ask the honours and awards committee to review the evidence and find decision once the decision be find by that independent body it will be finalise that will provide an answer once and for all on how paddy mayne service be recognise there be lot of mention today of look at the evidence with fresh eye in the context and have cool calculated review of the historical fact the honours and award committee will do that and we will present that evidence in the house thank the hon member for strangford for our debate lieutenant colonel robert blair mayne be man whose spirit and legend will remain recognise in the annal of the mother of parliaments in perpetuity call jim shannon

be always significant occasion mark the fact that easter be the holy time of year for christians in this country look over to the other side of the chamber and see the crest of sir david amess who be

blackman who suspect might be about to speak far to that point of order madam deputy speaker may assure you and the whole house that no discourtesy be intend whatsoever we do not get notice of whether we would get time for debate and when that time would be until quite late on take what my hon friend the member for romford andrew rosindell have say we will take that point back to the committee and will ensure that we correct the matter for the future and have easter and christmas recess debate the summer recess debate we have already rechristene the sir david amess debate hope that reassure my hon friend thank the chair of the backbench business committee for that clarification that bring we to the backbench business committee debate on matter to be raise before the forthcoming believe

and it seem as though it be only yesterday that we be prepare for christmas and the new year be pleased that the weather have finally indicate that spring have spring and with the clock go forward the day be get long and everyone be little chirpi apologise in advance because have bit of cold so hope do not develop meldrop during this speech it have be busy few month both in parliament and across my constituency have be speak in the chamber host resident tour and event visit school prepare for local election pilot presentation bill and chair the backbench business committee and we have celebrate lent ramadan navaratri and holi but still no trophy for tottenham hotspur maybe if we play more like bodrumspor we would finally win something that be an in joke for my team for colleague it have be an exhausting time and many of we may be feel like bit of wabbit by the time we get to the vacation be delighted that have assume the chairmanship of the backbench business committee follow in the footstep of the former member for gateshead who stand down have serve nine year as chair of the committee it be encouraging that so many member be keen to get in on this debate and hope to hear some topical and important issue be raise however if any colleague be apply for backbench business debate they will probably have to wait until the end of november or december before they will get debate in the chamber because we have such long waiting list thank the leader of the house for make time to meet to discuss the committee and ensure that back benchers have adequate time to discuss matter that they wish to raise let mention transport for london regular attendee of these debate will know that regularly bang the drum for lift in tube station in my constituency be sorry to say that be still bang the drum and we still do not have any lift however we recently have an excellent report from the transport committee on disabled access to public transport and subsequent statement in the house on that issue it be clear from the report and the experience of my constituent that we need tight definition of step free and that that may require change in the law my call for lift at stanmore station be just as be the call of the many member of this house who be campaign to make their station step free the station may be officially classify as step free but that be very broad definition at stanmore station to get from the gateline to the street people have to either go up stair or go up ramp so steep that even baroness grey thompson could not manage it they then have to wheel themselves through car park with no pavement for nearly yard we think that we need legislative change if that be what we need we want it as well as lift at canons park and queensbury station note that lift be be plan for eastcote station in my neighbouring constituency although that station get far few passenger than stanmore accord to the late datum clearly transport for london consider lift at stanmore to be inconsequential see no option but to make legislative change to remove stanmore suppose step free status in order to get some movement from as chairman of the all party parliamentary group on uk israel know that members of the house be all conscious of the escalate situation in the middle east there be clear and present danger that if terrorist remain in gaza the conflict can not have long term resolution and that hezbollah iran and extreme force in the middle east could be drag into full scale war with israel which none of we want the event that have unfold in the middle east since october have be unbearable to witness israel suffer the bad terrorist attack in its history at the hand of the iranian back terrorist hamas innocent civilian be brutally murder and hundred be take hostage include baby child and the elderly the hostage have be hold in appalling condition and the account give by those who have be release have be distress and harrowing as direct consequence of the action of hamas on october and the use of civilian infrastructure to undertake terrorist action palestinian civilian be face devastating humanitarian crisis in gaza my thought be with the family of those still hold hostage and every innocent life that have be lose or impact by the conflict firmly support israel right to defend itself against security threat but we must continue to press the government to work with international partner to support ceasefire in gaza to release all hostage to provide aid and to work towards lasting and sustainable end to the conflict in the long term continue to support credible and irreversible pathway towards two state solution for israel and palestine with both nation and the wide region live side by side in peace and security thank the chair of the backbench business committee for oblige with all these debate over the year there be couple more come up which will keep we busy in few week time on the future of gaza and israel support the two state solution as the way forward but do the hon gentleman share my view that peace can happen only if hamas be not there hamas be try to restrict freedom and liberty do the hon gentleman believe that they can not be part of future in which everyone can be at peace thank the backbench business committee season ticket holder for his intervention but assure he that it will not get he any favour in his application for further debate be sadden to hear that on sunday night hamas yet again fire rocket into israel in an attempt to cause further harm and destruction despite the civilian of gaza be in desperate need of ceasefire if that do not show that they be terrorist organisation do not know what would they be focus solely on the destruction of not only israel but their own people it be an outrage that they be still in position with passover come pray that we can reach true settlement restore peace in the region and ensure that no more life be lose in the war against terrorism have just celebrate the persian new year nowruz we need free and democratic iran in iran people continue to be supresse by the undemocratic regime and be silence and imprison for show any opposition to the islamic revolutionary guard corps the regime be become increasingly brutal with at least people execute in iran during the first three month of this year double the number of people who be execute in the same period last year the irgc be threat to global prosperity and security it continue to fund external militia group across the middle east it be particularly concern that iran russia and china have be engage in talk about their nuclear programme hope that president trump firm approach to their action will make they think twice before cause further disruption in the area once again urge the government to turn their promise into action and to proscribe the irgc in its entirety as terrorist organisation be the chairman of the appg on end homelessness we face rise cost of living increase unemployment and more recently rise in council tax many more people be be force to live in poverty and be struggle to afford their rent rent have rise by this year take they out of reach and force many people into temporary accommodation or bad on to the street where they have to sleep rough in harrow east alone accord to recent report from crisis mere of housing be deem to be affordable that be unsustainable and exert considerable pressure on local authority in more positive news be pleased that my third private member bill on homelessness and tackle rough sleeping recently pass its second reading unopposed the homelessness prevention bill focus on use prevention at the core of solve the rough sleeping problem as it be often too late much hard and much more expensive to help people once they be already on the street the bill would increase the effectiveness of the current duty on local housing authority in england to take reasonable step to help an applicant threaten with homelessness to secure accommodation so that it do not cease to be available to they look forward to the next step in secure government support to achieve royal assent be also pleased that we soar through the third reading of the tobacco and vapes bill welcome the government ambition to inherit the goal of the previous conservative administration to eradicate smoking from society and tackle

that redhill have to offer that be positive thing for our local economy but at the same time we have see an increase in antisocial behaviour to address the real issue face the safer redhill initiative be establish that be partnership between surrey police the office of the police and crime commissioner reigate and banstead borough council and east surrey ymca to cut crime and foster pride in the town the project adopt the college of policing clear hold build framework which be three stage approach where offender be clear from the area and then partner work together to put in place intervention to keep it that way from drug operation at redhill train station to plain clothe officer out at night look for suspicious behaviour huge amount have be achieve as part of the safer redhill initiative there have be arrest with combine prison time of year for local offender drug seizure include kg of suspect of cash recover and weapon take off the street take this opportunity to thank surrey police especially jon vale the borough commander and lisa townsend the police and crime commissioner for ensure that redhill get the additional police focus it need at the right time however make redhill safe be not all about police action it be also about prevention and that be where east surrey ymca have come in with its qualified youth worker it have be support local young people at risk of offend or become neet not in education employment or training by give they the support they need and help they to thrive and flourish with their bus the ymca have be get out and about in redhill to engage with the young people and thank it for the important part it have play in make redhill safe and ensure more positive future for the next generation safer redhill be an inspiring example of what can be achieve by the police the local council and the charity sector work hand in hand with all partner bring different skill and expertise to the table but with the same ultimate goal thank and pay tribute to everyone involve it be wonderful to see the local community start to feel safe in the town centre and business feel more confident about their future in redhill however there be still much to do and will speak briefly on some of the other challenge face in redhill town centre the first be pavement parking redhill have fantastic pedestrianise shopping area but some people mistake it for car park and even use it as cut through that behaviour by motorist be disrespectful and downright dangerous there use to be physical bollard in place to prevent access by car and those need to be fix as that would go long way towards address the issue but we in this place also have role to play we must ensure that unnecessary and antisocial pavement parking as in the case of redhill town centre be tackle and routinely enforce that type of parking affect wheelchair user people with visual impairment and those with pushchair make it difficult for they to get around safely redhill resident have be raise this issue for year and we must tackle it currently it be not criminal offence for car to park on the pavement which be to ensure that traffic continue to flow on narrow road where pavement parking be the only option but it be an offence if the vehicle create an unnecessary obstruction the problem here be what constitute an unnecessary obstruction and that ambiguity make it incredibly difficult for the police to successfully prosecute offender as consequence of the low success rate we see few instance of the police enforce it therefore urge government ministers to look at how we can make it clear which type of pavement parking be prohibit and which be not so that effective enforcement can be deploy by the police or even the local authority create the necessary deterrent effect thank you madam deputy speaker for allow to talk for so long about the wonderful town of redhill and the huge amount of work that have be put into make it safe will now bring my remark to close so that other may contribute it be pleasure to take part in this easter adjournment debate for moment there think that the chair of the backbench business committee the hon member for harrow east bob blackman be try to cancel easter which worry he would not just have be haunt by david amess believe will talk briefly about gambling the gambling act and how it be not fit for purpose be sick and tired of the number of gambling establishment pop up in my constituency every time shop close gambling establishment try to put in bet shop the gambling act be not fit for the modern age under the aim to permit provision council must permit licence have have so many argument with brent council that it have lead an amazing campaign join by other council around the country call on the government to reform the act so that we can protect our high street this be brent six point plan for change reform the aim to permit policy categorise gambling premise consider household debt in planning introduce statutory levy ban gambling advertising and halt liberalisation of adult gaming centre fix odd bet terminal be more addictive than heroin and for every person who be addict to gambling at least seven other be also affect there be licensed premise in brent and my constituency contain more gambling establishment than supermarket and school which be ridiculous hope that the english devolution white paper power and partnership will enable we to reset the relationship between central and local government and ensure that local authority can listen to local resident include those in brent east so that when we say we need no more gambling establish our high street they will no long be allow rise order want to get everyone in so be impose an immediate four minute time limit dorset be burn just before midnight last wednesday the sky outside my home glow deep orange upton heath precious stretch of lowland habitat be ablaze in the middle of the ground nest bird season few hour later just mile away canford heath one of our large and most precious site of special scientific interest be also go up in smoke and day before that moors valley country park and forest just outside my constituency have also catch fire these be not isolate incident they be frighteningly normal fire crew from dorset wiltshire hampshire and the isle of wight work through the night and we owe they all debt of gratitude but more than football pitch worth of rare habitat be nevertheless lose in that one fire it be not even the first time this year upton heath burn back in february in march part of rspb arne be torch and canford heath go up in smoke as well dorset wildlife trust rush to rescue reptile and assess the devastation to the nest of nightjar woodlark and dartford warbler even when their nest and egg survive their insect food source be go nature organisation have establish that it will take at least five year for upton heath to recover from this one incident dorset be one of the few area in the country where nature be actually make comeback partly thank to the dorset heaths partnership but how long can we keep win this battle if the fire keep come so what be cause the fire let be clear it be we almost every one of these fire from upton heath to wareham forest be cause by human activity carelessly drop cigarette illegal campfire or bad deliberate arson as climate change make our landscape hotter and dry we be live in perfect storm fire be more frequent more intense and hard to contain know the fire service well my dad ray walls serve with the london fire brigade throughout his career and have be member of the dorset and wiltshire fire authority have see what the fire crew do hero run towards danger as we run away but have also see how underfunded they be last year we lose fire appliance in poole and wareham with further threat to wimborne and bere regis this be about response time when family home be at risk or someone be stick in flood dorset and wiltshire fire and rescue have receive real term cut in government funding and the fire brigades union have say that fire funding be now low than it be decade ago band household in dorset pay just week for its fire service through council tax but local service have no flexibility to raise more if they want to we need proper investment we need drone for wildfire detection we need equipment for flood rescue and for bariatric patient we need fire crew not just to respond but to educate prevent and prepare they be do great job attend school such as broadstone middle school where last month fire crew explain the danger to young child but they be stretch to capacity therefore call on the government to rethink fire service funding so that it be sustainable for the future let we look at the cause of so many accidental fire disposable barbecue they seem harmless but they have be the spark behind countless wildfire over in london in just year local authority can and do impose public space protection order and dorset be consult on one but if petrol station and supermarket keep sell barbecue people will keep buy they disposable barbecue not only cause fire they get leave behind on beach burn unsuspecting foot and create litter it be time we consider ban as we head into the easter recess encourage people to enjoy dorset it be jewel of the uk fill with chocolate box town stunning beach and plenty of easter egg hunt at farmer palmer and kingston lacy but please leave your barbecue at home will end by put on record my thank to all member of the emergency service and the volunteer who work alongside they include the royal national lifeboat institution dorset community first responder and corfe mullen firewise volunteer may join other members in pay tribute to sir david amess he be monumental figure in british politic and internationally bank continue to do well despite the challenge that ordinary household continue to face we have have the disappointing news that natwest be plan to close bank branch this year nine of those be in greater manchester and one of they be in my constituency these branch closure will undoubtedly cause uncertainty for staff and they will have an adverse and disproportionate impact on people with low income old people disabled people and people with low level of literacy who rely on bank branch after natwest group be rescue in by billion government bail out believe that it have duty of care to british taxpayer and should continue to provide vital community service have recently visit several excellent secondary school in my constituency include reddish vale high school priestnall school in the heatons and reddish hall school it be great to see that the staff student and teacher be so ambitious about the future but the funding that our local authority receive could go far stockport have one of the lowest fund school system in england and it have high proportion of child with education health and care plan than the national average my local authority be part of the group of local authority some of which be the lowest funded on average the lowest fund authority for send receive approximately per pupil with the highest fund receive per pupil in stockport the figure be approximately per pupil want to see reallocation of funding for stockport and obviously want to see more funding allocate to child in stockport sky make major announcement few day ago and have be do some work with my hon friend the members for sheffield central abtisam mohamed and for leeds central and headingley alex sobel sky announce that it be plan to close three contact centre in sheffield leeds and stockport put job at risk include in stockport have be contact by large number of sky employee who be distress by the news

simply not acceptable my hon friend and have have meeting with sky and we be look forward to engage with staff the loss of these job in leeds sheffield and stockport be hammer blow to our town sadly on new year day we have some flooding in my constituency the meadow mill be affect and recently have very productive meeting with the environment agency pay tribute to the emergency service worker and council staff who help resident on the day of the flood but want to see the government invest more in flood defence particularly in my constituency to support resident and business number of resident have contact about the flooding and it have have negative impact on quite new development finish by wish you happy easter madam deputy speaker also take this opportunity to wish the cleaner who clean our office on the parliamentary estate our police officer our catering staff everyone who work here and of course member staff very happy easter rise to talk about south west water and pennon group speak today for anyone in devon and cornwall who have ever have to walk past polluted stream stay out of the sea when visit beach or stare at water bill and wonder how do we end up here south west water like its parent company pennon have become byword in the south west for failure aloofness and even arrogance in the company dump sewage into our river and sea for over hour these spill be suppose to happen only in exceptional circumstance in reality this have be regard as licence to pollute if that be not enough south west water be now try to flush out our constituent wallet issue bill rise of over in some case should say that ofwat rule last december that bill can rise by on average over five year before inflation however that rise be permit on average bill and many bill for resident in devon have rise by much more stuart thompson who live near aylesbeare have find that even though he be not connect to south west water sewerage system his annual bill be now even though last year it be just that be jump of over stuart be cancer patient and his immune system be weaken from treatment to protect himself he boil his water before drink it because he be conscious that south west water have an outbreak of the cryptosporidium parasite last year one can understand his caution give his weakened immunity when stuart try to ring south west water he find himself in the queue and that be not one off graham long who live in the blackdown hill near honiton also try ring south west water like stuart graham find on the first occasion that he be in the queue on another occasion he be when he try at quieter time he be and on day that be quieter still he be in the queue that be absolutely crazy from water company hike people bill in some instance by louise thompson from sidmouth contact in disbelief about her instalment she do get through to south west water and when she raise her concern about her high bill she be offer reduction to month rather than the for which she have be bill however she work out that this be because the instalment would be spread over month rather than so it be cloak for no bill reduction whatsoever yet since privatisation this company have pay out more than billion in shareholder dividend south west water be propose to spend billion on infrastructure improvement but the cry shame be that it have fail to invest in its infrastructure in year go by this week we have learn that the pr side of the business be go to be join by none other than the former mp for east devon simon jupp he be go to speak for south west water have attack it while he be member of parliament it be pleasure to speak in this easter recess debate to pay tribute to sir david and to bring to the attention of the house movement that have be spread across city and community all over the world speak of course of yarn bombing yarn bombing be an urban art form that involve decorate object in public place with knit or crochet yarn interruption the vandalism it be way of transform everyday place into something colourful creative and alive and it have take my constituency of carlisle by storm in the last month the term bombing come from traditional graffiti culture where street artist would leave their mark in public place however unlike spray paint yarn bombing be soft as it be about create sense of warmth and whimsy in an often difficult and challenging world at time when we be all too often disconnected from one another by screen and technology yarn bombing bring sense of connection it be an invitation to stop notice and engage and it can be playful light hearted and fun in carlisle that light hearted fun start with three lady who begin meet in their local community centre the follow week and month see the group grow in number their first project in may last year be the yarn bombing of mayor drive in bitts park in the centre of carlisle for an attraction as part of carlisle matters show and tell event which be attend by more than member of the public next the lanes shopping centre in the city centre ask the yarn bomber whether they would crochet large scale poppy display to celebrate remembrance sunday the result publicity include that generate by our brilliant community radio station crfm prompt an outpouring of support leave carlisle matters with far more poppy than the shopping centre could possibly display and so it be that the step of the old town hall and the ancient market cross come to be yarn bomb the yarn bomber be currently work their finger to the bone create yarn bunting and flower in bright colour to decorate the pedestrianise area of our city centre when it reopen after multi million pound transformation in few month time however yarn bombing be about more than beautiful crochet creation it be genuinely inclusive community activity one elderly lady tell carlisle matters that her husband have recently pass away but that yarn bombing have give she purpose again even who can not successfully sew on button have dabble and may say have successfully produce pom pom next time you pass tree wrap in brightly coloured yarn or lamp post drape in knit flower madam deputy speaker take moment to appreciate the creativity the effort and the message behind it finally on the subject of meaning and message will take moment to celebrate and thank our church leader during this busy period of lent and as they approach the celebration and hope of easter give special thank to the bishop of penrith robert saner haigh who for more than month now have also be act diocesan bishop of the diocese of carlisle and for whom easter will therefore be doubly busy conclude by convey my good wish to you madam deputy speaker and to mr speaker the other deputy speakers and all parliamentary staff for joyful easter will focus my remark on wylfa and this government approach towards nuclear energy ynys môn have long history associate with clean nuclear power with two magnox reactor construct at wylfa in the and come online in by both reactor have reach the end of their operate life and be shut down despite promise of new nuclear project at wylfa community on ynys môn have be leave wait and wait with rwe and pull out of develop new project at wylfa in follow by hitachi in the prime minister have recently say that the world have change and that it not the job of government to sit back and hope for the good or simply manage the moment in that spirit ask the government to look seriously at develop the site at wylfa it would provide reliable clean source of power that could last for up to year strengthen our energy security at time when the world be become more uncertain it be estimate that large reactor project would create job during construction in north wales and long term job during operation this be in an area of wales with some of the low wage if the government be serious about generate growth they must surely see that develop site at wylfa be no brainer the government have change their approach to the planning system for nuclear project while recognise the government aim of change the planning system to make it easy for more site to host nuclear power that should not come at the expense of progress with development at wylfa the removal of the preferred site include wylfa in the government nuclear planning policy will likely lead to confusion for developer about where they should prioritise their investment urge the government to reinstate wylfa as preferred site in the national policy statement for nuclear energy generation we also have little clarity from the government about the role of great british energy in support nuclear energy at wylfa have table an amendment to the great british energy bill to ensure that nuclear development would be at the heart of gbe but that be reject by the government as the head of rolls royce have say the uk government run the risk of ensure that critical supply chain to support the development of small nuclear reactor will be build elsewhere if they fail to select the company to build they by the end of june the government say that they will announce plan for the small modular reactor soon but when exactly will that be the people of ynys môn have have their future put on hold for too long by successive westminster governments this government need to make decision on wylfa and to do so quickly it be pleasure to speak in this easter adjournment debate and wish everyone happy easter and restful break rise to speak about the british coal staff superannuation scheme and the need for the scheme investment reserve to be return to its investor as soon as possible in cannock chase we be rightly proud of our rich mining heritage that legacy have shape our community with generation of hard work man and woman who dedicate their life to the industry that define our area for seven century follow privatisation many british coal employee be part of either the mineworker pension scheme or the british coal staff superannuation scheme commend the government for deliver the long overdue justice for mps member in the first labour budget for year transfer the billion investment reserve have speak to some of the mps member in my constituency since the government keep their manifesto promise and they be very grateful for the boost to their pension however that have lead to member of the bcsss call for similar action to be take on their pension scheme there be member and dependent of the bcsss in my constituency who like their mps counterpart do not receive substantial pension also like the mps the bcsss have return billion to the treasury more than enough to guarantee the scheme for its life surplus sharing be end after an agreement between the trustee and the government of the day and since then all surplus be due to go to the treasury however the fundamental be the same with substantial investment reserve which could boost member pension and dependent income very sadly this be an urgent matter last year more than member of the bcsss pass away so it be not hard to see why so many member fear that they will not be able to see this money in their lifetime these pensioner dedicate their working life to power our country and it be vital that they receive the thank that such demanding and important role require this be particular passion of those of we represent coalfield constituent where the vast majority of the bcsss member live wish to pay tribute to many hon member for their steadfast campaigning on this matter we know that just as it have for the mps return of the bcsss investment reserve would provide welcome boost for business in our community which have be hammer hard than most in recent year hope that in the very near future we can secure an agreement with the bcsss trustee who also deserve credit for their work on this and for foster transparent and positive relationship with the member that they serve transfer the final billion payment from the reserve will ensure fair pension for everyone who contribute to the coal industry whether that be underground in the office or in the canteen it be also worth flag the gender inequality angle because unlike the mps large proportion of bcsss member be woman as it be the default pension scheme for clerical and catering staff who do not always get the recognition that they deserve for the huge contribution they make to such critical industry reflect the shameful reality face by woman for decade many be pay significantly less than their male colleague and now they be campaign hard for some restitution for that historic injustice with the return of their scheme investment reserve fully understand that the issue be not as simple as duplicate what have be do for the mps give that the scheme be set up differently and pay tribute to the work of the minister of state for industry who have confirm that bcsss proposal will be consider have raise this matter today hope that an agreement can be reach in timely manner give that we be lose an average of six bcsss member every day the soon we can get this do the more member of our community can see and feel justice it be pleasure to speak in this easter adjournment debate would like to highlight an issue that continue to fill my inbox and be sure the inboxe of colleague across the house dentistry hear from resident on an almost daily basis about the challenge they face in access nhs dentistry hear story of people who have be on waiting list for year but still have not see an nhs dentist and people who be in pain but be unable to access treatment hear about pensioner be quote thousand of pound for few filling and pensioner question why nhs dental treatment be not available to they despite their have pay national insurance contribution for most of their life hear of child who need brace that their parent can not afford and child with special educational need who need support with oral hygiene unfortunately there be very little reassurance that can give nine month after the general election we be still wait for meaningful progress to be make on this issue despite labour manifesto promise to tackle the immediate crisis statistic from last month show that of people in the south west who try to make an nhs dental appointment in the last day be unsuccessful in devon there be simply not enough nhs dentist no practice in my constituency be take on new nhs patient one practice be take over by new owner last june and still only have one dentist despite inherit the patient list of three dentist the government promise to roll out extra urgent dental appointment be welcome but it be not simple solution nhs devon be be ask to provide more urgent care appointment than last year while we agree that those appointment be much need it will be huge challenge for the integrate care board to deliver nhs devon have already increase the minimum unit of dental activity rate beyond the nationally mandate uplift figure and invest into the golden hello scheme to attract dentist to the area however it tell that clear feedback from provider show that the current remuneration be not sufficient to sustain baseline activity let alone incentivise additional activity there be concern over the impact on routine dental activity and preventive care because of the high rate be pay for urgent care appointment one local dentist tell that the lack of nhs worker be down to not just money but the environment they work in private dentist can give more dedicated attention to patient have to deal with less red tape and might experience well work life balance however the vast majority of nhs dentist be self employ so even those carry out nhs work be at risk of litigation if the risk be the same but the reward be less why would dentist choose to carry out nhs work rather than private work we need to look at how we can change the system to make nhs work more attractive have write to the minister for care ask what consideration have be give to allow icb to use discretion when provide funding to project that fall outside of contractual regulation but be yet to receive response have also ask what plan be in place to allow icb to modify underperform contract as understand that the current system do not allow they to make change with an underspend of around million in devon flexibility to change contract be key be yet to receive response on that either private dental care be unaffordable for many people the cost of living crisis couple with recent welfare cut under this government be only worsen outcome if we do not act now the situation will continue to worsen and the implication will be even more widespread oral health be crucial and oral health for child be even more important we can not wait any long for this situation to be resolve thank you madam deputy speaker hope that in future when it get to easter recess you will be able to fly away with to doncaster sheffield airport once it be reopen for now let shine light on some of the amazing work be do within my community start with sport be really lucky to have some amazing football club that inspire young child in my local area we have rossington football club epworth colts bawtry junior dunscroft warriors hayfield football club club thorne colliery and finningley harriers junior club they all provide opportunity for child to develop their skill and build lifelong friendship it be not just football club that we have in thorne we have the thornensians rugby union football club which have long be pillar for the local sporting community it be found in but the club do not play its first game until due to the war reg clayton its found member be there for the very first match at year old he be still supporter today it be club build on heritage and heart and every sunday it proudly host over boy and girl play rugby nurture the next generation and keep the community spirit alive be sure that reg be very proud on the isle of axholme we be home to cricket league that date back to when west butterwick take home the trophy that heritage still live on in the club that take to the field every summer week in week out support by the volunteer to whom pay homage across our community we be fortunate to have remarkable individual and organisation work tirelessly to support those in need local hero vera owen she be also our midwife as tell my young child be one of they week in week out she collect surplus food from supermarket for the food bank and lead on fundraise effort all without ask for recognition today we be give she that recognition similarly mary macmillan at doncaster food bank run campaign to provide basic facility such as shower affordable laundry service and cooking amenity not just for those face homelessness that be really important to because as you be aware madam deputy speaker be homeless for period as child but for family in temporary accommodation and the wider vulnerable community will take moment to recognise the tireless work of our local councillor in thorne and moorends mark houlbrook susan durant and joe blackham have deliver real result for the community they fight to keep thorne south station open after the pandemic and they offer lot of wonderful local service for our resident they have also be do work on the thorne leisure centre in rossington bawtry and austerfield ken guest bob anderson and rachael blake have show what commit community focus representation look like over the last four year they have secure vital road safety measure include zebra crossing at bawtry and pelican crossing at rossington and have make sure that it be affordable for everybody to swim with swim scheme finally our hatfield councillor glynis smith and linda curran have work with real dedication to support our local people and strengthen community life they have back range of grassroots initiative and be make real difference include through their support for the hatfield library which have be run by brilliant volunteer like sue lowndes for over decade child event be hold there every school holiday free of charge they have also help to fund dunscroft together which run youth club safe and welcome place for young people they have also host celebration for dunsville community centre anniversary lot go on there include the mark guest taekwondo school overall want to thank those incredible community champion for everything they do day in day out their dedication compassion and tireless effort remind we just how special our constituency be and how strong we be when we come together to support one another have very happy easter it be pleasure to speak in debate that pay tribute to the memory of sir david amess like my hon friend the member for south devon caroline voaden want to raise an issue that be absolutely fill my email inbox the collapse of nhs dentistry in taunton and wellington and across somerset indeed across the whole country in when first do survey on access to nhs dentist in taunton and wellington over half the respondent report that they be unable to access an nhs dentist since then thing have get bad and bad in the month since the general election last year have receive hundred of email about the issue it feel like tidal wave of distress people be struggle with pain face unaffordable bill for private treatment or simply give up on dental care altogether the government announcement of extra dental appointment be of course welcome but as the british dental association have point out that amount to no more than about two extra appointment per nhs dentist per month and that be only when there be an nhs dentist in dental desert like somerset and my constituency there be barely any nhs dentist leave so that announcement will not have the effect that we would all like that be particularly so because the government figure be real underestimate of the position in taunton and wellington in february the government say that one in four people be unable to see an nhs dentist but as say the survey that carry out in show that just over one in two in my constituency could not access nhs dentist and be sure that the proportion who can not access an nhs dentist have only increase today launch new survey of constituent school and local dental practice to expose the real cost as result of the collapse in dental service people child and eligible adult be pay for what should be free treatment the survey be launch at about two this afternoon and be grateful for the fact that we be allow mobile in the chamber because be tell at the beginning of the debate that there be response to the survey but during it there have be another the issue have clearly hit nerve and it really affect people in my constituency one constituent tell that he have to spend more than to get treatment for his child dental need treatment for all child should be free on the nhs but they be not get it the entitlement mean nothing if there be no nhs dentist to go to too many in our area face the choice of pay up or live in pain bill often run into hundred of pound which people can ill afford give the effect of recent month on the cost of living this be not just about tooth it be about people dignity their health and the way they feel about their life and themselves urge the government not to underestimate the scale of the problem particularly in area such as somerset we need urgent reform and urgent action the broken dental contract really need to be renegotiate and we need proper incentive to bring dentist back into the nhs hope the government will look closely at the evidence that my constituent be send in and will work with and other to make the situation well with that as we look forward to eat lot of chocolate and be in need of great many more dental appointment wish all my colleague across the house and the staff security and police officer who look after we so well very happy easter with easter approach thought often turn to egg my favourite be cadbury creme eggs or possibly smarties one but the egg that want to talk about this afternoon be those that chicken produce and which be sell in our supermarket although the majority of whole egg sell in uk supermarket be now from cage free environment shockingly one in five hen still spend its life cramp in cage when battery cage be ban in many place so call enriched cage be introduce to replace they have to say however that the word enrich be bit of misnomer yes they be slightly well than the traditional battery cage for example they have to have perch but think enriched make it sound bit like they be on yoga retreat or something the marketing people absolutely earn their wage that day the reality be absolutely nothing of the sort confinement cage might be well description they be small than piece of paper and have minimal room for bird to spread their wing they restrict natural behaviour hen can not properly dust bathe or forage and be all subject to frustration and stress welcome the million fund from the department for environment food and rural affairs to transition to high welfare standard for hen however also worry about low welfare import that undercut our uk farmer especially of powdered and liquid egg which be often find in product such as quiche or hot cross bun at this time of year and which often come from country with low animal welfare standard turn back to shell egg if hon member buy dozen egg and plan to tuck into soft boil egg this easter urge they to check where the egg come from they all have code print on their shell and the first character will tell they where they be from if the character be three it mean that the bird be cage anyone can choose to vote with their foot support our hen hero and make an eggs traordinary difference stick briefly with the easter theme as the easter getaway approach want to give shout out to the uk coach sector which be often the unsung hero of holiday travel every year million people travel by coach to visit attraction attend event and explore our region coach passenger spend billion annually in local economy support hotel restaurant and tourism attraction give the climate emergency it be important to note that single coach can remove up to car from the road cut congestion and emission hope that ministers in the department for transport will consider some of the thing that the coach industry be ask for such as be able to use bus lane by default more robust datum from transport authority on the coach sector more drop off pick up and parking facility and allow the coach sector funding similar to the zero emission bus regional area funding we have have for the bus sector it be after all crack industry would like to say in my remain second that think this will be particularly good easter because the clock have already change so we have plenty of daylight to celebrate it in end by wish you madam deputy speaker and all hon member very happy easter it be great to speak in this easter debate and would like to use this opportunity to thank handful of fantastic organisation from across the

reform be spearhead by the government labour plan to simplify structure cut duplication reduce waste and slash cost while give local leader the tool they need to deliver growth for their area raise living standard in every part of the country in way that be directly accountable to resident be welcome and long overdue to understand why devolution and reorganisation be desperately need we need look no far than conservative lead derbyshire county council almost every step of the way that council have fail to deliver for my resident in high peak derbyshire conservative have all but take the council to bankruptcy on their watch derbyshire have the ignominy of have be dub the pothole capital of the uk by the rac child with special educational need and disability and their family have be shamefully let down derbyshire county council damn ofsted report find widespread and systemic failing old people in our community have be leave distraught by plan to close our care home and day care centre indeed queens court day centre in buxton be close last week with no notice with such record it be no wonder that in the immediate aftermath of the government announcement for local government reform the derbyshire conservatives try to cancel the local election and put in proposal for council cover the whole of derbyshire and its resident be glad that the proposal be reject by the government and that the council plan to cancel the local election in may be refuse derbyshire conservative can run from the voter but they can not hide say that high peak be unique because it sit in the middle of three region with huge economic potential but rather than be an asset to our area that position mean that we have all too often be overlook the call from the government to reorganise should have be meet with creative thinking through the lens of what be good for our area have listen to student in glossop who go to college in greater manchester and their family to commuter in new mills who want well transport link to old people in buxton whose derbyshire identity be what matter most to they and to the people in hope valley who look to sheffield for job and healthcare be back labour lead high peak borough council plan for north derbyshire unitary authority and the plan of east midlands mayor claire ward for peak partnership that bring together the combined authority of greater manchester south yorkshire and the east midlands which be in the interest of high peak hope that as both proposal be develop over the come month they will help we to address the unique varied and economic public service need of all our community include the hope valley line snake pass the extension of the bee network and well and fair access to greater manchester and south yorkshire hospital and further education in the proposal for north derbyshire unitary authority and for the peak partnership of three labour mayor we have the building block to make life well for the resident of high peak with more integrated transport job and investment and improve access to healthcare and education the crux of that reorganisation speak to the heart of the government mission to drive economic growth and deliver opportunity for all as regular participant in these end of term debate usually speak about three or four different subject but today want to return to an issue that have raise on number of occasion in the house over the last few week the future of the steelwork at scunthorpe the scunthorpe site be the equivalent of wembley football pitch it extend well beyond the bound of scunthorpe into my constituency and employ hundred of my constituent and many more beyond have spend all my life live in the grimsby and cleethorpes area sadly cleethorpes be no long part of my constituency but have gain ward in grimsby as result of last year reorganisation be old enough to have witness the decline of grimsby follow the loss of its core industry deep sea fishing member across the house will have have similar experience with town that have lose their core industry be it shipbuilde or mining and it be massive change it affect the heritage the culture and the health of the local community the increase burden of chronic illness low life expectancy reduce productivity increase healthcare cost and low community cohesion be some of the issue that arise when town lose its core industry appeal yet again to the government to show sense of urgency there be strong likelihood that the furnace will shut down in few week time because the owner jingye have cancel the order for raw material if that happen and the furnace go cold just reinstate those furnace will cost million we do not want to get into that situation know the government do not want scunthorpe to lose the steelwork on their watch it be vital for the nation security apart from anything else unless action be take in the very near future be afraid direct job loss could occur and there would be thousand more in the supply chain yet again my hon friend be demonstrate what powerful champion he be for his constituency do he share my concern that this be about more than just job because if we lose the ability to produce our own steel that be national security concern absolutely have speak with number of people involve in the military and they be very concerned about the future do we as still significant manufacturing nation want to lose the capacity to produce our own steel and become the only country in that position north lincolnshire council ably lead by councillor rob waltham who have be in china to meet the current owner of scunthorpe steelwork have put together contingency plan include the creation of an ai growth zone and green growth zone those project if allow to continue could result in new construction job and new job on site and safeguard in the supply chain moreover the ai growth zone could lead to billion in private business investment those be all vital to northern lincolnshire irrespective of what may happen to the steelwork the humber region more widely be very significant for whole host of energy project involve hydrogen sustainable aviation fuel carbon capture and the like it be vital for the government to recognise that they must support these new project irrespective of whether there be job loss in the steel sector close by urge the government to show real sense of urgency on this as say in my urgent question yesterday the government have to nationalise the industry to give it breathe space to attract new private sector investment and to keep the job of those thousand of people happy easter to you madam deputy speaker and to all the staff and member few week ago my barber ev send dm it be video from three lad in ilkeston in my constituency and it be go viral owen harrison and roy be talk about how life be for they as teenage boy in they talk about not have anything to do about the youth club have shut down

own time grow up and of my own boy throughout my time in school and indeed well into my take no interest in politic because feel it be not something have stake in what do care about though be the group of friend grow up with first properly meet my boy at party when be at joe house in north cardiff be sit awkwardly in corner too uncool to talk to anyone beyond the one or two people come along with and generally afraid of the significantly more socially adept group of teenager around as get to know they though and as become one of they feel that have finally find tribe young man with share interest in heavy music in skate and in make fun of each other as often and as brutally as possible as we grow we do all the thing that young man do we one up each other we drink we argue we be immortal one day everything change on wednesday october andrew send message to our group chat it start boy think it time you should know tom be involve in very bad accident at work yesterday he get trap under camper van he not do so well he in intensive care currently after have surgery last night tom tomas shackson work with his dad in their autobody business and he have terrible accident indeed later that week tom die of his injury in many way tom death cause we all to reassess everything we find ourselves face our own mortality and the unexpected irreplaceable loss of someone who we have call brother for most of our life up until that point the way we interact with each other change our interpersonal relationship deepen and we suddenly have to be there for each other in way that we have even consider before we start talk about our own happiness and feel that we collectively open up about our own struggle and thing that our prior macho bravado have stop we from share previously to this day have note pin to my kitchen wall from dan which he send in the post after tom accident it say here if you need anything brother none of the boy have ever even send any post before but every time see it it remind that dan and all my boy be indeed here for anytime need they in the year since tom death our once bravado fuel group have evolve we learn to talk about our issue

and family that we know tom would be very proud of give special shout out to joe today who this past weekend after year of graft become consultant hand surgeon we be incredibly proud of he all of that be why think it be so important for those of we who have be on such journey to share our story with boy like owen harrison and roy who be grow up today with the rise of increasingly toxic online culture and with so much social medium encourage boy to take increasingly hateful stance spread vile misogyny and the lie that woman and girl be somehow beneath they it be incumbent on we all to share the positive that can be gain by open up and be there for each other as boy and as man and let each other know that we be here for one another whenever we need it wish briefly to cover three thing in this debate first the world as we know it have change drastically in the nine month since the general election to our constituent those threat can sometimes feel abstract and distant but we know that it be our constituent who will feel the pain in their pocket and it be probably those who have the least who will be rock most by the destruction and chaos we see all around we some of those threat have mean that difficult decision have have to be take include the reduction in overseas aid to fund necessary increase in defence spending over this parliament and the next remain of the opinion that even those increase might not be enough to counter the new security threat that we face if this period be to be remember by history as one of instability and global shift let it also be remember as time when we endeavour to build new foundation that help future generation to succeed and build well world our response to those threat must be to invest in our young people and their aspiration opportunity and skill not only will necessary increase in defence spending support thousand of job but as necessity be the mother of invention the new condition create an unmissable opportunity for investment in innovative engineering and high tech skill that can be apply in other sector in my constituency those opportunity be widespread whether at the port of rosyth which be increasingly become hub for renewable or at the hop for redevelopment of the longannet generating station my second point follow from consideration of that future the imperative to invest in skill we must invest in skill for the long term by work well with further education establishment such as fife college in my constituency and build well link with business sadly in scotland that link with business be lacking and stall skill agenda be fail our talented and ambitious young people business of all size in my constituency have tell that they be increasingly use or consider use city guilds or similar training module in england and not even bother to have discussion with the scottish qualifications authority such be the long laborious and bureaucratic process the scottish national party abject failure on skill will have long term implication for young people across the country if we be to make the future truly one for the next generation we must support those young people to build that future that firstly mean stop demonise young people who have struggle with more once in lifetime crisis by this stage of their life than any other generation from credit crunch and pandemic to political instability and uncertainty at home and around the world they have see service and support for they eradicate chance to get on the housing ladder vanish and secure long term employment become pipe dream and all while wealth sit with the generation of their parent and grandparent this parliament must not continue the trend of give only to the old generation without engage and energise young people there will be no money leave by the time people of my age hope to retire young people be not ask for mango sorbet and malbec but for respect and understanding and that be what we should be give they antisocial behaviour and crime be not the preserve of the young alcohol and drug misuse be rise in people of old generation not among young people and tolerance of other be much high among young people than among people my age and old as everyone in this house will attest from our encounter on social medium and our dealing with some constituent as we enter the recess we should remember that we be still very much in the early stage of this parliament and yet we have already see unprecedented turmoil and change that be shape our future while much of that might be outside the control of the government it be vital that our response be to enshrine in place the right foundation build with confidence and commitment for the future of young people and our country because the two be indivisible if we do not leave this place in well condition for those who follow we then all that we strive for be after all for naught associate myself with the warm word about sir david amess it be privilege to speak in my first easter recess debate although this be not my first time in this place in fact it be my want to say huge thank you for the warm and welcome reception that have receive across my constituency as mps visibility be vital if we be truly to represent the people who put we here as well as those who do not we need to understand the issue that our constituent face and the challenge

july my team and have help over people in portsmouth as we approach easter one press issue that my constituent be about to face be crunch in their household budget with huge rise of nearly in southern water bill which be project to rise on average by around by that huge hike will hit everyone but it will hit low income household the hard and many distressed constituent have contact southern water offer social tariff the essential tariff that give reduction to eligible customer but if bill be to rise by that reduction be effectively wipe out clean safe water be not luxury yet southern water be ask people to pay more while provide less reliable service it be not just household that be affect but business for example south coast wakepark in hilsea which be great local business have lose consecutive trading day through poor water quality in addition to the continued dumping of sewage into our sea and the repeat flooding that be affect our business we can not accept system in which customer be foot the bill for decade of under investment while water company executive pocket million in bonus call for an urgent expansion and deepening of social tariff we need clear and proactive help for those who be struggle to pay easily accessible compensation scheme for business and full transparency on how the increase in bill be be spend we need concrete plan to tackle sewage dumping fix leak infrastructure and reverse year of environmental neglect southern water have one of the bad record on pollution in this country my constituent be rightly ask why we should pay for more when we be get so much less the people of portsmouth deserve so much more as have say every day get to see amazing thing and to meet amazing people charity business and individual across my city and get to bring their story concern challenge and celebration here to help to find solution and improve our city it remain extremely humbling and huge privilege as one of the final speaker today wish all those

adjournment debate always find that these end of term debate really enlighten about fellow member of the house their constituency and the issue that be important to their constituent before talk about something close to my own constituency and heart associate myself with the contribution of the hon member for reigate rebecca paul and the thank that she give to surrey police my own borough team in guildford have be fantastic just as hers have be in support our town centre by deal with antisocial behaviour note the absolutely crack contribution and egg cellent easter pun from the hon member for dunstable and leighton buzzard alex mayer will stop there with the easter pun and move on to my constituency will use my time to highlight an issue in my constituency that have both national and local significance hope that action on the issue will not just resolve it in guildford but help to drive long term change in the way we support charity and business during multi year infrastructure project many member will be aware of the extensive redevelopment work take place at junction of the near the royal horticultural society garden at wisley the redevelopment work start in november and be due to finish in summer but sadly it have be confirm recently that that will not be the case they will finish in approximately spring that be four year of disruption for local resident and business ultimately the project should improve the junction but it be very big have be serious consequence for rhs wisley and our much love local café ockham bites alongside frustration and disruption for local resident in village around the junction and everyone who have have to travel through it while the two place be very different in scale both have see significant loss ockham bites be lose day and rhs wisley predict that by the end of the project it will have lose million these financial loss be highlight in the early day of the project but dismiss on the basis that current legislation compensate only on the value of property not for loss of business for rhs wisley the loss have have far reach consequence plan for new arboretum have be delay fund for scientific research have be reduce and community outreach programme have be scale back the impact go beyond my constituency and the garden itself through to the community around guildford and other rhs site across the country they be be force to consider cut to training opportunity with project reduction in workplace student horticulturalist position over the next two year be sure that member of the house will be very sad to hear all those thing about rhs wisley know that resident in my constituency as well as people across the country feel strongly about this issue petition that be currently live have signature and that number keep increase pause to thank my colleague baroness benjamin who have be highlight this matter in the other place for the answer she have gain from member of the house of lords on the issue surround the problem at rhs wisley will the hon member for wellingborough and rushden gen kitchen encourage the transport secretary to respond to my request to meet and representative of rhs wisley return to ockham bites and its fantastic cake and tea it have suffer big financial loss for small business there have also be problem with water and all those thing combine have force the owner to make serious personal and professional adjustment include relocate their home and deal with heighten stress level these two business story be of very different scale but they highlight serious flaw in current legislation we should not be leave small business charity and other organisation struggle financially and potentially fail due to multi year infrastructure project not only be those organisation the lifeblood of our community they be fundamental to our economic success hope that ministers will agree to meet and work to find way to support those business and commit to review the legislation to ensure that their story be not repeat and that future multi year infrastructure project be deliver without leave key part of our local economy and community behind want to close on positive note in this afternoon fantastic debate by give cheeky little encouragement to everyone in the chamber if they have not yet experience rhs wisley or their local rhs garden to please go and

topic that know be of concern to member from across this house even on the last day of term the subject still give pause to so many hospice provide beacon of hope to so many people in their dark time it provide the comfort and knowledge need at very difficult time and without hospice support many would be lose that be why across the country we see volunteer give up their time and their finance to support local hospice because primarily many of they be charity although they receive some funding from the nhs member from across this house from every party believe that hospice matter first commend the hon lady for bring this debate forward she be absolutely right to highlight the work of hospice but also all those group that raise money for hospice so that they can do their work for instance the elim church which have cancer group that hold dinner or breakfast every month recently give from coffee morning as well as its monthly offering again we see charitable organisation particularly when they be support by church make the difference in this nation do she agree that while they be admirable we can not expect coffee morning and fun run to raise the funding that the government have an obligation to provide rather than seek to end life the government must seek to ensure that people last day in palliative care be dignified and pain free that will only come with fully funded end of life palliative care thank the hon member for that intervention and pay tribute to all the volunteer who organise the fun run and to volunteer in my constituency such as sharon williams who do the thames hospice walk in denham village every year these be the people who support our local hospice and we should all pay tribute to they hospice matter because each year they support people and family member hospice matter because they be vital holistic care service for people and their loved one at the end of life hospice matter because they provide crucial end of life and overall healthcare relieve the pressure on the nhs they provide both community specialist and acute care however suspect that the minister and the government already know this and be sure that they agree that hospice matter so let turn to why this debate matter the hospice sector be under enormous pressure and it face an unprecedented challenge the sector be catch in the triple squeeze of increase demand increase cost and uncertain funding only the government have the power to change that squeeze only the government can eliminate the increase cost or create more certain funding in this house recent month have be consume by debate about assist dying while the real scandal of the lack of support for end of life care through hospice go below the radar it be estimate that the demand for palliative care in the uk will increase by in the next year but as hospice face this increase demand the government have decide to saddle they with increase cost and have fail to provide long term settlement let speak about the excellent thames hospice that support many family in my constituency and the constituency of my neighbour would not be here today be it not for baroness may of maidenhead as long term champion of thames hospice she ask to have word with the hospice as it be so concerned about its funding which do and that lead to this debate again member of parliament from both houses continue to champion this important cause recently meet dr rachel de caux the chief executive officer of thames hospice like many other hospice thames hospice represent the very good of our community people who believe in provide quality of life at end of life for everyone passionate people who care like the thames hospice denham support group and the volunteer who make donation and support those who go into the hospice through their excellent work they enable of the people they support to receive dignified end of life care at home and the rest to get specialise in patient service visit the service recently and when visit the call centre be move to see volunteer and staff work around the clock to help those who have just receive terminal diagnosis or family who could not cope they be go to people home and work all hour of the day and night to ensure that people have the pain support and palliative care that they need at home or in the centre thames hospice like many hospice face critical moment less than one third of its income come from the nhs like many hospice it raise the rest through its charity shop fundraise effort and the generosity of private donor the chancellor budget be like hammer blow to its finance and it face deficit of up to million largely as result of the government choice the national insurance tax raid from which this government recently vote not to spare hospice will add to its cost for the next financial year while change to the national minimum wage will add another both through the direct impact and the need to maintain pay differential meet the nhs pay settlement which the hospice need to do to keep clinical staff but which again it need to do without government support will add furth finally thames hospice supplier face the same cost pressure and be pass those on to the hospice through high price know the minister will talk about the million settlement of additional funding for hospice that be announce in december but let we set out the detail of that money it be for capital expenditure and be welcome be sure by hospice but it be not money for meet operational cost pressure it be also split across hospice so it become drop in the ocean for individual hospice and their need will the hon lady join in commend compton care hospice in my constituency the hospice which visit recently do great work raise fund and it really welcome the million support provide by this government however the hospice emphasise to that if it be not there to provide social care therapy and respite care for patient and their family the nhs would need an extra bed hospice provide invaluable service to our community which make it so important for we to continue to support they as much as we can the hon gentleman make an excellent point about the pressure that hospice take off the nhs the wonderful work of the hospice the hon gentleman mention be the reason the nhs can function in the way it do the cost saving on palliative care both in hospital and out of hospital care setting be invaluable the hospice in our constituency be model that already work and they be trust by the community think we should be fund that model instead of allow hospice to die on the vine because of lack of funding and change to the funding model thank the hon gentleman for that point congratulate my hon friend on secure this debate we should not just complain about this terrible new tax that be be apply to hospice but point out to the minister that the return on taxpayer investment in what hospice spend on the dying be very great indeed if little bit of the big increase in funding that the nhs receive be transfer to hospice it would pay great dividend it would save the need for much more costly care in the hospital the return be accord to st helena hospice just outside my constituency on whose behalf be speak this evening hope the minister will address that point when he wind up my hon friend make an excellent point that cost benefit would be replicate across the country in every hospice setting small amount of money give to hospice through the nhs funding model would be invaluable we talk about palliative care and assist dying but why be we not have debate about increase hospice funding and make that service part of the nhs if hospice setting be part of the nhs they would be exempt from the rise in national insurance contribution that increase be devastating hospice right now many rely on volunteer or low pay worker in charity shop the money raise help pay for the running of hospice although that be wonderful model hospice be not exempt from the nics increase as other nhs body be even change the status of hospice to make they part of the nhs would go very long way to make their financial model viable the hon member be make powerful speech have steer the palliative care commission for the past six month and the one thing that have become crystal clear in our mind be that the fundamental funding model be completely break it be not fit for purpose furthermore we need more integration in the system hospice be involve in part of people care they do not provide the entirety of their care do she believe that the finding of the commission need to steer the future funding of the hospice sector that be an excellent point we should be lead by the evidence and also by what the commission find wish to highlight the hon lady long term work champion out of hospital care provision not just palliative care but all adult social care can recall many debate on this matter in which there be just one or two of we in the chamber and she be always one of they she be long term champion of the vulnerable of palliative care and of those who desperately need well service may thank she for all that work madam deputy speaker it be not often that you will see reach across the house but let we give credit where credit be due there be member from all part of the house who have champion these cause over and over again and it be only right and fair that recognise they today there be very real prospect of the hospice sector collapse under the weight of the national insurance change and that would be unimaginable these be institution that be trust in our community and that we need to protect they need additional funding from the nhs the government must act urge they to please reconsider the national insurance change exempting hospice from the nics increase or help to fund their operating cost would make material difference to their ability to survive our hospice matter and hope the minister will hear that message loud and clear and show we that the government understand how vital they be thank the hon member for beaconsfield joy morrissey for secure this important debate wish to take this opportunity to thank all those who work or volunteer in the hospice and palliative care sector for the care and support that they provide to patient family and love one when they need it most this government want society in which every person receive high quality compassionate care from diagnosis through to end of life we be determined to shift more care out of hospital and into the community to ensure that patient and their family receive personalise care in the most appropriate setting palliative and end of life care service include hospice will have vital role to play in that shift in england integrate care board be responsible for the commissioning of palliative and end of life care service to meet the need of their local population to support icb in this duty nhs england have publish statutory guidance and service specification although the majority of palliative and end of life care be provide by nhs staff and service we recognise the vital part that voluntary sector organisation include hospice play in provide support to people at the end of life as well as to their love one most hospice be charitable independent organisation that receive some statutory funding for provide nhs service the amount of funding that each charitable hospice receive varie both within and between icb area this variation be dependent on demand in that area and on the totality and type of palliative and end of life care provision from both nhs and non nhs service include charitable hospice within each icb footprint this government understand the financial pressure that hospice have be face which be why we have announce the big investment to hospice in england in generation we be ensure that hospice in england can continue to deliver the high quality end of life care possible for patient and for their family and love one we be support the hospice sector with million capital funding boost for adult and child hospice to ensure that they have the good possible physical environment for the care they

and young people hospice grant icb will once again administer the funding to their respective child and young people hospice on behalf of nhs england this be in line with nhs devolution policy and it promote more consistent national approach by support commissioner in prioritise the palliative and end of life care need of their local population be pleased to confirm that nhs england have now communicate the detail of the funding allocation and dissemination to individual hospice do accept that there be unwarranted variation and inequality in access to and quality of palliative and end of life care in england but we be work to reduce these variation nhs england have publish statutory guidance and service specification to support commissioner in prioritise palliative and end of life care it have also develop palliative and end of life care dashboard which bring together all relevant local datum in one place the dashboard help commissioner to understand the palliative and end of life care need of their local population enable icb to put plan in place to address and track the improvement of health inequality and to ensure that funding be distribute fairly base on prevalence nhs england have also publish the ambition framework which set out our vision to improve end of life care through partnership and collaborative action between organisation at local level throughout england additionally nhs england have develop an assurance system with specific step and deadline to ensure the timely dissemination of the million revenue funding to child and young people hospice because we know that there be some quite significant problem last year with the transmission from nhs england through the icb to hospice these step include regular oversight session with icb region and hospice and give icb hard deadline within the first quarter of the financial year by which they be expect to disseminate the funding to hospice include escalate to nhs england if any icb be unable to meet the deadline if the deadline be miss nhs england have put step in place to ensure that all hospice receive the funding within the timescale outline we alongside key partner and nhs england will continue to engage proactively with our stakeholder include the voluntary sector and independent hospice on an ongoing basis to understand the issue they face in fact recently visit katharine house hospice in stafford and hear from staff how important our record investment have be to they more widely in february meet key palliative and end of life care and hospice stakeholder in roundtable format to discuss long term sector sustainability in the context of our year health plan recognise the concern that hon member have raise about funding and employer national insurance contribution in july last year we inherit public finance in their bad state since the second world war and we take the necessary decision to fix the foundation in the public finance at the autumn budget enable the spending review settlement of billion increase or uplift in resource spending for the department of health and social care from out turn to gently point out to the conservative party that while believe it have welcome that unprecedented settlement to my knowledge it have be silent on its preferred mean of generate that revenue gently say that opposition members can not have it both way they can not welcome the billion on the one hand but on the other hand condemn the way in which the money be to be raise without come up with their own plan and proposal for how they would raise those fund we have to recognise that the hospice sector be in quite difficult place financially however if there be good advance care planning money currently spend in secondary care could be invest in the hospice sector and in more community provision surely that must be first step that would not only get well clinical outcome but be well for the whole of the palliative care pathway my hon friend speak with tremendous and deep knowledge of the sector welcome the work that she be do on the commission on palliative and end of life care and we very much look forward to see the outcome and result of that my hon friend be right that if we be to make the three big shift at the heart of our year plan the shift from hospital to community from sickness to prevention and from analogue to digital the delivery of that will require left shift in term of both funding and reform it be absolutely right that we take hard headed look at funding across our nhs and ensure that funding be go to where it be need she will know that the share that hospital get of overall nhs funding have go up dramatically since the early to the detriment of primary care community care and palliative care all the thing that happen outside hospital that be something that we must address and shift upstream because we will never solve the considerable challenge that our nhs be face until we make that left shift note that the funding announcement be warmly welcome by the sector toby porter chief executive of hospice uk say today announcement will be hugely welcome by hospice and those who rely on their service hospice not only provide vital care for patient and family but also relieve pressure on the nhs this funding will allow hospice to continue to reach hundred of thousand of people every year with high quality compassionate care we look forward to work with the government to make sure everyone approach the end of life get the care and support they need when and where they need it hope that the measure have outline in my response to the hon lady will go some way to reassure all member of this government unwavere commitment to the sustainability of the hospice and wide palliative and end of life care sector thank the minister for outline what the government be do will he consider look at the exemption to the national insurance increase for worker and at allocate more funding directly to hospice so that they can conduct the palliative care that be need in the out of hospital care provision although the government may want to give it to palliative care there be no directive that do so at this time aside from capital expenditure therefore could more money be allocate to hospice for operational cost the definition of where employer national insurance will be levy be base on the office for national statistics definition of where it should be and it be the same definition use by previous government do not think that point be up for debate to clarify the nhs and the staff within it be exempt from the change how be that part of the national statistical average when everyone in healthcare who be under the nhs umbrella be exempt from the change all be ask be for hospice care which be out of hospital care provision and which technically fall within adult social care to be incorporate into the exemption already give to the nhs the exemption be give to full time worker within the nhs in essence hospital as regard gps dentist and care provider enic be be levy on those other part of the health and care sector every aspect of my portfolio be therefore see enic be levy suggestion to the minister would be to integrate the staff work in hospice into the nhs payroll it would be that simple to exempt they from those national insurance increase the decision on enic and where they be be levy have be make think it be make very clear that the line be draw where it be draw any attempt to try to reverse engineer where that line should be draw would not really be align with the policy decision that be make at the budget be it the government intention to put an additional tax on hospice be that exactly what the government intend to do or be that an unforeseen consequence would not dare to speak from this dispatch box on behalf of the chancellor but be absolutely clear that when she do the autumn budget she know that she have to dig we out of very deep hole indeed and that require levy taxis that she have to levy the line have to be draw somewhere and that be where the line be draw on the other question ask by the hon member for beaconsfield the funding have go through hospice uk so it be not direct funding in that sense hospice uk have kindly co ordinate the process because it be extremely well informed about which hospice across the country have opportunity to upgrade their infrastructure whether that be it infrastructure refurbishment or whatever it might be it have review those proposal work at tremendous pace and as result we have manage to deliver the entire million of the first tranche we be now work closely with hospice uk on the million and be confident that that money will be out of the door and into hospice in very quick time this year base on the outstanding performance on the first million tranche therefore hope the hon lady will be reassure on that point in closing hope that we at least have consensus on the vital importance of hospice the government be commit to work at pace to ensure that we secure sustainability and solidity for the sector go forward thank the hon member for beaconsfield once again for secure this important debate also thank and wish everybody in this chamber all the very good for the recess and look forward to see they all on the other side question put and agree to house adjourn
