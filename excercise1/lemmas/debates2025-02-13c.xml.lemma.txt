emission vehicle through taxation incentive vehicle grant and funding infrastructure roll out in january ev sale be high than in january the recent national audit office report show that we be on track to meet the public charging point need for expect demand in meur ras ha myttin da mr speaker electric vehicle demand be increase the government commitment to ban the sale of new petrol and diesel vehicle by will have significant impact on uk emission but there remain many misunderstanding and myth about electric vehicle they be safe and clean and whole life cost be significantly cheap what can the government do to increase consumer confidence by dispel some of the nonsense peddle by vested interest my hon friend expertise in the field be welcome showcase the benefit of ev ownership and the growth of the public charging point network be vital to support the transition away from diesel and petrol power car as he will know ev driver can save hundred of pound year and the average range of new ev be now mile that be about two week drive for most people and of course it be clean and greener we be work closely with industry stakeholder to promote positive messaging around evs and to improve consumer confidence one of the challenge face people who be move to electric vehicle be the charge infrastructure particularly in inner city local authority have work to try to help that but they have limit resource my old team at newham council do deal with uber to supply on street charge unit do the minister agree that that sort of partnership use public sector actor with private finance could help resolve the issue could the government look at way they could work with local authority to secure those public private partnership it be great to hear about newham council partnership that be develop under my hon friend leadership the million local ev infrastructure fund do just as he suggest and be expect to deliver charging point across the country support those driver without off street parking to switch to electric vehicle the future of the car industry be important to west brom and that future lie in electric vehicle one of the key issue on the demand side be that consumer do not have enough confidence in second hand ev despite manufacturer warranty and increasingly good battery life what step be the government take to improve consumer confidence when buy hand ev my hon friend will be pleased to know that one in three use electric car be now under and datum suggest that owner should expect an ev to last just as long as an internal combustion engine car the united nations economic commission for europe have develop new global technical regulation which would set standard for the lifespan of an ev battery and its minimum durability we be analyse option for the implementation of such regulation in the uk what the minister say be all very well but why do the government not support my exemption from value added tax public electric vehicle charging points bill as the hon member know matter relate to taxation be for the treasury rather than the department for transport but be sure that the chancellor will be look at the proposal that he bring forward welcome the increase uptake of electric vehicle indeed we do still need to dispel many myth in my constituency charge infrastructure be still big issue and the distribution network struggle to speed up connect to the infrastructure that be need will the minister outline what work she will do with distribution network to increase the expansion of ev charging network as be sure the hon member know there have be rapid increase in the roll out of electric charging point it be up by more than last year however she be absolutely right that in some case that roll out be difficult because it be hold back by the availability of capacity on the network that be precisely why we be work across government include with my colleague in the department for energy security and net zero to unblock those thing so that we can ensure that everyone can access the electric vehicle charging point that they need close to home thank the minister for her answer be not petrolhead but do love my diesel vehicle those of we who live in the countryside understand that have diesel vehicle be incredibly important and there be no electric charging point across the rural countryside there need to be more of those charge point on the high street and in the shopping centre and there definitely need to be more of they in the countryside since those of we who live there be be disadvantage by the electric car process as it go forward what be be do to help the rural community those of we who live in the countryside and those of we who represent they take advantage of electric car as well the charging point be not there the system do not work think the hon gentleman have already be charge the hon member make an important point we need to ensure that there be access everywhere across our nation to electric vehicle charging point in the autumn budget we commit million to support the roll out of charge infrastructure which be bolster by over billion in private investment that have be commit up to the hon member will be pleased to hear that there be over public charging point in the uk over have be add in the past year and there have be increase in rural charging point over the past year call the shadow minister draw the house attention to my entry in the register of members financial interests last year just one in consumer buy new car choose battery electric and in the private market for battery electric be low than government intervention have try to manipulate it to be without fleet sale which we know be warp by huge tax incentive promote they over practical vehicle choice electric car demand just be not there when will the minister understand that people be cry out for different way to defossilise and decarbonise their private vehicle battery electric just be not popular so when will the government stop try to tell people what they should want this be just government know good attitude at its very bad be it not what an absolutely astonishing intervention by the shadow minister it be his government who introduce the zero emission vehicle mandate and we be not propose to change the trajectory that they introduce would gently remind he that many fleet vehicle be in fact private vehicle as people choose to lease their vehicle or access they through salary sacrifice scheme last year the uk be the large market in europe in fact in the world for ev report february vol correction he be talk nonsense the society of motor manufacturers and traders january report simply do not back up what the minister have just say repeat that only one in consumer the people we all represent in this house actively choose battery electric vehicle as the minister know from her time on the transport select committee when we look at the future of fuel there be other technology out there the government like to say that they be technology neutral but the zev mandate myopic focus on the tailpipe rather than whole system analysis effectively deny our innovator the room to defossilise and decarbonise in manner that consumer want surely the minister see that so instead of try to force people to buy battery electric will the government just get the bureaucracy out of the way and let our innovator innovate wonder whether the shadow minister have actually meet any vehicle manufacturer if he have he would know that they be invest incredibly heavily in the switch to battery electric vehicle and my ministerial colleague have meet manufacturer represent of the uk car market to understand their concern and we will be work with they to ensure we support all uk vehicle manufacturer who have as they would put it bet the house on the transition to electric vehicle local road condition what assessment she have make of the adequacy of the

city itself but only million be spend in keighley and my wide constituency despite street such as elliott street in silsden be in very poor state of repair will the secretary of state write to leader at bradford council and remind they that highway spending need to be spend equally across the whole bradford district include place such as keighley and ilkley and not just within bradford city centre be not the sort of secretary of state who would sit at my desk in whitehall and instruct local authority to spend certain amount of money on certain road expect local authority to take strategic decision base on where the investment be need and will leave it to local leader to make those decision call the liberal democrat spokesperson too many of britain road be in shocking state of disrepair as the secretary of state say in my constituency labour run merton council have the bad road in london and the second bad in the country some of our local road be rat as poor by her department although welcome the come year increase in funding that be only short term measure and not base on need merton and other have receive less than authority whose road be in well condition as labour run merton have fail to maintain its road and have not be bail out by its friend in the government will the secretary of state meet to discuss what action can be take would be very happy to meet the hon

increase for local authority it will be make the difference and would be happy to discuss this issue with he far local bus services what step she be take to help improve local bus service what step she be take to help improve local bus service what step she be take to help improve local bus service the government be commit to deliver the well more reliable bus service that passenger deserve we have already make significant progress by introduce the bus services no bill to help local leader get the power they need and by announce investment of over billion to support and improve bus service thank the minister for that answer the cost of transport be huge cost of live pressure for child and young people in my constituency who be try to access education and social and leisure opportunity what assurance can the minister give that the bus bill will end system in which bus service be control by ideology and make it system that put they at the service of local people thank my hon friend for his question the government know how important local bus service be in provide access to education and allow young people to get around empower local leader to improve service be at the heart of our reform include through the introduction of the bus services no bill so that bus service deliver for hard work family and community throughout the country my constituent in worsley and eccles face high level of congestion on our road especially during their rush hour commute we benefit from greater manchester bee network but it only take temporary set of traffic light roadwork or an accident to back thing up will the minister outline what step be be take to give the necessary power and encouragement to our local community and decision maker to create join up public and private transport network that will alleviate congestion my hon friend be absolutely right to highlight this issue and will know that this government be act quickly to respond to his concern as outline in the english devolution white paper we will empower strategic authority to play great role in co ordinate their local road network that include remove unnecessary secretary of state consent requirement for certain local highway decision potentially include lane rental scheme which will speed up decision making so many people who live in rural town across my constituency rely on bus service to go to work school and hospital appointment but too often bus be run late or never turn up at all last week meet local resident nicola from emley who tell that when she be unable to drive it be nearly impossible for her daughter olivia to attend after school club will the minister advise on how this government will hold fail bus company to account and will help improve service in our local area my hon friend be my constituency neighbour and understand the challenge her constituent face we know that local bus service be not currently deliver for people around the country we be commit to change that and our bus service bill will give local leader the tool they need to deliver reliable bus service that truly meet the need of local community include in rural area know that the minister be truly passionate advocate for bus service but if he be privileged enough to live in the beautiful village of hixon in my constituency and want to get to the surgery in great haywood he would have to travel into stafford on bus and then on bus from stafford to great hayward will he update the house on what additional help and support staffordshire county council might look forward to receive so that hixon resident be able to get directly to great hayward the government be determined to empower local leader to make decision about their local bus service they can choose from variety of option in that toolkit include franchising which be now open to all local transport authority we be lift the ban on municipal bus company and improve enhanced partnership it be for local leader to make those decision and we be empower they to do so rural community such as mine rely on bus service as vital lifeline but too often these service be limited and infrequent private operator dominate the market in my area yet there be no minimum service requirement to ensure that people can get to work school or medical appointment will the government guarantee minimum level of service so that rural community be not leave strand the hon member will be pleased to know that the bus service bill include the socially necessary local service measure under the new measure local transport authority operate under an enhance partnership will need to identify local service which they consider socially necessary and put in place requirement that must be follow before such service can be change or

inability of disabled people to use their bus pass before limit they in get to work access leisure opportunity or see family and friend do the minister agree that one of the good way to improve local bus access would be to be allow disabled people to use their pass before the government already invest million in the national concessionary travel scheme in order to fund those bus pass and at the last budget we announce over billion of funding to support bus we change the formula for bsip bus service improvement plan away from the competitive hunger games style contest under the previous government the hon member local area will have receive funding and it be able to use that funding to go above and beyond what be set on national level open access railway services what step she be take to maintain open access railway service open access operator will continue to have place in our reform great british railway we have support new proposal from wrexham shropshire and midlands railway and exist track access right will be honour open access can provide benefit but it must not come at the cost of well service for passenger and well value for taxpayer in her recent letter to the office of rail and road the transport secretary appear to push against open access agreement yet last week as she have mention today the government signal their intention to support the request to license the wrexham to london euston line which will come through aldridge in my constituency will the transport secretary clarify her position on the wrexham to euston line particularly in regard to the inclusion of aldridge train station as she will be aware thank to the labour mayor the funding for that station have be raid and put into his pet project appreciate the right hon lady commitment to make the case for new station at aldridge but gently point out to she that in the year of her party government include her own stint in the department for transport the station fail to materialise the west midlands combine authority have have to prioritise the delivery of scheme that be in construction that seem to to be reasonable approach but appreciate that she will continue to make the case for her own station open access operator grand central already run five service daily from sunderland to london king cross through my constituency but unfortunately they currently do not stop my constituent have endure year of poor rail service from northern rail with just one overcrowded two carriage train an hour which be often cancel or delay while welcome this government investment in new train for northern rail we need some immediate solution will the minister urge the orr to approve the application from grand central to allow these train to stop at station in my easington constituency open access operator currently account for of our railway and they do not always have the same public service obligation as other train operating company we have always support open access operator where they genuinely add value and do not divert revenue away from exist operator all of which be support by the taxpayer in some form would add that we need to make good use of constrain capacity on the rail network ensure that the railway can recover from problem on the railway be also important to talk of access several year ago greater anglia demolish half of wickford station to extend some of the platform however after nearly three year of endless excuse miss deadline and frankly broken promise it still have not rebuild it regret to say that have lose all confidence in the senior management of greater anglia if they tell today be thursday would double check it can go over their head and ask the secretary of state for personal meeting with the rail minister so that we can finally get wickford station rebuild despite greater anglia rather than because of it will happily ask the rail minister to meet the right hon gentleman to ensure that progress can be make at wickford know that my right hon friend will be delight by the news that go op will be operate new mandate for return service between swindon and taunton do she agree that this demonstrate the government commitment to improve connectivity across the country can we hope for such improvement to connectivity in my little corner of the world in berkshire be pleased that my hon friend have raise this proposal which demonstrate the pragmatic approach we take to open access operator go op will be the first co operatively own train service run anywhere in the uk if there be any investor out there think about invest in that service encourage they to look closely at it rolling stock purchasing models what assessment she have make of the potential merit of use alternative funding model to purchase roll stock as part of our reform to the railway we have set out that we will continue to lease rolling stock when we take contract into public ownership but we will apply single direct mind approach to eliminate barrier to share roll stock well across the network we will consider the good funding and financing structure for future order and contract in partnership with private capital at the moment the rolling stock leasing company take more than billion of profit out of the railway substantial amount of that could be reinveste in improve the railway network with the bill for great british railways due to come to parliament soon will the secretary of state look seriously at alternative financing model such as eurofima the european company for the financing of railroad roll stock or even publicly own rosco that could deliver roll stock at considerably low price indeed will she be more socialist and more ambitious with the bill assure the hon gentleman that do not lack any ambition when it come to great british railways it would cost billion in taxpayer money to buy exist rolling stock at time when there be many pressure on the public purse my official have be engage regularly with eurofima to consider the potential for uk membership and how eurofima finance could be deploy in the uk east coast main line what step her department be take to improve reliability on the east coast main line the department recognise the critical importance of the east coast main line and have invest billion in combination of infrastructure enhancement and roll stock upgrade that will help to deliver journey time reliability and capacity improvement the full benefit of this investment will be feel with the introduction of revise timetable in december the department continue to work closely with network rail to explore opportunity to improve performance and resilience my constituent have raise concern about the reliability of service on the east coast main line with one constituent receive delay repay compensation for five out of six journey he take over two month period welcome the correspondence have have with the rail minister on the action that the department for transport be take with rail partner include through the east coast digital programme will my hon friend confirm that the first train utilise new digital signal technology will be on the track by the end of the year when do she expect passenger to feel the full benefit of this welcome upgrade the east coast digital programme be deliver digital signal on mile of the east coast main line the technology will deliver an inherent improvement to service reliability and uplift performance and capacity across the line include for my hon friend constituent the first train be forecast to start run under digital signal from early the number of service run under digital signalling will increase until the full programme be expect to be complete in the early cost of rail services what step she be take to reduce the cost of rail service what step she be take to reduce the cost of rail service it be our ambition through public ownership to deliver more affordable railway this year fare increase of be the low absolute increase in three year we be committed to reform the overcomplicate fare system and expand ticket innovation like pay as you go in urban area across the country when the secretary of state finally step in and knock head together and we get our azuma train to grimsby via market rasen will she instruct the railway company to name the locomotive margaret thatcher to remind we all that the good way to reduce the cost of rail service be to end restrictive trade union practice hate to disappoint the father of the house but be afraid that will not be make such commitment today the british people pay some of the high rail fare in europe however the government seem to prioritise the size of the socialist state by kowtow to trade union with radical public pay rise and nationalisation plan will the secretary of state instead please focus on improve the lot of commuter particularly romford hard work commuter and take real step to reduce rail fare and improve railway service be surprised that the hon gentleman have the gall to raise this issue when under his party government fare rise at around twice the speed of wage also point out that since train operating company have pay out nearly billion to their parent company sign off by conservative ministers in the previous government if the hon gentleman want to talk about cost and value for money on the railway suggest he start by look in the mirror it be in fact conservative secretary of state who force fare rise on transport for london in exchange for covid emergency funding what step will my right hon friend take to put tfl on well footing in the future include back great project such as the one in my constituency to upgrade and provide step free access at one of the busy station in the country at south kensington my hon friend be absolutely right in the middle of global pandemic the conservatives be still obsess with settle old political score over fare in london rather than do right by the capital vividly remember meeting with the then secretary of state to discuss how we could keep service safely run which end with he tell this would have be so much easy if you have frozen fare unlike the conservatives this government will always do right by the capital as well as the rest of the country can ask that this uk government do not follow the approach take by the scottish government on public ownership scotrail fare be set for another inflation bust increase in april follow an hike last year and the reintroduction of peak fare in september do the secretary of state agree that the snp should be make rail more affordable instead of hit passenger with painful fare hike time and again the increase be bad for scotland rail passenger bad for our economy and bad for the environment assure my hon friend that we will bring the train operate company into public ownership properly and that we will not repeat the mistake we have see in scotland call the shadow minister be very interested by that last answer because the government do think that nationalisation will reduce the cost of rail travel what lesson have the secretary of state learn from the snp nationalisation of scotrail we will be increase value for money in the way we operate our railway to start off with we will be get rid of up to million year in management fee that we be currently pay out of the public purse to the train operating company we be determined to drive up performance on our railway and give well value for money to the taxpayer the late experiment in nationalisation have show in just two year that state inefficiency have push up cost not reduce they by million force fare to rise alongside an increase in delay slump in customer satisfaction and cut instead of improvement to service the data show that in england greater anglia have be the well perform operator save money for taxpayer while serve passenger with modern punctual train the secretary of state be about to launch public consultation on nationalisation one that have be as delay as scotrail train be tell that even the plan to publish it today have be far delay with the excuse of no on the line if the secretary of state consult she have to be prepared to listen will she now listen to the deep concern of the rail industry and not just the ever generous union and avoid another disastrous nationalisation assure the hon gentleman that the consultation on establish great british railways be come soon and look forward to discuss it far with he be confident that by bring together the management of track and train we can strip out duplication in our railway provide well value for the taxpayer and ensure that train be turn up on time with reliable and punctual service that be what we will deliver transport infrastructure rural communities what step her department be take to improve transport infrastructure in rural community the government recognise the importance of high quality transport infrastructure as part of well function integrate transport network we be support all local authority to improve transport infrastructure include through our billion investment in local road know that my hon friend road be litter with pothole which be why they be get share of our uplift norfolk economy to fire on all cylinder need decent rural road network the thickthorn

with the heritage station will this government back access for my constituent and access for people to come and visit our beautiful town thank the hon lady for that question improve accessibility in our railway station be incredibly important be sure that the rail minister will be happy to write to she on the specific of her station and to consider the proposal that have be make road safety what step she be take to improve road safety the last labour government halve the number of people kill on our road each year under the conservative that progress stall with only reduction between and when almost people be kill or seriously injure on our road that be about one casualty every minute that shocking statistic be why improve road safety be one of my key priority we be develop our road safety strategy the first in decade and will set out more detail in due course thank the minister for that answer nearly of my constituent have fill in my survey about the dangerously short slip road on the at east ilsley and beedon they include nick who never use the beedon junction when his young family be in the car and be even consider move house because he believe it be real risk to their life will

that have remain unusable since its construction due to road layout and safety issue despite this be relatively small fix somerset council have yet to take action what additional support can the government provide to ensure that bus can stop at the station safely and improve connectivity in my constituency thank the hon gentleman for raise that question it do sound like it be matter for his local council but be sure that my official would be very happy to work with it to provide any advice and support it may need to work out how to provide safe service in that area rail passenger what step she be take to improve passenger rail performance improve performance be top priority for this government as we establish great british railways we regularly meet manage director of train

decision that will improve performance for the benefit of passenger and taxpayer alike the transpennine route upgrade be the big rail infrastructure project in the country and my constituency be at the centre of it one of the main benefit for passenger will be fast and more reliable train will the secretary of state update the house on the project and tell we what step be be take to ensure that local community such as those in huddersfield benefit fully from improvement in rail performance my hon friend be right to draw attention to the importance of this investment to her constituency the rail upgrade will double the number of seat between huddersfield and manchester and will increase the number by between huddersfield and leeds service reliability will also improve moreover of the workforce will be employ within mile of the route and of spending will be within the local supply chain which will lead to local growth and job so it be good news all round want to improve rail

country pay approximately million annually to fund the chancellor next spending spree the valuation office agency be currently revaluate airport in england and wales and any significant increase could impact heathrow ability to fund airport expansion and third runway be the secretary of state aware of the late estimate of how much heathrow business rate will increase by this be policy cook up by the valuation office agency under his majesty revenue and customs by the last government we have engage with airport on this matter and ask they to continue to engage with the valuation office agency notice that the minister do not answer my question so will assist he the estimate be that heathrow rate bill will increase fivefold to million annually put substantial additional pressure on heathrow finance in the light of that will the minister confirm the long stand policy that the full cost of third runway include related work such as relocate tunnel or bridge over the will be fully fund by the private sector and not by the taxpayer the airport national policy statement from which be two government ago make it clear that any proposal we have not have proposal come forward should treat surface access appropriately and that should be fund by the private sector where possible resident in ashbourne have be leave feel hopeless and frustrated after wait decade for relief road more than

company that do not comply with certain requirement for carry out their street work and we have extend overrun charge of up to per day to weekend and bank holiday to prevent overrunning roadwork open access operator such as hull train offer excellent cheap unsubsidised inter city service to location across the north so why be minister try to block their expansion and stifle growth there be balance to be strike here welcome service such as those that run to hull they open up new route and new connectivity have however ask the office of rail and road to consider the balance in the revenue that they abstract from public operator and to ensure that we be use constrained capacity in our network appropriately to deliver excellent service for passenger the rac recently report that pothole in derbyshire be the bad in the country but rather than welcome over million of funding for the east midland the conservatives at derbyshire county council claim that this be not new money and that it be

will take time to become stable and reliable service would be absolutely delighted to work with my hon friend as you will know mr speaker rarely if ever agree with the mayor of london sadiq khan the secretary of state have set out the position in relation to her change of heart but will she commit to ensure that any proposal for third runway at heathrow will have full impact assessment before it be approve or deny fully support the chancellor call for fresh proposal for heathrow some of our airport in the south east be run at or near capacity we can not pretend that that be not the case and be not prepared to be part of government who duck the difficult decision as the person who may ultimately be take planning decision on any application for third runway at heathrow will judge any scheme on its merit we will update the airport national policy statement and any expansion scheme must meet our legal and environmental obligation as the secretary of state know the south west peninsula already contribute significantly to the uk economy include through life science and climate tech we be however hold back from reach our full potential by under investment in transport connectivity which be make bad by upcoming work at old oak common and the continue bottleneck on the will the minister commit to develop strategic investment plan to ensure that the south west

slow unreliable and grossly outdated rail service it be also underserve by road transport link eastward the government recently announce that they will develop silicon valley between milton keynes order we be on topical think you need an adjournment debate who be go to answer that will certainly meet the hon gentleman to discuss this matter call the chair of the transport committee department for transport analysis carry out in show that expand heathrow would displace job from the uk region to london by with million few passenger use non london airport do the minister hope that the same analysis if do now would come to different conclusion in order to ensure that uk economic growth really do benefit all uk region and not just west london the government be commit to regional airport be proudly wear my yes to badge from when we build second runway at manchester airport in the position be quite the opposite of what my hon friend describe under the airport national policy statement the number of connection from heathrow to regional airport be expect to increase if heathrow expand increase productivity in those region northern train run one train per day on the gainsborough brigg cleethorpes line do the secretary of state agree that one train per day be pretty pointless will she arrange meeting with the appropriate minister for and other affected mp so that we can discuss how to secure well service reliable frequent train service be important no matter where in the country we live will ask the rail minister for meeting do the minister agree that achieve economic growth

will go ahead without disabled access be put in place that clearly impede disabled people can we ensure that difficult engineering work be undertake before planning permission be grant the accessibility of all mode of transport be extremely important to this government would be delighted to meet my hon friend to discuss this matter far despite my constituency be only stone throw from heathrow we have no direct rail link to the country busy airport last week heathrow southern railway submit business case to the government when will the government consider it to ensure that my constituent can get train to heathrow alongside the question of how many plane should take off and land at heathrow there be the critical question of how people get to the airport the hon gentleman make an important point and would be happy to discuss it far with he learner driver in basingstoke have be leave strand for month in some case year unable to book driving test that be affect their job their education and the local economy do the secretary of state agree that urgent action be need to extend test centre hour to ramp up the recruitment of examiner and to clamp down on the rip off

seven point plan that recognise the need to fix the drive test booking system so that we can get new driver on the road will hold it to account for delivery of that plan and the change that my hon friend and his constituent need to see when the previous government cancel high speed they promise more than billion for project in the north and the midland do the government still plan to deliver on that and when should we expect to see that money in the north hate to tell the hon gentleman this but that be fantasy money we be work through pipeline of transport infrastructure project and will make announcement alongside the spending review the long promise platform lift at hertford north station due to be deliver under the access for all scheme have be delay yet again this leave some of my disabled constituent have to travel back up the line to get different train to platform so that they can use the lift there will the appropriate minister meet to discuss how we can urgently drive

transport network and would be happy to ensure that or one of my colleague meet he on economic growth which we have discuss will the secretary of state clarify for the benefit of the conservative party that economic growth depend on rather more than well oil revolve door between the tory party and big business door through which former tory transport minister and member of the other place

birmingham camp hill line reopen we will need track investment if we be to restore the pre pandemic service frequency on the cross city line include to northfield and longbridge will the minister look fully at the case for upgrade king norton station my hon friend be an assiduous and informed campaigner for improved rail service for his constituent he will know that funding for the midland rail hub include funding for design for reinstated island platform at king norton decision still need to be take on future investment but know that he will push for construction to start as soon as possible the calder valley line be list as top priority for improvement by transport for the north electrification taskforce year ago back in yet my constituent be still wait for those improvement will the minister commit this government to deliver the infrastructure for my constituent that the last government could not network rail be complete strategic outline business case cover electrification of

month railway enthusiast from around the world will come to my constituency where we will mark the anniversary of the stockton and darlington railway which take off from the town of shildon will my right hon friend ask the rail minister to meet and other mps along that route to talk about how the government can be part of those celebration be sure that be an invitation that the rail minister could not possibly refuse on that basis look forward to minister open the coppull railway station or at least do an impact study on the main line ukraine urgent question to ask the secretary of state for defence if he will make statement on ukraine yesterday at the ukraine defence contact group chair by the defence secretary we see almost nation and partner stand together ukraine be back by the member of the group and by billion of dollar worth of arm and ammunition that have be commit to keep its warfighter equip that will increase pressure on putin help force he to the table and bring sustainable peace close we be pleased that secretary hegseth confirm the us continue commitment to the group to ukraine pursuit of what he call durable peace and to the importance of security guarantee we hear his call for european nation to step up we be and we will nato ally pledge billion in and go on to provide billion the majority of that come from european nation while non us nato ally boost wide defence spending by in just the last year so europe be step up finally we see clear commitment to ratchet up the pressure on putin use both military and economic tool we all agree that will be the critical year for ukraine at this crucial moment we will not step back but step up our support for ukraine president trump and president zelensky have both speak of their desire to achieve peace through strength the commitment make yesterday provide the collective strength that we need to achieve peace for our part the uk will spend billion on military support for ukraine this year which be more than ever before we have now provide more than artillery shell worth over billion yesterday the defence secretary announce that we will provide an additional million of new firepower include drone tank and air to air missile ukraine security matter to global security that be why the vital ukraine defence contact group coalition of nation and partner stretch from the indo pacific to south america this war be never about the fate of just one nation when the border of one country be redrawn by force it undermine the security of all nation the us be serious about stability in the indo pacific as be we that be why the prime minister announce that the carrier strike group will go there next year if aggression go unchecked on one continent it embolden regime on another so on step up for ukraine we be and we will on step up for european security we be and we will be grateful to you mr speaker for grant this urgent question we be in recess next week and the day that we return will be the third anniversary of putin unprovoked illegal invasion of ukraine in the past three year russia have inflict unimaginable suffering on ukraine there have be military and civilian loss of life on vast scale at the hand of dictator oblivious to consequence and only too willing to sacrifice his own soldier to the meat grinder in the face of so many casualty and so much pain of course we all want peace we all want the senseless slaughter to stop and for ukraine to once again thrive and enjoy the trapping of peace and prosperity which we all take for grant it be clear that an end to this suffering be goal that president trump wish to achieve rapidly he set that out to the american people before secure their support for his election to the white house and for second mandate we remain steadfast in our support for ukraine and in our backing for the government in deliver that they give we the same backing when in opposition we agree in principle with they and believe as we stress repeatedly in government that it be for the ukrainians to decide the timing and the term of any negotiation on end the war do the minister agree that negotiation without the direct involvement of ukraine would be unthinkable what more can the minister say about how the government will work with ally to ensure that any negotiation be drive by the primacy of ukraine need not least give its status as the democratic nation invade without provocation by dictator we welcome the news from the minister about the commitment give by other european nato nation this week but be not president trump right to consistently highlight the point that some nato nation spend far below what be expect and require on defence will the minister assure the house that the government use every lever at their disposal will remind all nato member that win for putin in any settlement may bring temporary end to the conflict but will not make the world safe place far from it it would be an illusion of peace and would be likely to send very dangerous signal to other potential adversary of course the position express by both the us president and his defence secretary yesterday have huge implication for our defence policy they have make it abundantly clear that the us will play no role in any future peacekeeping effort in ukraine should that be necessary although the government will of course be cautious about contemplate publicly the implication of that be not the key point straightforward if high defence spending be urgent before it be now critical welcome the fact that in the main there be still consensus across this house on support ukraine that have be tremendously important part of the support that we have give over the last three year and before to the ukrainians the hon gentleman say that there should be no negotiation about ukraine without ukraine my right hon friend the defence secretary make that clear in his remark yesterday nato job be to put ukraine in the strong possible position for any talk but there can be no negotiation about ukraine without ukraine involvement we want to see durable peace and no return to conflict and aggression that be the only way in which this war can end with the kind of security that president trump and secretary hegseth have refer to we be all conscious of the three year anniversary of the invasion of ukraine and our thought be with the people of ukraine at this time however there can be no peace without justice it be therefore welcome that country be collaborate to try to bring about de escalation of the war what be the government do to focus on the justice system to ensure that war criminal be try and justice be bring to the ukrainian people my hon friend make an important point we have always say that this have to be just peace and that those who have commit war crime during the invasion of ukraine need to be pursue for they call the liberal democrat spokesperson yesterday the leader of my party warn the prime minister that we might be face the bad betrayal of european ally since poland in the hour since have confirm our fear this be moment of great peril for we all do the minister agree that the us action be betrayal of our ukrainian friend who have fight so hard for their freedom of the uk and of all our european ally will the government step up and show british leadership start by pass urgent legislation to seize frozen russian asset so that we can support ukraine whatever the us do clearly in the light of the event of the past hour the government need to look again at defence spending do she agree that the decision of the previous government to continue with cut to the army of troop at time when war be rag on our continent now look utterly unforgivable do not accept what the hon gentleman say about be betray by our ally the us defence secretary have make it clear that he that he want durable peace that be what he and the president be proceed to try to obtain so do not accept that point in term of our own force we be seek to ensure that recruitment which have fail to meet target over the last number of year be improve so that the number in our armed force be up to full strength thank the minister for her statement and the additional support that the government have announce it be essential that the uk support ukraine and that the annual billion pledge continue do she agree that work alongside our ally be even more essential in these turbulent time to bring about an end to the war agree with my hon friend it be clear that any such negotiation must involve ukraine and that the ukrainians must be happy with the peace that be negotiate our role at present while fierce fighting be still go on be to put they in the strong position that we can in order to enable they properly to negotiate welcome what the minister have say from the dispatch box do she agree that in this new world and in the event of any peace deal the united kingdom and its european ally must lead in provide ukraine with military support and potentially military presence across land air and sea to give ukraine confidence that any peace will endure assure the government that they will have my support if that be what they decide to do thank the right hon gentleman for his remark of course when he play part in these matter he be in office so he be very knowledgeable about they can confirm that we aim to put ukraine in the strong possible position to enable it to negotiate that involve continue to supply the ukrainians with the arm and weapon that they need in order to fight because the fighting be still fierce we need to step up and ensure that we do that certainly over the last period the eu and european nation that be involve in the coalition to support ukraine have give the majority of military aid and support as the secretary general of nato confirm yesterday of the support that ukraine receive last year be from european nation so european nation be step up we must continue to do so welcome the minister comment about ukraine security be indivisible from global security do she agree that the uk must stand firm against those who believe that they can take land through aggression and that we must continue to send strong signal around the world that large nation can not just grab bit of small nation as and when they please my hon friend be correct as say in my initial response to the urgent question it be important that we deter that kind of behaviour wherever it be see around the world it be quite clear from event of the past few hour that the atlantic and the high north be of increasingly critical concern indeed be member of the scottish affairs committee that consider that in the previous parliament know that the government have have conversation with denmark but what conversation be they have with our other joint expeditionary force partner to ensure that those force be give the support and the resource that they need the government have ongoing discussion with our partner in europe and the high north do the minister agree that this announcement should not affect the support of this house and the uk for ukraine and will she work with our armed force and our defence industry to do everything possible to support ukrainian force on the frontline my hon friend be correct we be do that but we must continue to step up our capacity to support ukraine with weapon and the force that it need to deter ongoing aggression and to ensure that it be in the strong possible position in any negotiation that it decide to enter will the government impress on president trump at every possible opportunity that the reason why appeasement lead to world war two be that it leave vacuum in europe whereas the reason why the occupation of eastern europe at the end of that war do not lead to world war three be that the united states fill any possible vacuum and contain further aggression if he be go for settlement against the wish of the ukrainian people the least he can do be guarantee directly the security of that part of ukraine which remain unoccupied no matter which side of the chamber he be sit on the right hon gentleman have long history of support deterrence whether nuclear or short of that threshold and he make the same point again the us secretary of defence make it clear in his remark to the contact group that deterrence be important around the world so think there be agreement there welcome the announcement of the new million package of military firepower for ukraine include drone tank and air defence system how will that boost ukrainian resilience and the uk defence sector it do both there be only one way in which we can provide the ukrainians with increase amount of munition and drone which be develop and change rapidly and that be by boost the strength of our defence industry that have the additional importance of enable we to boost our capacity to deter any potential aggression so in that sense we can do both and we be do so view from washington the idea of carve up the map in europe might look like pragmatic deal even if history tell we that that always end badly surely we in europe understand that no matter what we give vladimir putin he will always want more be that the context in which the strategic defence review be be carry out and do the minister accept that this moment require fundamental reset of our relation with our european partner not just in defence and that we need to get real about the financial and economic implication assure the right hon gentleman that the strategic defence review be about identify threat that we face now rather than threat we perhaps face before the ukraine war begin so can tell he that the review be be conduct with that in mind on the deterrence that we need to be able to provide and the money we need to spend to provide it the commitment be as it have be as the prime minister have say he will set out path to once the strategic defence review have be publish and we expect that to be in the spring as the minister will know from her many welcome visit my constituency be home to many defence company that be play vital role in this conflict do she agree that it be crucial that we continue to support company here in the uk to get military kit into the hand of those in ukraine who need it most very much agree with my hon friend have have the pleasure of visit her constituency on several occasion and when it be her predecessor constituency as well so be well aware of the strength of its defence industrial base we need to strengthen that base across our nation and region and we be do that that have the additional importance of provide deterrence for our nation as well as support ukraine will the minister agree that this clarify what the benchmark of success for the defence review must be as some of the defence chief have be express we must be ready if necessary to fight war with russia if we be to deter it and if we be to be in any position to guarantee the security of an independent and sovereign ukraine after whatever be agree between president trump and president putin agree we all agree with the hon gentleman that defence spending need to increase that must be do in the context of we set out in the sdr precisely where we see the threat it be important to spend money correctly and in the good possible way and do not think that there be any real disagreement across the chamber about that we will see in due course whether those challenge be meet when the strategic defence review be publish and we set out the path to when in the spring welcome the statement that any negotiation about ukraine must involve ukraine in that spirit have the minister or any of her colleague have conversation with their counterpart in ukraine follow the recent development to find out how they be feel if not do they plan to soon have not but know my right hon friend the secretary of state have be have discussion and indeed our discussion be ongoing and frequent have have contact with my counterpart in ukraine just not since yesterday yesterday no matter that we in this house wish it be not the case the people of ukraine be betray and the crime of aggression and annexation be reward in telephone call between washington and moscow right now we have to be build close partnership with our european ally for whom democracy sovereignty and the rule of law still actually mean something welcome the government announcement that they defend the territorial integrity of ukraine but how will the government do that in the face of two man who believe that because of their military superiority they can do whatever they want to whomever they want the us secretary of defence make it clear yesterday that any peace negotiation that the americans be involve in need to lead to durable peace that do not see resumption of the aggression that have lead to this war and we support that we have also make it quite clear that these negotiation must involve ukraine of course they must that be the way in which this war will finally end welcome the minister statement particularly the commitment that any negotiation about ukraine must involve ukraine because if report of the call between president trump and moscow be to be believe this be less the art of the deal and more charter for appeasement will we be work with nato ally to establish clear road map with define timeframe for ukraine nato membership ensure long term deterrence against inevitable further russian aggression we have always say that ukraine rightful place be in nato and our position be that ukraine be on an irreversible path to nato membership however we have also always be clear that the process will take time have already say quite clearly that the fate of ukraine in these negotiation can not be determine without ukraine be fully involve and that be our priority at the moment warfighting be still happen to put ukraine in the strong possible position to negotiate from strength in russia along with the uk and the us sign the budapest memorandum pledge to respect the sovereignty and territorial integrity of ukraine give russia flagrant breach of that undertaking why should ukraine believe word that putin say without concrete security guarantee the right hon gentleman be correct that there must be security guarantee and the us defence secretary say as much these be all matter for any negotiation that take place of course we will be support ukraine and we have make it quite clear that there can not be peace that do not involve ukraine or that it do not support can the minister assure the house that it be uk government policy that not only must ukraine be involve in peace and in secure its territorial integrity but it be only the ukrainian people not president trump nor president putin who can determine the destiny of ukraine we have say that ukraine must be involve in those negotiation and that peace negotiation need two side to come an agreement it therefore clearly follow that the ukrainians must be content with whatever the process come up with there must be security guarantee and the peace must be durable everybody agree with that be the minister concern that president trump be repeat false kremlin propaganda and perpetuate gross misrepresentation of the war in ukraine by suggest that for ukraine this be not good war to go into will the uk government be make it clear to the us president in no uncertain term that ukraine have just defend itself from invasion bombing rape murder and occupation and that it be an outrage for president trump to suggest that ukraine should give up its sovereign territory to russia we have make quite clear with our year partnership with ukraine that we back it in the long term we have provide ukraine with support from many party across this chamber over number of year to ensure that it can continue its fight and we will continue to support ukraine during any negotiation that take place so that it can get the peace that it wish to have the minister commitment to continue defence support for ukraine be essential and be sure the house thought be with ukrainians who be fight for their freedom and all the ukrainians in our own community who have find sanctuary in this country do she agree that any settlement can not be repeat of the budapest memorandum or the minsk agreement which fail to deter future russian imperial aggression think everybody agree that any peace that be negotiate must be durable that will require security guarantee give the past experience that the ukrainians have of russia and russian aggression as the minister will be aware much of the russian war effort be be sustain by other nation include several of the bric nation which be support russia through direct military aid or dual use product what be the minister do to try to deter the flow of arm that be continue to sustain russia the right hon gentleman will know very well that there be sanction which we do our good to police and they have have some impact think they have to continue both while the war be still ongoing and while the peace be be consider and negotiate all war end but know it be the feeling of member across the house that we very much owe it to the man and woman fight for ukraine that when this war end it do so with ukraine in position of strength at the table and in the drive seat on the term and timescale agree with my hon friend that we need to continue to support ukraine to put it in the strong possible position both while it be fight the war and during any negotiation that take place could we take moment to reflect on the hundred of thousand of life that have be lose in this war ukrainian civilian ukrainian soldier russian soldier and all the family who be mourn today effort be make early on by latin american and african leader and the pope to try to negotiate an end to this war and we may now have an opportunity to demonstrate that one country should never occupy another do the minister believe that there be any possibility in the near future of ceasefire ahead of negotiation that would be acceptable to the people of ukraine as well as the rest of europe because we need to see an end to this ghastly conflict the right hon gentleman be correct that conflict such as this need to come to an end as soon as possible so acknowledge the point he make about the death on all side and how bad that be however think it be important for any peace that may be negotiate to be durable and lasting so we need to focus our mind at present on support ukraine as much as we can so that it go into any such negotiation in the strong possible position give putin illegal invasion and declare intent do the government agree that any negotiation must result in sovereign ukraine and that the uk will play its part in provide security guarantee that be meaningful unlike those of the past because that be crucial to secure last peace the hon member be right that security guarantee be likely to be an important part of any peace agreement give the past history we have year partnership with ukraine and we be commit to ensure that it can defend its sovereign capability to continue to exist while it be too early to talk about any detail of what those security guarantee may be we be committed to make sure that ukraine can continue as an independent state on monday there will be concert in bath abbey in support of ukraine my constituent have be unstinting in their support for ukrainians live among we but also for ukrainian community such as in oleksandriia now be not the point at which to weaken our support how will the government ensure that ukraine voice be hear loud and clear in any peace talk and that no european country may potentially or will ultimately be bully by us president trump agree very much with the hon lady when she say that our ukrainian friend here in this nation have receive lot of support not only in her constituency but across the uk from their friend and neighbour and that that will continue we have year partnership with ukraine we have support the ukrainians through the tough time of this war with arm and other necessary support and we will continue to do so be sure the minister will acknowledge as do the huge effort of the ukrainian diaspora in the uk of which large proportion be in scotland particularly in and around my constituency give the huge effort they have make do she agree that we must not convey the idea in the come week that we have in any way let they or their countryman down do agree with that and we have no intention think in any part of this house of do so call jim shannon thank you mr speaker be surprised to be call so early do you want to wait minute no no will grab the chance thank the minister for her answer it be obvious to and other member of this house that she have heart that want to help those in ukraine and we appreciate that especially since it come from government welcome the potential peace that might come but of course it have to be peace of justice it have to be fair to the ukrainians and we hope way can be find do she agree that any sign of negotiation be to be welcome but that there can be no doubt that ukraine retain the support of this house she have say that and everyone have say it what role will the uk have in ensure that the people of ukraine have security from further russian aggression when putin recalibrate his force year or two from now the hon gentleman be right to raise these concern it be clear that any peace that be negotiate which must have the consent of the ukrainians themselves have to be durable and to the extent that that require security guarantee those have to be present for it to work it be truism from ancient roman time that if we want peace we must prepare for war and be glad the strategic defence review be prepare we for war sadly although in slow motion unfortunately will the sdr consider the unlocked back door that be ireland which sit outwith nato it be clear that alarm bell be ring in nato but ireland cash rich sit outside nato and have critical role in defend undersea cable we learn from the irish press that its navy be set sail without sufficient officer to man its main gun it be send out gunboat without gun what can we do to encourage ireland to play full role in what will think be confrontation with russia the hon gentleman be right that we need to prepare the strategic defence review will set out the threat that we face and we will then turn our attention to make sure we obtain the capability to deal with they obviously we will look at any weakness there might be and try to shore they up every time president trump make statement about ukraine hear from constituent that they be terrify for the future of ukraine and never more so than in the last hour will the minister confirm whether the british government be consult on or tell about president trump call with vladimir putin beforehand be afraid it be above my pay grade to know the answer to that question but be sure the hon gentleman will have an opportunity to ask those whose pay grade it be not above at another question session as far as be aware we have have friendly conversation at the ukraine defence contact group with member of the us administration what practical help be the government provide to ukraine legal system and judge to ensure the prosecution of war crime we have year partnership with ukraine which have be sign that will be support it in any way it feel it need support that we might be able to offer can not answer the hon gentleman question today about what help we have give but be absolutely certain that if ukraine ask we for help and it be consider that our legal profession be able to supply it we will think about do so do the minister not agree that the lesson to draw from this be the importance of military strength work with all our nato and european ally but critically be able to stand on our own two foot militarily we need to see defence spending as investment and in that light do she wish we be not give however many billion of pound it be to mauritius and that we could invest that money in our defence instead we have commitment to get our defence spend back to of gdp and the last time it be at that level be at the time of the last labour government business of the house will the leader of the house give we the forthcoming business the business for the week commence february include monday february remain stage of the crown estate bill lords tuesday february second reading of the institute for apprenticeships and technical education transfer of functions etc bill lords wednesday february opposition day allot day debate on motion in the name of the official opposition subject to be announce thursday february general debate on the third anniversary of the war in ukraine follow by general debate on st david day the subject for these debate be determine by the backbench business committee friday february the house will not be sit the provisional business for the week commence march will include monday march remain stage of the finance bill tuesday march all stage of the church of scotland lord high commissioner bill wednesday march estimate day allot day at pm the house will be ask to agree all outstanding estimate thursday march business to be determine by the backbench business committee friday march private member bills like some of our lead podcaster we love storm cloud or two in business question sure enough the poor government have be desperately hop that recent event in america would drive the storm cloud away from the uk economy even though the news from washington dc have be startling to say the least it have not be enough to dispel yet another week of adverse economic headline both the office for budget responsibility and the bank of england have reportedly downgrade their growth forecast the latter cut its by half to measly for the year so much for the chancellor much vaunted dash for growth meanwhile the national institute of economic and social research have report that zero fiscal headroom remain to deal with any shock in the same week that president trump have announce tariff on steel it be easy to see what have happen here labour never expect president trump to win it send team over to campaign for his opponent the government pass an anti growth budget and they do not build enough leeway into their financial planning indeed the chancellor promise no new taxis or spending now we be have to live with the consequence it be also hard to miss the continue controversy that the attorney general be create and hard still not to notice the extremely critical word of his labour colleague lord glasman do not propose to repeat those word here but they point to two issue that demand this house full and proper attention in both case the concern be not over the legal position take by the attorney general as such but the contradiction that they offer to the rest of government policy people can agree or disagree about the policy but the contradiction can not be fudge they can not be blame on other and they require explanation the first contradiction be in relation to international law on february the attorney general tell the council of europe that the government would never withdraw from the european convention on human rights or refuse to comply with judgment of the court in do so he be simply restate settle uk policy for many decade fact that he somehow neglect to mention the difficulty arise however because the government new legislation on small boat appear to retain measure ban migrant from claim protection under the modern slavery law that be ban that the prime minister go out of his way to denounce when it be first introduce in in his word it be cry shame that we face legislation that drive coach and horse through our world lead modern slavery framework which protect woman from exploitation official report march vol that be quite turn you see the deep problem mr speaker which be it to be will the government abide by international law in this instance and protect woman from exploitation as the prime minister say or will they reverse his newly adopt position in support of the ban the second problem relate to domestic law last november the attorney general strengthen his official guidance to government lawyer on possible legal risk he specifically caution against offer legal support for policy that have only tenable case elsewhere he have pledge to restore check on executive that is government action this come at time when the prime minister have specifically pledge to end vexatious litigation while build huge amount of new housing and infrastructure you see the problem mr speaker it be the problem that the noble lord glasman be point out when he praise the rule of law but not of lawyer this edict will have chilling effect on what think we can already agree be pretty sluggish decision making by ministers will the government now take less legal risk as the attorney general require will their lawyer now require ministers to act only when they can defeat legal challenge or will they curb the judicial review and other legal case that will otherwise inevitably disrupt their building plan do not expect the leader of the house to tell we how the government plan to resolve those obvious problem today but the house would be grateful for debate in government time on what on earth the government approach will be to resolve they may first update the house on the work of the modernisation committee which chair we establish the committee to rebuild trust in politic raise standard improve culture and make parliament more effective in recent year the role of an mp have change significantly with many more demand and expectation in the constituency the make up of the commons have change great deal too many more party be represent and member well reflect the country we serve so how we do thing need to change too thank all of those who contribute to our wide range call for view work be already under way with the standards committee inquiry on members outside employment and the procedure committee inquiry on proxy vote and call list today we have set out three further area for consideration improve accessibility ensure that the chamber remain the crucible of national debate and how we can provide more certainty on parliamentary business the right hon gentleman raise number of point and give list of economic statistic might give he some alternative one if may inflation be down mortgage rate be come down wage be grow at their fast rate in three year business investment be at the high level for year and the international monetary fund and the oecd be both say that britain will be europe fast grow major economy in come year he support the former prime minister not the right hon member for richmond and northallerton rishi sunak who be in his place but the one who crash the economy and send mortgage rate fly and inflation to record high so will not take lecture from he yet again the right hon gentleman raise the attorney general quite honestly the way in which the conservatives and their friend in the right wing medium be try to undermine the attorney general be pathetic they be once the party of law and order and now they seek to undermine law and order at every turn as someone who work closely with the attorney general can tell the right hon gentleman that he be an asset to the government and formidable partner in our attempt to restore integrity to how we make and implement law in this country the conservatives law do not fit that remit and that be why in many case they never get off the ground they be challenge time and again in the court waste everyone time and money and not deliver the outcome that they want we will not take lecture from they on that the shadow leader of the house do not want to talk about the substance of the border security asylum and immigration bill which we debate this week that be because the previous government lose control of our border net migration rise to record high of almost million in their last year in office and small boat crossing increase by one hundredfold to be fair to he he know that the rwanda plan be gimmick and would not work he say as much when he resign as minister but be at loss as to why he and conservative front benchers vote against give the border security command new counter terrorism power and other measure they be chase the tail of reform so much that they be go around in dizzying circle leave the incredible sight of the modern conservative party voting against strengthen our border also notice that the right hon gentleman do not take up my invitation last week to celebrate the leader of the opposition first day in office early this week however he do mark the anniversary of another leader be elect those be the day be they back then the tory party know what it stand for back when it be serious party and represent large part of the country be not sure margaret thatcher would even recognise the conservative party today it be no wonder the conservatives herald and respect their former leader far more than their current leader let we be honest like their current leader their party be shadow of its former self woman centre provide vital support for woman face issue include isolation domestic abuse health problem and navigate the social security system among wide range of other support recently visit stockport women centre and want to place on the record my thank to all the staff and volunteer there who support woman from across stockport can we have debate in government time on the enormous contribution of organisation that support woman in our society in particular woman centre across england and on how to secure the essential funding they need to continue their important work join my hon friend in congratulate the woman refuge in stockport on the work it do he will know that this government be commit to tackle violence against woman and girl and that we want to halve those statistic over the next year that be huge ambition and will take detailed and committed work which know he will join we in do as we now know local government be be reorganise and the labour government have cancel local election while affect council work out how on earth they will reorganise themselves like many resident in these area would have hop that that plan would have be in place before the election be cancel many issue be very much up in the air and the public deserve to know what they be in for in woking for example successive conservative administration at the council rack up billion of debt with absolutely no plan for how to pay it off in greater essex conservative run thurrock run up debt of around billion largely due to investment in solar farm that do not exist with both essex and surrey now on the fast track for local government reorganisation what will happen to those debt last week the minister for local government and english devolution the hon member for oldham west chadderton and royton jim mcmahon write letter to all the leader of the two tier council and unitary authority in essex in which he say there be no proposal for council debt to be address centrally or write off as part of reorganisation proposal should reflect the extent to which the implication of this can be manage locally will the leader of the house ask the minister to come forward with statement to confirm that what he really mean be that resident across place such as essex and surrey will be force to pay for the incompetence of previous tory administration of other council and that they be likely to see reduced service and high council tax bill simply because this labour government be determined to press ahead with local government reorganisation but not prepared to offer any financial support to alleviate that the hon lady raise the important issue of local government finance and she be right to identify the mess those finance be leave in by the previous government many council have to spend their reserve on statutory service which be not what they be intend for we see council after council go bust month after month under the previous government and many more be leave in severe debt like the one she have describe we have give local government significant settlement this year but we recognise that more need to be do we need to fix the long term problem we need multi year settlement know the transition will be difficult but the devolution revolution give local area more say and more power over how they spend and raise their revenue will in time lead to more secure and sustainable funding for local government will ensure the relevant minister come to this house with regular update at the stroke of pen tory lead northumberland county council be about to wipe people off the county housing waiting list my office be beset by constituent in desperate need of secure and affordable accommodation but even those in the high priority banding be often unable to get the housing they need this be simple callous attempt to massage the huge housing list rather than deal with the issue can we have debate in government time on how to ensure that those in need of decent affordable housing be not easily cast aside and throw on to the scrap heap as in the case of northumberland county council be really sorry to hear about what have happen with northumberland county council and its housing waiting list my hon friend be absolutely right to identify that waiting list be far too high and that many people be in desperate need of affordable social or council housing that be why the government be really committed to not just build million new home over the course of the parliament but ensure that we have very many more council house affordable house and social house we announce further plan on that this week and will ensure that minister be accountable on

it receive the recognition that they deserve certainly recognise the issue that my hon friend have raise and know that you mr speaker will share some of his view be not speak for you of course but know that we all want to recognise the valuable contribution that rugby league make to our community and our country it be indeed surprise that rugby league player have not be honour in the way that

charitable fundraising and he be definitely someone think we should all consider shall ensure that the power that be have hear my hon friend comment and will help he to make representation let just say as have be tempt into the conversation that have raise this matter with the prime minister because there be major injustice in the stigma attach to rugby league and the fact that not one player

citizenship we have strengthen those rule in small way for those who arrive on small boat so that they also will not be able to become british citizen it be important that we take away some of the

on the first syllable and instead ask for debate member oh it take while instead will ask for debate on trend in defence spending during and after the cold war so that those on both side of the house have the chance to appreciate that when we be involve in serious confrontation we should not be argue about we should be argue for figure much near to the that president trump for once be right to

affirmative procedure there will be an opportunity for parliamentarian to debate and approve they before they become law when lay before the house the previous regulation to establish the scheme for people who be infect and be claim compensation under the core route make commitment on the floor of this house that those regulation would come into force by march subject to parliamentary approval would welcome the support of the house in approve those regulation enable we to deliver compensation to those who deserve it as quickly as possible be fully aware of how important it be to the house and to the many victim of this appalling scandal that the government provide clear and regular update on our progress in establish the infected blood compensation scheme have therefore come before the house today to explain the step that have be take and what they mean once approve by parliament and in force the infected blood compensation scheme regulations will provide ibca with the power it need to begin make payment to eligible affected people by way of reminder those affect include partner parent child sibling and in some instance carer those people have suffer terribly from the impact of infected blood on their love one and these regulation mark significant milestone for they the government will do all we can to support ibca aim of the first compensation payment to eligible affected people be make before the end of this year and by lay these regulation we be step close to achieve that aim as we set out in august the infected blood compensation scheme be tariff base the tariff be intend to work in way that would be appropriate for the majority of people apply to the scheme however we know that the impact infect blood have on people life vary hugely each person experience be unique and breaking and the government recognise that there be some exceptional case where the level of compensation offer through the core route do not sufficiently address person individual circumstance for that reason the government have provide for high level of compensation for specific award through the supplementary route where people can demonstrate their eligibility the regulation have lay before parliament set out the detail of that supplementary route once in force the regulation will allow ibca to make payment to eligible people through both the core and supplementary route all applicant will need to go through their initial core route assessment before apply to the supplementary route but do so will not delay payment of that initial core compensation offer the regulation have lay propose to restate and consolidate the infected blood compensation scheme regulations which be approve by parliament in october last year we have do that primarily for reason of simplicity have single set of regulation that consolidate the provision mean that it have be possible to cover all compensation route for all eligible people in single place alongside the draft regulation yesterday we publish an accompany explanatory memorandum and equality impact assessment we also update the compensation scheme explainer on have hear from the community the importance of simple document so commit today to the publishing of wide simple document have already engage with several hon and right hon member across the house in recent day and will continue to do so on the substance of these regulation in the come week would also like to welcome the progress be make in deliver compensation in addition to the over billion of interim compensation payment that have be pay so far ibca have now invite people to claim compensation so far offer have be make total over million and offer have be accept and pay total over million ibca remain on track to invite people to apply by the end of march and it will continue to publish its monthly statistic on its website however this be only the beginning and there be much more work to do this week ibca set out its plan to open the compensation service in stage to make sure it be effective and secure for all those claim this decision be take independently of the government by the ibca board the group that ibca will work through as it build the claim service will be as follow the first will be people who be live infected and be already register with support scheme ibca already have the detail of those people through the infected blood support scheme and it begin make payment to this group in ibca intend to accelerate the number of claim it be process from april the second stage will be people make supplementary claim the regulation be lay provide ibca with the ability to process these claim as ibca develop its service this will it to process the different type of evidence need for supplementary claim and allow people to settle their claim in full as quickly as possible people who have register estate be in the third group ibca have set out this be where an estate have already be verify as eligible for compensation through the interim payment scheme that announce in october last year this will ensure that significant compensation can reach multiple people who could include both those who be infect and those who be affect people who be affect and link to register infected person or register estate will be in the fourth group if an infected person or an estate be register this will allow ibca to progress an affected person claim more quickly the fifth group that the service will be develop for be people who be infect but not register with support scheme the sixth group will be people who be either apply on behalf of an infected person who have not previously be register with an infected blood support scheme or people who be affect and not link to register claim ibca expect that it may take slightly long to work through the claim of people who have not previously be register for compensation the ibca board assure that this be in no way intend as prioritisation of different claimant but be the good way of build the service so that ibca can get to the point where it can progress all claim as quickly as possible crucially it do not mean that all claim in each group need to be finish before develop and open the service for the next group ibca have communicate its decision on its website and through the regular community update and it have write to member of the infected blood community and right hon and hon member with whom it have previously engage to inform they of its plan determine these grouping be heavy responsibility and be pleased that ibca seek feedback from the infected blood community in reach this decision the community must after all be keep at the centre of all this work while the roll out of the scheme be an operational decision for ibca as an independent body fully support its commitment to move forward as swiftly as possible and be encourage to see the dedication of its staff and leadership in my visit to the organisation last month as compensation application increase know that ibca be determined to ensure payment be make to people as soon as possible will set out more detail on this in due course but it will include key performance indicator that ibca will be work towards to make sure that compensation claim be deal with effectively and efficiently of course decision on the parameter of and eligibility for the scheme remain one for the government subject to parliamentary approval as be set out in the regulation have lay and be not impact by ibca decision let conclude by say that in lay these regulation we be one step close to have the entire infect blood compensation scheme fully establish in law understand the importance of provide an opportunity for everyone across the house to debate this matter this will be another significant moment for all those who have wait too long on january be able to meet number of representative from the community to update they on the government plan as ever find it an invaluable experience and be hugely grateful to those who share their thought and experience on my appointment to this role in july be determined to meet the first statutory deadline of august for the first set of regulation over the past seven month have be insistent to my official and the community on the importance of make sure that after year of injustice justice be now finally be deliver and compensation rightly be pay the budget announce billion of funding for this compensation scheme show the scale of this government commitment to concrete action hope parliamentarian across both houses will support the regulation so we can finally focus solely on deliver compensation to those who have wait for justice for far too long commend this statement to this house remind the minister that statement should be limit to minute and that it be courteous to let the speaker office know if statement will exceed this time the opposition will of course be allocate additional time call the shadow minister thank the minister for his very thorough statement and for advance sight of it want to start by thank the campaigner and victim who have spend year push for justice for this terrible tragedy that occur over number of decade the previous conservative government take the first step towards recognise the horrific wrong inflict on so many patient and their loved one in opening and conclude the inquiry into the infected blood scandal but particular acknowledgement must go to my right hon friend the member for salisbury john glen who work so hard when he be paymaster general to make sure that victim and their family could at last receive some degree of justice welcome the progress the government have make since the election parliamentary politic inevitably focus on division and there be plenty on which we profoundly disagree with the government but on this matter we speak as one there be nothing of substance that the right hon gentleman and his department be do that be meaningfully different from what we would have do if we have still be in government we will of course review the legislation on the next stage of the infected blood compensation scheme but the minister and all who be campaign for justice can be assure that we will support the government in their effort we welcome the start of compensation payment by ibca but we know that victim have raise concern about the pace of processing application for compensation hope the minister can confirm what measure he be put in place to ensure that the processing capacity within the authority be adequate and that application processing can be speed up because the next phase of the compensation framework will mean that application to the authority could increase by ten of thousand all victim and their family need to know what be be do to ensure that those claim can be process at pace be concern by report that only very small fraction of those who may be eligible to claim compensation have be contact so far one estimate put it as low as of possible claimant although recognise that such estimate can sometimes be out of date hope the minister will be able to provide some clarity on the percentage of those believe to be eligible who have be contact so far know that the minister will understand the need for the government to communicate clearly to all who may be eligible to encourage they to apply that reinforce the importance that must be place on processing claim quickly those who be eligible must have confidence that their claim will be accurately and quickly process so that they receive the payment they be entitle to as soon as possible appreciate of course the stag manner in which the authority be take claim and the need to prioritise certain claim but hope the government can reiterate clearly that no one need to worry about the capacity within the authority and the system particularly in relation to claim that will be process in the later stage ask the minister to offer some clarity on his assessment of whether the funding allocate so far will cover all the expect claim we know that up to relative could apply for compensation as result of the plan expansion of claim eligibility while the government understandably can not provide an exact estimate of the total funding require that would go some way to offer reassurance to victim and their family that the funding for the authority to compensate in full all who suffer harm or loss and for all the operational requirement of the authority be properly provide for all of we in this house understand the scale and damage of this scandal and recognise the immense effort of victim and their family in push for justice and we welcome the laying of the regulation conclude by repeat my assurance on behalf of his majesty opposition that we will work with the government to ensure that everyone who be eligible be aware and that they receive the compensation that they need and deserve as quickly as possible will make sure that your stricture about time be properly communicate across government madam deputy speaker may start by echo the comment of the hon member for kingswinford and south staffordshire mike wood about my predecessor as paymaster general the right hon member for salisbury john glen who do so much in government to push this forward just as offer cross party support when shadow he the continued cross party support today be very important in respect of the speed at which we be able to push forward with the legal framework we be put in place on the issue of speed be restless for progress while ibca be of course an arm length body and have operational independence will none the less have more to say in due course about key performance indicator as the house will want to continue to raise the speed of payment be make to constituent entirely agree with the hon gentleman comment about clarity of communication be forever emphasise the need for simple explainer document on what be complex regulation finally the government have already allocate billion in funding for the operation of ibca and for compensation and we be commit to compensate all the victim of this terrible scandal welcome my right hon friend statement and the progress he have make in seven month not least on the billion he secure in the budget he deserve credit for that it be regrettable that we lose year from sir brian langstaff second interim report in which he give his final recommendation on compensation state that the government have no reason to delay set up the compensation process know my right hon friend be aware that there be still concern about the tariff particularly among those infect with hepatitis and those who endure unethical testing do he agree that while we must move ahead with all haste to get people the justice they deserve ibca must have flexibility in its decision when deal with those who feel that the tariff do not recognise the suffering they have endure pay tribute to my hon friend for the work he do as chair of the all party parliamentary group on haemophilia and contaminate blood obviously the tariff be set on the basis of the expert group chair by sir jonathan montgomery and compliment he on the work he do in that regard however the tariff and the scheme also recognise particular individual circumstance and case that be more complex that be why the supplemental route be be put in place would add that see when visit ibca understand that my hon friend will be visit shortly the sympathetic compassionate approach be take with regard to evidence give how long ago so much of this happen call liberal democrat spokesperson thank the minister for advance sight of his statement the liberal democrats be glad to see the introduction of this legislation and the extension of the infected blood compensation scheme this scandal be chilling story of people be fail not only by the medical professional who treat they but by the nhs that should have be responsible for the safety of their treatment and by series of government who should have prevent the scandal from ever take place we be glad that the new regulation will move the victim both those infect and those affected close to long overdue justice however we be deeply concerned by the speed at which victim have be receive compensation with only people have be invite to claim by december last year it be right that the government be now widen the scheme so that compensation reach many more people as soon as possible it be also crucial that there be mechanism in place to ensure that the concern of the charity organisation and affected individual be hear to that end and to provide confidence to victim and their family will the minister outline timeline for when all victim can expect to have receive their long overdue compensation furthermore will the government introduce duty of candour on public official so that such scandal be never repeat the hon lady be absolutely right that this scandal go across decade and across government while compensation be obviously one of the crucial recommendation there be total of recommendation from sir brian langstaff on which will be update the house in due course at present ibca will meet its target of people by the end of next month the approach it be take be one of test and learn that enable ibca to scale up more quickly to be able to do what we all want it to do which be to get compensation as quickly as reasonably possible to those who need it would expect the first payment to the affect to begin before the end of this year finally on the duty of candour which be another of sir brian langstaff recommendation expect to be introduce legislation to this house on that before april which of course be the hillsborough anniversary thank my right hon friend for his statement want to focus on what he say about the progress be make in deliver compensation for victim and their family recently meet constituent of mine sue sparkes who lose her husband les owe to infected blood in she be concerned that it will take many many year to make all these payment do not doubt my right hon friend commitment and passion on this issue to tackle injustice and deliver the culture change that be need but will he assure sue and that every lever of government be be pull to ensure that all payment to infect and affected individual be make as matter of urgency can certainly give that assurance both to my hon friend and to his constituent sue the government will continue to push this forward as quickly as be reasonably possible be conscious of the strength of feeling and be also conscious that victim have wait decade for justice and that need for speed be recognise across government every member of this house should welcome this statement as certainly do as there be no great horror imaginable than become chronically sick as result of what ought to be routine medical procedure blood transfusion will the right hon gentleman follow on from the previous question ensure that these matter be deal with promptly will he reflect on what the report into these matter describe as institutional failure the national audit office look at compensation for range of scandal and conclude there be no central coordinate approach when government set up new compensation scheme result in relatively slow ad hoc approach the report recommend that the cabinet office review its arrangement to allow compensation scheme to begin and operate in more timely and effective manner when the minister return to the house will he reflect on that recommendation and perhaps say to the house what the government will do in response the right hon gentleman make powerful point and what be crucial whether it be this compensation scheme or other that have be run by government be that we learn the lesson between the different compensation scheme and we learn good practice absolutely agree with he that that be crucial with this compensation scheme too thank the minister for his statement brian heatlie haemophiliac be give infected blood product in at the age of five as result he die in at the age of his devoted parent lynda and james from new mills in my constituency of high peak have be wait year for compensation and they be now in their can the minister confirm that the new regulation will mean that it may be possible for victim who have lose love one in this scandal such as lynda and james to receive both their own compensation and compensation for the estate of their love one think speak for the whole house in send our sympathy to lynda and james for the indescribable sense of loss and the experience that they have be through over so many year the answer to my hon friend question be yes these consolidated regulation be for the estate of infected people but also for the affected too but know and the whole house would agree that no amount of money can make up for that awful experience thank the minister most sincerely for his statement nobody in the house be not reassure by what he have say he also refer to the regional administrations and how this will affect they and he have have those discussion with they there be report today that only of eligible family member have be contact about the scheme and there be concern that the scheme do not have the capacity to cope with the number of potential applicant can the minister outline how he will ensure that there be capacity for all those family to have sense of recognition and to be definite about form of restitution first in term of number as indicate ibca be operate test and learn approach that then allow it to scale up it will scale up its capacity alongside that to ensure that it have the capacity it require to process the claim as indicate visit ibca last month can already see that scale up start to take place and the hon member can certainly give assurance to his constituent that the government will continue to do all we can to ensure the swift delivery of compensation thank my right hon friend for today update my west dunbartonshire constituent fiona be infect with hepatitis follow blood transfusion in and fiona be apparently not entitle to any form of support or compensation payment because of miss medical record and because of receive transfusion both before and after the cut off relate to screen for hepatitis will the minister agree to meet my constituent and to discuss this matter and ensure that she and other affect in similar circumstance apparently small number can receive compensation and justice under this labour government generally with regard to evidence the infected blood compensation authority have say that when an individual be invite to make their claim it will aim to gather some of the information include medical record and information about an applicant condition and severity from organisation that already have it that should mean that those claim will be ask for the least amount of information possible know that ibca be currently consider what guidance can be provide for people ahead of make claim on the specific case of my hon friend constituent fiona if he send the detail be more than happy to look into it may thank the minister for the thoroughness and thoughtfulness with which he have make his statement think he would agree that there be still issue around speed quantum flexibility and care be right in think that ibca do not have any flexibility about the amount of damage pay if so can he give rough indication of what sort of compensation be pay when someone have lose their life as result of be poison by the nhs be it the case that people have to make an individual settlement and agreement on what they will accept if so be there any professional support that someone who might be quite ill can get before sign on the dotted line and possibly sign away their right to more compensation than they might otherwise receive on the right hon gentleman point about tariff they have be set out and publish there be then assessment to be make about severity within the tariff band there be also as have indicate the supplementary route for more complex case can not give he single figure across these case as they obviously vary but the house will gradually see the overall amount be publish by ibca on the right hon gentleman second point victim make an application to the ibca will be give particular claim manager meet the first claim manager only in recent week to speak to and guide they through the process which be crucial know that the culture imbue by sir robert francis be an enable one about help victim particularly with evidence have also sign off both legal support and financial support because it be about receive what be in many case life change sum of money may first thank my right hon friend for the update despite his sterling effort really mean that the process have take far too long victim be die at the rate of two per week never have see the compensation they deserve victim be very much unaware of and desperate to understand what and how much compensation they might even be due under the process can the minister say how many of the infected victim will be invite to apply to the scheme during have he consider or be there potential to consider allow victim to take support scheme payment as lump sum without any reduction on people have sense of the amount of money they will get the government publish explainer document in august last year and in recent day that be on the government website the infected blood compensation authority be intend to publish compensation calculator for the infected core award by the end of march on my hon friend other point the number of victim pay will be regularly publish by the ibca during the course of the year the payment to the infected have start and expect payment to the affect to begin before the end of the year as regard the support scheme one change that the government make be to allow both lump sum payment and the continuation of the support scheme that come through from the consultation that sir robert francis undertake during the general election campaign have make that change to the scheme and how that work precisely be set out in the explainer document be grateful to the paymaster general for the update indeed be grateful that he have give several update to the house my north east fife constituent be infect number of year ago and involve in the campaign for long time he have share concern about the evidential standard expect of claimant particularly in relation to medical record indeed his lawyer have tell that they have concern that case manager be not correctly interpret the initial date of infection because medical record be not available to substantiate that they also have concern that the australia antigen have not be properly understand as an indicator of hbv be the paymaster general aware of those concern can he comment on they the hon lady be entirely right to raise the issue of evidence there be the specific issue that she refer to but there be also far more general problem about incident often be from long time ago we also know that in some case there be deliberate destruction of record the level of evidence be therefore clearly significant issue as have indicate when visit the ibca hear from claim manager about the approach they be take and the culture that be be imbue an enable culture and about how the ibca will aim to gather some of the information to assist victim which think will be vital part of the process welcome my right hon friend statement and his commitment to this issue will he say little more about how he be work with colleague in scotland to drive forward the final compensation scheme share the concern already express by hon member across the house about the need for speed in ensure that victim receive the compensation that they so rightly deserve assure my hon friend that work closely with the devolved administration on the issue of compensation there be broad point as well event that take place in the and beyond occur in the pre devolution age over the next few month as we look to implement the rest of sir brian langstaff recommendation partnership work with the devolved administration will become even more important thank the paymaster general for an advance copy of his statement recognise his sincerity and the hard work that he and his colleague be put into progress this vital compensation scheme also understand the need for he and his colleague to take small initial step to test their system and process but as other have say legal representative fear that many will die while they wait and justice delay be justice deny do he really think that be good enough give the number involve will he consider strengthen the authority team who be process these claim so that the pace can be rapidly accelerate and so that they can meet the forthcoming key performance indicator to which he refer finally the last time we speak about the scheme in the chamber he undertake to look at the role of voluntary organisation that provide vital support to claimant and to consider put funding for they on statutory basis will he comment on that as well please on the hon gentleman first point he mention and my colleague but of course ibca be an arm length body it be operationally independent so it take operationally independent decision on how good to pay out the money to as many people as possible as quickly as possible as say it have decide to adopt test and learn approach to make that possible one of sir brian langstaff recommendation be that we look at support for voluntary organisation that will be cover in an update that will give to the house in due course on all recommendation however give the hon gentleman the general assurance that be and will continue to be restless for progress on his point about ibca scale up and have more staff and claim manager that be precisely what it be do at the moment thank the minister for his statement and update in stafford eccleshall and the village have constituent janet who be in her she tragically lose she first and second husband to infect blood and she be due to receive compensation as their next of kin she would like to ensure that she can pass the payment on to their child who as the minister rightly say be victim too however she have be advise that if that happen it would constitute secondary transfer and be subject to inheritance tax we be talk about people who lose their father and stepfather to this issue will he meet to explore whether solution can be find in these case first should say for clarity that all ibca payment make to those in the uk will be exempt from income tax capital gain tax and inheritance tax anyone who be in direct receipt of compensation from ibca or be beneficiary of an estate to which compensation be pay on behalf of the deceased do not need to pay income tax capital gain tax or inheritance tax on the amount that they receive be aware of the concern that my hon friend be talk about that be slightly different situation if she write to with the detail of the case will be more than happy to look into it thank the paymaster general not only for his statement but for the clarity and commitment in his answer as he may remember from previous occasion in the chamber have the personal experience of have lose very close family friend in the who be victim of this his widow die without compensation and his child be now among those wait to hear what will happen thank the minister for his application and commitment but as other have mention there remain the issue of speed and good practice go forward he mention that he will simplify the process can we have update from he in future on what the government be do to examine good practice and how can future victim of such scandal be assure that they will not have to wait as long as year as on the last occasion express my sympathy to the hon lady for the loss of her family friend back in the of course be always look to share good practice as say moment ago to the right hon member for south holland and the deepings sir john hayes who be no long in his place that be vital can also give the hon lady the undertaking that will

countless individual and group from the early effort of campaigner in the quietly seek the recommendation of lord wolfenden and see they make into law to the loud protest against section in the and the move fight for marriage equality in the these people have not only drive change but enrich our society the stonewall riot in america be landmark moment in the global fight for equality from then on unapologetic visibility and authenticity would be the banner under which people would organise those lesson be learn and be adapt to the uk where we have our own history of struggle for equality our first pride march be hold in when few hundred brave soul wound their way from hyde park to trafalgar square the trepidation those individual must have experience may be hard for many of we today to imagine yet alongside their trepidation there must also have be strong sense of action achievement and community it be undoubtedly that sense of community that play part in one of the more colourful moment in our history some year ago in this very building in an inverse of it rain men number of lesbian abseil their way from the public gallery on to the benches of the other place in

prime minister in coalition with the liberal democrats who introduce same sex marriage into law albeit heavily dependent on labour vote on that point give special thank to baroness featherstone the then liberal democrat equalities minister who push through the marriage same sex couples act with tireless effort however in recent year that consensus have begin to fray increasingly voice across society and this chamber be push division anxiety and apprehension while the tone of debate on right have always be contentious the level of toxicity have perhaps never be so intense our answer to this must be to lead by example and conduct ourselves in measure consider and respectful language it be vital that we regardless of party or position promote tone and quality of debate that while at time may provoke impassioned disagreement refuse to lower itself to the politic of division and anxiety for decade labour in government have seek to advance the right protection and opportunity of people and this government be no different take for example conversion practice we know that they be abuse that they do not work and that they leave legacy of painful memory and last mental health problem the previous government do nothing to ban this abhorrent practice this government will be different that be why we commit to publish draft legislation in the king speech detail our plan to introduce fully trans inclusive ban on conversion practice of course while it be important that we protect people from these abusive practice the government have be clear that any ban must not cover legitimate psychological support treatment or non directive counselling it must also respect the important role that teacher religious leader parent and carer can play in support those explore their sexual orientation or gender identity in our manifesto we also commit to modernising simplify and reform gender recognition law while uphold the equality act and its provision on single sex exception we will remove indignity for trans people who deserve support and acceptance while retain the need for diagnosis of gender dysphoria from specialist doctor we will set out our next step on this work

health and care excellence the finding be echo in the cass review and in accompany systematic review conduct by the university of york which find insufficient evidence to support the safety or clinical effectiveness of puberty blocker for adolescent there be clear time for this order to be review in well quality evidence be critical if the nhs be to provide reliable transparent information

those pupil who be the object of such comment in the way that they should have be protect should have do more today the notion that an family be pretend be absurd to most nowadays it be not uncommon to find same sex parent pick up their child from school appreciate the minister apology but to have take such stance would have mean she lose her job although we can always reflect and do well in hindsight we have to be kind to ourselves and give ourselves the space to be able to see the grace in ourselves as well thank my hon friend for her very kind comment on the issue even today it do not mean that there be no challenge come out particularly to family or classmate be still challenge and scary with all the worry of how it might be perceive and the fear of bullying in the previous

amazing job absolutely thank the hon lady with whom have the pleasure of co chair the all party parliamentary group on woman in parliament these stigma these mindset these myth have divide people and

the village have to travel many mile to brighton or crawley to get test for my young constituent the problem may relate to lack of transport or connectivity isolation or loneliness or simply not have

all call the chair of the women and equalities committee it be always an honour to take part in this annual debate commemorate celebrate and protest for history month will start by say that be incredibly disappointed that there be not more member of the house present to hear what know will be really informative heartfelt genuine debate the theme for history month this year be activism and social change but give what the community be face at the moment in the medium and in political rhetoric perhaps more appropriate theme would be survival and existence we see powerful people rich people at home and abroad punch down refer to the lgbt community as woke snowflake weak and fragile any of we know that the community be far from all those thing because fight for who you be and to love who you want to love in the face of hatred humiliation and persecution be one of the brave thing any of we could ever do the trans community have to live every day in body that do not reflect who they truly be that be courage and all against backdrop of conversation about they without they particularly for tran man some of the strong least snowflake people could ever have in my life be from the lgbt community be so proud to call they my friend they be basically my extended family they be the family choose they fight to be who they be and they fight to exist now be go to give some personal example from when be perhaps at my weak as straight woman rely on that community and my friend to hold up because they have the strength when do not when be in my use to go out out as miley cyrus say use to be young on one night be out out with one of my gay good friend and my non binary friend we have go to gay club because unsurprisingly and for reason that can not possibly put my finger on feel safe and able to have more fun in gay nightclub than do in straight club as year old single woman of that time can not think why that might be we be on our way home and we want chip and kebab standard right in the queue be group of lad they start give abuse with sexual connotation and be myself do not shut up do not take that lie down give as good as be get they go ahead and all of sudden when we come out with our chip and kebab could feel thing hit my head they be throw chip at we those chip suddenly become punch to my face and they push to the ground who stand up and fight for my gay good friend and my non binary friend take on five bloke for do not stop fight either but they be there when need they have work across different community on various campaign particularly human right campaign and when have lose those campaign my dear friend paul have be there to pick up when be cry and break and think could not carry on he show the importance of that because of his experience of fighting for equality throughout the and the and unfortunately in my dear friend helgi be one of the first out lgbt council member of the royal college of anaesthetists have speak quite often in this place about the multiple miscarriage have experience could not have find myself at dark time than do then he be there in the surgery to hold my hand and help through one of the most difficult procedure to remove two of the baby that do not make it out he be my friend and be there when wake up that be the strength of the community that be the strength of allyship right now they be the one be attack they be the one feel isolated they be the one feel without hope so make plea to every ally and to everybody to use their voice to stand up for the many who have use their voice to stand up for our right our dignity and our future we have an election last year and be so proud that my first official engagement be pride in luton every year it get big and well and there be more supporter more attendee and more fun take my family with and my then four year old ask what pride mummy say pride be celebration but it also protest she say okay say pride be protest and celebration of people love who they want to love and be who they be her reaction be okay and she shrug we have the good time ever and hope that pride long continue but we do not get here without fight over decade ago the previous labour government introduce some fantastic measure they remove the terrible section from the statute book pass law allow trans people to legally change their gender and introduce the equality act to protect people from discrimination labour also lift the ban on lesbian gay man and bi people serve in the armed force introduce civil partnership which give credit to the previous conservative government pave the way for same sex marriage and bring in law to allow unmarried couple include same sex couple to apply for joint adoption be pleased that we have that legacy and foundation to build on but build on it we must the plan propose in the labour manifesto be to deliver trans inclusive ban on conversion practice be pleased that the minister confirm at the women and equalities committee yesterday that the ban will be trans inclusive she give her commitment on that we need to ensure that hate crime constitute an aggravate offence in the same way as other hate crime offence we need to bring forward new hiv action plan and be glad that many hon member have speak about that already we need to right the wrong endure by veteran which know this government be take aim at modernise the law on gender recognition fix the nhs and recruit more mental health worker all those be brave and laudable aim but one thing that have be miss be timeframe schedule for when all these fantastic plan will be put into place when will the community be able to feel the benefit of these laudable and beneficial aim we have see many member of that community feel scared it be not just about look across the pond and see that their existence have be completely wipe out by president trump and the rich man in the world there be also feeling that there be rowing back in the uk want we to address some of the issue and hope the minister will be able to explain perhaps in writing where we be on some of these point the indefinite ban on puberty blocker for young trans people have be mention the women and equalities committee hold an inquiry and be proud to say that although there be diverse opinion among committee member be pleased to see some of they here and the witness themselves the debate be conduct with dignity and respect with evidence and with willingness to try to understand which have all too long be missing can not yet say what recommendation will come out because will get into trouble but we need to be part of solution it be not just about point out what the problem be although the minister say that the use of puberty blocker pose unclear risk of harm we need to look at the unclear risk of harm from not be able to provide healthcare for trans people when they need it what can be do to mitigate some of those harm we have talk about vitamin calcium healthy diet and all the thing that would address some of the concern about puberty blocker why be it that the ban be explicitly only for their use in treat people with gender dysphoria why be it safe for people with endometriosis prostate cancer or precocious prepubescence to take puberty blocker but not for those experience gender dysphoria the women and equalities committee hear evidence from endocrinologist with brain the size of small planet which be incredibly informative there be much work to be do but we need to ensure that it be do fairly inclusively and with the community not against it there be also plan to reform the gender recognition act to make it easy for tran people to change their legal gender know that the minister for women and equalities my right hon friend the member for oxford east anneliese dodds call the process intrusive outdated and humiliating in that be just as true today as it be then and would welcome an update from the minister on when the gra will be review while we all debate this issue people be be isolate far they be be target and talk about which be come through clear in the statistic the number of hate crime against people increase from in to in that increase be huge and it affect real people life there be also huge amount of under reporting because we know that only one in eight victim report homophobic or transphobic hate crime to the police we need to build up society trust in the government to protect the most vulnerable from such crime we have lot of work to do ban conversion therapy have receive cross party support and look forward to find out when we will see timeline for the ban to come into force as we hear in the women and equalities committee yesterday we need to commit to make it tran inclusive and would be grateful if that commitment could be reiterate from the dispatch box today when will minister commit to timeline for bring forward the plan to make anti lgbt hate crime an aggravated offence we have speak about the new hiv action plan and building on the work of the previous government and be really pleased that we have that it be wonderful to see the prime minister casually take an hiv test which be not something that we would have see in the past the minister and the shadow minister speak eloquently about the stigma around hiv as do my hon friend the member for harlow chris vince tackle that stigma be so important but it be really difficult to break it down when those in power continue to punch down we have see that with president trump devastating cut to usaid which have leave million across the world without access to lifesave antiretroviral what will the uk do to fill the gap as we have see in the us progress be never inevitable hope this government can address the concern of the lgbtqi community and of those who want to live in society free from persecution and barrier to healthcare service and safety we must stay united in the fight because an attack on one of we be an attack on all and hatred never stay in one lane for long call the liberal democrat spokesperson it be pleasure and an honour to follow the hon member for luton north sarah owen concur with everything she say about the work be do by the women and equalities committee it be important to recognise where we stand in history because when we talk about lgbtq right woman right or racial equality in this place we often talk about the journey that we have be on and what we have achieve yes we have achieve lot but we face enormous challenge at this moment in our history our country lgbtq community need to look at we today and know that we will stand up for they and that we will fight for their right include their right simply to be who they be but we have face challenge before and we have overcome they think of scotland particularly my home city of glasgow where be bring up in the and when be student in the it have unfortunately garner for itself the unenviable reputation of be one of the bad place in europe to grow up gay attitude be somehow more polarised in scotland than anywhere else in the uk in poll show that more than of scot do not want homosexuality to be decriminalise the figure be in england in prepare for this debate find an article in student newspaper from the university of liverpool whose student union disaffiliate with the university of glasgow because it refuse to allow gay society to form accord to the union president that refusal be on the ground that the age of consent for homosexual sex be and give that most student be young than the union do not want to give the impression that the union in some way bestow an unofficial blessing on their activity many member of the gay society be not interested in constructive approach to change the membership attitude but use this as ploy to gain momentum to destroy the character of the union as we know it we hear an echo of that language today but imagine how young lgbt people must have feel hear and read it that be the kind of attitude they face on daily basis and imagine if we have be able to tell they that year later glasgow would be in the top five place in europe for lgbt people to visit and enjoy and that despite those attitude long rich history have develop of the community across scotland come together to support each other we have improve so much as those figure show edinburgh befrienders later know as the lothian gay and lesbian switchboard open in and be the uk first bespoke helpline for gay and lesbian people beat switchboard which still exist by just one day edinburgh be also home to scotland first lgbt bookshop lavender menace and in welcome people to scotland first pride march it be now huge the event of the year and have be privileged to speak at it twice of course much of this change have be possible only because of public figure include former mps such as robin cook who equalise scots law and english law on homosexuality val mcdermid whose novel report for murder feature lindsay gordon britain first fictional lesbian detective and award win author jackie kay the second woman and first lesbian to hold the post of makar scotland national poet and whose work have deal with race gender transgender identity and her own sexuality thank to such people and place so many attitude law and the understanding of people have change for the well the age of consent be finally equalise for gay and straight people in england scotland and wales in same sex couple be recognise for the first time in with civil partnership in the same year trans people gain formal recognition in law for the first time with the gender recognition act and year ago same sex couple gain the right to adopt my party its politician and activist play key role in that fight as for the fight for right be not just another political issue but like the fight for all human right be part of who be what believe and what my party stand for as have already be mention it be thank to the allyship and hard work of my noble friend baroness featherstone that in hundred of thousand of campaigner and activist across the country finally have their voice hear with the achievement of marriage equality for same sex couple however sometimes think that focus on the success of the lgbt right movement in the uk lead we to think that everything have be easy that progress come without any great effort and that it be quick and natural we forget the negative we forget the fight we have to go through and our country moment of shame shame be the only word for the treatment of gay man like alan turing who be imprison chemically castrate and sham for his sexuality shame be the only word for the fact that before anyone could be dismiss from the armed force simply for be gay shame be the only word for the public distrust indeed hatred that many gay man face during the aids crisis grow up during that crisis and the fear and stigma be sometimes palpable and despite the public solidarity and support from many lesbian group it continue and of course shame be the only word to describe the last impact of section on whole generation of young lgbt people who be not allow to see themselves represent in school or have appropriate protection from homophobic bullying we may think that these negative be all in the past but in recent year we have see horrible debate on lgbt right particularly tran right and they have become increasingly toxic many trans people see their identity denigrate their experience ignore and their life sideline in debate about their own right and their own life too many people forget that at the centre of these culture war be real people who simply want to live their life and be leave alone to be who they be it be time that we move the debate forward it be time that we think about the people and not the politic by focus on the solution to the issue that the lgbtq community still face we must tackle the growth in hate crime the misogyny and objectification face by lesbian and the intersectional issue face by black and minority ethnic or disabled lgbtq people be delighted that we will hear about the government draft conversion practice ban bill soon how can we support school and business in eradicate homophobic and transphobic bullying and harassment we have to think about how we can support trans people in access well support and how we can help binary people to gain recognition in law hope that the government will address all these point and today be more confident that they will the hon member for luton north mention her daughter as hope for the future my daughter be considerably old in her couple of year ago we go to edinburgh to see play everybody talk about jamie about young cross dress guy who want to wear dress to the prom which cause all sort of hassle we go because have see the film and love it about halfway through the play begin to find the audience more interesting realise that everybody under the age of about or be totally engage in what be happen cheer for jamie and boo his opponent it be great everybody over the age of about look stunned they be look round think what go on my daughter mhairi and come out and as we walk along the road say your generation really do care do they she say no we do get it we do know why it problem and we do know why politician do see that think to myself this toxic argument which we all want to end will end because the young generation will not allow their peer to be punish for be who they be in the way that mine be thank the government for have this debate and thank everyone who be here please let we send the positive message that we will stand up and make sure that acceptance come soon it be an honour to speak in the main chamber in this parliament which as mr speaker tell we the other night at his reception be the gay parliament in the world lgbt history month have never be more need as politician of all political stripe here in the uk in europe and

long way to go would not have imagine that would still be have the same slur chuck at now as do then in argument that try to make out that people be threat to kid that be why lgbt history month be so important why our activism be so important and why always say that be an activist first and politician second we must celebrate our history and remind people that we have always be here and that trans people have always exist we also have to remember the lesson of our activism we have to remember and listen to those who live those fight and we have to learn from they in order to defend ourselves and our community from the late wave of attack over the last few year have repeatedly hear why do we need lgbt history month surely pride be not need any more and have equality go too far but people be start to understand why we still need those event the fight to protect our right never end even this week there be far too many people still make those type of comment and too many people be

abusive comment and both peter and receive horrific homophobic and lesbophobic abuse online and in real life be proud to say that peter wendy and the team be ensure that the local pride go ahead again this year and will be there but we need to see more solidarity from people in the face of such hatred and we need to ensure that there be pride event in every town and city we must tackle the rise in hate crime and in particular the huge explosion in transphobic hate crime over the last few year those attack reflect an increasingly hostile environment exacerbate by negative medium and political rhetoric not just in the us but in europe and here in the uk just last week gb news host link people to paedophilia the leader of the opposition have refer to trans people as an epidemic and as have remind she the definition of that be widespread occurrence of an infectious disease it be no wonder with language like that that under the last conservative government the number of hate crime commit on the basis of sexual orientation increase from around in to nearly in that be disgrace and be pleased that our government have promise to tackle hate crime by ensure that it constitute an aggravated offence must echo the word of the chair of the women and equalities committee my hon friend the member for luton north sarah owen it be so disappointing to see not one conservative mp on the back benches previous labour governments ensure that equality be at their heart and be so pleased that our first ever out lesbian minister my hon friend the member for wallasey dame angela eagle continue that work as minister in this government also pay tribute to the minister for equalities who be lead today debate for make sure that we have this debate in government time and for everything that she

write my speech ahead of today could not help but feel old we be here to debate history month and as woman of certain age have have the stark and daunting realisation that be so old that be part of history we be all aware of the story of now famous people who be remarkable in their own field but who live too early to enjoy the progress that we have now achieve alan turing who be mention early spring to mind in many sens his story be now legend the understanding of the role that he play in protect this country be universal that he happen to be gay should not have matter despite his service he be chemically castrate and suffer for the rest of his life it be absolutely correct that the last labour government apologise and that ture be pardon in august history month be often mark and reflect through story and today want to share just some of my story grow up in mining town in the the difference in the right that have now compare with then be strike as lesbian woman have spend my adult life fight for right it be when fight for those right that first visit this place after many year of debate and setback in june this house vote to equalise the age of consent between heterosexual and gay man as an active member of the unison city of edinburgh lesbian and gay self organise group we have be campaign for many year to end this discrimination the unison archive remind that our branch write letter to all scottish mps and mp who have link with our union it be in total on the day of the vote two of we come to this place to lobby mps in person to vote for this historic change the next big fight for our right in which be actively involve be the repeal of section or section in scotland as someone who work in local government and who have same sex partner with child see the damage that section do every single day the act mean that teacher and youth worker could not provide support to child of same sex partner or young people it result in many public sector worker particularly those in educational setting feel that they could not come out in their own workplace essentially the law say that household such as the one in which be live be just wrong when the scottish executive announce that they would repeal section there be considerable and at time vile campaign against its removal much of it finance by brian souter souter want to bankroll private referendum and campaign for people to vote no there be billboard across scotland oppose the repeal one billboard be on ferry road one of the main bus route through my home in the edinburgh north and leith constituency will never forget have to take david and zoe to school on bus and pass sign that say that our family be not real family can not put into word the anger that feel because of the worry that it create for the kid and their mum thankfully the people of scotland reject the buying of democracy by brian souter and the referendum never happen few year ago the scottish trades union congress commission book celebrate year of trade union success in scotland and as contributor write about this struggle in the book say an overarching worry for the general public be that souter be try to bankroll this referendum and campaign people do not want private rich people to be able to buy democracy know that my constituent still hold this view the following decade and half bring significant improvement to the right of people in scotland and across the uk look forward to reflect on one of those right in few week time when celebrate my first wedding anniversary with my wife in closing the struggle for lgbt right have be fight in workplace in our community in our family and across this house for decade we have have many success but sadly some people still live in fear of their life because they love someone of the same sex in this place we must continue to fight to ensure that everyone be able to love who they wish regardless of where they be bear my hope be that very soon people across the world will have the freedom that enjoy here in the uk today my hon friend the member for edinburgh north and leith tracy gilbert must have be think the same way as when she write her speech because for lgbt history month be always time to reflect on the past and at have fair bit of past on which can reflect grow up in the and be all too aware of the challenge of hiv and aids many will remember that terrify tv advert the public health campaign that be regularly play out on television the reality be that it be terrifying time as there be no cure and no real treatment aids be death sentence this in itself lead to stigmatise perception of the gay community in particular because as we all know they be disproportionately affect by the disease dr nick phillips my lecturer at perform art school be the first person meet who have aids and this be in nick have be well know in the and for his performance with the famous bloolips cabaret troupe and he have perform extensively both here in the uk and in the us it be his stint in the us that tragically see he become one of the first people to catch hiv as unfortunately do many of his friend about eight year ago see nick do touching solo performance in which he portray the heartbreak of this period for he lose so many friend while deal with his own potential mortality despite there be no treatment nick miraculously survive when many do not and he be still around today to tell the tale when first meet nick and become close friend of his have to overcome my own prejudice touch he hug he or give he peck on the cheek be one of many in the who be still absolutely petrified of this uncurable illness but nick help see that it do not have to be death sentence it also mean that could not catch it by just give he hug remember nick get really ill in and end up in hospital he be one of the first to receive the experimental treatment of combination therapy and it work nick go on to compose the touching red ribbon requiem which be perform by the royal liverpool philharmonic orchestra today he have demonstrate just how far treatment have come live normal healthy life and have naturally father two lovely twin boy fast forward to and really close friend of mine sit down to tell that he have hiv my immediate reaction be despair think that be go to lose he that he have that death sentence but he laugh at and say do worry my level be already now undetectable this be because of the wonderful medication that he be take as long as he keep take it he will go on to live normal life today more than hiv medication be available many people be able to control their hiv with just single pill day early treatment can prevent hiv positive people from get aids and the disease that it cause such as cancer hiv drug also stop people who have the virus pass it on during sex we still do not have cure for aids but with the right treatment people who be hiv positive can have normal lifespan but we must remember that hiv and aids do not just affect the community it do not discriminate like those who have be victim of the virus have be discriminate against in the past while most people have catch the disease from unprotected sex regardless of their sexuality other have contract it from infected blood from their parent during pregnancy from share needle or from be horribly rap fully support the labour government new hiv action plan to end all new hiv case in england by be pleased that there be cross party consensus on that the powerful image just this week of the prime minister of the united kingdom publicly take an hiv test on camera be wonderful take my test too and encourage everybody to do the same as we look to the future with this labour government introduce great protection for the community such as the trans inclusive ban on conversion practice and right the wrong do to lgbt veteran we would think that we would have reason to celebrate but as other have say we must be aware that among some the narrative be shift we have see our trans community under attack be make to feel non existent around the world we have see those in power in country that we normally consider progressive rowing back on right we sadly even hear such rhetoric come out of this place this week the hon member for great yarmouth rupert lowe have give he notice state that he would sack every dei officer in the nhs just this weekend he tell they on social medium how much he detest their work let we look at this stand for diversity diverse people and people from diverse background stand for equality help those diverse people to gain equality and feel equal stand for inclusion make they feel they be include in society how dare somebody say that they want to ban that we need to call these people out those who be look to push we back and take away our right make diversity irrelevant as oppose to embrace it we be diverse country and should embrace everybody whoever they be we have make huge stride forward so please let we not go back pay tribute to all the pride organisation across the country many of which be run by volunteer for their wonderful work in raise awareness and create visibility and safe space for the community particularly call attention to basildon pride where be still the chair of trustee and the wonderful southend pride which offer so much to the community long

speak about these issue with warmth compassion humanity and empathy today we have see some of the good of all party represent in the chamber the shadow minister the hon member for east grinstead and uckfield mims davies have always be voice on these issue within the conservative party the liberal democrat person the hon member for edinburgh west christine jardine have long be ahead of many in this house when it come to equality issue include be outspoken in support of the right of sex worker who must never be exclude from conversation on feminism and lgbtq equality be thrilled that we have the opportunity to discuss lgbt history month in the chamber for many reason not least because it give the opportunity to put on record just how gay nottingham be and have long be be overjoyed to learn that mansfield road where my constituency office be base be home to queer friendly cafés in the and that just down the road in st ann there be flourish lesbian pub scene nottingham also have trans meet up group all the way back in the again disprove the lie that trans people have only exist more recently and people in our city be active in the section protest in fight the aids crisis and

recognition as well as mark lgbt history month this debate coincide with hiv testing week commend the prime minister for be the first to take public hiv test at the height of the aids crisis that would have be unthinkable it demonstrate just how far we have come in this regard it be thank to activist who have fight so hard for proper treatment and funding for research and against ignorance and stigma that we be where we be today hiv be no long death sentence far from it and end the epidemic be possible unaids have set goal of and it be vital that our government play their part in help to achieve that welcome our commitment in this area although it be right that progress be celebrate it can not come at the expense of recognise where we be continue to fall short and even go backwards in some area many of the struggle of the past be also struggle of the present the community continue to face huge inequality with trans people at the sharp end include high level of homelessness discrimination at work and school an increase likelihood of experience verbal and physical abuse and yes disproportionate rate of suicide this be not hyperbole and recognise that sad reality be not in some way irresponsible life for may people be still immensely difficult we be live in an era of rise hate both here and around the world which be put more people at risk the state of politic on issue be appalling trans people have be make political football with their suffering almost consider price worth pay to score political point that make some people feel tempt think just to ignore the reality that trans people face or to try to find some kind of so call middle ground but when the conversation have be drag so far to the extreme right by anti trans activist the middle ground be far from moderate history show we that the answer be not to cede ground to the right framing it be to fight back generation of queer activist hold fast in demand their right and they win they eventually want to make clear as feminist and as woman who be not tran that be proud to stand with my trans sibling those who claim that stand up for my right as woman require roll back the right of trans people do not speak for when people with very loud voice and newspaper column tell we that there be conflict between trans right and woman right and that they be stand up for woman they be just not be honest from the abuse towards woman of colour compete in sport to cisgender lesbian be harass in bathroom attack on trans people endanger all woman who do not fit within anti trans activist ever narrow heteronormative and eurocentric parameter of womanhood far from advocate for woman right they be put they under threat whether or not they realise it they be help to usher in the far right who want to restrict woman freedom and reinforce traditional gender role we see time and again for example campaign against tran right and abortion right work hand in hand because they be part and parcel of politic be drag ever rightward entire conservative leadership contest have be fight on the basis of who can talk the tough when it come to an extremely marginalise group the conservative party have go from support gender recognition reform under the may government and promise to outlaw conversion therapy to outright oppose the first and come up with excuse to allow the second to continue be extremely sad to say that my party too have be drag in the wrong direction our policy on trans issue be bad now than it be in previous year that be the wrong approach our party must completely reject the tired narrative that trans people be threat which underpin so much of this moral panic it be not true about gay man in the and it be not true about the trans community now our approach must centre on trans people themselves and their humanity we must stand against bigotry and for human right and deliver material change such as trans inclusive conversion therapy ban the reform that we have promise in the gender recognition process proper access to gender affirm healthcare to trans people of all age include by ensure that everybody who need puberty blocker have access to they the creation of inclusive school and the expansion of affordable housing lgbt history be not just in the past it be be make every day labour be now in government and we must decide what role we want to play thank to year of campaigning by people previous labour governments take important stride in equalise the age of consent repeal section and legislate for civil partnership adoption right and gender recognition the future of the next generation of people will be shape in part at least by our party that generation will judge we on our record we still have time to make it one to be proud of want to speak directly to they to youth know that for so many of you life be really hard and your future feel uncertain there be no doubt that this chapter of history and the direction in which the world be move often feel dark but you be not alone there be so many people who love and not just accept you but celebrate you for who you be both within our community and outside it our history be one of struggle but not every chapter have be bleak we have face down bigotry and win right throughout it all queer joy have always co exist well world be possible and hope that one day the need for struggle and the feeling of darkness will have go and that our joy be all that remain until then we will keep fight thank you madam deputy speaker for call to speak in this important debate mark history month it be an honour to follow my hon friend the member for nottingham east nadia whittome one of my predecessor as mp for scarborough and whitby paul latham who be the mp from to be imprison for two year after be arrest for improper behaviour while serve in the royal artillery during the second world war his story be case study of how so often people have be hide from history as they face prejudice persecution and in the case of man who be gay prosecution paul latham arrest drive he to try to end his life which result only in charge of attempt suicide be add to that of indecent conduct very sad story but hardly exceptional the post war period see sharp rise in the number of prosecution in britain for homosexual act with the fine for first offence be the equivalent of today and second offence punishable by sentence of one to five year on average thankfully in the then labour home secretary roy jenkins provide parliamentary time for leo abse ten minute rule bill to decriminalise homosexuality through the sexual offences act of course there be still long way to go to full equality even as fairly recently as scarborough town council refuse permission for the campaign for homosexual equality to hold conference in the town something that damage not only scarborough reputation at the time but its tourist trade the success of today scarborough pride be therefore all the more welcome and be cause for celebration of course there be other pride event in nearby york and leeds but it be important for the community in scarborough to be visible which it be at pride with over people take part since it restart in have take part in both joyous parade join the scarborough and whitby labour party carry its splendid banner along with my dog tarka resplendent in her rainbow neckerchief the parade wind its way cheerfully through the town centre and along foreshore road towards scarborough spa where the festivity continue with fabulous performance stall and delicious food of course tarka particularly appreciate the latter local business along the route decorate their shop and window put pride flag out to show their support with the whole town get into the spirit of the event it be fun day but it also help combat the feeling of isolation that resident feel and it have an educational value break down barrier through family friendly entertainment so that future generation of the community will not have to experience the prejudice that old member have mccain foods major local employer have go above and beyond to support the event but as be the case for so many other charity funding have be struggle for the organiser who all give their time for free pay tribute to those wonderful volunteer know that scarborough pride would welcome offer of support for this year pride which take place on september celebrate inclusivity diversity and love on the yorkshire coast of course far up the coast in whitby we enjoy massive outpouring of love and acceptance twice year as horde of splendidly costume goth visit the town in april and october however as we have hear in the house today and as we know from our own experience the community continue to suffer from abuse and discrimination brilliant exhibition of photo from last year scarborough pride be run at scarborough art gallery as part of history month but sadly the comment section of yorkshire post article about that exhibition have have to be switch off because of the vile nature of many of the post we have see so much progress include legislation to introduce civil partnership and allow same sex couple to adopt child the equalisation of the age of consent and the repeal of section all under the last labour government that be follow by the right of same sex couple to marry under the coalition government and be so pleased to see this government take action to right historic wrong and compensate veteran who be dismiss from the armed service because of their sexual orientation or gender identity the defence secretary have call this moral stain on our nation official report december vol an honest look at history mean confront the prejudice and often brutal treatment that people have suffer in the past and continue to experience it mean face the fact that progress have not be smoothly linear but case of stop and start in which each step forward have have

have the courage to be themselves be the reason we have make the progress we have the real challenge for every person be not battle with their career or their personal ambition the real battle each and every one of we face be battle with shame when you be tell that you be disgusting or when you be tell that there be something wrong with you it eat at you it eat at your very sense of self every time in our history that an lgbt person have steel their nerve and hold hand in the street every time they choose to tell colleague or friend the pronoun of their partner or choose to express their gender and every time they choose love over fear they show an almighty act of strength it be the most powerful political act there can be an individual act of defiance of courage and today we stand here because of each and every one of they we have achieve so much as community but want to conclude by reflect on the work still to do and the importance that this government place on advance right because our journey be not complete when there be still so much hate towards gay and tran people while conversion practice still take place and while our gender recognition law remain out of date that be why be so proud that this government will deliver trans inclusive ban on conversion practice make hate crime an aggravate offence and modernise the law on gender recognition the good way to honour the people who have throughout history fight for our right often at great personal cost be to never be complacent to link arm as community and to make it our solemn mission to ensure that pride be not

by six man in elthorne park in hanwell simply because he be gay both the stigma of hiv and the chilling effect of section keep so many people in the closet live life they could not be honest about for

those sack from the armed force for be we be roll out opt out hiv testing with the prime minister himself take test on camera this week and we have open the first of six new trans healthcare hub it be

respiratory syncytial virus vaccine eligibility criteria people with respiratory illness such as my constituent jane wessman benefit greatly from receive the free respiratory syncytial virus vaccine and also the shingles vaccine the arbitrary decision to end eligibility for these vaccine at the age of have profound effect on those who need it the most accordingly my constituent and other would like to see the age barrier lift and the vaccine continue to be available after the age of the petition state the petitioner therefore request that the government take into account the concern of the petitioner and take immediate action to seek reallocation of fund to ensure that the provision of the free respiratory syncytial virus vaccine dose and shingles vaccine dose be extend to those individual who be year of age or old follow be the full text of the petition the petition of resident of the united kingdom declare that extend the eligibility criterion for the free respiratory syncytial virus vaccine and the shingles vaccine dose to individual who be year of age or old would bring considerable health benefit note that the former illness can cause acute respiratory infection influenza like illness community acquire pneumonia and lead to death and the latter illness can cause decrease vision or permanent blindness and note that vaccine dos for the respiratory syncytial virus and shingles virus be recommend to all individual year of age and over in the united states of america and in the european union the petitioner therefore request that the house of commons urge the government to take into account the concern of the petitioner and take immediate action to seek reallocation of fund to ensure that the provision of the free respiratory syncytial virus vaccine dose and shingles vaccine dose be extend to those individual who be year of age or old and the petitioner remain etc reform of private family law hearings motion make and question propose that this house do now smith it be sad reality of life that marriage fail it can happen for variety of reason and do not seek to provide critique on the underlie cause in today debate however one of the tragic consequence of divorce be the disruption and pain that it cause to child it be evident that an amicable relationship between parent would enable arrangement in respect of where child reside follow divorce to be make without the intervention of the court avoid much additional heartache and the adversarial nature of contested hearing but such contest hearing can not be avoid in each and every case while it may be the intention of the system to protect the privacy of individual and family during these hearing the reality be an increasingly inefficient and at time unresponsive system that fail to place the emotional and psychological need of the party at its centre the flaw in the present system be regrettably clear for all to see and in fail to address they party be leave with system that undermine the very value that it seek to uphold value such as fairness and natural justice with the wellbeing of child at their core this be such vast topic that it would be inconceivable to address all the issue in the course of an adjournment debate and will therefore focus on the constitution of those on the bench who hear child arrangement order case the reason be simple the anchor point in all family law case involve child should always be that child good interest and the creation of an outcome that support and promote the child safety and emotional and psychological wellbeing and protect his or her future prospect it be almost inevitable that each and every member of this house will have have experience of child arrangement order in some way shape or form whether through constituency casework personal experience or family and friend because such case be sadly far from rare if you will indulge madam deputy speaker will tell the story of one such case which suspect will resonate with many up and down the country because it be sadly an all too familiar experience this be the story of young child who by virtue of their age can not fully articulate their want or desire whose loyalty be split in two who do not want to be see to betray either parent who be already deal with their world be turn upside down and whose future be decide in sterile magistrate court often as mere timetable exercise that child now face birthday christmas and easter all split in half with week cut in two and weekend alternate between one household and another leave they with no sense of oikophilia the love of home this be child who feel different from their classmate because they be force to go to school with their overnight bag child who constantly live with the anxiety of turn up to school without their sport kit because it be at the other parent house child who feel nomadic often confused and invariably distressed the scale of the problem can be see starkly in the figure from the children and family court advisory and support service as of august last year there be open private law child case involve child in the first quarter of the average time for such case to reach final order be some week during that period child be leave with uncertainty magistrate have form an integral element of the england and wales legal system since the century and the reign of richard who appoint the first keeper of the peace almost year later pursuant to the justices of the peace act the term justice of the peace be formally introduce do not propose reform of the role of magistrate lightly however have reach the view that there be an overwhelming policy argument for do so be not for one moment suggest that magistrate do not have an important role to play in the justice system self evidently that would be fallacy however be increasingly convinced that the nature and focus of their work should be reconsider and in the case of child arrangement order it be my overwhelming view that the magistrate court should no long play role the reason for mount this argument be simple there be an inequality in our legal system when it come to private law family case these be case that decide the nature and degree of contact child have with each parent determine the long term future of child and by their very nature have significant lasting impact upon any child presently in this country private law child case can be hear before bench of three magistrate or district judge with family ticket magistrate be lay bench who well meaning as they may be be not require to hold any formal legal qualification while magistrate undergo some specific training follow their appointment it be not more than handful of day year in comparison district judge hear such case undergo much more rigorous training and must have law qualification as prerequisite the stake in case such as these could not be high this singular most important decision if misjudge can set in motion truly devastating series of event thereby irreversibly damage child and their life chance let we contrast that with the role of magistrate in the criminal court the maximum sentence that magistrate can hand down be month sentence beyond that be remit to the crown court to be hear by circuit judge in comparison decision about child domestic arrangement until adulthood be frequently make by individual with no specialist knowledge or training in family law furthermore in the absence of formal legal training subconscious bias be likely to run high among magistrate than among member of the judiciary we can also take note of the approach take by other court in england and wales specialist judge preside over employment immigration business and property and social entitlement case even in case where panel of three hear the case it be legally qualified specialist judge who sit in the chair give the importance of such decision to child long term prospect the outdated practice of magistrate hear private law child case should in my humble opinion be abolish it be an inefficient and unreliable system of dispense justice in the modern world and it run the risk of reach inconsistent decision of vary and questionable quality far too often one hear of case simply be decide as timetable exercise and of child weekly diary be carve up without proper thought or consideration of the impact on that child remove the role of magistrate in private law family case and ensure that all such case be hear by specialist family judge would ensure great consistency of decision making apply more judicious and impartial approach on this most consequential of issue we should ensure that those who preside over family case be not only appropriately legally train but well verse in the emotional psychological and social factor at play there should be much great focus on ensure that decision maker be train in childhood development domestic abuse dynamic and trauma inform practice the system in england and wales be virtually unique in permit lay magistrate to determine such matter with most jurisdiction across the world entrust the decision to suitably qualified judge in more complex case we should consider the use of specialised panel as deploy in other tribunal such panel could have judge as chair and suitably qualified wing member who may include expert in child psychology by adopt this model the panel can take more holistic approach to decision making my ask of the minister be very simple if we aim to create well future for our child if we truly believe in progress and not merely maintain the status quo and if we be to be believe when we talk of improve life chance for generation to come the minister should commit to reform this outdated and harmful system and ensure that all child arrangement case be appropriately consider by qualified judge congratulate the hon member for solihull west and shirley dr shastri hurst on secure this important debate and applaud the thoughtful and consider way that he have approach very challenging area think we all want to mitigate the disruption and pain that family law hearing cause to child and he be correct to say that we all want to have child good interest as the anchor point in everything we do applaud the way that he set out his concern it be well know that family breakdown be almost always challenge at time dispute be unavoidable and often intense with child catch in the middle the family court play crucial role in resolve such dispute want to clarify that magistrate who sit in the family court be formally refer to as lay justice however for the purpose of today debate will use the term family magistrate as it be more widely recognise the hon member be well aware that the family justice system in england and wales rely on the work that family magistrate do to ensure that the most vulnerable member of society particularly child be protect and that their good interest be prioritise welcome his word about the importance of magistrate in our justice system even though he have concern about the role that they play in this particular area although family magistrate do not have formal legal qualification they undergo rigorous selection and comprehensive training process that be provide by the judicial college and it be worth note that family magistrate be involve in family proceeding long before the inception of the family court in before that family magistrate in the civil and county court would sit on family proceeding and make decision about arrangement for child there be long history of that in our law family magistrate be recruit from the community and bring diverse range of impartial perspective and experience to the court this diversity help to ensure decision be fair it be crucial that we recognise and preserve their contribution to the family justice system for several compelling reason especially in the light of the argument make by the hon gentleman in both his recent article and this debate suggest that family magistrate should no long be able to make child arrangement order the house will know that these be family court order that detail arrangement for child include where the child will live and how they will spend time with each parent the hon gentleman have clearly spell out some of the implication the government appreciate the concern raise by the hon gentleman regard the training of magistrate however we believe the exist system have safeguard in place which will outline to offer reassurance not only to he but to everyone listen to this debate be talk about the training that magistrate receive the role of the justice legal adviser and the robust protocol the family court have for allocate and reallocate case can assure the hon gentleman that the quality of training provide to magistrate be of high standard to safeguard their independence from government the statutory responsibility for training family magistrate rest with the lady chief justice as set out in the constitutional reform act these responsibility be exercise through the judicial college which offer comprehensive training programme to equip family magistrate with the necessary skill and knowledge to handle the intricacy of private law child case effectively this training ensure that family magistrate be prepared to make informed decision that prioritise the welfare of the child involve further information on the college training programme can be find on the judiciary website when sit in the family court family magistrate be support by the justice legal adviser who be qualified to provide advice on the law and procedure that family magistrate must follow and who be also subject to an ongoing family training requirement all judge include family magistrate who hear application for child arrangement order be obligate by the children act to have the child welfare as their paramount consideration and must undergo extensive training to be appoint as family magistrate each individual must undertake training on determine the good interest of the child navigate the welfare checklist and way of communicate with people in court particularly where there be high conflict let emphasise and underline the role of justice legal adviser in assist family magistrate in these case panel of family magistrate decide case with the presence and involvement of the justice legal adviser the recent case law derbyshire county council marsden confirm that these adviser play an integral and legally require part of the decision making process justice legal adviser provide essential guidance and support to family magistrate ensure that decision be make with thorough understanding of the complexity of family law and always prioritise the good interest of the child involve nor be family magistrate operate in vacuum they rely on assessment carry out by train professional for arrangement order prohibit step order and other key ruling when make arrangement for child this collaborative approach enhance the quality of the family court decision in these very sensitive case family magistrate do not deal with the most complex case in the family court establish rule and guidance determine the appropriate level of judiciary base on number of factor include the complexity of the case case involve certain complexity will be immediately allocate to other tier of the judiciary district judge circuit judge and at the most serious level high court judge in accordance with the issue guidance it be like lift that the judiciary enter at the appropriate level the judiciary include family magistrate have an ongoing duty to keep allocation decision under review particularly if further information be receive from the party and the children and family court advisory and support service the case can then be reallocate to more appropriate level of judge depend on the complexity and the issue in the case and that can happen in the course of proceeding the system ensure that magistrate handle appropriate case for which they be train while more complex case be manage at different level of the judiciary depend on the issue in the case the mechanism not only maintain the efficiency of the legal process but ensure that justice be serve appropriately family magistrate also play an essential role in the effective functioning of our family justice system the number of outstanding case in the system have grow since and the average time take for case reach high of week in under the previous government which be similar to the datum the hon member share early while we have take step to address the underlie issue which mean we be on track to reduce the outstanding caseload by more than there be still significant challenge face the system family magistrate routinely deal with number of case about child remove that capacity from the system would fundamentally undermine the effective administration of justice but more than that the resultant delay in resolve case would have profound impact on the wellbeing of the child involve and on parent seek to resolve their issue furthermore the government remain committed to reform private family law process where appropriate just last week the government announce that our new pathfinder model of private family law proceeding will be extend to mid and west wales in march and to west yorkshire in june it be significant reimagining of private law proceeding with dedicated support for domestic abuse survivor up front multi agency information sharing and great emphasis on the voice of the child through the production of child impact report those proceeding allow our judge include family magistrate to have much rich understanding of family circumstance from the outset and ensure that party be fully support by professional it be clear that family magistrate be indispensable in hear private law child case their collaboration with justice legal adviser the quality of their training the mechanism for allocate and reallocate difficult case and their contribution in alleviate the burden on all our judge be all critical factor that contribute to more efficient and effective legal system by maintain the involvement of family magistrate in those case we can ensure that the good interest of our child which be what we be all focus on be uphold and that justice be deliver in timely and compassionate manner question put and agree to house adjourn
