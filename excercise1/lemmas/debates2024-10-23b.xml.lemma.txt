the most vulnerable among we but if we get it right we unlock enormous opportunity for our society in join the local leeds branch of friends of the earth and launch campaign for the uk first climate change bill everyone tell that it be impossible that it be too ambitious and too radical there be no way that the treasury would ever allow carbon budget but friend they do we turn that campaign into the fourth most support campaign in parliament history with cross party backing from member across the house the last labour government turn that bill into an act in under my right hon friend the member for doncaster north ed miliband whom be honour to be work with again under this act britain decarbonise fast than any other rich country this act have now become global benchmark adopt by other nation and that say to my hon friend be what global leadership look like why be share this it be because politic must be about real change or it be about nothing want to serve our community and improve our school healthcare and public service when think about change think about my grandmother marjorie simms she challenge the status quo she live in horsforth in there be not that many woman drive then but marjorie do there be not that many woman wear trouser but marjorie do majorie develop breast cancer and most parent in the avoid talk to their child but marjorie show they her mastectomy so they could understand she die at the age enter parliament majorie do thing differently and her spirit live on in we have see too much promise and too little delivery in recent year endless debate about challenge but lack of energy for real solution politic should be about action not just word the seed of change can be see within our community as government our role be to water they and create the condition for they to flourish leed north west be willing to play its role in full we have the leader we have the idea and we have the get stuff do attitude that personify yorkshire like the student meet recently at ralph thoresby and green meadows or the cadet in my constituency who be ambitious about the difference we can make like the horsforth shed set up couple of year ago by ex teacher base on the national man shed model and support male mental health but expand to include many other vulnerable member of the community like those from otley who decide they want to be beacon of hope and create live laboratory in the town to create climate friendly and sustainable solution where people and nature thrive and like brian who after death in morrison car park in guiseley set up defibrillator all over the community so that lifesave equipment be on hand and there be network of community activist service they let we not forget the gold medal olympians in our
