website there be few teacher than last year there be few child in primary school this year know the right hon lady be at the treasury so would expect bit more when it come to her math it would be

harrowing case at twickenham green nursery in my constituency which result in nursery worker be convict of count of child cruelty last month and in the tragic case of gigi meehan in cheadle will the secretary of state commit to issue fresh guidance to nursery on the use and regular monitoring of cctv footage the hon member will know that meet the family of genevieve meehan recently that be tragic

commit to have early year setting inspect within month and indeed within four year have offer meeting with the hon member and be very happy to discuss these issue far apprenticeship should be open to everyone have meet too many young people in doncaster east and the isle of axholme who be more than capable of do the job they have the hand on skill the attitude and the drive to work but be be hold back from apprenticeship because they have to get grade in english or math when will the government move forward with reform the rule so that we stop shut out good people from good job just because they do not get pass in the classroom absolute agree with my hon friend this government will indeed stop shut good people out of good job he be probably aware that the department fund apprentice to achieve qualification as part of their training we do not set entry requirement these be decision for employer however we have allow for more flexibility in english and math requirement for adult age and over child in receipt of fund from the adoption and special guardianship support fund often have significant mental health wellbee and educational need for many of these child their individual therapy be the single big factor enable they to continue at school what assessment have the minister make of the implication of cut funding for this therapy the adoption and special guardianship support fund provide valuable therapeutic support to child and family which be why we have commit to continue the million to this financial year we have be hold discussion with key stakeholder and we will soon announce the next step for the fund as well as be the governor of sixth form college be proud to be governor of the abbey hill special school in stoke on trent draw the house attention to my entry in the register of members financial interests accordingly which be why be so appalled by the comment of the reform uk chairman that child with special need be naughty child often as the result of bad parenting can invite the secretary of state to condemn those comment and to reaffirm our support for those child and parent join my hon friend in condemn those remark be aware that the reform uk leader say in similar comment not be heartless be frank well will be frank reform uk would plunge the send system into further disarray only labour will back the child with send who need support the citizenaid first aid charity provide excellent education in emergency situation to child and young people have write to the scottish education department to invite it to introduce it to the curriculum be there any interest from the department for education down here if the hon gentleman would write to will look into that far meaningful work experience can be life changer for our young child cut the risk of their be out of education employment or training the derby promise be hard at work link school with employer to raise the aspiration of our young people do the minister agree with and do she recognise the valuable work that the derby promise deliver in open door for young people do indeed agree with my hon friend and applaud he for the work he do on the derby promise before he enter this place and for all he have do for child in derby south since be delighted that employer such as rolls royce have sign up to the derby promise to bring industry close to young people and to inspire their future career essex have see huge increase in the number of request for education health and care need assessment and be fail to meet the target in part due to the difficulty of recruit educational psychologist rather than try to bury the problem by scrap education health and care plan can the minister say what the government be do to meet that need the right hon gentleman be pre empte decision before they have be make we have not make decision about the future of ehcp we be listen carefully and work with the sector to make sure we have the workforce in the system and the support system to identify need early we will continue to do that and we will work with family to design system that work rather than the one we inherit york be seek to advance new model of support for child with send that be inclusive and provide opportunity include great curriculum flexibility to deliver broad education in small group and life skill curriculum so child be equip to navigate the world around they safely would the minister support city of york council to deliver such measure the hon lady will know that curriculum and assessment review be currently be undertake by an independent panel we be keen that the curriculum be broad and rich but also inclusive we will be respond when the panel report with its recommendation in the autumn when the secretary of state talk of such large reduction in the number of anticipate future primary school pupil do she attribute any part of that to wish by certain community to develop parallel education system rather than engage in full integration with this country be not quite clear what the right hon gentleman be drive at with that question what have say in response to the very sharp decline in the birth rate be that as government we want to make sure that people be able to make choice that be right for they include around family size my concern be that too many young people because of the inaccessibility of housing and the challenge they face in the job market be make decision they do not necessarily want to make that be why the expansion of childcare for example be critical part of how we be support family those work in our school in south gloucestershire do brilliant job but they receive the low funding per pupil in all of england via funding formula inherit from the previous government do the minister have plan to review the formula as part of the impactful wide work to ensure that every child receive the education they need to thrive no matter where they live we recognise that school be work incredibly hard to deliver in their community there be whole range of factor that impact school funding include their rural or urban nature and pupil number we have discuss decline roll we will continue to keep the school funding formula under review that do take time and it have to be do very carefully to ensure certainty for school about their funding planning last year ehcp be issue in cambridgeshire with few than complete within the statutory week deadline cambridgeshire county council now rank as the bad nationally for meet the timeline on their delivery with of send tribunal finding in favour of the parent what step be the secretary of state take to improve the process that see so many application require tribunal and to improve the delivery of ehcp in cambridgeshire assume they be not go to be scrap in mainstream school until that final point think the hon gentleman raise some serious concern which we have hear this afternoon from many colleague across the house who need we to bring forward reform to deliver well outcome for child with send if the conservative party want to work with we to do this in way that deliver well system for child with send would be very happy to do so but at the moment all we seem to get be opposition for opposition sake victoria college in my constituency be one of the relatively small number of send specialist further education college in the country it do outstanding work for many year such college have not have access to dedicated capital grant funding will the minister be so good as to look into the issue and agree to meet to discuss it far ensure that school and college have the resource and building they need be key part of our mission to break down barrier to opportunity will be very happy to meet my hon friend to discuss these issue far sadly both university in my constituency de montfort university and leicester university be on the verge of make hundred of redundancy and even shut down complete faculty what financial commitment be the department make to secure academic job especially in subject such as chemistry humanity and language rather than make short term cut the hon gentleman will appreciate that university be independent institution that be able to make their own decision around financial management as government we have seek to stabilise the high education sector that be why we take the difficult but necessary decision to increase tuition fee later this year we will be publish strategy that will deal with many of his question last week hear from mum who apply for an ehcp for her son in december and be tell it would be ready in june she have now be inform by buckinghamshire council that he remain unallocated with child ahead of he be very grateful to the secretary of state for the work she be do to grip and reform the send system but can she talk more about her ambition to support people catch in the horrible waiting game for ehcp we have hear this afternoon from my hon friend and so many member across the house about the urgent need to make improvement for child with send we be lay the foundation with more investment in the system through both the high need budget and capital so we have the place that be need there be of course much we be do right now with council to improve some of the unacceptable wait that parent currently face the superb john hampden school in wendover report that it be run deficit support student with significant send while they await assessment however it be an infant only school and the money often do not come through until the pupil have move up to junior school will the minister look at how the system be work for infant only school to make the system fair as we have say we be look at reform to the system we recognise that there be challenge right across the system that we inherit we know that family face challenge in secure support and that school face challenge too we will look at every detail and announce reform in the white paper in the autumn recently host series of engagement and roundtable on the sen reform and it be impossible to ignore the sheer size of the problem this government be confront will the secretary of state confirm that the legal right to specialist support will remain core principle of every child entitlement as labour rebuild this break system and that we will go far deliver real outcome genuine inclusion and an sen system build to serve family not fail they be grateful to my hon friend for the work he have do in this area over many year and for the way he champion this cause here on behalf of his constituent can confirm that child with send have legal right to additional support and that labour will protect that he will appreciate that discussion be under way with family campaigner and school leader to ensure that we get this system right well system with strengthen support and more timely intervention and early identification of need it be clear this afternoon that that mission be urgent and that we need to deliver well outcome for child with send look forward to work with my hon friend on that asylum hotels migrant criminal activity before call the shadow home secretary to ask this urgent question remind the house that hon member must not refer to any matter that be currently before the court member be free to refer to broad policy issue but they should not get into the detail of the specific case for which criminal charge be be bring urgent question to ask the home secretary to make statement on criminal activity by illegal immigrant at asylum hotel as the house will be aware on tuesday july an arrest be make by essex police follow incident that take place in epping early that day and man be subsequently charge his trial be due to start on august and he have be remand in custody until that time these be very serious allegation and it be vital that criminal justice procedure be able to run their course superintendent tim tubbs of essex police have say that the last thing we want be for any public discussion to hinder an ongoing prosecution thank essex police both for its swift response on that case and for handle the protest in essex yesterday evening and in previous day with diligence and professionalism criminal activity of any kind be totally unacceptable wherever it occur and whoever it be perpetrate by as outline follow the recent casey report we be improve joint protection arrangement between the police and immigration enforcement link to the asylum system we be clear that where crime be commit every effort must be make to catch prosecute and punish those responsible let there be absolutely no doubt foreign national include asylum seeker who abuse our hospitality by break our law should expect to be remove from this country in the first year of this government foreign national criminal be remove from the uk increase on the previous year that be important progress but we want to go far through the border security asylum and immigration bill we be change the law to ensure that individual convict of any register sexual offence be not grant asylum and we be legislate to allow for the tagging of any migrant consider to pose threat to public safety or national security as well as strengthen our crackdown on illegal working but we must go far to end hotel use this labour government inherit an asylum system in chaos with hotel in use at the peak in at cost of almost million day we be change that clear the asylum backlog and increase return to end the use of asylum hotel all together by the end of this parliament alongside those action we be mount comprehensive and wide range effort to tackle small boat crossing include the intensify co operation and pilot return scheme with france outline by the home secretary in her statement last week there be no quick fix for the chronic problem this government inherit but for the first time in year there be now serious and sensible plan to restore order and proper management to the asylum and immigration system let state plainly to the house that we expect rule to be respect and enforce and we expect the law to be follow when it be not we expect those involve to face the full force of the law we be take every possible step to deliver the strong border security that the country need because nothing matter more than the safety of the british people the policing minister be crow about the government action on small boat but the truth be this so far this year the government have allow in illegal immigrant across the channel that be up on last year this year have be by far the bad ever and number in asylum hotel be now high than at the time of the election this be border security crisis but it be also public safety crisis especially for woman and girl many nationality cross for example afghans commit up to time more sex offence than average louise casey make that point in her report now we have press reporting on the huge scale of the crime commit by illegal immigrant house in the government own asylum hotel the sun find charge in the last six month base on only half the hotel currently operate the mail on sunday find charge base on only third of those hotel those crime include multiple case of rape sexual assault violence theft and arson include the case that the minister refer to in epping where year old ethiopian man have be charge with sexually assault year old girl an illegal immigrant in oxford have be convict of rap year old woman in churchyard sudanese man be convict of strangle and attempt to rape woman in nightclub toilet in wakefield violent protest in response to those appalling crime be never justify the public though be rightly sick of this illegal immigrant crime wave it have to end will the minister commit now to do the follow thing first will she record and publish the immigration status of all offender secondly will she close that asylum hotel in epping thirdly will she repeal the human rights act for immigration matter finally will she emulate greece new approach which start today and deport all illegal immigrant on arrival from france without judicial process either back to their country of origin or to safe third country will she give the house and the country those commitment let repeat to the house that any allegation of crime or sexual assault include by individual in the asylum system be incredibly serious and be to be treat so by the authority and by the government regret the tone that the shadow home secretary be take on such serious and important matter also gently remind he to look at his record and that of the conservative party on this issue more than asylum hotel be in operation at their peak housing over people at cost of almost million day enforce return be down on return of foreign national offender have fall by thousand criminal smuggler gang be able to exploit our weak border security it be the bad year ever there be no proper management of public safety risk pose by individual asylum seeker interruption order do we both understand indicate assent okay carry on minister there be no proper management of public safety risk pose by individual asylum seeker and migrant could work illegally in the gig economy with few sanction for the company responsible this government be grip the situation and turn the system around we have remove foreign national offender in our first year in office just to put that in perspective for the benefit of the house that be more foreign criminal than be remove in the entire month when the right hon gentleman be the minister for immigration we have covid excuse excuse excuse would say that the same pattern be true of illegal working but actually it be even bad in the first quarter of this year we deliver more raid more arrest and more fine for illegal working than the shadow home secretary manage in the entire time he be immigration minister we do more in three month to crack down on illegal working than he manage in now that nonsense it be not nonsense it be fact now we be try to go far in all these area but it be clear that the conservatives and their friend in reform be the one try to stop we we introduce counter terror measure at the border to smash the gang responsible for the vile trade they vote against the bill that deliver that we introduce measure to ban sex offender from get asylum in the uk they vote against the bill that deliver they we introduce tag for those arrive illegally who pose risk to the public and extend illegal working duty to cover the gig economy once again they vote against it we have see year of inaction leave our border expose and our community fractured yet the shadow home secretary have the cheek to lecture we about keep the country safe draw the attention of the house to my declaration of interest people who come to this country legally and work hard be welcome but the minister be right to say that those who do not be not we know that one of the big pull factor be the ability to work illegally in the uk can the minister set out what the government be do to stamp out illegal working and in particular the role of the new fair work agency introduce by the employment rights bill which will be critical in stop illegal working in the uk my hon friend will know that the immigration minister my hon friend the member for wallasey dame angela eagle who believe give evidence to the esteemed home affairs committee on which he sit be look at that issue number of company have be report in the press as employ or use people in particular from asylum hotel know the shadow home secretary have take particular interest in this and the minister be work very hard to ensure that those company be hold to account and that the new provision we be bring in to ensure that the gig economy be treat in the same way as other employer who have to check individual immigration status be follow through there be much more to do but certainly know the immigration minister be work hard on this call the liberal democrat spokesperson the scene of violent unrest at the bell hotel this weekend be deeply concern liberal democrats will always defend the right to peaceful protest but what we see go far beyond that there be no place for that sort of violence and thuggery in our society thank the police and the emergency service for their brave and professional response and my thought go out to anyone who be feel frightened as result of those unacceptable scene it be completely understandable that people be concerned about criminal activity not least after the former conservative government chaotic approach to immigration shatter public trust that be why we need an efficient asylum system that swiftly return those without genuine right to stay would welcome detail from the minister on what step the government be take to deliver that clear rule that be properly enforce will be key to rebuild public trust in the system after it be break by the conservatives welcome the tone of the hon lady contribution this be serious issue fully agree with she on peaceful protest but it be totally unacceptable when that step over into violent disorder as we see last summer for example she will know that there be huge effort go in to deal with the backlog we inherit from the previous government to speed up the process so that those people who should not be in our country be swiftly remove and those refugee and asylum seeker whose claim be accept can get on with the rest of their life welcome the surge in return that we have see and the raid on company with illegal working practice as we have speak about many time in this house those company be incentivise the boat crossing and ultimately undermine our national security can the minister set out what further enforcement there can be be it possible that conversation could be have with the treasury about further measure that could be take to bring some of these company to heel be the policing minister but know that work be already under way on that issue the immigration minister have have number of conversation particularly with employer as have just say about where work should not be take place because of individual immigration status there have be investment in the national crime agency additional officer be work on this issue and work be under way on smash the gang who be behind bring people across in the small boat there be also our international arrangement and treaty that we be sign with various country which the previous government be unable to do call the father of the house this be real national crisis and there be such an outcry and such outrage in the country that there be real danger that people will take the law into their own hand which we all deprecate we have to solve this and the only way to do so be to have reasonable and proper deterrent we must arrest the people who land on our shore detain they and send they back to where they come from the human rights act be never intend to cover illegal immigrant of this sort we have to do this for all our sake otherwise people will wrongly take the law into their own hand as just say to the hon member for richmond park sarah olney who speak for the liberal democrats peaceful protest be completely acceptable we understand that there be different opinion on immigration in this country and people should be allow to voice those opinion when that turn into violent disorder as we have see it be not acceptable know that the police behave in very professional way they allow protest to take place but they clearly have to keep the king peace as well the father of the house be correct to say that we need function system where application be deal with swiftly people be not wait for year for application to be decide and those who should not be in this country be remove think many of we agree with the minister when she say that it be important that we be able to debate immigration and refugee and how we as country support they and that we recognise when allegation of incredibly serious sexual offence be involve that people be rightly concerned peaceful protest play its part but she will be conscious that the police themselves have condemn the mindless thuggery that we have see in epping also there be report that seem quite serious about neo nazi group and their leaflet be circulate in order to protect peaceful protest which many of we seek to do we have to stop the direct targeting of individual with violence what assessment have be make of any co ordination of violence by group in these incident say again that we absolutely believe that peaceful protest be part of our democratic process unfortunately as my hon friend will know there be always people who will seek to exploit situation and we probably see some of that over the last few day in epping say again that there be people from the local community who be express genuinely hold view and it be important that we note that however be also aware that literature be be distribute and that other group be perhaps go to epping to stir up problem the police be aware of that and they be look at all the information and evidence about what happen and they will obviously keep that under review two week ago in epping there be three allege sexual assault on school age girl my thought be with the victim their family and their peer these be allegedly link to the bell hotel which have be stand up as an asylum hotel against all advice since then we have have numerous major protest involve hundred of people injury to police officer and damage to police vehicle people quite rightly have the right to peaceful protest but these violent scene be not we they be not eppe and they be not what we stand for want to thank essex police for all that they be do to keep we safe in these challenging and distressing time for our town follow the protest we have church cancel service business close early and local resident feel like they be barricade in their own home the hotel be in the wrong place it be near school and there be inadequate safeguarding of the hotel vulnerable resident this be crisis that be boil over and for the sake of community safety the home secretary and the government must get grip of the situation they must listen and act now to close this hotel immediately will they now do that the hon gentleman comment on behalf of his constituent be measure and he be absolutely right that our first thought should be with those affect by what happen in epping the victim and their family it be important for the house to note that also want to reiterate that this government be commit to close all asylum hotel by the end of this parliament welcome the shadow home secretary concern about crime link to the asylum system that be concern hold across the house why do the minister think the conservatives and reform vote against the border security asylum and immigration bill which allow the tagging of asylum seeker who pose threat to public safety have absolutely no idea it be for the shadow home secretary to explain that one clearly would expect all hon and right hon member in the house to want to do everything to keep our community safe look forward to the swift deportation of anybody who take advantage of our hospitality by break our law and attack woman and young girl in july warn my constituent not to throw away their future as the far right lynch mobs threaten to spread to gloucestershire once again this thuggery have flare up this time in epping what action be the government take to support authority in the prosecution of those who whip up this furore both online and in position of influence the hon gentleman may know that great deal of work have be undertake since the disorder of last summer to ensure that intelligence be gather from the online space as well as the offline space and that all the authority be prepared and ready if there be any sign of disorder again just to reiterate all of we in this house would recognise that peaceful protest be an important part of democratic society but not when it cross over into the disorder and mayhem we see last year when criminal act be perpetrate by individual agree that it be important that we be able to debate immigration and asylum people across the country know the consequence of the asylum system fail to protect the public community and business we have have experience of that in my own city do the minister agree that public safety must come first and that it be indefensible that the tory party and reform oppose measure allow the tagging of high risk individual do she agree that the breadth and depth of this crisis need we all to work together to regain public confidence absolutely agree with my hon friend she put that eloquently again expect that all member of this house would want to do everything to protect the member of all community in this country the minister say that an asylum seeker convict of an offence will not be grant asylum do she have some special method of send they back to country to which we can not send anyone back if they have break into our country illegally otherwise what do her sanction amount to to the right hon gentleman specific question this be about not grant asylum to those who be convict of register sexual offence so it be not recognise that they have an asylum claim that be the issue we be legislate for at the moment the right hon gentleman and understand that there be certain country in the world to which it be difficult to return individual fully appreciate that but we be set out in legislation clear note that asylum will not be grant to those who be convict of register sexual offence the shadow home secretary the right hon member for croydon south chris philp be try to out populist the populist and there be danger involve in that do the minister agree that it be common sense for individual convict of sexual crime to be bar from receive protection in the uk if so why do she think the conservatives and reform vote against that again that be matter for each individual opposition member to explain to their constituent know that this be an issue that people care about opposition members will have to explain their decision to their constituent include in croydon we have responsibility to deal in the truth and to counter plainly false narrative the minister talk about the fact that this protest cross over into mindless thuggery every one of we should stand up here and say that to our constituent or to anyone who get in touch people be spread rumour that have no basis in the truth include in my constituency where last year rumour go around about asylum seeker in hotel it have absolutely no basis in the truth but could have cause some sort of mob like in epping this be dog whistle politic what be the minister do to tell people that just as not everybody in any community in our country be rapist not everybody in migrant hotel be rapist we should do what we can to ensure that people be protect and decision be make as quickly as possible the hon lady raise an important point over the past few year the online space in particular have be use for misinformation and downright lie it be important that we all recognise that we should look carefully at social medium site we should use critical thinking as we teach our child in school we should always ask why that piece of information have be put out and whether it be from reliable source and look for reliable medium source if we be seek information about what be happen that be important we in this house have perhaps not be as quick as we should be to recognise how social medium have move thing on in society in way that we need to deal with there be an enormous amount of work in the department for science innovation and technology and the home office to consider what more we can do in relation to social medium and the online space the shadow home secretary the right hon member for croydon south chris philp have speak passionately about crime in this country include dare say some by number of individual who enter the country on his government watch when he be home office minister as other member have say when opposition party take that position while vote against tag asylum seeker who be perceive to be threat and against bar from the country those who have be convict of sexual crime it damage not only confidence in our community but the life chance of asylum seeker who have commit no crime and have legitimate claim to be here do the minister agree yes my hon friend put it very well within this there be people flee persecution in other part of the world this country as we all know and have hear many time in the house recognise our role in the world to offer safe haven to such people fully endorse what he say over the past year how many gang have actually be smash as understand it obviously be the policing minister but will get the minister with responsibility for immigration to write to the right hon gentleman about this the national crime agency have over ongoing investigation into network and new nca officer have be recruit and fund by the border security command take the total number of officer focus solely on this issue to when violent disorder erupt on the street of my constituency last summer the police put themselves between two group of people who have be wind up and be look to see how much damage they could do to each other chief constable chris noble alongside chief inspectors david barrow and laura davies ensure that community come together after the event to realise that neighbour can live in peace my constituent expect everybody who have commit sexual offence or other crime to be prosecute but what work be the minister do across government to ensure that once such event have take place community can come together again and live in peace nobody want to walk around on eggshell fearful of their neighbour my hon friend raise really important point after the disorder last summer we do see community spontaneously come together and want to say that what have happen in their local area be do not by the majority but by very small number of people the ministry of housing communities and local government have be work with local authority on rebuild community cohesion which for many year under the last administration be not see as important at all because it be so important that all part of our society feel safe and value through community cohesion we stop those who wish to divide and pit people against each other and recognise the valuable role that all part of society and our community play illegal migrant cross the channel be time more likely to end up in british jail than british bear citizen yet this government allow thousand of unvetted male to enter this country who will commit horrific crime like rape and murder and there be some potential terrorist among they too do the minister agree that it be time to forget the silly legislation that labour mp be bleat on about and to detain these people and deport they we do not want to see any of these silly tag put on their ankle just detain and deport they straight away sit on the select committee on home affairs with the hon gentleman for number of year and think he attend the visit to manston when we be both on the committee interruption well perhaps he do not but it might have help if he have at manston information and biometric be take from people who come across in small boat they be check against record wish he would have look at what actually happen think the statistic he mention come from newspaper do not think it have actually be verify although be willing to have look at it but think it be in the sun if recall correctly member will be aware of the public streaming of violence and criminal activity towards property and police officer this be the second year that this have happen over the summer period will the minister confirm that she be engage with other departments on how we can review streaming activity so that it do not promote violence and criminality and replication in other location around our country that be very important point and there be ongoing conversation with the home office and other government departments to ensure that it be address that have be problem particularly in the terrorist field and action have be take speedily to get such posting down have be fob off with ridiculous non answer to my write question on this subject and an insulting letter from the immigration minister the hon member for feltham and heston seema malhotra so do not want to be promise yet another evasive letter that ignore the question will the minister tell what the legal reason be that the immigration minister cite as justification for the government and serco refuse to tell mps and local people when they move migrant into our constituency and where the hon gentleman be relatively new member of this house but have be in the house while and certainly that do not happen under the previous administration there be always opportunity to improve and local members of parliament local council and the police be all engage when people be move into certain area of the country know that happen although be sure it could be well but be happy to raise this again with the immigration minister because have not have sight of the letter that she send to the hon gentleman the press regularly run story where economic migrant be quote describe what they believe be the benefit available to they in the uk and the work opportunity that our relatively under regulate labour market offer do the minister agree it be time that we consider labour id card plan scrap by the conservative liberal democrat coalition and its ability to reduce the uk pull factor for new migrant the government have be take action over the past month to deal with the issue of illegal working there have be illegal working visit lead to arrest rise of and respectively compare with the year before that mark the first month period in which more than visit have take place to start to tackle illegal working in this country my constituency have proud history of be welcoming community we have have an asylum hotel for two year with no problem the family be well integrate in the local community with many child in the local school late last week however we be tell that people would be ask to move from that hotel with no notice from today despite the fact that the hotel will still be use for asylum seeker they do not know where they will need to move to have raise the issue with the home office and have no response so can the minister urgently look into it today do she agree that every mp with an asylum hotel in their constituency should have dedicated home office contact so that we can work together to promote peace and harmonious community relation and against disinformation and violence be happy to pass on that issue to the immigration minister we have hear conservative and reform mps decry legislation that they say be stop the problem be fix they talk the talk but they do not actually vote for legislation the shadow home secretary with an angry face be go on about what be happen in hotel but it be his government policy that set up hotel as hostel for asylum seeker this government have say that they will end the policy can the minister set out the government sensible approach not gimmick to end the use of hotel as hostel thank my hon friend for those comment it might help the shadow home secretary if say that the number of hotel have go down under this labour government interruption despite what the shadow home secretary say the number of hotel have go down since the government come into power violent disorder be always wrong but we need to recognise that it be symptom of people outrage at the current situation and of their fear of crime particularly sexual crime in their community the minister should focus not on the tone of question in the house and what have happen in the past but on what she will do to solve the problem in that respect agree with what the father of the house say about require credible deterrent so do the minister regret cancel the rwanda scheme totally disagree with what the hon lady say violent disorder be not symptom it be criminal it be thuggery it be attack on our brave police officer there be no reason or excuse for what happen last summer or for any violent disorder that may happen in future it be criminal it should be prosecute and people should face the full consequence of the law thank the police for how they have deal with the violent disorder that we have see from minority of people in recent day would much rather that the police be investigate the crime that be allegedly behind the incident also thank the minister for show zero tolerance to the minority of people in our asylum system who break the law it be right that we do that she mention that the number of asylum hotel have come down have the bill also come down the number of hotel have come down the aim be to reduce the overall bill by billion but the number of hotel have come down since we come into power one year on it be quite clear that the labour government have not get grip on illegal migration and criminality there be no plan and no cap and it would appear today that there be not even an answer or any knowledge as to whether any gang have be smash when will the minister put in place an effective deterrent that protect not just our border but our citizen the right hon lady say that there be no plan first we be work with source and transit company to stop dangerous journey before they begin secondly we be step up law enforcement with new power more national crime agency officer and specialist unit in france to disrupt smuggling gang thirdly we be strengthen border security with more patrol drone and legal challenge to stop overcrowded boat fourthly we have secure new return agreement with france something that the shadow home secretary could not achieve so that people arrive illegally by small boat can be send back while also accept matching number of eligible applicant through safe route finally we be crack down on illegal working and reform the asylum system to close loophole exploit by gang and ensure fair control migration that look like plan to that be plan there have be numerous report over the weekend about an alleged incident at the metropole hotel the asylum hotel in my constituency the minister will know that have raise concern about the hotel numerous time with the home office will she ensure that this incident be investigate swiftly and that as the mp and the community get report urgently absolutely be very happy to give that assurance know that my hon friend have be raise these issue for some time so be happy to do that while migrant hotel cost the british taxpayer billion migrant be now be move into house in multiple occupation take house from local people and cause misery for neighbour can the right hon lady tell the house how many migrant have be move into hmo what be the cost to the british taxpayer what can tell the hon lady be that we inherit huge backlog of claim for asylum one of the important part of deal with the backlog be process those claim and determine whether people have an asylum claim that can be successful if it be not they should then be return that be the whole purpose of close the hotel as we will speed up the processing of the application last month the immigration minister could not tell in write answer how many illegal asylum seeker have criminal record we have an asylum hotel in cheshunt in my constituency and my constituent be understandably concerned about criminal activity and antisocial behaviour they do not think that the government be listen to they when will the minister come to this house meet her manifesto commitment and close the asylum hotel in my constituency as have say number of time this government be commit to close all hotel by the end of this parliament few hotel be open now than when we come into power last july the vast majority of british citizen be law abide and they be concerned about the impact of mass migration on their community deterrent would go some way towards restore trust that the british people may have in the asylum system when will the government implement deterrent to send those enter the country illegally to safe third country as have just set out in great detail we have plan let say respectfully to the hon gentleman that the plan that the previous government have result in four volunteer think go to rwanda general election be call the then prime minister decide to call general election why do he not let the scheme operate if it be such success that be the real question why do they go to the country if they be just about to have an enormous success with rwanda the house will be aware of the serious street disturbance in my constituency last month follow the allege rape of young year old girl last week ballymena magistrate court be inform that the chief suspect have flee back to romania do the minister agree that extradition that work be an imperative and that extradition that work expeditiously be an even great imperative clearly that be live matter before the court but want people to be hold to account for their action if that involve extradition that be the right thing to do as always thank the minister for her answer however all too often we seem to be hear about criminal activity by immigrant and asylum seeker across the united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland and more need to be do to address it on behalf of my constituent who ask this question all the time every weekend to be precise what step will the minister take to ensure that we have zero tolerance policy for migrant await an asylum decision so that if they be detain for any kind of criminal activity during that time they will be send back to their country of origin as matter of urgency as say at the outset whoever perpetrate crime will be hold to account and there will be consequence hope have be clear that that include people who be make asylum application as well as the wide general public people have to be hold to account independent water commission before call the secretary of state to make his statement place on the record the fact that mr speaker and the deputy speakers be disappoint to see extensive coverage in the medium this morning of ministers response to the independent water commission before the house have have the opportunity to consider the matter it would be nice to think that the normal courtesy will be resume thank you mr deputy speaker have of course save the bulk of my response for you and the house this afternoon with permission would like to update the house on the government plan to reform the water sector the water industry be clearly fail our river lake and sea be pollute with record level of sewage and water pipe have be leave to crumble into disrepair share customer fury at rise bill right now hosepipe ban be in place across the country because not single new reservoir have be build in over year and the lack of water infrastructure be block economic growth water company have be allow to profit at the expense of the british people when they should have be invest to fix our break water pipe they get away with this because of broken regulatory system that have fail both customer and the environment the public express their fury in last year general election and vote for change that change will now come in just one year we have put in place the building block for change first we restore accountability by give the regulator more tooth and introduce ban on unfair bonus severe and automatic penalty for break the law and jail sentence for the most serious offence secondly we be invest billion of private sector funding to rebuild the water network upgrade crumble pipe repair leak build new sewage treatment work and dig out new reservoir it be the single big investment in the history of the water sector and it allow to make new commitment to the country this government will cut water company sewage pollution in half by the end of the decade that be the most ambitious commitment ever make by any government about water pollution and it be just the start over decade of national renewal we will restore our river lake and sea to good health the third building block for change be today final report from sir jon cunliffe independent water commission express my thank to sir jon his official and all those who have contribute to this outstanding piece of work agree with sir jon that water regulation have be too weak too complex and ineffective have four separate regulator with overlap and conflict remit have fail both customer and the environment ofwat have fail to protect customer from water company mismanagement of their hard earn money and it have fail to protect our waterway from record level of pollution today can announce that this labour government will abolish ofwat we will bring water function from four different regulator into one single powerful super regulator responsible for the entire water sector with the tooth it need to enforce the high standard that the public rightly demand the new regulator will stand firmly on the side of customer investor and the environment and prevent the abuse of the past for customer it will oversee investment and upgrade work so that hard work british family be never again hit by the shocking bill hike that we see last year as customer be leave to pay the price of failure by the previous government for investor it will provide the clarity and direction require for strong partnership between government the sector and investor to attract billion of pound of new funding for the environment it will reduce all form of pollution to clean up our river lake and sea for good we will work closely with the welsh government to devolve the economic regulation of water to wales will publish white paper this autumn give the government full response to the independent water commission final report and launch consultation on it follow that will bring forward new water reform bill early in the lifetime of this parliament ofwat will remain in place during the transition to the new regulator and will ensure that it provide the right leadership to oversee the current price review and investment plan during that time to provide clarity during this period will issue an interim strategic policy statement to ofwat and give ministerial direction to the environment agency set out our expectation and requirement we will publish transition plan as part of our full government response in the autumn today we be immediately take forward number of sir jon recommendation first we will establish new statutory water ombudsman single free service to help customer resolve complaint such as incorrect bill leak pipe or water supply failure the new ombudsman will have the legal power to protect customer and will bring the water dispute resolution process in line with other utility such as energy it be part of the government ambition to put customer at the heart of water regulation secondly we will end the era of water company mark their own homework we will end operator self monitoring and transition to open monitoring to increase transparency and help restore public trust water company be already require to publish datum on some sewage spill within one hour we will roll out real time monitoring across the wastewater system and all this datum will be make publicly available online that will ensure that the regulator and importantly the public have the power to hold water company fully accountable thirdly we commit to include regional element within the new regulator to ensure great local involvement in water planning by move to catchment base model for water system planning we can tackle all source of pollution enter waterway so that they can be clean up more effectively and more quickly this will ensure for the first time that water infrastructure investment plan align with spatial planning to support fast regional economic growth the lack of water infrastructure that hold back development around cambridge and oxford for so long will not happen again the new regulatory framework will recognise the risk investor take and if they meet their obligation they will see fair stable return on their investment just last week sign the government new water skill pledge to make sure that the sector have the skill and workforce it need to deliver this vast investment this labour government be elect to clean up water pollution and ensure that unacceptable bill hike can never happen again we now have all the building block in place to make that happen we be establish new partnership base on effective regulation where water company investor community and the government will work together to clean up our river lake and sea for good call the shadow minister be grateful to the secretary of state for advance sight of his statement shall be respond on behalf of the shadow secretary of state while she meet farmer at the royal welsh show let begin by recognise the scale and seriousness of the work undertake by sir jon cunliffe and his team the review contain page and recommendation and represent one of the most detailed examination of the water sector since privatisation indeed there be much in it that we cautiously welcome include the merger of the regulator as we examine the recommendation in more detail we stand ready to support serious reform if it be do properly however be afraid that what we have see and hear from the secretary of state over the past year have not match the seriousness of sir jon cunliffe work nor have it go anywhere near the root and branch radical reform that he sell to voter before the election therefore seek clarity from he on the follow point first over the weekend the secretary of state announce that labour would cut sewage spill by by but what he do not mention be the fact that plan submit under the last conservative government be already set to cut sewage spill by even more than that amount the times report yesterday that the secretary of state new pledge would actually see an additional discharge of sewage in our river compare with exist plan can the secretary of state explain why after recommendation and year long review of the sector he have water down sewage reduction target rather than massively ramp they up secondly the secretary of state take to the airwave at the weekend tell the public that we need to go back to the purity of our water that we all remember but the uncomfortable truth for which labour still refuse to take responsibility be that when it leave office in just of storm overflow be monitor let repeat that under blair and brown of sewage discharge be happen with no oversight and no accountability whatsoever the only reason we can talk tough today be the fact that the last government push monitor to in may therefore ask the secretary of state to clarify his statement thirdly the secretary of state tell the public that he have secure billion of investment from the water sector to fund these reduction but what he do not mention be that billion of that investment plan have already be submit by water company in october nine month before he be even in office would know that because be the minister at the time and have here the letter show that he have nothing to do with it will he comment on that fourthly the secretary of state champion the criminal investigation of water company that have take place since the election and his ban on water company boss bonus but what he do not explain be that these criminal investigation be direct result of the conservatives policy of quadruple the number of water company inspection and that it be our party that launch the ban on boss bonus this be all available for the public to see and to fact check for themselves as it be matter of public record what all this show be that for all their bluster and promise of radical change the government have make almost no new progress on the issue over the past year they have sit on their hand for more than year wait for the review it be no wonder that the campaigner whom the secretary of state so shamelessly use for vote in the run up to the last general election be now today call for his resignation we on this side of the house stand ready to work with the government on serious reform we will support any action that genuinely hold water company to account deliver clean water and protect the public from pay the price of corporate failure however we will not stand by while the secretary of state rewrite history water down ambition and backtrack on the promise that he make to the public thank the hon gentleman think for his comment but it be disappointing that the shadow secretary of state do not consider matter of this urgency to be important enough for she to show up in the chamber this afternoon be afraid that that really do reflect the importance that their party ascribe to this issue during the year in which it be in power enjoy listen to the hon gentleman but be afraid that he sound little delusional this afternoon if he really think that the conservatives do so well on sewage wonder why he think sewage pollution in our waterway increase every single year during their year in charge the fact be that the conservatives make the situation far worse because they instruct the regulator to apply light touch when they should have tell it to get grip they strip out resource from the regulator reduce its resource by at one point so it be less able to enforce against sewage pollution they allow million of pound if not billion to be divert away from investment and to be use instead for unjustified bonus and dividend for water company it be this government who have secure billion of investment to upgrade our water system it be this government who have ban the unfair bonus that water boss be take it be this government who be introduce monitoring of all sewage outlet and it be this government who be go to clean up our river lake and sea where the previous government fail abysmally my constituent will be very pleased with what the government have announce today follow year of see increase in the dumping of sewage on the beach and in the river in my constituency could not help but notice that yesterday the leader of reform in his answer to every question say either do know or ve no idea of course he be not here either but he do say that his answer to this problem be to increase payment to the shareholder and to do absolutely nothing to deal with the problem in our water industry will my right hon friend confirm that during his time as secretary of state he will make it his priority to ensure that we reduce the sewage be dump in our river on our beach and in our lake be of course on the television show in question with the hon member for clacton nigel farage think he tell we six time that he have no idea well that much we know it be this government who have plan to clean up our waterway we have put in place the building block for change and that allow to stand before this house and commit that by we will reduce sewage pollution from water company by as we move towards decade of national renewal in order to clean up our waterway for good call the liberal democrat spokesperson thank the secretary of state for advance sight of his statement and sir jon cunliffe for his report and for his work in produce it the liberal democrats have long argue for the abolition of ofwat and for the creation of new consolidated and powerful regulator in fact we put it to the public bill committee and it be support by neither the labour party nor the conservative party but today proposal seem to include do just that so we strongly welcome the statement it be reminder to the wonderful volunteer and water campaigner across the country that their work be absolutely worth while and have make huge difference my message to they be thank you so much and keep go because we still do not know the detail and the nature of the new regulator and we still see no sign in the report of any plan to tackle the toxic nature of the water industry ownership structure why be there no plan to change the structure of the industry itself even the good regulator in the world will fail if water company be still own by those who care nothing for the quality of the lake river and sea and who care only about make as much profit as possible in return for very little investment be it really acceptable to ask bill payer for rise when there be no guarantee that the water company will not be siphon off huge chunk of that money in dividend pay rise or bonus why be there nothing in the statement that will truly empower the volunteer citizen scientist and water campaigner just mention why be we not give place on water company board to the like of the eden rivers trust the south lakes rivers trust save windermere the clean river kent campaign surfers against sewage and windrush against sewage pollution know as wasp why be there no mention of monitor the volume of sewage spill as well as the number of incidence and no mention of include legally bind pollution reduction target although the statement be welcome and we rightly celebrate the liberal democrat campaign win that it be full of our job as constructive and effective opposition be to scrutinise the detail and to carry on campaign to clean up our waterway and our water industry too that be exactly what we shall do thank the hon gentleman for his question echo and endorse his comment about the volunteer and citizen scientist who carry out fantastic work to ensure that this issue remain where it need to be which be right at the top of the political agenda hope that they will join we in welcome sir jon report there will be white paper and consultation alongside it we will launch the white paper in the autumn give detailed government response to the page report with recommendation there be lot to go through but the report include proposal about ownership which will be consult on as well volunteer and citizen scientist will be able to engage for the first time through the propose regional structure we accept that proposal in principle and the detail of it will be work through during the consultation for the first time there will be engagement on the catchment of entire river system and citizen local authority and business will all have voice in that as will member of the farming community operate within those catchment believe that by reduce the number of spill we will also reduce the volume of spill the hon gentleman will be able to monitor that and he will be able to hold to account as will the house and the public as we work towards the target that have outline for reduce sewage spill from water company by by he of course be lucky enough to represent one of the most beautiful part of the country include windermere and we be work with united utilities to remove all source of pollution from that beautiful iconic lake so that what become story of decline can become visible symbol of renewal with this government rise order it be apparent that very considerable number of back bench members wish to participate in this statement there be two further statement to follow before we come to the main business of the day which be also very important so urge colleague on both side of the house to ask brief question and not make statement resident in peterborough and across anglian water catchment area will welcome the statement and the bold action take they know all too well that the water system be break one of the issue we on the environment food and rural affairs committee have look at be the need for water infrastructure can my right hon friend confirm that the drive and determination he have show today to fix the water system will also drive forward the fens reservoir and the infrastructure we need in the east of england after generation of delay on reservoir we now have the opportunity to succeed can he tell we that this will stay on track and we will get the job and the water resource we need in the east my hon friend make very important point we be currently go through dry spell and see hosepipe ban in many part of the country yet in the winter it rain very heavily the reason we have hosepipe ban be that we do not have the reservoir to catch the rain when it fall and then use it in dry period which be because we have not build new reservoir for year that change now these plan include the intention to build nine new reservoir to speed up the planning process as the secretary of state be take control of consent for reservoir so that they can be approve much fast and go ahead to provide the country with the clean drinking water we need the environment agency estimate that there be million regular and occasional angler throughout the united kingdom with million get fishing licence last year angle across the country be worth about billion to the economy and it be the favourite pastime in this country as the secretary of state will know will he give an undertaking to all the angler throughout this country that they will be fully engage by the new regulator the right hon gentleman make very important point angler be quite rightly furious about the level of pollution which be destroy fish and other life in our river but also about the impact of abstraction particularly from chalk stream so the new regulator will be engage with they sir jon have propose new mechanism for volunteer and campaigner to engage with the system that be not available previously we will consult on those in the autumn and move ahead with legislation follow that really welcome the water commission the efra committee have have each of the water boss in one by one and each struggle to explain why their industry prioritise bonus over fix broken pipe therefore really welcome the action that the government have take to ban bonus start with the bonus for the southern water boss lawrence gosden we be however disgusted to hear last week that he plan to take doubling in his salary an additional after oversee major water outage flood in hastings town centre and massive sewage dumping do the secretary of state agree that that be slap in the face to my constituent and that lawrence gosden should think very seriously about whether he take that salary increase my hon friend who be such strong campaigner on the water sector make very important point which she put very well consider that pay rise to be outrageous as do she it turn out that he be receive that pay increase under scheme that be permit by the regulator under the regime that the conservatives have in place and the payment he be get this year relate to the last year of the conservative government we have change the law so that no similar payment can be make in future south east water broad oak reservoir in canterbury which will also serve your constituency mr deputy speaker be not due to open until will my beleaguered resident and business in canterbury and part of whitstable have to put up with the drought and the leak in heatwave which have be unbearable for another eight year the hon lady be quite right to point to the problem that we be experience because of the lack of reservoir as say early we be speed up the consenting and the building of new reservoir so we have the mean to catch the rain when it be fall and can use it during dry period she refer to leak the investment that we have secure will reduce leak from water pipe so we can help to conserve water for the purpose for which it be intend welcome today statement be incredibly excited not least because we have the beautiful river trent which separate my constituency from staffordshire it be home to the staffordshire swooshers who have member from derbyshire they frequently have to avoid trent tan but they extol the virtue of open water swimming do the secretary of state agree that by have clean water we can encourage more great exercise to make the country healthy and improve wellbee trent tan be very alarming and graphic image but it capture what have go wrong with our water sector for so long the change that we be announce today will clean up our waterway across the country so that wild swimmer as well as many other people who like to enjoy our precious river lake and sea can get on and enjoy they without the kind of concern she allude to in my constituency last year there be sewage spill last for total of hour however contrary to the secretary of state early assertion we do not know the volume of that dumping because it be not monitor what step be the government take to impose target to reduce both the duration and the volume of individual spill we be increase monitoring to of all outlet note that representative from the conservative party will often try to take the credit for increase monitoring that be good thing to have do but what be not so good be to use it just to wave hello to the sewage as it float on by and do nothing about reduce it be afraid that the report feel like miss opportunity for the government to show the public whose side they be on it entrench privatised model that have already fail economically environmentally and democratically with to of bill go on service debt why be public ownership if it be good enough for rail gb energy and renewable not good enough for water we have to take rational not ideological approach to tackle this problem nationalise the water company would cost billion those be not figure as have see my hon friend claim from the water company they be provide by official in my department under the influence of nobody externally to pay that billion we would have to take it away from public service such as the national health service and education to hand it to the owner of the company that have be pollute our waterway that make no sense to and it make no sense to the public frankly be surprised that it make any sense to he warmly welcome the secretary of state announcement that he be go to merge all four water regulator into one however offer slight note of caution it be no good move the deckchair around the deck unless the situation have be improve when will he produce the white paper and what tooth will he give this single new super regulator welcome the hon member support in principle for sir jon cunliffe proposal which have accept to merge the four regulator water function into one single super regulator will publish the white paper contain the government full response during the autumn if the hon member would like to peruse the page document that sir jon have provide he will find separate recommendation in it many of which will significantly strengthen regulation so that the new regulator can enforce much more harshly against the kind of abuse that water company get away with in the past the environment food and rural affairs committee have hear unbelievable statement from major water company we also take long hard look at ofwat as sir jon cunliffe do and find regulator that be too cosy in deal with water company and too bureaucratic in deal with customer weak regulator and fragmented power have let the public down for far too long do the secretary of state agree that while the conservatives have fail and reform and the greens make unachievable unfunded promise it be this labour government who will call time on failure and protect bill payer my hon friend make very good point believe that one of the reason why the relationship between ofwat and the water company become far too cosy be the instruction that ofwat receive from ministers in the previous government to apply only light touch regulation when what be need be firm grip on what be go on it be astonishing that the conservatives think it be good idea to strip out resource and tell the regulator to go soft on the company give the abuse that be take place that have end now and we be move to model of effective regulation that will protect bill payer and clean up our river in express his opposition to the nationalisation of water just yesterday the secretary of state do not mention the fact that under scottish water bill in scotland be cheap or the fact that of scotland bathing water meet the quality standard expect no what he say of scottish water be that pollution in river in scotland be bad than in england have consult the house of commons library and just of river in england meet the quality standard expect whereas of scotland do trust in politics matter so he will correct the record today wo he as the right hon member correctly point out scotland have nationalise water company under the control of the snp government of course and water pollution be bad than in england as result be more than happy to write to he to give he the fact so that he can come back and correct the record in due course yesterday have lovely swim in the north sea off bamburgh castle and would like to thank the safer seas and rivers service for tell which beach to avoid due to sewage spill by northumbrian water not all my constituent swim but they all tell that the current situation be disgraceful they will not be read page report so could the secretary of state explain to they whether it be their fault for not accept high bill as tory former ministers and water uk say the water company fault for extract so much more value in the shape of dividend and bonus payment and load the company with debt than they put into they or because water be natural monopoly and incredibly difficult to regulate effectively in the private sector or be it both and be slightly confuse by that question if be honest my hon friend be very brave to go swim in the north sea but know that many people enjoy that the change that we be make will bring about effective regulation and appropriate level of investment and protect customer from the shocking bill hike that we see last year which be the direct result of year of failure by the conservative government be sure my hon friend constituent will welcome that thank the secretary of state for his statement environment agency datum show increase in serious pollution incident last year so the target of halve spill over five year would still mean nearly quarter of million sewage spill happen annually by when we drink glass of water we measure it by how much we drink not the time it take to drink to make real difference to place like chichester harbour and the river lavant in my constituency will the government look at the volume rather than the hour of spill happen the target for reduction use as its baseline the figure not the figure use by the previous government recognise the extent to which sewage pollution increase between and want to recognise the scale of the problem and then work to solve it from that point we have announce the most ambitious target for sewage pollution reduction of any government ever and that be not the end of our ambition there will be further to go until we restore all our waterway include the beautiful chichester harbour back to purity warmly welcome the secretary of state statement and the tough action he have announce resident in my community have suffer appal problem with sewage pollution in the thames the kennet and many other waterway as well as hour long interruption to supply to make matter bad resident have also suffer subsidence from water leak how will the new ombudsman help and my resident to tackle these very serious problem the new ombudsman will have statutory power to provide independent and free support to customer experience the kind of failure that my hon friend describe there be many other of course previously water be one of the only utility that do not have that resource available but it will do from now on we have also take step and introduce measure to increase compensation for people who have experience failure by their water company with compensation at least double and in some case increase tenfold the quality of river be about not just the water that go into it but the maintenance of the river itself my constituent have be fail over and over again by the environment agency in the maintenance of our waterway give the secretary of state enthusiasm for break apart quango will he consider bring power away from the ea so that we can manage our river properly and effectively the hon gentleman make an important point but gently remind he that it be his government who cut resource to the environment agency by which may well have have something to do with the fact that people be no long there to enforce against the kind of failing he talk about warmly welcome the secretary of state statement my constituent will be relieve as after year of tory failure and inaction water pollution from toxic sewage discharge be persistent problem in battersea and all the while their bill be be hike welcome the government take the necessary step and introduce reform of the water sector and protect my constituent will he say little more about when he intend to bring forward legislation be sure he agree that he be take long overdue action know battersea very well it be beautiful area and be aware of the problem with pollution of course she know all too well the concern of her resident about escalate bill as result of the failure of the previous government to get grip on the water sector we will be publish the white paper and launch the consultation this autumn which will be follow by legislation in the first half of this parliament my constituent have face an increase in their water bill without any improvement in the dumping of sewage in their river and brook or upgrade in their infrastructure what assurance can the government provide that those increase will not end up in the pocket of water company boss hope that the hon member will be reassure by the fact that have ringfence customer money so that it can no long be divert for payment of bonus and dividend as be commonplace under the previous government it will be spend only on what it be intend for which be invest in well water infrastructure if that do not happen it will be refund to customer more than year pupil from walter evans primary school in derby write to and the secretary of state worry about sewage dumping and plastic pollution in our river thank the secretary of state for his clear commitment that the government will halve pollution in our river by do he agree that have the conservatives take action of that kind when they come to power year ago my nine year old constituent would have know clean river all their life pay tribute to the young people of my hon friend constituency young people famously care about the environment and they be devastate to see the scale of pollution in our waterway that she describe we have take all these step and put in place the building block for change within year of win the general election the previous government have year they could have do exactly the same thing in any one of those year but as be show by the absence of the shadow secretary of state they just do not care enough this government commission review look at how to tinker with the conservatives fail privatised monopoly system but the truth be that it be moribund model that have result in billion be pay out to shareholder and billion in debt be load up and in crucial infrastructure be neglect mean that sewage be regularly pump into our river and sea do the secretary of state accept that the cost of that failure must be part of the calculation of the cost of bring water into public hand where it belong and that figure like billion be grossly inflate by those who do not think the water industry should pay for its greed and terrible mismanagement of our water system be afraid that the green party proposal would mean pay billion of taxpayer money to the owner of the water company that money would have to be take away from the national health service it would take year to unpick the current ownership model during which time pollution in our river would get much bad not well we know it do not work and we have only to look north of the border to see it under the nationalise model in scotland pollution be bad not well the hon member be talk about cut the national health service give billion to the owner of the current water company and make pollution far bad that do not sound very green to action to tackle the water company failure on long stand systemic problem be much need in my constituency where have be work with resident in brownsover who have face repeat burst pipe with some family force to move out multiple time and not receive the proper value of damaged property severn trent have now give timetable for action on the infrastructure welcome the introduction of new statutory water ombudsman to put the public as the secretary of state say at the heart of water regulation do he agree that where the conservatives fail the british consumer this labour government will protect they and put people before profit my hon friend be vocal champion for his constituent he be quite right to demand more compensation when outage happen and an ombudsman that be what the government will provide so that we can give well support to customer who be let down by the water company we be on the side of bill payer and the environment the previous government be on the side of neither between and untreated sewage be release just over time from scottish sewer overflow and more than half of wild swimming spot in scotland contain unsafe level of sewage so whatever model the government decide to adopt for the regulation of the water industry in england will the secretary of state assure that they will not follow the scottish government fail model completely agree with the hon member who accurately point to the failure of both the snp government in scotland and the nationalise model which do not fix the problem it be correct to analyse the failure of the regulator and to seek to replace they but rather think the secretary of state or one of his successor will be come back to discuss ownership structure after all under yorkshire water the first to pioneer hosepipe ban this year the pipe be leak like tetley teabag with more than billion litre of water leak in the last year alone what do he envisage if the new regulatory system fail and the ownership structure continue to produce the kind of problem we have see up and down the country will he have reserve power to take action against the owner of the company themselves probably to remove they there be system in place for when licence be breach it be call special administration the reason we be strengthen regulation and change the regulator be so that we can prevent such failure the billion that we secure at the end of last year will help to upgrade pipe so that we can reduce the amount of water leak out of the system and pay to build and dig out the new reservoir to catch the rain so that there be supply of water in the dry period understand the point the secretary of state make about the level of pollution and damage to our natural world and environment by the water industry over the past year and understand the need for regulation but do he not understand that he have not deal with the fundamental problem in the future private enterprise be still go to be make money out of public water supply would it not be well to bring it into public ownership and set share price base on the cost of pollution and on the exorbitant executive pay and bonus so that the public as whole can control their water supply and no long be leave to the vagary of the private sector with all the devastation and damage it have cause over the past year this government be go to do what work rather than what be ideologically correct we be not go to strip billion out of public service like the national health service to give it to the owner of the water company who have pollute our waterway we be not go to wait year to get investment in while pollution in our waterway get even bad and we be not go to let the pipe deteriorate to such an extent that bill payer be hit with even high bill in the future be go to act to deliver we low bill and clean water in the fast way possible what have happen to our waterway be national disgrace the state in which the conservatives leave our river our lake and the sea around britain epitomise what they do to public service in general do my right hon friend agree that what have be lack over the past year of privatisation be proper consumer representative to protect customer and will he give guarantee that that will be at front and centre of the new regulator my hon friend make an important point in sir jon cunliffe final report today he make recommendation for how customer can be put at the heart of the new model there be several recommendation will not go through all of they but one be to set up new regional entity where customer will have direct representation in take decision about how water infrastructure investment will be spend to tackle the priority in their own area my constituent campaigner at safeavon and tewkesbury friends of the earth will be delighted to see that at length the government have implement core liberal democrat manifesto pledge the abolition of ofwat will the secretary of state now go far and implement second pledge to put those campaigner on the board of severn trent so that they can hold the water company to account and continue to show my constituent that liberal democrat pressure pay off welcome the liberal democrats conversion when they be in government and when the water minister be indeed liberal democrat they commission report that find there be no need to change the model of regulation many people will find it incredible that cunliffe be not even allow to look at public ownership also say mildly to the secretary of state that the billion he cite have largely be refute by independent body and economist way back in raise the example of northumbrian water and its use of various complicated device for tax avoidance that become endemic within the industry can we have report on the water company role in tax avoidance on massive scale so that we can then look at what further action could be take against they agree with the right hon member on one point that we should be crack down on tax avoidance it be always worth look into that on his early point be much more interested in the purity of our water than the purity of our ideology the figure of billion as the cost of buy out the water company if any government want to nationalise they be provide by official in my department with no external influence on they this country can not afford it and we also can not afford the worsening of sewage in our waterway during the year it would take to unpick the current model of ownership the minister say he want nine more reservoir but can he say how many of that number be already under construction or in the planning process when we can expect to see they and who will pay also be it his view that sir jon cunliffe predict uplift of more than in real term for water bill payer will be cover the cost would be more than happy to write to the right hon member with the detail he be ask for but as have say early we be also speed up the planning process and treat reservoir as nationally significant infrastructure mean that as the secretary of state will take the consent decision so that we can do this in month rather than the year or even decade it have be take up till now the village of upper tean frequently suffer flooding and sewage outflow and one reason be that the antiquated main water infrastructure can not adequately cope with the increase amount of new housing development even when the developer meet all the require mitigation recommendation in the report state comprehensive system planning framework should be introduce the report also state plan should consider the region or nation spatial development priority particularly those which be likely to have significant impact on the water system such as housing development do the minister agree that give the government plan to build million home it be vital that privatised water company ensure that they can adequately meet system demand without sewage dumping and that they prioritise do so over profiteer my hon friend make an important point because of course water infrastructure be critical for housing development economic development and economic growth in every single region of the country today have accept in principle one of sir jon recommendation that will allow we for the first time to align water infrastructure investment and spatial planning so that those home and factory can be build fast for the benefit of local people very much welcome the proposal today announcement be step forward in tackle the sewage crisis but of course the detail will be in the delivery that be important especially as the river ver precious chalk stream in my constituency have receive nearly hour of sewage in the last year some of that be hour non stop we do not know the volume but we know it be terrible will the secretary of state meet to see how the proposal can help to prioritise the desperately need upgrade of the markyate sewage work know the river ver very well because use to walk over bridge across it every day on my way to school while be grow up would be very happy to make sure that the hon member have an appropriate meeting with minister to discuss her concern be pleased to see today report believe it have picture of the bingley five rise lock in my constituency on the front cover so thank the minister for that the creaking and leak water infrastructure the current drought restriction and the dumping of sewage in our river include the aire and the wharfe be evidence of fail industry and of the failure of previous tory water ministers one of whom be sit on the opposition front bench welcome today report and also give credit to campaign group like the ilkley clean river group and the people water commission it be right that the secretary of state have say that he will abolish ofwat and strengthen oversight and regulation but yorkshire water have labyrinth of hold company that have build up debt take out dividend and interest payment put up customer bill and fail to invest in upgrade do the secretary of state agree that it be time for radical action not only to merge the regulator but to restructure fail company like yorkshire water can not take credit for the picture that be sir jon but can join my hon friend in credit the campaign group who have do such fantastic job at keep this issue at the top of the political agenda sir jon make proposal in his report about those labyrinthine structure that she be talk about we need clarity and transparency and that be what we will now work towards between and there be over incident of sewage overflow in dewsbury and batley amount to over hour bill for my constituent and yorkshire water customer have go up by in the last five year and by nearly in the last month some billion have be take in dividend by all the water company in the uk with billion of that saddle on to the company themselves what step be the secretary of state take to reduce the bill of my constituent and resident of the whole united kingdom and what step will he take to claw back that billion so it can be invest to fix the pipe be grateful to the hon member for make that important point his constituent just like people right across the country be last year force to pay the price of year of conservative failure because the conservatives allow the company to pay out million in dividend and bonus when that money should have be invest in upgrade infrastructure have ringfence customer money so that it will now only be spend on the purpose for which it be intend otherwise it will be return to customer on crooked bridge road in my constituency of stafford eccleshall and the village it have take the county council far too long to accept responsibility for faulty pipe the buck have be pass between the council and severn trent and the investigative work will not even start till august will the commission consider intervene in case where the buck be repeatedly pass back and forth in order to ensure that urgent work can get under way my hon friend make an important point buck passing should not be allow to continue we be move to new regional structure that will bring together the regulator customer advocacy group business and local authority to place where those kind of issue can be resolve we welcome the government commitment to cut water bill by in the next three year however give the stark increase that consumer have pay because of fail water company finance this commitment will not touch the side especially for the most vulnerable customer will the secretary of state do what conservative ministers fail to do commit to implement single social tariff for water bill to help eliminate water poverty of course social tariff already exist within the individual water company sir jon have make recommendation about that we will consult on that later in the year and then take decision as we bring forward legislation in the new year it be shame that no one be here from the reform party to explain its proposal for the water company its member might have manage to be more eloquent than their leader be on tv yesterday reform unfunded spending commitment would send mortgage through the roof and take money away from the nhs school police and our armed force will the secretary of state tell we how much he think reform proposal would cost and comment on whether he think reform have clue about this policy area as its member can not even be bother to be in the chamber agree with my hon friend it be shame that no reform members have turn up although perhaps it be not surprising because they do not bother mention this issue in their manifesto either we do hear at the weekend that their leader the hon member for clacton nigel farage want to hand billion of taxpayer money to the owner of water company if we add that to its exist billion of unfunded commitment it come to billion by my reckoning that be almost double the amount that liz truss bet and lose on the economy when she crash it and send mortgage price and rent skyrocket reform want to double down on the bad bet be genuinely all ear for any practical step that can be take to build on the environment act to clean up our waterway but may pick up the secretary of state comment on the role as he put it of citizen scientist and local community in my constituency water hero like doug kennedy who join in nether winchendon test the river thame few week ago have decade of real local knowledge on our waterway as do the volunteer of the river thame conservation trust that powerhouse of local knowledge will be replicate up and down the country rather than just involve they as consultee will the secretary of state reflect on how they can get properly lock into local solution to clean up our waterway support what the hon gentleman say about the environment act which be worthwhile piece of legislation pass by the previous government also support what he say about ensure that people have more involvement at community level will certainly take that on board as we work through the consultation my constituent want to know that their drinking water be safe and that waterway such as the river trent be clean and look after welcome all the secretary of state commitment on the new regulatory body but he will know that the power of regulator be not just in its power but in its ability to enforce they will the regulator have the resource to enforce the new rule that he propose it need to be more than the sum of the part of its predecessor which fail as so many of my constituent have see thank my hon friend for important question we have already introduce the polluter pay principle so where there be successful prosecution and enforcement action against water company they pay the price for that enforcement that fund the additional resource to allow further investigation and if necessary prosecution to go ahead what contrast with the previous government who slash those resource in half from saturday night to monday morning main burst on richmond hill in my constituency go unattended result in resident be leave without gas supply as water leak into the gas pipeline burst pipe sewage dumping follow storm overflow have now become customary last year alone hour worth of sewage be discharge into river and waterway in my constituency thames water have be allow to get away with such negligent and environmentally hazardous practice for far too long while ofwat have stand by and watch early this year freedom of information request uncover that ofwat have not recoup single penny from the financial sanction it have place on thames water now that the government have finally realise that ofwat must be replace will the minister set out timeline for the implementation of the review recommendation of new regulator agree with much of what the hon lady say her constituent be experience what constituent across the country be experience it be not acceptable and it will not continue we will publish the white paper in the autumn with consultation alongside it and we intend to move to legislation during the first half of this parliament clean up our river lake and sea could not be more important have serve on the water special measures bill committee be glad that our government have move so quickly to begin that vital work welcome the further measure announce today will my right hon friend confirm that he will bring in the next change as quickly as possible agree it be important that these change be bring in as quickly as possible the state of our water sector give the level of pollution in our waterway and the unacceptable bill hike that customer experience last year be national scandal we can not allow thing to continue we will move at the great possible speed and be sure that my hon friend will hold our foot to the fire as the secretary of state and the minister for water and flooding will know sewage be major issue in my constituency as we have hear the government plan to build million new home ten of thousand of which will be in my area lot of people be understandably concerned that south west water will not keep pace with development so what guarantee can the secretary of state give that south west water will put in the require infrastructure the hon gentleman make an important point the recommendation that have accept will create new regional structure under which water infrastructure investment will align with spatial planning so that we can guarantee that in the future however that legislation be not yet in place so have set up water infrastructure board in the department it will ensure that water company be put in infrastructure where opportunity for housing development and other form of economic growth can take place welcome the statement resident in dartford will be impress by the government ambitious commitment to halve sewage pollution in our lake river and sea within five year they have have to put up with the poor performance of thames water for too long do the secretary of state agree that unlike the conservative party which have year to fix this and unlike reform which appear to have no idea how to fix it when the labour government say that we will clean up our water and protect the british bill payer we mean it my hon friend rightly point to sewage get bad and bill rise every year for year under the previous government we be turn the tide on tory sewage today and over the next five year resident in dartford and elsewhere will see reduction in sewage until we meet our target thank the secretary of state very much for his statement yesterday on the laura kuenssberg show he show positivity in relation to the new strategy and the step to be take certainly make sense however water in northern ireland be still publicly own yet we still have the same difficulty that the government be seek to combat here so my question to the secretary of state be simple one will he do favour and speak to the relevant minister at the northern ireland assembly andrew muir to ensure that we in northern ireland have the same result as what be go to happen here with the require change to infrastructure give more responsibility and output the change that be make with the positivity the secretary of state have show that would take care of some of our difficulty in northern ireland thank the hon gentleman for his question speak regularly with my counterpart in northern ireland and be more than happy to convey his message to they the next time speak to they as someone who enjoy swim in cumbria lake river and tarn welcome the secretary of state ambitious commitment to halve sewage pollution in they can he say more about how unlike the conservatives who do nothing for year and unlike reform moon on stick approach to reform when he say he have plan to protect water consumer and protect water user he actually mean it thank my hon friend for her question voter want to see action not just word that be why be so proud that that billion of investment that we have secure start to be spend in april it be already be invest people will see the change as result of this that will help to restore their confidence and their trust in politic so shattered after year of the conservatives can the secretary of state publish the datum that quantify the amount lose in leak so that the public can understand exactly how much water and how much of their hard earn money be lose it will also help the water company to focus on fix their pipe it be no good just build another reservoir as they might do in my area if the water just continue to be lose en route to where it be need the hon lady be right transparency be always very important believe that datum be available and be happy to write to direct she to it so she can share the information with her constituent for far too long family in scarborough and whitby have be pay the price of failure yorkshire water be recently force to pay out million due to serious failing yet few day later customer bill rise by almost third will my right hon friend say little more to reassure my constituent that national social tariff be now on the card for those on low income we always want to support those on low income and those who may be experience water poverty nobody should be worried about their water bill because their income be too low social tariff already exist in every region we will be consult on the proposal for national social tariff which the independent water commission have propose in its final report citizen and family in my city of birmingham be currently pay an average of year for their water bill increase to by the end of this parliament term we know that the cost of living be spiral out of control and while family struggle with the cost of living big bonus be be take by chief executive and shareholder will the secretary of state consider bring water back into public ownership give that more than of the british public be ask for that nationalise the water company would as have already say cost billion money that we would have to strip out of the national health service and education in order to hand to the people who own the water company that have be pollute our waterway it be not an idea that commend itself to be afraid calder valley have see near flood and hosepipe ban meanwhile in yorkshire have see sewage spill last over hour do this mean an end to useless regulator that be preside over fail industry well the answer to that question be very quick yes it do draw the house attention to my entry in the register as be an office holder on the all party parliamentary water group last year at the first prime minister question of the session draw the prime minister attention to the fact that thames water have pump sewage into the river evenlode for hour in the previous year call then for the scrapping of ofwat and be delighted that the secretary of state have listen to my party and so many campaigner by do so today thames water have pump further hour worth of sewage into the same river in the intervene period however which be why the evenlode catchment partnership have take to citizen science to try to measure those figure the secretary of state set out that he wish to halve the number of spill but why be he not seek to halve their volume and quantity for that be what be kill our river our target for sewage reduction be the most ambitious target put forward by any government in our country history and be very proud of that it be an important step stone to restore our river lake and sea to the good health and purity that many of we will remember from when we be young welcome my right hon friend statement which be detailed practical and focus on outcome that be in stark contrast to the ludicrous back of fag packet policy of the hon member for clacton nigel farage who claim yesterday that he would simultaneously nationalise half the water industry without know how much it would cost and bring in more business people to run it the people who have be free to run up debt force up bill dump sewage and leave pipe break reservoir dry and our lake sea and river filthy such people include of course the chief executive of southern water lawrence gosden who have million pay package that he should hand back as my hon friend the member for hastings and rye helena dollimore point out however how will the government answer the people who say that these proposal do not go far enough and will still leave our precious water lake and sea in the hand of shyster and spiv my hon friend be right to point out that the hon member for clacton nigel farage by his own admission have no idea and no clue about this issue my hon friend be also right that the proposal be detailed sir jon provide page report with separate recommendation that we will consult on when we implement final version it will be the big overhaul to our water sector in more than generation we will reset it from top to bottom so we have water sector that work on the side of customer the environment and investor rather than the serial failure that we witness under the previous government the derwent run through the heart of derby but thank to the pollute water company and the tories its health be in serious doubt can the secretary of state reassure my constituent that this labour government be commit to take the robust action that be desperately need to restore the river and preserve it for our community to enjoy safely the state of the river derwent be alas similar to many other river lake and sea up and down the country that be why we be launch water revolution today to completely reset the water sector from top to bottom so that the failing of the past can never happen again norfolk be home to many beautiful beach and river but as in many area people be concerned about the state of their water the cow tower dippers in norwich be apply for designate swim status which would mean that anglian water be oblige to monitor the water that be one specific example but can the secretary of state expand on how the reform will help local group to hold water company to account and speed up such process by monitor every single outlet and make that visible to people across the country campaigner and resident we will open up the system with far great transparency than have previously be the case last week it be reveal that the chief executive of southern water be award an egregious enormous pay rise worth hundred of thousand of pound despite the company continue to oversee sewage spill and infrastructure failure that affect my constituent do the secretary of state agree that water boss should not profit from oversee catastrophic failure absolutely agree with my hon friend and share his sentiment that the payment be outrageous it be possible as part of scheme that be permit under the regulatory regime allow by the previous government we have change the law it will not happen again commend the secretary of state on the action in his statement to hold water company to account not least with the new regulator and ombudsman scotland widespread water pollution challenge be far great than england particularly the sewage relate pollution in our river and on our beach scottish water be publicly own but scottish ministers be fail to take the problem seriously with inadequate monitoring do the secretary of state agree that scotland need to take similar urgent action which only new direction under scottish labour can deliver agree with my hon friend we have an example early of the complacency with which the snp treat these kind of issue there be only one chance now in scotland for reset the election of scottish labour government in holyrood to work to clean up pollution from our river lake and sea as we be do my constituent have be hit by massive rise in bill which be real kick in the tooth give that thousand of they be without water after major burst early this year warmly welcome the secretary of state commitment to devolve the economic regulation of water to wales which will allow the welsh government to move forward with the commission recommendation on have an independent economic regulator in wales do he agree that that demonstrate the value of two labour governments work together for bill payer in wales agree with my hon friend understand that the welsh deputy first minister have lay statement before the senedd today give his comment on sir jon report thank the secretary of state for everything he be do to transform water company across our country my resident in gillingham and rainham have suffer astronomical hike in their bill and have be expose to pollution and sewage dump in our water yet the chief executive of southern water think that he deserve bonus of approximately on top of his salary do the secretary of state agree that that be an absolute disgrace will he ensure that any loophole use to bring forward those bonus be shut down under his reform agree with my hon friend that that be disgraceful be afraid that these problem arise because the previous government instruct the regulator to apply only light touch approach to regulation when they really need to get an absolute grip on this fail sector the previous government fail to do that but this government will ensure that that happen many of my constituent share my utter disgust at the way in which water company have be able to profit from degrade our river and chalk stream it be fantastic to see bonus already ban at pollute anglian water and to see that we be follow up by take action and sack regulator that be asleep at the wheel as we start on really ambitious reform to halve sewage spill over the come year how can we ensure that we be tighten up some of those monitoring procedure so that my constituent can see clearly and transparently whether we be feel the benefit locally monitoring will now be compulsory on every single outlet not just some of they that datum will be publish in near real time so that consumer know exactly what be go into the waterway in the area where they live or where they be on holiday warmly welcome the statement and the work of the government portsmouth as an island city be well aware of the damage do we see it we smell it and we feel it in our pocket every day more than of my constituent have raise their fury and disappointment at the way that the tories allow firm to extract billion and pump raw sewage abolishing ofwat and have an independent water commissioner be another brilliant step that will have real tooth and serve customer will the secretary of state confirm that this government will ensure action that we do not just monitor we take action that there be no light touch and we take action that our action ensure that fair water company serve the public interest first will he meet and my resident david taylor brilliant campaigner and inventor to explore how we not only stop sewage pumping but reduce leak assume that be not my hon friend the member for hemel hempstead david taylor but another david taylor be happy to ensure that my hon friend the member for portsmouth north amanda martin get that meeting let take this opportunity to thank she for be such champion for her resident and her constituency have have the honour of visit couple of time and have see how strongly she fight for clean water in her community very much welcome the secretary of state focus on protect water customer because my constituent and have see our thames water bill go up dramatically we want to know that those bill increase be go towards improve the infrastructure and customer service as oppose to payout to boss that happen so much under the regulator watch have meeting with thames water boss in their read headquarters next week follow that meeting will the secretary of state meet and fellow labour mp work on the issue to discuss how we can well hold thames water to account on behalf of all our constituent be more than happy to make sure my hon friend get meeting with an appropriate minister be sure she will be pleased to know that this government have ringfence customer money so that it can only be spend on the purpose it be intend for include upgrade break and leak pipe and will no long be divert to pay for bonus and dividend as use to happen under the previous government what pleasure it be to welcome the secretary of state to the water meadow in bury st edmunds the lark and the linnet in bury st edmunds and the gipping in stowmarket be disgracefully neglect and my own laboratory test reveal

have drive palestinians out of of gaza leave around million people trap in an area scarcely over square mile whatever this israeli government might claim repeat displacement of so many civilian be not keep they safe in fact it be quite the reverse the new israeli aid system be inhumane and dangerous and it deprive gazans of human dignity it contradict long establish humanitarian principle it create disorder that hamas be now exploit with distribution point reduce from to just four it force desperate civilian child among they to scramble unsafely for the essential of life it be grotesque spectacle wreak terrible human cost almost civilian have be kill since may seek aid include this weekend alone there be near daily report of israeli troop open fire on people try to access food israeli jet have hit woman and child wait for health clinic to open an israeli drone have strike down child fill water container which israeli official blame on technical error hamas be of course contribute to the chaos and take advantage of it but utterly condemn the killing of civilian seek to meet their basic need the israeli government must answer what possible military justification can there be for strike that have kill desperate starve child what immediate action be they take to stop this litany of horror what will they do to hold those responsible to account be steadfast supporter of israel security and right to exist treasure the many connection between our people and the horror of october must never be forget but firmly believe that the israeli government action be do untold damage to israel stand in the world and undermine israel long term security netanyahu should listen to the israeli people some of whom desperately want ceasefire and to the hostage family because they know ceasefire offer the good chance to bring their love one home those hostage may be hide in cramp tunnel under the ruin of gaza but we will not forget they or hamas despicable action and we will continue to demand their unconditional release this offensive put they in grave danger but still netanyahu persist indeed minister katz have go far propose to drive gaza entire population into rafah imprison palestinians unless they be persuade to emigrate this be cruel vision that must never come to pass and condemn it unequivocally permanent forced displacement be violation of international humanitarian law many israelis themselves be appalled as the former israeli prime minister ehud barak say it march we into the abyss he be right today join statement with foreign ministers as signatory it have simple urgent message the war in gaza must end now there be no military solution negotiation will secure the hostage far bloodshed serve no purpose hamas and israel must both commit

condition be true hero they deserve the thank and admiration of the entire house we be also work multilaterally the truck from the world food programme and unicef enter gaza in recent day include food supply fund by the uk thousands more truck laden with aid pay for by british taxpayer can enter the moment that the israeli government let they in today be announce an extra million for humanitarian assistance in gaza this year include million for uk med to sustain its vital operation in gaza and save more life accompany the horror in gaza be an accelerate campaign to prevent future palestinian state in the west bank it be embrace by netanyahu encourage by his ministers and drive by an extremist ideology that want to suffocate the two state solution which be the only route to last peace and security we see it in the unprecedented pace of settlement expansion and in the shocking level of settler violence and even settl terrorism for that be what the most egregious ideological attack be the deliberate attempt to squeeze the palestinian authority unjustly deny they access to their own fund harm israel long term interest in the process now the israeli government be reintroduce plan to construct new unit in the area of occupy east jerusalem if build that settlement would separate the west bank north from its south and palestinians in the west bank from east jerusalem these plan be wholly unacceptable they be illegal and they must not happen we be strive to keep open the prospect of two state solution uk assistance have be preserve the palestinian authority contribute to essential palestinian worker salary and support they to progress critical reform today can confirm that we be enhance our support provide million to strengthen the palestinian authority and palestinian governance implement the agreement sign by and prime minister mustafa early this year and deliver the reform plan that president abbas have set out can also confirm that we be provide million to support the united nations relief and works agency many service for palestinian refugee alongside that support we be lead diplomatic effort to show that there must be viable peaceful pathway to palestinian state involve the palestinian authority not hamas in the security and governance of the area hamas can have no role in the governance of gaza and nor must it be allow to use it as launchpad for terrorism israeli ministers should support the palestinian authority not actively undermine their economy as ministers ben gvir and smotrich be do the uk be co lead with egypt the humanitarian and reconstruction track for the forthcoming two state solution conference and we be push to agree plan for credible next phase in gaza with responsible reform pa at their core so that we can turn any temporary ceasefire into last peace in our year in office this labour government have act to address this horrendous conflict we restore funding to unrwa after the tories freeze it we suspend arm export licence when the tories have decline to act we have provide nearly quarter of billion in humanitarian assistance this year and next get medical treatment and food to hundred of thousand of civilian in gaza we have stand with the hostage family at every stage we have work with jordan to fly medicine into gaza with egypt to treat medically evacuate civilian and with kuwait and unicef to help child in gaza we have deliver three sanction package on violent settler suspend trade negotiation with the israeli government and sanction far right israeli ministers for incitement we have defend the independence of the international court we have sign landmark agreement with the palestinian authority and host the palestinian prime minister in london push for the reform they need we call for work for and vote for an immediate ceasefire and the release of the hostage at every possible opportunity and we will keep do so until this war be over hamas release the hostage and we finally have pathway to two state solution commend this statement to the house call the shadow secretary of state be grateful to the foreign secretary for advance sight of his statement the violence loss of life and conflict that continue in the middle east shock we all event in the middle east have direct impact on our national interest and on people live on our own country from concern about family member in the region to demonstration on our street and from the threat from iran to the rise of antisemitism we on the opposition side of the house be clear that we want to see an end to the conflict in gaza we want to see the return of the hostage the humanitarian support which be so desperately need must get in there must be an end to the terror inflict by hamas and iran however the reality of peace and sustainable end to the conflict in gaza seem to be drift far away what be britain role when it come to workable outcome and practical solution to advance an end to this conflict and what diplomatic action be be take with regional ally and the united states where be britain voice and action when it come to put new pressure on hamas to agree to the most recent us proposal to secure ceasefire and release the hostage who have be in cruel captivity for more than day as for the statement that the foreign secretary sign early today can he explain what an unconditional and permanent ceasefire mean for hamas and the palestinian authority last week meet keith and aviva siegel and hear about their harrowing experience of be hold in brutal captivity by hamas pay tribute to they for their incredible bravery and resilience and for their dedication to secure the freedom of the remain hostage from gali and ziv berman to matan angrest and omri miran and all those be hold in barbaric captivity they must be return to their love one the hostage be be deny humanitarian access by hamas what be the government do about that and when be the foreign secretary last intervention on the issue the situation relate to aid for gaza have deteriorate beyond all rational comprehension the daily report of casualty seek aid be appal and we utterly condemn these attack but our word and political statement of condemnation be not save life so what practical solution proposal and option have the foreign secretary and the british government discuss with israel in respect of aid supply into gaza what dialogue be there to find agreement on the opening of access for that aid that go beyond the current dangerous approach remind the house that the last conservative government through lord cameron secured new aid route and well aid access to save life surely the desperate urgency of the situation which we all see call for such option to be consider once again reiterate our long stand position that settlement be not helpful to achieve long term peace israel should not take step that could make two state solution more difficult and must use its legal system to clamp down on settler violence we want two state solution that guarantee security and stability for both israelis and palestinians and be sure the foreign secretary agree that it should come only at time that be conducive to peace and can not be the start of peace process certainly not while israeli hostage be still in captivity in gaza do he agree that there need to be clear plan and international measure to see the exit of hamas from gaza as for syria the barbaric violence that we have witness in recent day can not continue all group and minority in syria must be protect the foreign secretary mention his recent discussion with the transitional syrian leadership do he convey to those in charge that they have responsibility to end the armed conflict in their country and guarantee the protection of all minority group in syria before the international community remove sanction and normalise diplomatic relationship what assurance have he receive from the transitional government and have those commitment be meet in any way with measurable action will he update the house on whether any of the million dedicate to syria that be announce by the government early this month will be use to deal with the aftermath of these late clash and on how it will be spend do he deem sufficient action to have be take by the interim government on the destruction of chemical weapon do he believe that the tahrir al sham government be capable of secure syria border and do he intend to change the proscribe status of hts what be his assessment of the effect of the sanction that have already be lift have they have any unintended side effect syria future still hang in the balance and we need to be wholly evidence lead in our approach the foreign secretary do not mention iran but we understand from report that iran britain france and germany be due to hold nuclear talk in istanbul on friday what be the purpose of those talk be he co ordinating action with the united states and what be the content of the deal that he want to see be grateful to the shadow foreign secretary for the tone of her remark and be grateful for the cross party consensus in the house that this war must come to an end note the huge concern that we all feel not just in the house but in the international community about the humanitarian suffering that we continue to see the right hon lady ask what more could be do and pray in aid the work of the former foreign secretary lord cameron she will recognise that lord cameron and before he the right hon member for braintree sir james cleverly raise the humanitarian situation with the israelis it have become steadily bad the number of aid point be now down to four and while the new foundation be offer aid people be die as they scramble for that aid note that the right hon lady do not say we should return to the aid point that we have in the past and she will note that her government do not refund funding to the united nations relief and works agency but we believe that the un and its system be well place to deliver aid to gaza and that be the position that we continue to maintain against that backdrop the right hon lady ask what we be do on multilateral basis and what we be do in work with other to bring this to an end ask she to read the statement that have land which country have now sign up to of course we be press and work with colleague speak to minister once again today urge he to do the right thing to secure ceasefire but also to look at the aid system that be not work as for governance the right hon lady will know that in couple of week time we will participate in the two state conference that have be organise by france and she will also know that that conference be now dedicate to look closely at the governance arrangement that must be put in place when hamas leave and they must go they can not govern gaza how do we ensure that it be not day pause but that we bring an end to this and move to the two state solution the right hon lady know our commitment to recognition as set out in our manifesto and the conversation about recognition that be go on internationally the right hon lady rightly press the case on syria when meet al sharaa make it absolutely clear that his government have to be inclusive press he on his background as terrorist and on our concern the concern that exist in this chamber but we must work with he to ensure that the government be inclusive and to ensure that security be fundamental as the right hon lady will understand there be much that we need to do to support they on counter terrorism at this time and in country where of people be live in poverty to ensure that people receive the aid and support that they need and indeed that that aid and support go to the area affect by the murder we have see over the last few day call the chair of the foreign affairs committee early today country put out powerful message the war must end now aid must go into gaza unrestricte the hostage must be release and all party must uphold international law that powerful message be send to israel and by return it be reject it be denounce by israel as be disconnect from reality so what now in that statement the nation say we be prepared to take further action to support an immediate ceasefire and political pathway to security and peace for israelis palestinians and the entire region what be we go to do may ask and do that include the final recognition of palestine my right hon friend be right to call into question so quickly the israeli government rejection of the advice of their friend and country which have come together to express their horror at people lose their life when simply reach out to get aid and humanitarian care she refer to the debate about recognition we will be work with our french colleague who be focus the upcoming conference on how we get to two state as she would expect the uk will play its part on the broad issue hope and pray that we get ceasefire and of course that will lead to further activity as we head towards the un general assembly call the liberal democrat spokesman thank the foreign secretary for advance sight of his statement welcome his commitment to diplomatic resolution in syria and to hold the government of syria and israel accountable for protect all civilian especially minority the foreign secretary be right to say that the situation in gaza be inhumane and grotesque and that ceasefire be desperately need welcome the aid allocation that he have announce but the problem be that the situation be not new and that repeat expression of regret by this government have not prevent further carnage from be work by the netanyahu government the whole house see the passion with which the right hon gentleman announce the british french and canadian joint position on may and with which the under secretary of state for foreign commonwealth and development affairs the hon member for lincoln mr falconer sanction ministers smotrich and ben gvir on june in those statement ministers say that we can not stand by and that they would respond not just with word but with action official report june vol think they mean it and yet two month later the secretary of state have only word not action once again his joint statement with other country say only that we be prepared to take further action and yet child queue for food or water be still be kill every single day as the israeli cabinet maintain its grotesque blockade of humanitarian aid it now propose an open air prison for all gazans which accord to ehud olmert would amount to ethnic cleansing today speak to the oxfordshire doctor nick maynard and nada al hadithy from nasser hospital in gaza they describe the desperation of civilian face the late israeli attack on deir al balah and the death of patient for want of basic dressing and say that idf sniper fire directly into the hospital compound yet settler in the west bank continue illegally to occupy palestinian home and land and the remain hostage who have be hold in gaza for over day at the hand of hamas terrorist be no close to release have write to the foreign secretary frequently to set out the many more step that liberal democrats believe he should take so will simply ask he this do he truly believe that his government be do all they can to put an end to the terrible violence and starvation be visit on gaza in clear contravention of international law can he explain why there have be so few consequence since he and the under secretary of state speak so powerfully in the last two month and can he dispel the widespread view that he be not set the policy he would choose but that he be instead be rein in by no desire not to upset president trump by act more boldly associate myself with much that the hon gentleman say it be source of great regret to that we have not bring this most horrendous of war and conflict to an end my right hon friend the member for islington south and finsbury emily thornberry who chair the foreign affairs committee refer to the israeli government response to the statement sign by country which have not hear because have be sit in this chamber that ignore of the international community be tarnish greatly the reputation of israel list in my statement the action that this government have take in the last year since come into office the hon gentleman know that this government have lead much of the multilateral effort and that sit behind both the leader statement few week ago and the foreign secretaries statement today we will continue to press we continue of course to look at what far we may need to do as he would expect wish could say that if we be to recognise tomorrow it would bring this war to an end but be afraid be not sure that be the case what be require now be painstaking diplomacy to get to ceasefire and my assessment be that we will not see that ceasefire until the knesset rise rise order once again very large number of hon member wish to take part in this discussion the intention be to try to accommodate everybody but that will mean member exercise degree of self restraint that be not entirely evident during the previous statement leave it to you but if you want everybody to be call then please we need question not statement if may say so foreign secretary we also need relatively brief answer the statement we have from the or partner take we no far forward it say we be prepared to take further action to support an immediate ceasefire people want action not more repetition of we call for we demand and we urge we want action and this be not action we have have this so many time before we have this terrible humanitarian crisis the forcible transfer of civilian and starvation by israel how can it be that we have situation in which the idf be fire at child and systematically go for the head stomach and testicle for their sport and in which rafah have be raze to the ground and this euphemistic humanitarian city be be construct which the former prime minister of israel have call concentration camp when be we go to take the appropriate action to bring about comprehensive trade and arm embargo and concentrate the mind of israel nothing else be work they be not listen and they be get away with murder every single day the hon gentleman clearly do not listen to word that say but be sure that the foreign secretary do understand my hon friend frustration and he have be consistent for very long time as have say regret that we be not in place where we currently have ceasefire despite the international community call for one and the pressure that exist he be right what we be see at the moment be an abomination and join he in those remark call the father of the house of course we all condemn the evil hamas but be not prime minister netanyahu the big recruiting sergeant for hamas for every fighter he kill he be radicalise the whole world against the state of israel because of this appalling humanitarian solution agree with everything the foreign secretary say but be word enough wonder whether he will oblige the house and allow free vote which bet would pass by an enormous majority on motion for further action against the extreme right wing action of prime minister netanyahu sanction and recognition of the state of palestine hope that the israeli government be watch and note what senior parliamentarian on both side of this house be say the right hon gentleman will know that of the population now want ceasefire and he will have see the remark of former prime ministers and of all the opposition in israel who condemn the most recent proposal suggest by minister katz early this month host in parliament dr waseem saeed british surgeon who have return from work in the nasser hospital in gaza where he treat child for severe burn amputation and shrapnel wound that be crawl with maggot he show we video that would shock everybody in this house do the foreign secretary agree that israel should face reckoning in the court for such injury and death and that the uk should force such reckoning more importantly do he agree that recognise state of palestine be really about recognise the humanity of the palestinian people and that their child deserve to have equal worth to every child on this planet agree with my hon friend that the palestinian cause be just cause and would ask the israeli government to reflect again on international humanitarian law have in front of practitioner legal handbook and be hugely concerned as read through it that it feel that there be breach the death of those try to access aid in gaza be truly shocking the foreign secretary will be aware that the number of civilian kill be be dispute by israel and there be suggestion of disinformation do he agree that one way in which we could establish what be actually happen be if international media organisation like the bbc and reuters be allow full access to gaza yes each time member come together for statement on the middle east there be new horror to comment on new inhumanity unfolding and new form of strong word from the dispatch box last week idf shell hit church shelter civilian several people be kill the pope call it barbarity yesterday world food programme convoy come under fire from israeli force despite numerous assurance that humanitarian operational condition would improve innocent palestinians who be queue for desperately need food be kill accord to médecins sans frontières we be witness in real time the creation of condition for the eradication of palestinian life in gaza so ask the foreign secretary where be this government red line at what point do our basic humanity require we to take strong action many of we in this house think the red line be pass long time ago remind my hon friend of the action that this government have take and how we have try to lead in the international community on this issue also join she in condemn what we have see in relation to civilian page of conflict hunger and international humanitarian law practitioner legal handbook make it clear that party to armed conflict must take constant care in the conduct of military operation to spare the civilian population civilian and civilian object clearly that be not happen like other in this house be frankly astonish at the statement of the foreign secretary at time when we have get daily lynching and expulsion on the west bank and dozen be murder as they beg for aid be just beyond word at his inaction and frankly complicity by inaction he say himself that there be massive prison camp be construct in the south of gaza and he know that lead genocide scholar from across the world be ring the alarm bell yet he have the temerity to show up in this house and wave his cheque book as if that be go to salve his conscience can he not see that his inaction and frankly cowardice be make this country irrelevant can he also not see the personal risk to he give our international obligation that he may end up at the hague because of his inaction finally frankly make an appeal to labour back benchers we can not get your leadership to change their mind only you can if you organise and insist on change order before bring in the foreign secretary remind member that we have other business to proceed with tonight so please keep question and answer short understand the fury that the right hon gentleman feel but have to tell he why do you feel it have to tell he that it demean his argument when he personalise it in the way that he do it be unbecoming and not something the house expect particularly of its more senior member we have see again image of child die of starvation and malnutrition and this come after month of warning from the un system about the catastrophic humanitarian situation in gaza welcome the foreign secretary announcement of more aid but we know that the gaza humanitarian foundation will not allow in more uk aid he say to day ago at the foreign affairs committee that if there be not ceasefire he would consider further action against israel as we have see the israelis respond to the call for ceasefire by launch new offensive in deir al balah what further action will we take to try to end this catastrophic situation we have actually be able to get in some further aid with the world food programme and of course that be important it be also right to say that with our funding of uk med we have be able to save life of course we must endeavour every single day to make the humanitarian situation well the foreign secretary appear before the foreign affairs committee on july when he be ask what would happen if we do not see ceasefire in gaza in the come week he be also ask whether the british government would take further measure against israel the foreign secretary be pensive and say the british government would be take further measure if the abomination in gaza continue could he tell the house what those further measure be or at the very least when we might see they we be do everything we can in support our qatari egyptian and us friend to get ceasefire the hon member will understand that in look closely at these issue even if we be contemplate further measure they work more effectively if we can co ordinate ally the ground invasion of deir al balah be the late to add to the daily attack on gazans and it be further evidence that the conflict have go too far israeli foreign ministers have already reject the joint statement sign by country include our can the foreign secretary outline what additional specific step he will take with other to bring about ceasefire and secure aid for starve gazans set out in my statement the action that this government have take and stand by it regret that we have not bring about ceasefire have also set out that we be attempt to get in more aid and how we be support the palestinian people include the palestinian authority and stand by that on the foreign secretary watch and in his statement today he have refuse to call it genocide he have refuse to end all arm sale to israel and of course he continue to refuse to recognise state of palestine so here be something he could do on his watch just two wee kid who have be bomb or shoot by the israeli force have be evacuate to the uk for medical treatment the first minister of scotland write to the prime minister say that we stand ready to provide hospital treatment to such child shamefully the prime minister have not even bother to respond will the foreign secretary do what his boss will not and commit the uk to make sure that child who have be bomb by israel be treat order call the foreign secretary say to the right hon gentleman that we have suspend sale of arm that could be use in gaza he should look closely at our export licensing regime because much of it be not about arm it be about for example equipment that we send to support non governmental organisation and other in the area of course be happy to look with the home secretary at what more we can do for child who be suffer minister say it be for the court to decide whether genocide have occur in gaza but the genocide convention be aim primarily at prevention and the international court of justice have already find that there be plausible risk of genocide and advise that all state must act collectively to prevent it while the occupy israeli force be accelerate the building of illegal settlement in the west bank the scene in gaza be horrific with almost people kill by the idf while just seek aid we be see starvation be use as weapon the forced displacement of gazans and mass civilian death and senior israeli official be use dehumanising language while propose to concentrate gazan into mass detention camp so ask the foreign secretary when will the government take decisive action with international partner to prevent genocide my hon friend pray in aid the law in term of plausibility in breach of international humanitarian law if he look at my statement back in september he will see that assess that there be clear risk of breach international humanitarian law it be for that reason that suspend arm sale rise be aim to finish this statement at around quarter to give the length of question member will be able to see that not everybody will get in everybody condemn the death as people queue for aid but this aid system that be enforce be only possible because of the support of the united states in its delivery so what be the foreign secretary do to persuade the united states that this be not the way to deliver aid into gaza reassure the right hon gentleman that have make representation to secretary of state rubio about my concern with the aid system have do that alongside many european foreign ministers and member of the recently meet the mother of oz daniel year old who be murder by hamas on october his dead body be drag into gaza oz love to play music he love guns rose and be brilliant guitar player this be about mum who just want her dead son body bring home senior us official have say that israel be bend over backwards to agree ceasefire and that it be hamas who be block it will the foreign secretary set out what pressure the government be apply to hamas via qatar and egypt to agree ceasefire and to bring the hostage home my hon friend be right to the extent that the challenge face on the ceasefire have be principally that hamas do not want pause and the israeli government have say that they do want pause there have also be discussion within israel of what withdrawal we would see of the idf and of course change the humanitarian aid system that be why ceasefire have remain stuck but it be my hope that once the knesset rise on the we will move to ceasefire as the foreign secretary follow the diplomatic path will he ensure that in the discussion of the two state solution it be bear in mind that not only do the state of palestine exist but that israel neighbour do need to recognise israel right to exist yes will najwa ahmed fathi radwan and mohammed hassan yousef daoud be just two of the ten of thousand of palestinian child who have be kill in gaza many of their name be read out over the course of hour at really powerful vigil which join in aylesbury town centre this weekend yet today that list of dead child have likely just get long with israel assault on deir al balah will the foreign secretary say to his israeli counterpart enough be enough reassure my hon friend that say that this morning to my israeli counterpart rise before call the next speaker let say that hear some unacceptable comment direct at member in this chamber and will not be have that we be investigate it until find out from the clerks who say those word please do be assure that will investigate it the foreign secretary at the beginning of his remark mention the savagery unfolding in southern syria and say that he have speak to his syrian interlocuter minister al shaibani about it have he speak to tel aviv about it since the only country that have visibly come to the assistance of the druze for all the criticism that have be rightly aim at it be israel if he have can he say what his assessment be of the wisdom or otherwise of the action that israel have take the uk be clear that we expect israel to adhere to its commitment that its presence in the area of separation in the south be both limited and temporary do press the israeli foreign minister on israel activity which worry destabilise the situation far recognise the foreign secretary labour to get as many international ally on board and the importance of that but clearly we must do more this be not enough israel flaunting of international law and the devastating consequence of that understand that israeli soldier be report be tell to kill child to point and shoot be completely unacceptable as starting point perhaps we could ensure that we refuse the israeli air force chief entry to the royal international air tattoo also as other have say how will we get over here child who need care say that will look at what more we can do should child require medical aid in our own country if what my hon friend say be correct it would constitute war crime very clearly we can not have soldier turn their gun on child it would not be appropriate for to comment on any decision that might come to last week host keith and aviva siegel both of whom be hostage and be release the previous week meet family of hostage who all plead with all of we to get the hostage release the hostage have now be in captivity for day without any access by the international red cross will the foreign secretary call out hamas to enable the international red cross to go to see those hostage and make sure they be be treat humanely the hon gentleman be right say in my statement that hamas be make hay with the chaos that exist on the ground and it be quite wrong to restrict the support of organisation such as the red cross and the red crescent the prime minister respond to my question on gaza in the liaison committee this afternoon by say we need ceasefire and we need it straightaway and the situation on the ground be intolerable how will we get that ceasefire when the israeli government have already reject the statement by the foreign secretary and his allied ministers as disconnected from reality the will of the house be clear on this matter it want action not word why be my right hon friend not hear that thank my hon friend for his long stand campaigning on these issue of course be hear the strength of feeling in the house how could of course the israeli government can see the strength of feeling in the house he know the list of action that the uk have take he know the work we be do with close ally he know too that we have not bring this war to an end and he will be familiar with the work we be do with country such as qatar egypt and the united states to bring about ceasefire yesterday it be report as hon member will be aware that at least palestinians be shoot and kill while queue for ghf distribute food because they and their family be be starve to death the fact that ghf stand for gaza humanitarian foundation smack of an orwellian doublespeak which find profoundly disturbing the foreign secretary must surely agree that the current system of aid distribution head by the ghf be both unsafe and grossly inadequate be the secretary of state content that britain be do all it can to ensure it be not complicit in the grotesque use of starvation as tool of war associate myself with what the hon lady have say and assure she not just on my behalf but on behalf of everyone in this chamber that there will be no complicity among any of we in act where there could be clear risk of breach of international humanitarian law last week hear from keith and aviva siegel who have be hold hostage by hamas it be powerful reminder that until all hostage be release no hostage be release that be true for avinatan or and his family and gali and ziv berman and their family in fact it be the family of hostage who be some of the loud voice call for an end to this war will the secretary of state outline what step he be take to ensure that the next ceasefire be permanent and will see hostage get out of gaza and aid get in be grateful to my hon friend for his question he be right to mention the hostage meet regularly with hostage family and do few week ago in my office he be absolutely right that the overwhelming majority of the israeli ceasefire so that the hostage can get out and they want it to be sustained and endure ceasefire which be not currently the position of benjamin netanyahu the un special rapporteur on violence against woman and girl have say that palestinian mother be repeatedly watch their child slowly starve to death be maim be kill and be bury alive and that it be deliberate part of israel strategy physically and psychologically to destroy woman and the continuity of the palestinian people she call this femi genocide the secretary of state have repeatedly say that the situation be intolerable yet by fail to pull every single lever that this government could pull they be tolerate it when will he stand on the right side of history and implement full arm embargo widespread sanction and ban on the import of settlement good and when will they fund evidence collection for prosecution stand by all the decision we have make as government which be numerous list they in my statement on the full arm embargo be content that we be not send arm that could be use in gaza ask the hon lady to look closely at the export licensing regime because there be many thing that be send to israel and they be for use by ngos in israel sometimes so that they themselves be not injure in theatre of conflict doctor have tell we that they walk into the emergency room and see if not starve and emaciated child tiny body strew across the floor with burn blast and bullet and their job be to choose which child to save and which one they will have to let go that be decision making the foreign secretary have an option right before he to make decision that could make difference to those child to protect all health facility with the mean to do that at the un trust that he will do that secondly if he do not recognise the state of palestine there will be no state leave to recognise be grateful to the hon lady for the vision that she paint and associate myself with the remark she make in relation to child particularly about starvation and the situation that they face of course we be work closely with the un system speak to tom fletcher at the beginning of last week to get the late on the aid situation and we will continue to work with he the foreign secretary state that he believe in two state solution as have do since at least the yom kippur war but that hamas must not be part of it do he agree that the good chance there ever be for the two state solution be when israel withdraw in from the gaza strip hamas be elect in january and have be in power there ever since and be still manage to hang on do he accept that if ever the government do recognise palestinian state it would have to be the west bank without the gaza strip give the internecine slaughter between hamas on the one hand and the palestine liberation organisation on the other that follow the last withdrawal agree with the right hon gentleman that hamas can not continue to govern in gaza and suspect that everyone in this chamber agree with that do believe that there be prospect beyond that indeed the ira lay down its arm and that be template for how to demilitarise and how leader in this circumstance can perhaps exit gaza however the continue undermining of the palestinian authority by the israeli government include the starvation of fund be an attempt not to get to two state solution which all of we in this house want to see we watch as family survey the ruin of their home and be mock by illegal settler in the west bank and we watch as little boy look at his dead relative wait for he to take another breath watch mother whose baby have its leg amputate before it even get to take its first step where be our humanity to have two state solution we need two state let we recognise palestine can the foreign secretary tell what word need to say to he to get our government to take real meaningful action tell what to say and will say it would say to my hon friend that we do need humanity and everything that this government have do have be to ensure that there be humanity and to ensure the dignity of the palestinian people and the hostage that be still underground we will continue with everything we have to get that ceasefire and we will throw everything at it that be what we be do sense her frustration and that of many member in the chamber be as frustrated as she be but frustration alone will not deliver what we want to see do the foreign secretary agree that the israeli government should bear heavy consequence should they decide to proceed with the approval of the illegal settlement plan in occupy east jerusalem which will threaten the two state solution the last government suggest back in that there would be consequence if the israeli government move forward with so it be absolutely the case that there would be consequence if they make such move not just from the uk but from all international partner child be be starve and shoot in front of our constituent eye they be watch illegal settler systematically and strategically undermine the palestinian state it be not that there be risk of international humanitarian law be break international humanitarian law be be break in front of our eye on an hourly and daily basis our constituent be ask what this government be do to stop it and they be ask that because it be unbearable and they can see that the current approach be not work we be promise more action week ago but today we be still not see more action so what be the government be do to secure accountability under international law and when will they recognise the state of palestine thank my hon friend for her strength of feeling and for campaign on and champion this issue in her constituency but remind she that we be support many group that be on the ground in the west bank document expansion and violence that work assist the united nations and the global community there be narrative around aid we all want to see it reach the innocent in gaza which be that israel be block it get into gaza however over recent month israel have facilitate nearly million tonne of humanitarian aid get into gaza as of this morning truck of aid have pass from israel and be sit in gaza undelivered will the foreign secretary agree that aid be get through and that what need to get well be the delivery be afraid can not agree with that statement do not recognise those number as understand it hamas want egypt qatar and the united states empower as legal guarantor not only for day truce but up to the signatory date of any final agreement with israel can america not be prevail upon to act as guarantor beyond the final settlement hamas could be force to reconsider their objective under pressure from population desperately look for long term security we be work particularly with arab partner on this issue hamas have to exit they have to step away from the governance of gaza my hon friend be right we can not have pause for day we need an endure permanent ceasefire hundred of thousand of people in gaza be be deliberately starve to death aid convoy be come under fire child be be shoot by soldier and school and hospital be be bomb can the foreign secretary outline what further war crime would need to take place before the uk government sanction the israeli government and prime minister netanyahu himself the hon gentleman would struggle to point to any government of major or european state that have do as much as we have in office we lead the sanctioning of smotrich and ben gvir specifically because of their language and behaviour in relation to the west bank we have say that we keep sanction under review as he would expect welcome the secretary of state statement with other foreign ministers urge israel to agree to ceasefire and humanitarian aid say to my right hon friend who know be entirely sincere that member and indeed the british people have hear urging demand and outrage in this chamber yet the situation only get bad with more and more palestinians die each life of incalculable value in my adjournment debate in april ask what more we could do to help the palestinian people when the minister respond last week he make some useful clarification include that israeli settlement good should be label so that british people can decide what they be spend their money on when it come to the action of the uk government however have to ask my right hon friend be this it in some sens that be in the hand of those who continue to prosecute this conflict my hon friend be absolutely right when she say that each life be of incalculable value think have make more statement on this subject than any other minister have make statement in this house over the past year of course the minister for the middle east my hon friend the member for lincoln mr falconer have also make his fair share of statement the strength of feeling be well know and it be reflect not just here but across the globe the current course of the government of israel be bring that country into ill repute that be what be happen last week in bogotá the hague group meet lead by south africa those nation pledge to support the icc and the icj to refuse all arm sale to israel to refuse the facilitation of arm to israel and to refuse anything that enhance the occupation of gaza and the west bank in short global opinion support the palestinian people will the british government also sign the hague declaration and support that group of nation which be determined to bring the world attention to this to end the genocide that be go on and the continue occupation will speak to my south african counterpart about that issue however say to the right hon gentleman that we in the uk support the icc indeed it receive funding from british taxpayer and the icj and we also stand against what we be see in the west bank and in gaza so would say that much of what he have say be consistent with uk policy on friday the un report that people have be kill near aid site in gaza over the past six week over the weekend yet again people die just seek food and water want to ask the foreign secretary question he have be ask twice before this month he tell the foreign affairs committee that he would take further measure against israel if there be no ceasefire and if the intolerable situation in gaza continue what exactly do he mean by that specifically on trade recognition and more our constituent want to know all action be under review at this time we be press for ceasefire and our assessment be that we could see one shortly after the knesset rise my hon friend will understand that ceasefire be our priority as it be the single act that would stop the suffering that we be see in gaza she list some of the action she would expect to be under consideration with international partner of course we must act internationally alongside our partner if we be to have any effect the disturbing image from gaza lead we all to the conclusion that this war must end however we must remember that it be start because terrorist rap burn and murder people take captive and still abuse those captive today the war could finish tomorrow if the terrorist release those captive and agree to ceasefire much have be say today about israel try to starve the people of palestine but the fact be that since the new arrangement be put in place to stop hamas steal aid million meal have be supply in gaza instead of talk about two state solution and recognise state that do not exist and that if it do exist would be control by terrorist our government should be stand by the israeli government who be seek justice for their own citizen can not agree with what the right hon gentleman have say save for his remark that the hostage must be release want to gently point out to the foreign secretary that the reason so many of we be here be that we have be wait long time for this statement with the situation unfold as many colleague have say our constituent continue to write to we last week save the child hold photo exhibition in parliament in partnership with choose love and the photographer misan harriman should declare that he be the chair of the southbank centre which be in my constituency want to read clip from that exhibition question next to one of the picture ask if you have one superpower what would it be and why the answer of the young girl in the photo be the ability to change event in order to help my country to become free and help my child live in safe environment like the rest of the child in the world we be see child be kill while try to access vital food and aid we must ask ourselves what more can we be do we be see child malnourish and starve ask the foreign secretary where be the real action from this government to stop that so that more child can live hear the strength of my hon friend conviction and view when she ask for more action we be take action we have take action every single day in office british taxpayer be fund the alleviation of suffering be it enough have we bring this war to an end we have not bring it to an end have to tell my hon friend that the uk will be unable to do that unilaterally which be why we be work with partner internationally have have do that every single day in office raise my voice will not bring this war to an end lament that and regret that but be sure that the uk government be do everything in our power yes be twenty nine arm export licence be suspend in september due to the possible breaking of international law yet between september and december we see furth licence will the foreign secretary explain that decision how many licence have be grant this year what be the uk government red line for total arm trade embargo most licence be not for military use most do not go to israeli authority many be for civilian use such as product testing or body armour for journalist and ngos be quite sure that the hon member would not want we not to support those organisation some be for component go to israeli company that be then re export to third country include nato ally my hon friend the member for vauxhall and camberwell green florence eshalomi be right we have be wait week for this statement the truth be that our constituent do not understand and neither do we how we can track our steal mobile phone to china or algeria but we can not track component in the multimillion pound arm trade they do not understand why we have not report israel directly to the international criminal court for what have be happen to aid worker and they do not understand why give that this house vote in to recognise the state of palestine that have not be enact hear the foreign secretary frustration and do not doubt his frustration with his partner but tonight we could say we do not need conference we will recognise the state of palestine will he join we yes or no again understand my hon friend strength of feeling she know that there will be two state conference on july and of course we will participate but she will have also detect that at that conference our french and saudi arabian colleague be talk not about recognition but about how we get to two state and get an endure ceasefire it may be that as we head to september and the united nations general assembly the issue of recognition be raise once more since the israel defence forces have kill record number of journalist and kill record number of humanitarian worker they continually murder starve child as they queue for aid an israeli soldier out his commander for their illegal order to arbitrarily kill civilian that be not sequence of coincidence but war crime after war crime and clear message to the world do not intervene and do not observe what we be do to the palestinians the foreign secretary have say that he want two state solution he can take giant leap in that direction right now with one word answer do the foreign secretary recognise the state of palestine the hon member have hear what have say about my commitment to two state he know that we have not yet get ceasefire and he know that we be work with international partner to ensure that we get an endure ceasefire he know the debate around recognition because have talk about it not just in select committees but at this dispatch box on many occasion seventeen thousand nine hundred and twenty one child have be kill in this horrific war in gaza the israeli army willingly open fire on child collect food and try to access water child be literally be starve to death and those child not kill be leave with disable injury agree with the foreign secretary that the war in gaza must end but we have see the response from the israeli foreign minister the israeli government be ignore what this government be say what will the foreign secretary do now be it not time for an end to all arm sale not just some of they and complete ban on all settlement good he say that he will be part of the conference on july but he do not need conference to recognise the state of palestine say politely to my hon friend that when last year some country take step to recognition it do not change thing on the ground she ask with passion what be go on my focus be what be go on and try to alleviate the suffering while recognise the debate on recognition and we must move to recognition at the appropriate point say to she politely that in term of this conflict do not believe in all honesty that recognition would change the situation on the ground every day we see more and more report of child be kill in cold blood while they queue for food the horror can not get any bad prime minister netanyahu have already reject the statement sign by country it do not take he long and it be clear that he be not interested in stop this horrific offensive the time for word be over the house want to see action with widespread sanction an end to all arm sale and recognition of palestine as state netanyahu deserve nothing less and he might actually take notice if we take action will the foreign secretary consider take more action to bring this horrific offensive to an end yes to that last bit want to see ceasefire in the come day but of course we continue to consider what further step we can take with ally to bring the war to an end as the hon member would expect do the foreign secretary accept that israel plan to transfer control of the ibrahimi mosque from the palestinian municipality of hebron be highly inflammatory and violation of international law will the government condemn any transfer of authority away from palestinians and consider sanction against the kiryat arba settlement municipality if it assume such role we be concerned about the statement make and the language use we do believe that they be inflammatory and that be that to take place that would breach israel obligation we be look closely at israel behaviour word do matter but action speak louder what member across the house and citizen of the country our constituent can not understand be why the foreign secretary will not take the action available to he to end uk complicity in this horror full arm embargo and an end to all military co operation full ban on all settlement good sanction on all those responsible for genocide recognition of the state of palestine why will he not take those concrete action now reassure the hon lady that the uk government be not complicit in any action that would breach international humanitarian law take that step back in september alongside restore funding to unrwa she ask for full embargo she will note that there be judicial review of that decision and the government position be uphold she do not want to see we or our ally weaken in other conflict that have direct bearing on the safety and security of the people of britain welcome the foreign secretary reiterate this labour government total opposition to israel military operation something my constituent raise with regularly and our share abhorrence at the sight of child be shoot at as they seek food the israeli defence minister announce his plan to forcibly transfer all palestinian civilian in gaza to camp in the ruin city of rafah which the former israeli prime minister ehud olmert have deem concentration camp in all but name do the foreign secretary agree that that be completely unacceptable violation of international law that can not go ignore and will the government guarantee further action against israel if it proceed with the plan yes yes yes my hon friend talk about the statement of ehud olmert it be also right to say that other yair golan yair lapid benny gantz and ehud barak the former idf chief have all condemn what minister katz have suggest and too condemn it wholeheartedly last week as minister meet yair golan shake hand smile and take photograph palestinian mother face dilemma should she stay where she be and see the starvation of her child or should she venture out and see the child be blow to piece add to the other who have die and the day whose limb be blow off these child do not need these empty word word will not stop their bleeding they will not stop their killing they will not nourish their body and they will not stop the tear of their mother agree with the secretary of state that even recognise the state of palestine today would not make any difference to the child on the ground so will he take tangible step and propose british lead internationally support hospital in gaza in partnership with coalition of the willing to provide some remnant of humanity in this darkest of hour notwithstanding the huge humanitarian catastrophe that be take place in gaza be proud of the work of uk med the funding we have be able to give it and the extra money that have announce today and that medical aid be get through to relieve some suffering however the hon gentleman be absolutely right we will continue to do more and reassure he that be work with my jordanian counterpart in particular to see what more we can do to alleviate that suffer aid should be lifeline in humanitarian crisis yet it have become death trap for gazans people be starve yet one of the only way they can get food be to risk their life by go to an aid distribution point run by the gaza humanitarian foundation do the secretary of state agree that we be see the militarisation of aid and we can not let that set precedent may press he far on his conversation with the israeli government and the us government on bring the operation of the gaza humanitarian foundation to an end be grateful to my hon friend for raise the issue of aid worker the widespread loss of life among aid worker be travesty it be unprecedented remind colleague of chapter of the conduct of hostilities the handbook for legal practitioner in international humanitarian law which say that distinction lie at the heart of international humanitarian law and require party to armed conflict to distinguish at all time between civilian include of course aid worker and combatant it be travesty what we have see take place over the last two and half year thank the foreign secretary for his statement and for his thoughtful use of word on very contentious issue the late report of attack on the druze people indicate that hundred of druze civilian include woman and child have be kidnap torture rap execute and mutilate with christians suffer at their side despite the fact that they be fight back there be real and valid fear of genocide of those people who have strong faith and as such be worthy of our protection what can the government and the foreign secretary do to secure peace and hope for those people who be currently be target and need aid urgently be grateful to the hon gentleman for name the druze who have see awful atrocity visit on they in the last few day and the position of minority in syria see that the pope comment unusually in the strong term on what he have see reassure the hon gentleman that raise these issue with the syrian leader myself urge he to act and say that there must be accountability as he grip the entirety of his country of course these incident be also take place under the assad regime and in some way have be go on for long time but the suffering that be be work on minority in syria at this time be totally unacceptable the situation face gazans be truly catastrophic we must secure ceasefire as soon as possible with all hostage free and unhindered access to aid our experience in northern ireland show that to build long term sustainable peace we need to invest in civil society and peacebuilder to create consensus and to change opinion for the well will my right hon friend therefore tell we what the uk government be do to support the international fund for israeli palestinian peace reassure my hon friend that british taxpayer be fund ngos that work across community we be support that work on the west bank and in gaza we be support accountability because that be no when we look at some of the injustice be work we will continue to do that work include with the international humanitarian fund there be no red line every single allegation make by the israeli government about the crime commit by hamas have be re enact and execute for example kill of innocent people behead of baby burn of baby alive rape and hostage taking include of many hundred of doctor now we be actually see child be shoot in the genital there be game be play by the idf there be no red line will the foreign secretary please tell we from the dispatch box what be the red line what will cause this government to take proactive step what the hon gentleman mention fall into the category of the assessment that make back in september last year that there be clear risk of breach of international humanitarian law it be on that legal advice and the quasi legal position that take that make sure that nothing we do in this country could be complicit in such action want to give he that reassurance he paint vivid picture it be unimaginable that the suffering have go on for as long as it have the suffering of civilian in gaza have reach horrific level israel aid delivery model have fail to meet humanitarian need as mother can not bear to watch child be murder my constituent can not bear to watch welcome the statement but what be the government do to deliver the three action that my constituent want to see they deliver un lead ceasefire the release of hostage and credible pathway to two state solution be grateful to my hon friend for mention all three of those thing we be work for ceasefire although it be my assessment that we probably will not get one now before the knesset rise we be absolutely work to get the hostage out have call to mind opinion in israel that want to see ceasefire to get those hostage out remind the israeli government of that and do so again when speak to the minister the aid situation be abominable that there be truck wait at the border be totally reprehensible as say be guide by the practitioner handbook on breach of international humanitarian law war crime the duty of care proportionality and distinction particularly in theatre of conflict and be deeply troubled that these seem to be be breach welcome the foreign secretary announcement of additional aid to help the people of gaza but it be aid that will join the million of dollar and thousand of truck that be stand outside the border not be allow into gaza there be million child in gaza starve to death palestinian child be our child we must do everything in our power to get food to they some of the population be face level starvation assessment so please what step will the uk government and the foreign secretary take to feed our child in palestine be grateful for the way in which the hon gentleman have put his remark he know that in the occupy territory israel control who get in and who get out he know that the last time we see ceasefire we see rapid escalation of humanitarian aid to the people of gaza that be far from the situation today we be able work with the un system to get some wfp truck in an increase over the last few week and our eu colleague have be do considerable amount with the israeli government to increase the amount of truck be it sufficient no it be not and we therefore remain deeply worried about malnourished child notwithstanding the statement that have be make in this chamber about child whose life have be take away from they as they have wait for aid because of the system that have be put in place as the hon member for dewsbury and batley iqbal mohamed touch on the situation in gaza be all the more infuriating when we hear that the un have three month worth of food wait in warehouse on the border while it be report that people die of starvation just in the last hour be grateful for all that the foreign secretary have do so far on this issue and know that he agree with that the war must end now but what be the next action that we need to take to make that reality we have to bring about that ceasefire and we have to do all we can to alleviate the suffering that be what set out in my statement today but remain as frustrated as my hon friend be that this war be not over the foreign secretary have be kind enough to meet number of time over this year so he know well my constituent feeling about this conflict they be concerned and disgust by the sight of the mass killing and starvation of the gazan people but they be also frustrate by the lack of medical care and humanitarian aid the foreign secretary know that have many surgical colleague work in gaza and who have work in gaza include dr mohammed mustafa who alongside the hashemite kingdom of jordan and the australian government be desperately seek to get maternity hospital care for woman and child into gaza will the foreign secretary lend his support and the support of his office to this endeavour yes absolutely be grateful for all the work that my hon friend have do and his background in medicine help to bring these issue to public attention accord to the un nearly palestinians have be kill near the gaza humanitarian foundation aid point the uk send million in aid be nearly pointless give the denial of the un aid system and israel cruel blockade be choke off supply to the people who need it and look very much like starvation as weapon of war the raf break previous blockade with airdrop month ago and although we welcome the additional million of medical aid that have be promise today and today international statement israel have reject such appeal so ask again please what be the additional step that the foreign secretary tell the foreign affairs committee we would take to break this cruel blockade and get aid to those desperately in need my hon friend will have hear the statement that make today on the extra step that we be take in term of humanitarian aid he will have see the statement make by international partner on the fact that this war must come to an end and that aid must get in he be right to condemn the aid system we warn israel about reduce the aid point to four and now we be see the horror in front of our eye remind israel again about its obligation to international humanitarian law and my worry that they be be breach we rightly re funded unrwa but since then aid have become daily death trap and starvation be widespread our call for ceasefire only see the last one get break now as my right hon friend have point out the chilling order to forcibly displace an entire population of million people have be condemn by ex israeli pm ehud barak what more concrete action be we take to stop the man make destruction of hospital as well as hostage soldier and civilian before our very eye history will not judge this well and word be not work we stand with the international community in all our effort in term of what come next we support the arab plan we be work with arab partner to improve that plan and to get to the day after which we can get to if we get that ceasefire gaza be face catastrophic famine like condition and people be die in appalling circumstance the gaza humanitarian foundation be fundamentally fail to properly distribute adequate humanitarian aid and be turn distribution into another frontline in gaza what action be the foreign secretary take to ensure that un ngos can get into gaza and deliver the humanitarian aid that gazans desperately need can reassure my hon friend that speak to the un about this last week we be work with the un and be pleased that the world food programme be able to get some extra truck in we will continue to work closely with the un because we believe that it must be fundamental part of the system that distribute aid to the people of gaza thank my right hon friend for his statement and note the agreement reach with the other nation however as we know israel have already reject it it seem to that israel be become more and more emboldened by the lack of concrete action by the international community while people starve or be kill while queue for food and while those shelter in the caritas jerusalem shelter be bomb at the weekend it really do begin to look as though there be genocide unfold before our eye realise that the foreign secretary will want to take legalistic view of that but to those of we look at it from moral and logical point of view there can be no other word for it although understand and agree with the foreign secretary that recognise the state of palestine will not bring this to an end it would at least give the people of palestine something to cling on to and some hope so can we please not discount the opportunity to raise that issue but advocate for it and declare that we regard palestine as state in my experience my hon friend choose her word carefully and the whole house will have hear what she have say this afternoon reassure she that in my discussion with the jordanians the saudi arabians the qataris the emiratis and the egyptians and indeed with prime minister mustafa we of course discuss the recognition issue as we have be do with our french colleague the israeli government unrelenting denial of aid to civilian be turn an entire population of palestinians to skin and bone starve they to death as kid die the israeli government be push ahead in defiance with their humanitarian plan for gaza plan that have be describe as concentration camp by the former israeli prime minister can press the foreign secretary to enforce further sanction and can he lay out what tangible pressure this government be put on israel to stop use hunger as weapon of war reassure my hon friend that as he would expect raise these issue with israel on regular basis and raise that issue with israel this morning inhumanity be red line draw by international law and underwrite by universal human right in gaza that red line have not just be break it have be ignore betray and erase the foreign secretary tell we that netanyahu be not listen in fact he be put his middle finger up to the uk government will the foreign secretary send military personnel to protect palestinians from the genocide be commit by the idf recognise the strength of feeling that my hon friend convey to the chamber list all the thing we be do think the most important thing that the uk government can do be press to get that ceasefire press to get an alleviation of the suffering and of course to do everything we can to see the hostage return just want to be clear on the government legal position on june last year the government report that they see no serious risk of genocide in gaza all this time on and after the statement that the foreign secretary have make can be clear be he say tonight that the government accept that there be plausible risk of genocide if he be not will he instruct his official to undertake an immediate review and report to member as rapidly as possible if there be plausible risk of genocide that would place legal duty on the government and all of we believe to act accordingly as we have see in the past when we have have rogue state like south africa the good form of bring they to heel be financial sanction if the foreign secretary meet the finance house and bank in this country and they deny credit line to israeli bank that would be probably the most effective thing we could do to bring the israeli government to their sens refer the right hon gentleman to the statement make back in september and the addendum to that statement which set out the basis on which have judge that there be clear risk to international humanitarian law he know that the long establish position be that it be for the international court to make any determination of genocide our assessment be there be clear risk of breach of international humanitarian law call cat eccles thank you madam deputy order cat eccles the people of gaza be be starve to death despite unrwa have enough supply to feed the population for three month it be not matter of logistic it be sheer cruelty ghf ration centre be purposely locate in the south in militarise zone with sporadic opening hour and

genocide it be now ethnic cleansing when israel government be ignore call from country what further action can we take as my hon friend have hear what we be see be inhumane it be deadly and it be deprive gazans of human dignity as she would expect the government work with our partner keep everything under further consideration we see the brutality and bloodshed in gaza every single night on our screen it be disproportionate and horrific and it have go on for far too long bomb bullet and now the blockade there can never be any justification for shoot people while they wait and queue for aid know that the secretary of state share my desire for peace two state solution an immediate ceasefire and the flow of aid into gaza will he share what he be do to help achieve that my hon friend be

will work with ibca to introduce mechanism that individual can use to raise concern to aid continuous improvement of the scheme as be sure hon member understand to do that the government will need to make further regulation our top priority be to move quickly so to make some of the simple change we will bring forward set of regulation as soon as parliamentary time allow those regulation will not implement all the policy change recommend by the inquiry in evidence to the inquiry in may say that be open to change that do not lead to further delay believe that make these change recommend by the inquiry will not delay the speed at which offer be currently be make further set of regulation will be need to implement the more substantial change particularly those for which we be take time to engage the community on how those update can be realise therefore expect this second more substantial set of regulation to be bring before parliament in but and really emphasise this to hon member we do not expect this engagement to cause delay to the roll out of the compensation scheme as it currently stand which be absolutely crucial as say to the inquiry we be respond swiftly and constructively to sir brian and put the voice and need of the community first will also provide further update on the government response to the report have continue to engage with the charity name by the inquiry in recommendation recognise their concern about the allocate funding and can confirm that the department for health and social care be re examine funding for this year and will look at option for the future with regard to recommendation on memorialisation be pleased to announce that follow engagement with the community clive smith have be appoint as chair of the memorial committee be delighted to be able to appoint chair with his wealth of experience and be confident he will be able to bring the community together to make great progress on this work the government have make progress in implement the recommendation but progress be never foregone conclusion sir brian be clear about the importance of scrutinise progress in deliver what the government have commit to and agree be pleased to confirm that have ask the public administration and constitutional affairs committee to take on the role of scrutinise implementation of the inquiry recommendation in the may and july report it be for the committee to outline how it will approach that work but trust that it will see fit to follow the example of the inquiry through scrutiny of the design and delivery of compensation in addition today be publish record of inquiry recommendation and the government response on as promise in our response to the recommendation of the grenfell tower inquiry those record will be periodically update to show implementation progress and will include all recommendation of future inquiry to conclude quote directly from sir brian report which he end by state truly involve people infect and affect in how the state recognise their loss would start to turn the page on the past he be absolutely right our focus as we move forward must be on work together with the community with ibca and indeed with each other in this house not only to deliver justice to all those impact but essentially to restore trust in the state among people who have be let down too many time commend this statement to the house thank the right hon gentleman for his statement and for advance sight of it on behalf of his majesty loyal opposition thank sir brian langstaff for his initial work on the inquiry and for all his follow up work this additional report focus on compensation be significant and thorough piece of work that have be do in good time our thank also go to those work at the infected blood compensation authority to get the money out to those who desperately need it know that my right hon friend the member for basildon and billericay mr holden welcome the valuable insight that he gain from his recent visit to the team on the ground in tyneside above all we pay tribute to the victim the family and the campaigner who have fight relentlessly and bravely on this issue have previously raise in the house the concern of victim and their family about the speed and structure of the compensation scheme they have be repeatedly frustrate by failure to speed up payment although there be sign that the pace be finally start to increase know that their frustration remain and we share they this scandal happen over decade under successive government of different party but we all have responsibility to do what we can to right the wrong of the past as quickly as possible and the opposition will support the government when they be do the right thing in do so have also raise the issue of engagement and call on the government to far solidify ongoing consultation and communication with victim and their family it be disappointing to see that as sir brian lay out in his additional report sufficient progress have not yet be make on that welcome the government response on that matter but urge they to ensure that that engagement work be carry out rapidly and urgently victim and their family deserve real action and as the additional report make clear they have have far too many assurance but not yet enough substantial engagement be pleased that the government be now take action on some of the issue relate to atypical personal or health impact and supplementary route which raise when we discuss the infected blood compensation scheme regulation in march know that will bring great comfort to many of those who have be infect with the disease mention appreciate that the government be take forward sir brian recommendation on grievance mechanism and be certain that across this house we all hope that implementation of this recommendation and the other from the report will meet the term of reference of sir brian inquiry and will complete the compensation and resolution process however the government must ensure that this mechanism be an active one not simply record device while it be incredibly important that lesson be continuously learn from this tragedy it be also really important that those case that contain difficulty with regard to compensation eligibility which we know make up significant proportion be address as matter of urgency and that all such case many of which will probably come through this new mechanism be consider carefully and that all information on the claim status and decision make on it be communicate clearly and frequently to the complainant above all learn those lesson must not come at the cost of delay payment to those who simply can not afford to wait any long to that end would appreciate the minister clarity on the number of personnel whom he expect to be task with the grievance mechanism and the oversight structure that will be put in place over it will that be the advisory board be establish and if so what specific oversight power will the advisory board have we support the government in take these measure forward and we will do what we can as the official opposition to help these action be implement but it be incredibly important that the government be clear to this house what measure they be put in place to ensure that the step announce here today be carry through and enact efficiently and effectively no amount of money can undo the harm that be tragically inflict on so many but comprehensive and effective compensation scheme can offer lifeline to victim and their family who have suffer far too much for far too long thank the shadow minister for his contribution and in particular for its tone the cross party way in which this have be approach have be crucial take that approach in opposition pay tribute to my predecessor as paymaster general the right hon member for salisbury john glen for the work he do in drive this forward agree with the hon gentleman that this additional report be very significant piece of work and echo his thank to ibca staff on the speed of payment the hon gentleman refer to the number of payment and of course ibca have use the test and learn approach but want to tell the house that have announce today substantial number of change to this scheme but it have to be on the basis that that will not affect the current speed of roll out of payment that be why still expect ibca to contact all register infected people to begin claim before the end of the year and indeed to open the service to affected people by the end of the year also agree with the hon gentleman about the need for an active consultation mechanism and entirely agree about clarity of communication very much hope that we can continue this cross party spirit into the delivery phase as that be so important victim survivor and campaigner have be fight for decade for truth and justice due to cover up by public servant last year the prime minister call for duty of candour law to prevent future cover up such as the infected blood and post office scandal and could not agree more but if we be to restore trust in the state do the minister agree that it be high time for hillsborough law to be implement in full as promise by the prime minister last september entirely agree on the need for hillsborough law and say to my hon friend that this government be absolutely determined to get it right and to lead that culture of change that we need across public service so that people be not put their own reputation or the reputation of institution above public service we be determined to lead that change call the liberal democrat spokesperson thank the minister for his statement we too pay tribute to sir brian langstaff and his team for their ongoing work as they continue to investigate this appalling scandal liberal democrats know that the victim of the infected blood scandal deserve compensation they and their family have be mistreat and have be wait for decade to see justice we welcome the establishment of this scheme in august and the commitment show by government from both side of the house to justice for these victim however sir brian langstaff additional report have be excoriate about the glacial pace of payment and the abject failure to listen to victim one of the report most scathing finding state that victim of the scandal have not be listen to as sir brian have report the expert who be responsible for the design of the compensation scheme be forbid to talk with victim and their family after so many year of secrecy deceit and delay exclude victim and their family be wholly unacceptable this report have be welcome by many victim include many of the haemophiliac boy who attend the lord mayor treloar college in hampshire my hon friend the member for eastleigh liz jarvis have be powerful advocate for these victim and thank she for her work advocate for constituent such as gary who welcome the finding of this report that be why we be urge the government to set out clearly and in detail the timeline for deliver compensation we be call on the government to engage properly with victim and their family do the minister agree that it be entirely unacceptable that victim be not involve in the original design of the scheme and that they have be consistently ignore when can victim of the scandal expect the implementation of sir brian langstaff recommendation to introduce formal advisory body of victim for the infected blood compensation authority in relation to transparency on the expert group establish under my predecessor entirely acknowledge sir brian langstaff criticism and point on that the government be now go to have to create new set of regulation and clearly will have to reconstitute an expert group but give the house an undertaking that transparency will be at the heart of that group include publication of its work and its minute because that be essential to regain trust the hon lady be also absolutely right about how essential it be to put the voice of victim at the heart of what we be do but would also say to the house in relation to today that at the autumn budget last year the chancellor set aside billion of funding to the end of the parliament to pay compensation for victim and the policy decision that be announce today be currently estimate to cost around billion in further compensation payment the total cost depend on what be agree follow consultation with the community but the government have say and we will stand by this that we will pay what it take to fund the scheme and we will update the forecast cost at the autumn budget of but victim should be in no doubt of the government determination to seek justice thank my right hon friend for his statement follow the inquiry report will the government now speed up the current timeline of and for the payment of compensation to victim the and date be backstop my determination be for payment to be make as soon as possible hope that what have say to the house about offer of payment and indeed payment start to affected people this year be an indication of that speed up welcome what the paymaster general have say about remove administrative burden to payment and accept the recommendation and his commitment to work with the community and do so in timely way know that he will continue to devote his considerable energy to those thing could he also say word more about memorial be think particularly of the young victim from treloar welcome what he say about the appointment of chair to that committee but be there timeline for that obviously there be sensitive matter to deal with but give the passage of time do he have timeframe in mind for its completion the right hon gentleman raise the issue of treloar which be in his constituency he speak very powerfully have also speak in recent week to former treloar student hear about the experience there never fail to move people be pleased to have appoint clive smith that have already be do and be ask he to progress that memorialisation work first quickly because the right hon gentleman be right about the passage of time and secondly in way that bring the whole community together clive have set out his intention to appoint vice chair to represent the whole blood transfusion community welcome that effort to bring the community together in what will be very emotional memorialisation thank the minister for his statement the infected blood scandal be the bad treatment disaster in nhs history but as the inquiry chair say this disaster be not an accident institutional reputation be put above truth and ordinary people pay the price it be far from alone there be horizon nuclear test veteran grenfell and hillsborough hillsborough law would end the culture of cover up which be why victim and family include those from the infected blood scandal fully support it the prime minister promise that one of his first act would be to introduce that legislation but one year on we be still wait do the minister recognise the importance of fulfil that pledge before labour return to liverpool for the party conference in september absolutely understand the importance of introduce the duty of candour to which my hon friend refer as indicate in my answer to my hon friend the member for liverpool riverside kim johnson sir brian langstaff talk about the pervasive culture the concept of people put their own or institutional reputation above the public interest the government be determined to change that and to get the duty of candour right by work with the family which think be absolutely crucial as co chair of the all party parliamentary group on hiv aids and sexual health very much welcome the removal of the start date coincidentally today be zero hiv stigma day so it be important to recognise the stigma that many people suffer as result of contract hiv through infected blood hope that one of the supplementary route to compensation might be to those who suffer extreme stigma and discrimination or severe psychiatric consequence from the contraction of hiv thank the right hon gentleman for his comment about the removal of the date promise in my evidence to the inquiry to look at that so be pleased to remove it he be absolutely right about stigma visit the terrence higgins trust in recent week and listen to the terrible stigma that people suffer be extraordinarily move he be right to remind we of that and as we move forward with try to deliver justice we should all keep that at the forefront of our mind on behalf of the appg on haemophilia and contaminate blood welcome my right hon friend statement it be major step forward as he know the issue of engagement with the affected and infected community have be major bone of contention since the expert group set the tariff for over year that community have be ignore and lie to by the state which should have be on their side when sir brian langstaff publish his recent report he say for decade people who suffer because of infected blood have not be listen to once again decision have be make behind closed door lead to obvious injustice my right hon friend say that he will accept most of the recommendation but if he be go to consult he must consult with the community will he guarantee that he will set up proper mechanism that will be approve by the community and that he will provide financial support to those organisation that be give advice to victim who be make claim first on consultation my hon friend be right be determined that we be go to get this right secondly as indicate in my statement with regard to the organisation and recommendation of sir brian langstaff may report dhsc be look not only at this year again but to the future my work in recent week speak to charity have make it clear that they want to look beyond this financial year and agree too thank the minister for his statement in particular the fact that ibca will design and introduce process for registration sir brian langstaff conclude that the current approach to compensation perpetuate harm by create different treatment for registered and unregistered victim can the minister confirm whether that include interim payment for unregistered victim which be another recommendation in sir brian langstaff additional report in relation to registration as the hon gentleman will have see ibca have accept all of sir brian langstaff recommendation include that one with regard to the estate of those who have sadly pass away have just from the dispatch box extend interim payment and hope to be able to announce the timetable for that very soon the very fact that sir brian langstaff reopen the scheme for the additional report bear testimony to the fact that there be something sadly wrong with the initial scheme be wonder whether the infected blood victim will be warmly welcome my right hon friend statement or whether they will be bit apprehensive frustrated or disappoint because the government have say that they will accept at this point only seven of the nine recommendation only victim have settle to date but many other have sadly pass on can my right hon friend clarify what will happen to those wait to start their claim they be the tuesday night lottery club they have be wait for month for phone call to tell they that they will get an invitation to apply for compensation will new invite be put on hold while ibca revisit the settle claim be it still priority to start all live infect claim by the end of the year the answer be yes absolutely would not have make such substantial number of change without assurance that it would not delay the ongoing payment ibca have say that there will be offer to all the living register infect by the end of the year that be unchanged by the change have make to the scheme today the promise that we make to start the affected by the end of the year also stand as say moment ago ibca have accept the recommendation about registration it have also accept sir brian langstaff recommendation about cohort prioritisation and be look at that hope that my hon friend who be powerful advocate on these matter will see that have say at the inquiry that would look constructively at these issue that be precisely what have do on the recommendation where we be consult that be precisely because want the voice of the community to be hear it be in that first raise the case of my constituent lesley hughes who be infect with contaminate blood in and discover the reason for four decade of ill health in only about so it be great that this progress have be make very large sum of money will be pay in compensation so can the minister outline what provision there will be for the recipient to receive financial advice to make sure that they be not take advantage of by unscrupulous people for example people try to tell they how to make claim that they can make directly agree entirely with the right hon gentleman about that risk have be very conscious of that which be why the government have sign off financial support for both legal advice and financial advice for the reason that he say that be crucial the minister have hear talk about my constituent brendan west veteran who live unknowingly with hepatitis for decade after be infect through military blood transfusion brendan talk about how he feel lucky to be alive but his view be that successive government continue to delay justice for he by design brendan have just receive an invitation to start the process for compensation which welcome but how long can he expect that process to take he have serve our country and suffer horrific injustice in the process and he deserve to be able to not waste single further day in live out the next chapter of his life say to my hon friend who have raise her constituent case before that ibca be operationally independent but stand ready to give any support that be require to speed up claim which think be crucial there be absolutely no deliberate delay from the government in term of the money be pay some billion be allocate in the autumn budget and have just announce series of measure worth around billion that be the commitment of this government to secure justice and will continue to do all can to speed up payment as far as can see some of the paymaster general announcement and his acceptance of some of the recommendation and sub recommendation will cause devolve administrative body to have to stay open for long period believe they be initially schedule to close on february but they will now have to stay open for long than that seek his reassurance that he will ensure that all the cost will be meet by the treasury and that there will be no divergence between the support give to those infected or affect anywhere across the united kingdom as there be previously due to the work start by the inquiry the hon gentleman make perfectly reasonable point speak on thursday to the health ministers of all three of the devolved administration include minister nesbitt in the northern ireland executive the hon gentleman be right that the scheme for scotland wales and northern ireland will stay open for further year that have be do to make sure that we can keep up the pace of payment at ibca but give he the reassurance which give to the health ministers that that will be fund by the uk government we be not ask the devolved administration to bear the cost of that the minister know that have raise the case of my affected constituent ronan whose mother jane die from hepatitis after blood transfusion she be recommend follow an ectopic pregnancy welcome the announcement on the affected estate but when will the affected particularly parent and partner be invite to start their claim many have be wait decade for justice and be concerned that they will not see it in their lifetime my hon friend make very good point in the first instance as have say payment to the affected will start by the end of the year that remain the case there have be concern about the affected estate and hope that my hon friend will have see that not only accept the recommendation but extend it by further two year to try to give that reassurance thank the minister and the government because ultimately he be do this on their behalf very much for his statement no one can doubt his commitment and we thank he very much for that it be always good to hear that movement have be make on compensation to make it as fast as possible will the minister reconsider the rejection of the recommendation by sir robert francis of an enhance award for people with extrahepatic disorder result in long term severe disability include people currently include in the special category mechanism and its equivalent in scotland wales and northern ireland also he refer to substantial regulation be make in can they come forward in on the first point as have just say we have acknowledge sir brian langstaff criticism on the special category mechanism that be why be take action on that and announce that today in relation to the very specific condition that the hon gentleman talk about think he be refer back to sir robert francis previous report be certainly happy to write to he on that particular detail the first set of regulation that have speak about will be bring forward before the end of the year thank my right hon friend for his statement one of my constituent who be now in her care for her husband who be victim of unethical research in edinburgh her son now fear that she will die before receive recognition or redress for what she endure do my right hon friend recognise that there be real fear that carer of infected people will die wait for their compensation if so what step will the government take to ensure that carer reach the end of their life can be prioritise for compensation my hon friend be absolutely right and that be why have change the scheme in respect of affected estate sir brian langstaff recommendation be for those who sadly pass away between may and and have extend that by two year to for precisely the reason that she raise thank the minister for his statement which be the right response to very thorough report that yet again detail the significant size of the scandal we be try to undo he mention the level of increase payment that these measure will lead to and think he mention figure of billion will additional resource be give to deliver the recommendation in addition to extra payment just give my hon friend the reassurance that the government have say that they will pay what it take to fund the scheme we will then update the forecast cost at the autumn budget this year thank the paymaster general for his statement think the heart of all of we across the house go out to the victim of this terrible scandal and their family as somebody who see family member die of aids know how incredibly difficult that must have be for many of they do the minister agree that the common thread in the infected blood scandal the post office scandal hillsborough and the pelvic mesh scandal the one that come across my desk the most be that victim be not listen to he mention the need to consult on the recommendation how will he go about that consultation can he assure that it will be thorough my hon friend speak very powerfully about his own personal experience he be entirely right about consistent failure on behalf of the state over many decade on many scandal that have be debate in this house and on which we have listen to victim get the consultation right and ensure that we hear the voice of victim and the community be crucial to the government point of order on point of order madam deputy speaker on july write to the home secretary regard the implementation of the proscription order against palestine action write to she ask whether any guidance be be issue to the police on the implementation of that proscription and in particular whether or not the expression of opposition to the proscription fall foul of the proscription order itself that include both reporter report those who be oppose to the proscription or indeed any member of parliament express opposition to it ask whether that would be construe as support for palestine action and would therefore be actionable have receive no response so through you madam deputy speaker and maybe through those on the treasury bench it would be helpful to urge the home secretary to reply or to issue statement be grateful to the

in what we believe be the yorkshire regiment part of the british infantry division he fight in the battle of kohima brutal turning point in the war where the terrain climate and condition push soldier to the absolute limit of human endurance like many people who fight in those condition he never speak about his experience but it be clear that the impact of the war stay with he for his whole life

mental health homelessness or poor housing the liberal democrats believe in fair deal for our veteran fair deal mean action on homelessness by build more social home every year to allow every member of society access to their own home fair deal mean proper mental health support by provide mental health support and easy access to professional help and fair deal mean make sure veteran count by ensure there be well recording of the physical and mental health outcome of veteran include wait time for treatment those who now carry the torch current service personnel must have fair deal be proud that last week my liberal democrat colleague in the other place defeat the government to extend the decent home standard to ministry of defence accommodation hope that that remain in the renters right

innovation and through global cultural phenomenon such as godzilla it be starkly different from the japan fight by our great generation less than decade after the nuclear attack on hiroshima and nagasaki godzilla be create as metaphor for nuclear weapon and their destructive power but godzilla minus and more destructive still be also metaphor for national guilt for everything we love about japan today it have never undertake the societal reckoning with its past that germany do follow the fall of the nazis across germany stand the horrifying relic of the holocaust in hiroshima the bomb dome be memorial to the victim of the atomic bomb in the land of the rise sun it be far more difficult to find such an open recognition of its wartime torture of prisoner of war or its atrocity

trauma yet their sacrifice be not in vain when japan surrender on august it mark the end of one of the most devastating conflict in human history the royal navy have play its part in bring about victory that would reshape the world establish the principle of international law and create the foundation of decade of peace and prosperity the lesson of vj day remain so very relevant today the victory be achieve not through the effort of any single nation but through alliance and co operation as we face new challenge in an uncertain world the example of those who serve in the pacific remain inspirational would like to mention the royal navy ship that have serve since hms daring hms argyll hms albion hms sutherland hms tamar hms spey and of course hms prince of wales which be en route there as special deployment in operation highmast to all veteran and serve personnel say thank you finally want to pay tribute to two individual lance sergeant harold kennard from stamshaw in portsmouth and private george ogle from north end both of whom be capture and die as prisoner of war make the ultimate sacrifice and reflect on my city role in vj day history be not make of distant figure but by serve personnel from my city and by community like mine that come together for common cause the home front be an unrelenting struggle and the european theatre be the most mechanised slaughter ever witness on the continent but the brutal fighting of the japanese be incomparable young man would have hear the tale of ferocious fighting on the ground kamikaze attack from the air barbaric treatment of allied prisoner of war upon victory in battle and mass suicide force on japanese civilian upon defeat in battle those harrowing tale do not faze the good old man of east london or essex or for that matter the million of brave british indian and commonwealth soldier who volunteer over the course of british involvement loyal subject of the crown leave their family friend and native soil to sail to the far east to defend their empire many of those brave man be from england include many from essex remember especially the south west essex burma star association which meet at

gallant man fight to ensure the end of one of the most brutal and oppressive imperial power which could rain terror upon its neighbour no long and to ensure that freedom and democracy prevail determined to fight to the bitter end the imperial japanese army fully intend to force an allied invasion of the japanese homeland which would have lead to untold casualty on both side that be avert often refer to as the forgotten army the soldier of the pacific theatre be the very great of the great generation their loyal service and valiant fighting bring victory home and secure we peace that have last decade their inspirational commander general bill slim be one of the great general of world war two his book defeat into victory which be about how he do it be one of the great book ever

for king country and commonwealth it be an honour to speak today as we approach this incredibly important anniversary today be the day to celebrate the victory of democracy and freedom over fascism as well as to remember all those who lose their life be take prisoner or suffer during that fight believe that the most important thing we can do to honour their memory be to ensure that we never again return to the politic of fascism although vj day mark the end of the war fascist politic be on the rise all over the world we must never allow ourselves to be complacent or to think that our modern world be immune my community have its own story to tell about vj day name be remember and list on the roll of honour at st john church in blackpool one of my constituent write to about the story of her grandad harold rhodes who be capture on february alongside many other man and take to the notorious changi prison camp harold be make to walk from singapore to burma via thailand to work for the japanese on the notorious death railway he walk the last mile of that mile force march on bare foot it be say that one man die for every sleeper laid harold be release from changi prison on september and put on ship for rangoon burma the purpose of the trip be rehabilitation for harold and many other ex prisoner who be all extremely thin and need to gain weight urgently on arrive home after three month journey he weigh stone lbs heaven only know what he weigh when he be release from changi harold granddaughter my constituent say that he be the gentle of man harold story be that of so many man across the country while harold survive many more die many starve to death and many die from cholera malaria or dysentery they be the man whose suffer we must remember their brutal treatment at the hand of the imperial japanese army must serve as reminder to we all of the horror of war and strengthen our resolve to build peaceful world their suffering do not end when the war end they spend their life suffer from ptsd limb lose and long term complication feel very move to intervene on my hon friend because she be make such powerful speech as someone who previously represent part of her constituency know how much this will mean to her constituent my grandfather have burma star and he have scar all over his body he never speak of it but the long last trauma these veteran face live with they throughout their life and we do not recognise that enough would like to put that on the record thank my hon friend very much for her intervention and totally agree with her analysis my school friend dad george brooks suffer for the rest of his life from the ordeal he endure in the camp as we approach the anniversary of vj day and the celebration that will come with it these story must be constantly tell we remember the blackpool regiment and everyone who have sacrifice their life for our country since it be through our veteran that our collective memory of the second world war be well preserve but as their bright flame be flicker it be important that new generation my generation commit to re tell their story as schoolboy one of the piece of work that have stick with the most be the man behind the name project because it be impossible to think of the million british young of adult man who fight in the first world war that be full wembley stadium the man behind the name project be so powerful with the general point be go and pick name on your local cenotaph for that be the one pass on the way to mrs wood history lesson at west hill school we be tell choose name and research that man because when you learn about that young man where he be bear his sweetheart his job his kid not too dissimilar in age to yourself you realise that it be not an abstract number but million young man with their own life it hit home the man behind the name for be benjamin ford my great great grandfather he die in mesopotamia fight the ottomans what strike particularly be that hear lot about the western front but little to nothing about this other front where man like benjamin die for king and country it rather strike that the pacific front in the second world war be often similarly overlook today debate be important for highlight those man who fight and die in the far east particularly those fight after ve day have pass just this weekend be speak to theresa haggart former local headmistress and stalwart of windsor civic society about her father the late charles snelling want to take this opportunity to highlight the man behind that name he pass in august age he

and operator he spend time hop from ship to ship make repair to essential equipment and like other british troop find himself thousand of mile away in the pacific unable to share his precise location with his family he sketch drawing of the local culture and the people he meet on blank postcard which he send to his parent let they know he be okay charles do not discuss his service although he do feel that while ve day commemoration continue to draw national attention vj day come and go almost as an afterthought gently say to ministers that this sometimes feel to be the case on the anniversary

more positive than before and he even appear to say that another month would be add ask the minister to clarify that statement have ukrainian guest who say they feel safe and settle in berkhamsted and can not return and be ask for long term solution do my hon friend agree that we need to look at example of solution such as that in poland through which we can provide certainty for the ukrainians here yes we need to do exactly that if the uk be to support the defence of ukraine we must continue to support the vulnerable ukrainian guest in our country and to give they some certainty about their future in my discussion with group around the newton abbot constituency have hear many of their concern we have one family with year old son with they ukrainian child passport have duration of just four year and they have to renew his passport he have be tell to do that but he will need to return to kyiv his parent be now worried that he will either not be allow to get back here or not be allow to stay here with an expired passport be grateful to the hon gentleman for make this debate possible can he explain to the house the attitude of the ukrainian government be it the case that most of the people here be dependant woman and child give that it be originally think that ukraine would be quickly overrun and the circumstance be very different be it also the case that the ukrainian government now want to see more of their citizen come back to defend the homeland the right hon gentleman have obviously be read my speech shall get on to that shortly have speak to ukrainian lady and her elderly mother in newton abbot this lady have lose her husband her son and her father her home in ukraine be in the russian occupy zone and like much of her village have be raze to the ground even when peace do break out what do she have to go back to other than landmine and unexploded bomb ukraine be the home of the fabled cossack and it be no wonder that the war be not over in the three week or so that putin expect however that mean that we have to think long term about the homes for ukraine scheme visa mention that there be now some million ukrainians out of the original population of million safely outside the country that be or about one sixth in old money it will not be practical for all of they to return to country with shattered infrastructure for number of year clearing landmine deal with unexploded bomb demolition and rebuilding must be do before most of the guest we have here could think about return my basic ask of the minister and the government be to look at long term extension of the homes for ukraine scheme to give our guest certainty in some part of their life at least could we ask the minister for clarity about the woman who have dependent child or elderly relative who be often unable to meet the income threshold require under settlement route such as the skilled worker visa or the global talent visa could we also ask for clarity for their child who have learn english so that they be so fluent and who have have their education here as they can not look forward to go to college or university because they do not have visa that will see they through that course very much so in my meeting people have be ask about these different visa and route not many of which work first be proud to say that the resident of my constituency have open their home and their heart to many ukrainian family flee this horrific conflict they be now our neighbour and friend they work or study and they be part of our community do my hon friend agree that we need bespoke route to permanent residency for ukrainians who want to stay in the uk absolutely agree and this be now urgent as guest start to have less than month on their visa have the hon member see the research produce by the university of birmingham on the experience of ukrainian refugee in circumstance such as those he describe particularly loss of employment and loss of tenancy do he agree that landlord and employer should not be act in this way that to do so may be discrimination on the ground of nationality and that some form of remediation need to be find in these case thank the hon member for mention report from my old university which will go away and look up however think this be more about get the visa extend rather than pursue the people who be refuse they congratulate the hon member on secure tonight debate last month have the great honour and privilege of meet the ukrainian family who have make their home in my constituency it now be their home and they be so very welcome have personal private conversation with each and every one of they individually and everyone say to that they so desperately need stability and security which the current bespoke ukraine permission extension scheme do not provide because month be too short particularly for young student progress from secondary school in scotland to university do he agree with that the government must urgently review the short term nature of their stay thank the hon member for his intervention and will be move on to that shortly have be impress by the way that the ukrainians do not sit back but get up and get work in many case they have take job way below their qualification while they learn the language settle in and find their way their child have integrate into school and set out on path to gcse level and degree course despite the fact that they do not have the confidence that they will have visa that cover the duration of those course they be still work hard at they have one guest who be fully qualified ukrainian dentist and we need dentist especially in devon he have do the first part of verify his qualification for the uk but it have take many month and cost however to become fully qualified dentist he need to spend and more time and the wait time alone may make that futile give the short time leave on his visa another bright young student have start dentistry qualification at plymouth university but she ask if she would be allow to stay to finish it another family want to get mortgage to buy house but they can not give the time leave on their visa they be brave inventive and industrious people and we need to help they by extend their visa scheme do the hon member agree with that the homes for ukraine scheme matter it be not just an immigration policy it be about real family who have make home in our community be particularly think of wonderful couple who come along to my surgery the woman who come from ukraine be work with charity and bring her son and be get marry to one of my constituent on july absolutely would like to give couple of story from ukrainians here be keep an eye on the time this be from anya glebova in north devon who be host

pain and despair it can not be describe my husband make the decision for we to leave ukraine probably because he see much more for it be difficult step firstly to leave my husband without support he sometimes come home for two day and it be always holiday for our family secondly to leave the home where the child grow up where there be dream where every corner have its own story but the safety of

of the ukrainian she be host be sure my hon friend will join in say that while the hero of ukraine fight putin for we as much as for they we should stand guard over their family the war seem far from end perhaps more protract than ever the eu clarify its position extend temporary protection for all guest to march and require all member state to find way for guest to have pathway to residency or settlement within those two year the home secretary comment in select committee that continue the stability of education for child university student and adult in training or apprenticeship be key and that enable that continuity through housing and job be an important part of the government support for ukraine we need the government to review the short term nature of the ukraine permission extension scheme urgently without urgent change we be at serious risk of put thousand of ukrainians child as well as parent into homelessness or bad as the term of their visa will be too short for they to carry on we owe they much well treatment than we be currently give they be sure that my hon friend will want to share his sympathy for julia in my constituency who no long have her flat or any accommodation back in ukraine she have secure job with legal firm that wish to train she up and get she qualified but she now find that she may no long be secure and safe in this country that be

one of the few county support over ukrainians thank he and everyone in devon for make such welcome contribution to what be as we be all aware very much national effort on that note want to recognise the contribution and story that have be share in this thought provoke and important debate we should honour the effort and sacrifice make by family who have find themselves split up and live in different country during this unprovoked war with the constant and daily anguish that it will bring pay tribute to the many local authority across the country and to the british public for the incredible generosity that have be show to our ukrainian guest will the minister give way be conscious of time will try to make some progress before take an intervention shortly since their launch the ukrainian scheme have offer or extend sanctuary to more than ukrainians and their family this be an outstanding response and one that underline the deep sympathy and compassion that people across the uk feel towards those who need sanctuary here rise will give way first to the hon member for north herefordshire ellie chowns the minister refer to the anguish feel by the ukrainian family who have be displace do she recognise that uncertainty over visa condition add to the anguish face by those family here in the uk and indeed to that of their very generous host will she therefore commit to review the situation and give they hope for the future thank the hon lady for that intervention and will comment on that matter directly in this debate want to take this opportunity to emphasise that the government support for ukraine remain utterly steadfast member will also be aware of the uk ukraine year partnership which be sign by the prime minister early this year the landmark commitment not only build on the close relationship we already have with ukraine but seek to formalise close co operation in number of key area such as trade security energy science and technology and educational benefit include youth compact it be important that we see that work ongoing with the partnership bring economic cultural and educational benefit to both our country not just now but in future will the minister join in do two thing the first be congratulate the hon member for strangford jim shannon on his excellent tie action this evening which be massively on point secondly and more importantly
