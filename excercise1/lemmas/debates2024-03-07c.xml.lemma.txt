environmental provision in our trade agreement and to use our multilateral trade policy diplomatic effort and trade promotion activity all of which support our green objective the government boast about the trade deal they have do and the environmental protection they have secure so presumably they have have the chance to analyse the impact will the minister tell the house whether the deal secure so far have improve or degrade our environment what lesson have be learn for negotiate future deal the hon gentleman raise an interesting point many of the agreement have actually for the first time include environmental provision if recall correctly he do not like the australia trade deal but it be the first time australia have commit in trade agreement to the paris agreement and so on when it come to the impact of our trading policy over the last year he will also find for example that of uk import of palm oil key interest for environmentalist be certify as sustainable up from in again we be see real result of uk trade policy move in much more environmentally friendly direction kinship carers employment leave if she will make an assessment with the secretary of state for education on the potential merit of introduce right to pay employment leave for kinship carer some child be in the care of close family member in england alone we recognise the vital role that kinship carer play in look after child who can not live with their parent last year the government publish the national kinship care strategy and announce million package of support for kinship carer in the minister just reference the government kinship strategy which be publish in december their own strategy have recognise that kinship carer in employment often report the need to give up work or reduce their hour to be able to care for the child they support it cite survey reveal that of kinship carer give up work and similar number have to reduce their hour permanently give the minister desire to drive up employment and the fact that kinship carer step up overnight to look after child save the taxpayer huge amount of money in comparison with when child go into local authority care why be the government not make pay employment leave statutory right and only publish guidance the hon lady raise very important point we call on local authority to be considerate to people who be in employment when they take on child to look after in kinship care situation we think that employer be the right people to make sure that any provision we provide be floor not ceiling company such as john lewis take very considerate approach to people in that situation we urge they to do so but we also encourage local authority which have budget allocate to this particular issue to provide support where they can infrastructure impact on business investment if she will make an assessment of the potential impact of infrastructure on level of business investment if she will make an assessment of the potential impact of infrastructure on level of business investment high quality infrastructure be crucial for deliver economic growth to quote previous prime minister you and come by road and rail but economist travel on infrastructure we know how important investment be the whole house will agree that the uk be the lead light when it come to offshore wind farm where we be already secure investment let point to few example of further investment nissan be invest billion in new electric car model in the uk microsoft and google have announce data centre worth over billion and my secretary of state oversee the global investment summit unlock billion of investment in fact since we have secure more inward investment than any other country in europe over the last few year we have receive the third high amount in the world after the united states and china could go on mr speaker but might test your patience that be all very well but the government decision to defer the banning of petrol and diesel vehicle until have lead to huge uncertainty among consumer and investor as the minister well know compare with other country it seem that the government lack ambition when it come to investment in electric vehicle infrastructure france for example will have something like installation by more than the uk what plan do the minister have to ensure that the uk investment keep up with our competitor and meet the grow demand for electric vehicle as the minister for the auto sector be very keen to ensure that we be break bad meme around the electric vehicle sector we be do huge amount of work in this space at the moment we have public charge point we have rapid charging fund and local electric vehicle infrastructure fund be sure that the hon gentleman local authority will want to tap into those the department for transport be work with local authority to ensure that they have charge strategy we have million local ev infrastructure fund which will deliver ten of thousand more charge point and support for on street residential charge point too it be really important that local authority be aware of the fund available and suggest that the hon gentleman get in touch with the dft to support the installation of charge point in his constituency do not think that any hon or right hon member could disagree in general term with the minister reply it would have be more interesting reply if she have make an assessment of the reduction in investment since the cancellation of high speed because there be no doubt as she say that investment in rail infrastructure lead to business investment all along the route we can see that in birmingham and manchester and we can now see the lack of new investment because of the cancellation be it not mistake to swap that investment which would have lead to many new high technology job for money to replace what have be take from local government to fill pothole in my previous response want to expose the opportunity and grant that be available to ensure that charge point be cris cross the country often parliamentarian be not aware of all the great work we be do on just last week we announce the extra support that will be make available for local transport plan which cover everything include rail road and even bus and of course pothole network rail have receive billion from the government to improve transport in every region of the uk just last week we announce an extra billion of additional funding for local transport authority in the north and midland we want to make sure that decision on transport be make locally and that the infrastructure be need and want by local community which be why we be make sure that the fund from be be make available regulatory cost small and medium sized enterprise if she will make an assessment of the potential impact of regulatory cost on small and medium sized enterprise we be hack through the red tape not least with our smart regulation programme we have announce reform to employment law and the recording requirement of the work time directive which will save uk business up to billion particularly benefit sme note that the minister welcome yesterday budget as help small business particularly in the hospitality sector which be very hard hit in my constituency one of the problem that many business tell we about be the business rate system more business have fail in the past two and half year than have be establish in scotland we often find that while the downside of this government policy be happily pass on by the scottish government any benefit be not we would like to see complete reform of the rating system not tinker but reform can the minister tell we whether widespread reform be plan how would he plan to do it how could business in scotland also benefit the hon lady be absolutely right to point to some of the difficulty in the hospitality sector speak to hospitality entrepreneur in my constituency and across the country who be find it difficult which be why we step in with first package of about billion of business rate support and there be billion of business rate support last autumn we pass the equivalent money on to the scottish government to pass on to their hospitality venue but they pass on none of it typical pub in scotland be bad off than typical pub in england and typical guest house be bad off that be why scotland have high failure rate than england similarly typical pub in labour run wales be bad off and typical guest house be bad off and there be high failure rate it be critical that the benefit be pass on to those business and that we look for structural reform anyone who want to scrap business rate need to show where the billion of income will come from rather than simply say that they will scrap they without announce replacement national minimum wage enforcement what assessment she have make of the effectiveness of publicly name employer for the enforcement of the national minimum wage since we have publish press release and name around employer that have in total repay over million in arrear to over worker we have recently have round of the scheme name and sham serf as deterrent but should we not go far against persistent offender pay the minimum wage be not an opt out it be law that no company be above strong penalty include fine proportionate to the severity of the violation to ensure that no employer can exploit its worker with impunity would level the balance between employer and employee will the minister commit to explore these measure to safeguard the right and the dignity of worker the hon gentleman be right to point to this measure we know that name and sham be significant deterrent against underpayment of the national minimum wage and we be very keen to ensure that naming continue alas in the most recent naming and sham round minimum wage investigation return more than million in arrear to over worker his majesty revenue and customs issue business with nearly fine total million as the hon gentleman recognise name and sham alone be significant deterrent and we intend to continue do it call the shadow minister my hon friend the member for bury south christian wakeford be right that too many employer still think they can opt out of pay the minimum wage early this week the low pay commission publish its report which say that non compliance appear persistent in the social care sector have hear range of evidence cite problem with record keeping exploitation of migrant worker and worker routinely not be pay for travel time it be clear that the social care sector have real issue with the minimum wage but when browse through the late naming and sham list publish by the department couple of week ago find only employer class as be within the social care sector which be less than of the total number of employer in the sector what will the minister do to ensure that everyone work in the social care sector get at least the minimum wage the hon gentleman be right to raise this issue on which we do much for example we make sure that people can anonymously report the underpayment of the national living wage through either his majesty revenue and customs or acas it be really important that we do that we have labour market enforcement undertaking and order and we provide the tool for serious case as of april employer be on labour market enforcement undertaking and employer have be prosecute the message should be loud and clear to employer that if they do not comply with the law we will take action smart data road map when she plan to publish the smart datum road map my official be co ordinating and lead on the drafting of the road map which will set out the government ambition for future smart datum scheme development across seven different sector we will publish that very shortly be delighted to hear that the road map be come very shortly my hon friend will recall that ask this question just before christmas and he say it would be out in january we be then hop it might be come out in yesterday otherwise excellent budget but it do not other country be come up on the rail and try to overtake we the noise of the approach herd be grow in our ear so can we please move as fast as possible on this my hon friend be right to hold our foot to the fire on this we be press forward and we be determined to get it right not just out quickly he rightly say that set the ambition to get it out in january and that have put official foot to the fire as well in get it out sign off the road map yesterday so it should be out very shortly do not agree that other nation be hot on our heel on this issue as we be way ahead there be billion of call in open banking every month and million be use this every day without even know

support for their steel industry give the very credible plan put forward by my union unite the union to protect job and expand production at the steel plant at port talbot why be the uk government not

government have ever make in steel we be turn port talbot around it be go to be regenerate we be replace high carbon emit blast furnace with electric arc furnace to help reduce emission which his party and all of we across the house sign up to when we make the commitment to net zero he may have specific thing he think we can do on the transition so can tell he that we have transition board to help those whose job be not go to be there with electric arc furnace however we have do significant amount for port talbot may commend to my right hon friend the recent paper on industrial policy by

single most transformative thing we could do to fire up the british economy we will continue to be competitive and ensure that we continue to be the third country after the usa and china in secure inward investment of course beat our european counterpart call the shadow secretary of state last month the secretary of state say at the dispatch box that she could state explicitly that trade talk with canada have not break down however the canadian high commission have since contradict that in writing say that neither negotiation nor technical discussion with respect to any of the outstanding

canada that we would pause fta talk on the basis that cheese access have be remove and that canada have signal that rule of origin provision would not be extend that be how negotiation work can tell the hon member that there be meeting on february between the foreign secretary and his canadian counterpart where the cheese issue be discuss and raise cheese and rule of origin directly with the canadians in abu dhabi last week must say to the hon member that chase headline base on thing he have be tell by the people with whom we be negotiate be not helpful to achieve the outcome that our business farmer and auto industry want to see that be lot of word for the secretary of state to use to say that she believe the canadian high commission be correct in the answer that it give may ask an important question about the propose uk carbon border adjustment mechanism labour very much support the introduction of uk cbam but we be concerned that the government will do so year after the eu result in the uk potentially be flood with carbon intensive product originally destine for europe include steel cement and fertiliser do the government recognise that danger if they do what be their plan just on the first point if the hon member still want to believe canada before the uk that be his business but we on the conservative benches know who we be work for and we be work for british

together we be follow development on the eu cbam closely and we be engage with the european commission to discuss technical consideration relevant to uk manufacturer we share its concern on carbon

retract baseless allegation she make against member of her own advisory body on her personal twitter account allegation that be base on dodgy dossier produce by conservative think tank remarkably the damage pay out come from taxpayer money from her department this be new low for ministerial standard so perhaps the leader of the house can clarify few thing be the pay in damage the total cost bear by the department for science innovation and technology apparently the secretary of state be give appropriate advice but do she follow it or be her accusation against the advice she receive if they be surely she should personally pay the cost will the leader of the house urgently ensure that the secretary of state be accountable to parliament the government can not have it both way if the money be pay by taxpayer because it relate to the secretary of state ministerial responsibility she must come to parliament as minister and account for that other ministers be tell that their twitter account be matter for they personally do the secretary of state still have the confidence of the leader of the house all we get from yesterday budget be old news brief and leak to the paper before it be give to parliament the next time that the leader of the house cry crocodile tear for the right of this place she could reflect on the government failure to stand by the parliamentary convention that budgets be deliver in the chamber first be sure that she be relieve that her marginal constituency do not get namecheck because her colleague be all complain that their namecheck be the kiss of death on the substance the verdict be now in the office for budget responsibility forecast that tax receipt as proportion of gdp be set to rise to their high level since the second world war the resolution foundation say that the big picture have not change taxis be head up and this will be the first parliament in modern history in which living standard fall to be low at the end than they be at the start the institute for fiscal studies agree that household be bad off since the last election and no soon have the chancellor sit down than the under secretary of state for energy security and net zero the hon member for west aberdeenshire and kincardine andrew bowie criticise key plank of the energy plan on twitter the public verdict be also in snap poll reveal that three in five voter think that the government plan be not work the sky news panel of tory voter could not have be more damning one voter say that the budget be absolutely farcical another say that the government have no plan and think that the budget be great vote loser and waste of time time for they to go say third that be because on the big issue this budget change nothing on taxis for every the government be give they be take in tax rise million more middle income family be pay more and more tax on their earning as they be drag over high tax threshold taxis be go up to their high level in year the government hate it but that be the reality that be the truth of this conservative government on the public finance borrowing have be revise upwards with the chancellor measure in the budget add billion to borrow and debt as share of gdp at its high since the borrow to fund tax cut how irresponsible on growth after everything the chancellor announce be take into account growth forecast be revise down from november growth figure would have be even bad be it not for high prediction of net migration the government hate that too but be the truth we be in recession the economy be small than when the prime minister enter downing street there have be the big fall in living standard since record begin and real income be below what they be at the last election that be the conservatives record and it have the prime minister name write all over it finally disgracefully the chancellor make no mention at all of infected blood compensation or horizon scandal redress the slowness in right these wrong be raise here most week the business and trade committee highly critical report out this morning call for legally bind timetable for deliver redress to sub postmaster and for that to be take completely out of the hand of the post office do the leader of the house agree give everything she have say on both these injustice do she understand the anger that no new money be allocate and no timetable be give for those compensation scheme in yesterday budget be not that omission just another short term cynical act that will store up problem for the next government to sort out as ever it be party before country these be the final act of desperate die government start by note that tomorrow be international women day point out that on most thursdays the primary player in this session be three woman and sometimes there be fourth in the speaker chair it be sometimes note that woman be often the last to speak in meeting that may be true but we be often the first to set the right tone and approach politic need more of we and hope that the spirit of tomorrow will carry into this important political year turn to what the hon lady say about female colleague of ours the secretary of state for science innovation and technology the hon lady can no doubt obtain from the department detail of some of the issue that she raise however remind the house because the hon lady be really probe the character of the secretary of state that when the latter be entitle to redundancy payment of for have be secretary of state she do not take it but hand it back to the department because that be the right thing to do that speak volume about my right hon friend character and how much she value the fact that we be talk about taxpayer money see that the hon lady be channel elmer fudd this morning bug may not have be in the chancellor hat but there be support for business large and small help for household tax cut for work people and help for single earner family also the price of fuel at the pump be be hold down through another fuel duty freeze we will ensure that the benefit of that be hand on to the consumer via pumpwatch will not take any lecture from the labour party on stewardship of public service and get growth into our economy will take no lecture on tax cutting from labour party that still have billion of unfunded spending commitment which can only be deliver through tax rise it be the labour party that leave office with billion black hole in the defence budget and equipment programme it be labour that bring in the fuel duty escalator and be clobber the motorist in wales and london it be the labour party in wales that have cut the nhs budget not once but three time that be in contrast to the increase that we have bring in and the furth billion announce yesterday labour nhs budget cut be one reason why quarter of the population in wales be on waiting list will not take any lecture from labour on council tax which rise by under their administration again in wales it have nearly triple since labour have be in power we have reform welfare to make work pay double the personal allowance cut national insurance and protect livelihood and job through furlough but labour think it be good use of taxpayer money to give asylum seeker month will not take any lecture on support those earn the least from labour party that bring in the rate the hon lady rhetoric on growth and modernise our nation do not match her party agenda to unpick year of trade union reform or tie business in red tape and it do not sit well with its voting record on minimum service level for the british public will not take any lecture from party that do the square root of diddly squat for victim of infected blood and the post office on that precise point the hon lady clearly have not read the red book which on page commit we to pay full compensation to victim of the horizon scandal the estimate be in there but it also say that amount will be increase if need this be tough shift post pandemic and mid war but thank god it be our shift our country have turn corner and we will get back to our inflation target soon as the new forecast indicate the plan be work and we will stay that course as we must otherwise we will end up back where labour leave we compare with today that be million more workless household more child and more pensioner in absolute poverty million few in work youth unemployment at literacy rate trail rather than lead the world and third less spending on the nhs no thank you shadow leader of the house we will stick with the prime minister further business will be announce in the usual way the mayor of greater manchester vanity project of square mile clean air zone have cost the taxpayer nearly million it have be support by all labour council in greater manchester and bury will my right hon friend make time for debate to ensure that the voice of conservative mp who have campaign against this ridiculous project can be hear again and that this tax on hard work people never see the light of day congratulate my hon friend on lead the charge on this matter there be legal obligation to comply with emission in the short possible time but we be review that he will know that greater manchester authority have change their tune and be now propose an entirely different approach thank to the campaign that he have run and the support that he have galvanise among his community congratulate he and encourage he to hold they to account call the scottish national party spokesperson follow the frankly appal behaviour of the labour party leadership to disrupt the snp opposition day debate on february interruption obviously they do not like the truth the leader of the house tell the house that she be sympathetic to the idea not only of the snp get another opposition day debate but of take it from the allocation give to the labour party could she update the house on how her thinking have develop on those point far to that on the issue of ministerial responsibility yesterday it be reveal that neither the conservatives branch manager in holyrood nor their energy minister support the government energy policy will the leader of the house confirm whether the principle of collective responsibility in government apply to junior ministers if so what advice would she give to any minister who be unable to support such key plank of government policy either publicly or in any budget vote ahead finally the secretary of state for science innovation and technology have cost the taxpayer after falsely accuse an academic of support hamas could we have debate on the limit of privilege specifically whether it be now the government policy that ministers can say whatever they like outside parliament and be financially indemnify from the consequence by the taxpayer do she consider it the taxpayer job to underwrite financially the conservative party culture war whenever its member overstep the mark thank the hon gentleman for his question have speak to the leader of his party in westminster regard future opposition day debate and he know that we will give more time to the snp think snp members be badly treat and we will make that right as have explain also want to ensure that the procedure committee look at what happen because do not want minority party to receive more time on the floor of this house and be in any doubt about how those debate will be conduct understand that mr speaker have write to the procedure committee to ask it to do quick piece of work and will announce future opposition day debate for the snp

completely understand the legitimate issue that the hon lady raise she have reputation for play the ball and not the man or woman and take her question in the spirit in which think it be intend from what know of the situation and because of the oversight that be give to such matter believe that this issue have be deal with in line with the rule refer she to what have say about the character of the individual in question listen to the chancellor budget this week people would think that everything be rosy despite our country be in recession however that narrative fly in the face of the daily reality of worker and business do the leader of the house accept that the government can not escape from their dismal economic record over the last year would ask the hon lady to reflect on how she think the hard work people of this country will cope with have to plug billion hole in labour spending plan which could only be raise if the party be stick to its fiscal rule by raise taxis scotland

ensure that every child have the good start in life recognise that it be the government job to address inequality as much as they can with the power they have to build more cohesive and fair society have no quibble with any of the issue that the hon lady raise but it be also the duty of government to ensure that people have public service they can rely on that the police can attend burglary and other such thing that people have access to the healthcare they need and that their ambition with regard to the growth of the economy and their local community be support unfortunately her government in scotland be not do those thing my constituent michelle be cancer survivor who have campaign for year on access to nhs dentistry for cancer patient have make frequent attempt to secure debate on this matter and will continue to do so but will the leader of the house allocate some government time to discuss this important issue give the traumatic impact chemotherapy can have on one dental

very welcome and know that the hon gentleman know how to apply for one public petition call for debate on end the uk membership of the world health organisation but debate be refuse by the petitions committee despite the petition well exceed the signature threshold can we please have statement on why this house be determined to give away sovereign power to an unelected unaccountable non tax pay diplomatically immune organisation whose current director general be appoint only through an unholy alliance of bill gates and the chinese communist party can the leader of the house say why the who have join excess death and vaccine harm on the list of thing that we just can not talk about in this house think there be enough health relate issue and all sort of other issue to worry about focus on and debate without invent crisis and drama where there be none the hon gentleman acknowledge that petition be matter for the petitions committee which be committee of this house be not responsible for its decision will facilitate and help he to secure debate and raise question and to do anything else he want to do on any topic on which he wish to campaign the hon gentleman will know because he have secure well attend debate in the past that this house be very open to discuss all sort of issue include the world health organisation and the treaty about which know he be concern let we focus on the real issue the substance and the matter at hand rather than pretend that this house anyone in it or any of its committees have hide agenda because he know that be not true do the leader of the house agree that this be probably the most perilous time for the world during my long time in the house of commons do she also agree that this house need to be up to date on what be happen in the world last week have to watch the foreign secretary appear before the house of lords on television to be inform of our foreign policy and what he be do understand that no conservative member of parliament seem fit to be foreign secretary and that we have to go to the house of lords but can we have more regular debate and statement it be not right for the elect house of commons to have no secretary of state to answer question during these perilous time implore the hon gentleman to recognise the merit of the minister of state foreign commonwealth and development office my right hon friend the member for sutton coldfield mr mitchell who have appear at this dispatch box an enormous number of time and to acknowledge that the foreign secretary who obviously sit in the house of lords have make himself available to hon member on raft of issue he have particularly make himself available to those member who have be affect by what be happen in israel and gaza the hon gentleman will know that the procedure committee have make further recommendation on how this house can scrutinise the foreign secretary and be sure the house of lords will shortly take decision on those recommendation despite yesterday short term tax cut family across the country know that they be bad off than they be year ago so will the leader of the house urge the prime minister to call an election and let the british people give their view on this government be afraid that what the hon lady say be not the case we have get an enormous number of people into work and the good way for people to lift themselves out of poverty be through work two million of those million people be woman and million be disabled people who would not have have the dignity of pay packet without our welfare reform to make work pay and to support people in work we have an enormous childcare package that the previous labour administration go nowhere near the number of pensioner live in absolute poverty have reduce by and the number of child live in absolute poverty have reduce by by any measure the country be do well it will have more opportunity in future because of what we have do in education we be soar up the international literacy table and we have reform education to enable people to get degree without get into massive amount of debt as happen under the hon lady party what she say be not true which be why we need to stay the course and stick with this government last week talk about my constituent sue sparkes whose husband die as result of the infected blood scandal know that the leader of the house have copy of the red book with she as she mention that early can she point to the line in it that show where the chancellor have set aside any resource to deal with the compensation that she and he know will have

and the plan he be bring forward care passionately about this issue as do when give evidence to the inquiry and do not want victim of this appalling scandal to worry about what be go to happen want we

the paymaster general will the leader of the house join in congratulate oldham athletic football club owner frank rothwell on his sterling achievement in row the mile across the atlantic in aid of alzheimer research uk in his for the second time he manage to raise more than for that charity add to the million he raise previously on the first row will she also allocate government time for debate on the real issue of the near million people affect by alzheimer in the uk and the funding and early diagnosis that support work in that area as the hon gentleman ask that question and reveal the full extent of his constituent incredible achievement there be an audible gasp so be sure the whole house will want to join he in congratulate his constituent on those amazing achievement be close to hms

also thank the hon gentleman for raise his concern about provision and care for those suffer from alzheimer shall make sure that the health secretary have hear what he have say welcome the chancellor

scottish influencer of the year for her fantastic environmental campaigning include on ban disposable vape this important tax measure have be so resoundingly kick into the long grass be sure that the house would want to join in congratulate laura but may we also have debate in government time on the imperative of move with more speed on tax vape perhaps we will also be able to make time to discuss the wholly unacceptable practice of vape company sponsor sport strip thank the hon lady for get her concern on the record will raise that matter with both the treasury and the health secretary the hon lady will also know that we be also hop to bring forward legislation shortly which be sure give what she say she would be happy to support my hon friend the member for middlesbrough andy mcdonald refer early to the gaffe by the secretary of state for levelling up housing and communities who demonstrate his ignorance while on visit to teesside refer to the hero of sunderland who win the fa cup in when perhaps he should have be praise the league cup winner middlesbrough instead of ignore the matter can the leader of the house arrange humanity lesson for the minister so that he can well understand the history and geography of the north east take my responsibility to all member of this house very seriously immediately after this session will go and raise with the secretary of state his special adviser and his official what the hon gentleman have say think that we can take from that give all the other issue that he might have raise in his question to this morning that he think the government be do very good job can we have debate on personal responsibility if say or tweet something defamatory would expect to be responsible for the consequence of that not the taxpayer and think that be what the public would expect as well the leader of the house response to an early question suggest that somehow the right hon member for chippenham michelle donelan have credit in the bank because she do not take the redundancy payment that be offer to she or that these payment be within the rule if that be the case the rule be wrong which be why we need debate the hon gentleman have hit on it if the rule have be follow and if we be not question the character of the individual it must be that the rule be wrong will raise this with the department and the permanent secretary however can reassure the house again that these matter have considerable oversight both from the monitor officer in the departments and from the propriety and ethic team this week march mark the year anniversary of anu abraham death anu be young man with bright future and he should still be here after speak to his family and see photo of he can say that he be one of the kind individual that anyone could know and that he have smile that would light up room anu tragically take his own life follow bullying while work as trainee police officer with west yorkshire police can we have debate in government time on police recruitment the training of police officer and the support package that be available lesson must be learn change must be enact and voice must be hear thank the hon gentleman for allow we to remember anu and to get that on the record clearly anu be somebody who want to step up to public service and serve his community his suicide be an absolute tragedy know that police service in general and in particular those responsible for training and ensure that the right safeguarding support be there for those go through training review these matter know too that the home secretary take these matter very seriously will tell he that the hon gentleman have raise this today and ask that he be update on progress to help ensure that this tragedy never happen again have be try to amend the road traffic act follow the tragic loss of one year old child pearl black from merthyr tydfil work with pearl parent have produce an amendment that seek to close loophole that cause they such huge distress in november the prime minister give commitment at prime minister question to facilitate meeting with the relevant minister possibly from transport or justice for pearl parent unfortunately despite request that meeting still have not take place can ask the leader of the house to please offer her assistance in secure debate on how we can deliver the change and crucially how we can facilitate meeting with pearl parent be sorry to hear that that meeting have not happen be sure that transport ministers would want to facilitate it so follow this session will make sure that they have hear what the hon gentleman have say and see whether we can rectify that tomorrow be international women day it sadden greatly that warwickshire should have the bad conviction record for rape and serious sexual offence philip seccombe our police and crime commissioner be one of the few to cut domestic abuse unit and close the rape and serious sexual offence unit in warwickshire can we have debate in government time on the accountability and scrutiny of police and crime commissioner the hon gentleman raise some very serious matter refer he in particular to what the prime minister say at prime minister question this week about the progress that have make on support victim of these heinous crime in come forward and the increase conviction rate that we want to see particularly for rape and sexual assault think debate on these matter would be excellent because there be considerable variation between area and in what police and crime commissioner be do would welcome that scrutiny on monday be out in meppershall where resident be feed up with the condition of the main road through the village as be the case in many village resident have be tell that the much need roadwork can not take place until development be finish as reasonable as that may sound development drag on and on and with no end to future development in sight surely enough be enough will the relevant minister issue statement on whether more guidance might be need about the length of time it be reasonable for private development to delay clearly need public roadwork will certainly ensure that the relevant departments have hear the hon gentleman concern he will know that local authority have be give sizeable uplift in road maintenance grant particularly for such thing as pothole and resurfacing on the of this month local authority have to publish what they have do with that money encourage he to scrutinise whether that money have be spend and spend on the right thing at the end of january the government launch the pharmacy first scheme which encourage patient to consult pharmacist rather than gps or at least to take pressure off gps while that be good in theory the reality be that the community pharmacy workforce be on their knee with level of train support staff have be cut by we be see the closure of pharmacy in rural and coastal town such as axminster and sidmouth with constituent tell yesterday that queue at the pharmacy in axminster be out the door will the government please make time for debate on recognise the value of community pharmacy the government do recognise the value of community pharmacy there can be no prime minister well place to recognise the importance of pharmacy that be why we have not only enable the pharmacy first service to be stand up but work on it for number of year it be now available to all member of the public but there be trailblazer programme prior to that for people who be on benefit some of pharmacy be now make use of the scheme which also enable they to derive an income from it that be progress to be support and welcome hope that the hon gentleman will promote the scheme in his constituency point of order on point of order madam deputy speaker it have be draw to my attention that on monday the hon member for mansfield ben bradley publicise his meeting with the leader of the nottingham independents which clearly take place in old market square in my constituency the hon member have not notify that he would be visit nottingham south we all make genuine mistake however when look at his social medium feed become aware that this be the fourth public visit that he have undertake in my constituency since the beginning of february none of which he notify of appreciate that he already have two job and be seek third but would be grateful for your advice on how he might be prevail upon to follow the rule of behaviour and courtesy that apply to we in our job as member of this house be grateful to the hon lady for her point of order and for give notice of it assume that she inform the hon member that she intend to raise this indicate assent this be an incredibly serious matter mr speaker remind the house on january that when member intend to visit another constituency other than in private capacity they should make every reasonable effort to inform the member represent that constituency before they do so that apply in particular to public event and meeting in addition hon member have duty to look after the constituent who elect they to this place boundary change do not take effect until the next election and we must observe the convention of not involve ourselves in another member constituency until that time have have similar experience and know how annoying it be it be also something that all part of the house need to observe we have the leader of the house present know it be not strictly in her remit but be sure that she will take back the view express as will the whips emphasise everyone have to stick to that particularly this year because thing can get very fraught and difficult think we will leave it at that bill present national insurance contributions reduction in rates presentation and first reading standing order the chancellor of the exchequer support by the prime minister laura trott nigel huddleston bim afolami and gareth davies present bill to make provision for and in connection with reduce the main rate of primary class national insurance contribution and class national insurance contribution bill read the first time to be read second time on monday march and to be print bill with explanatory note bill en way and means budget resolutions income tax charge debate resume order march question again propose that income tax be charge for the tax year and it be declare that it be expedient in the public interest that this resolution should have statutory effect under the provision of the provisional collection of taxes act call the shadow chancellor of the exchequer the stark reality of yesterday budget be clear taxis rise living standard fall growth stall and yet again the tories make promise that they can not deliver they have fail on the economy they be out of idea and they be out of time let turn first to the most and potentially only remarkable bit of the budget statement yesterday after an hour and minute the chancellor of the exchequer seem to float an idea of get rid of national insurance altogether be not quite sure what have hear but then ministers start tour the tv and radio station to say that that indeed be their intention in what seem to have be casual afterthought the chancellor have make billion unfunded commitment leave gap hole in the public finance even big than the unfunded tax cut announce in the tory kamikaze mini budget just month ago let ask the secretary of state for work and pensions this how do the chancellor plan to pay for the billion tax pledge make yesterday to be more precise what be the chancellor assessment of the impact that billion of tax cut would have on borrowing tax rise elsewhere or public spending or have he simply manage to find the same magic money tree that his predecessor be so fond of this be an omnishamble budget from desperate tory party instead of recklessness labour will take different approach as chancellor will never make commitment without say where the money will come from that be the responsible approach let we turn now to the other tax cut that the chancellor announce yesterday two year ago when the current prime minister want to increase national insurance we oppose it since then have consistently say that want taxis on work people to be low and so just as we support the last cut to national insurance we support the measure announce in the chamber yesterday to bring it down by further let we be clear however the measure come in the context of rise tax burden the high it have be in year and the tax burden be rise in each and every year of the forecast period for every that the government be take from family in high tax under their plan they be only give back they be give with one hand and take twice as much with the other and they expect people to be grateful do my right hon friend agree that the prime minister tax plan will leave household on average bad off under the conservatives my hon friend have do the math and be absolutely right take into account the change to the tax threshold the announcement yesterday and in november and council tax by the end of the forecast period the average family will be bad off as the resolution foundation highlight just this morning the million tax pay pensioner will see their taxis increase by an average of that be collective billion tax grab from our nation pensioner as paul johnson the director of the institute for fiscal studies say yesterday this remain parliament of record tax rise that be the legacy of this conservative government the tory government pickpocketing have mean high taxis on work people leave they with less money at time when their daily life be get more expensive yesterday the chancellor say that person on average earning be well off but let we take look at that claim he have ignore not only his own stealth tax rise with the tax threshold and council tax but the rise cost of energy bill food mortgage and rent in fact rather than be well off as he claim household disposable income be set to fall by per person over the course of this parliament completely agree that deliberately leave tax threshold untouched at time when pay and price be increase be stealth tax it be stealth tax when this chancellor do it but it be also stealth tax when gordon brown do it it be interesting to have an intervention from the snp which be increase taxis on ordinary work people would probably just stay on the bench this be the only parliament on record in which living standard be set to be low at its end than at its beginning the chancellor choose to ignore all those reality but the truth be that ordinary family can not ignore they as people up and down the country know the definition of be well off be have more money under the tories people have less people feel bad off because they be bad off let we look at economic growth growth be critical for our success as nation for our living standard and for provide sustainable funding for public service but the tories have fail there too the context of yesterday budget be prime minister who pledge growth but have deliver recession this economy be now small than when the prime minister take up office instead of bounce back the uk gdp be bump along the bottom this year in his statement the chancellor rightly elevate the true measure of success not just high gdp but high gdp per head official report march vol agree with he that that be the most important yardstick so how be the tories do against that measure the reality be that gdp per capita be set to shrink not grow this year have shrink and not grow last year too gdp per capita be now expect to be low at the end of this year than it be at the start of this parliament yesterday we learn that forecast gdp per capita growth have be revise down for four of the next five year hardly the success that the chancellor be look for the chancellor say that it be important not to follow path that rely on net migration to provide growth and gdp and agree have the secretary of state for work and pensions see the chart on page of the office for budget responsibility economic and fiscal outlook which show that net migration have be revise up by over the next five year that be the exact opposite of what the chancellor speak about our country have go through difficult time over these past few year the origin of many of the crisis we have face be global pandemic war and the energy crisis other country have also experience those shock but each time crisis have hit britain have find itself acutely expose because of the choice of successive conservative government austerity that choke off investment then brexit without plan and then the tories crash the economy with their kamikaze budget this tory record of economic failure have hold our country back for far too long if the uk economy have grow at the average of the oecd rate since when the conservatives come to office it would now be billion big than it be today that be equivalent to per household every year and would mean an additional billion in tax revenue to invest in our public service growth matter but the tories be incapable of deliver it interruption the hon member for newcastle under lyme aaron bell say from sedentary position that we be do well than the there be only two country in recession today we and japan that be the conservatives record and they should be ashamed of it this be the tory plan for growth in year and we be still in recession twelve plan from five prime ministers and seven chancellors with none of they succeed we be trap in tory doom loop of low growth and high taxis and it be work people who be pay the price be struggle bit with the right hon lady figure my own calculation suggest that this year pensioner will see an increase of from an increase in the state pension as result of the triple lock in all think pensioner will be get more than they be in that be huge increase in their income alongside all the help with the cost of living and winter fuel yet the right hon lady be say early that pensioner be go to be bad off do not follow her math can she help those number about pensioner who pay tax be from the resolution foundation they be publish this morning so the hon gentleman can also look at they but it be fact that because the tax threshold have be freeze pensioner who pay tax be pay more tax than they be before that be the legacy of this government this be not just about line on graph it be about our high street it be about whether business grow and it be about whether we can create secure well pay job in all part of the country with more money in the pocket of work people because if an economy do not work for work people it do not work at all when the tories be not pickpockete the taxpayer they be pickpockete labour policy have spend year defend the indefensible the tories have belatedly listen to labour and recognise the importance of close the non dom tax loophole believe that if people make britain their home they should pay their taxis here too the office for budget responsibility say that the steady state amount of revenue raise by the non dom policy be billion per year first call for that loophole to be close when it enter the public consciousness two year ago that some people be not pay their fair share of taxis mean that we have miss out of billion in tax revenue money that could have be invest in our public service if any further proof be need that labour be win the battle of idea it be our time limit windfall tax on the oil and gas producer have originally oppose the creation of such tax the tories be drag kick and scream by labour to create an energy profit levy even after yesterday announcement of one year extension the tories be still leave gap loophole mean that many energy giant will still pay less in tax meanwhile the snp oppose our proper windfall tax while just three week ago it put up taxis on work people in scotland on teacher nurse and plumber will the right hon lady give way will happily take another intervention if the hon gentleman want to defend high taxis on work people bring it on do the shadow chancellor not understand that the snp position be that there should not be single windfall tax that punish only north east scotland windfall tax should be apply to every sector that have profiteer from war covid and price increase do she not understand that the snp income tax policy mean that low pay worker the people the labour party be suppose to protect pay less income tax in scotland than they would in england and that nurse and care worker be pay more in scotland than in england that be true be it not all would say to the hon gentleman be put that on your leaflet the fact be that nurse teacher and plumber be pay more tax in scotland at the same time the energy giant that be make huge profit from the windfall of war will pay less tax under the snp that be its record and it should be ashamed of it labour be committed to invest more in our school and hospital that be priority before the budget and it remain priority because public service be on their knee after year of conservative failure labour believe in aspiration for all our child and we will not stand by while the roof fall in on state education under the tories history be repeat itself child be again be teach in portacabin as they be when be at school under tory government when the tories undervalue our young people they be squander their potential and undermine our whole country future that be why the next labour government will close the tax loophole enjoy by private school the money raise from end their exemption from business rate and vat will instead go where it be need to help the of child in our state school will always be clear that all the policy in our manifesto will be fully cost and fully fund now that the tories have turn on their policy on non dom which we welcome we will do the necessary work to show how our plan will be pay for we will set that out in an orderly and responsible way our public service be in mess under the conservatives but labour government will begin to turn they around give an immediate injection of cash to our school and our hospital and tackle tory waste through serious plan to grow our economy and provide the sustainable finance that our public service need it take some nerve for the chancellor to wag his finger at local council this week when the tories and the prime minister have squander billion of pound of taxpayer hard earn money who have use excessive number of management consultant in central government the tories who sign the cheque and lose an additional billion through dodgy personal protective equipment contract the tories who leave the vault open so that organise criminal gang could help themselves to billion of public money through covid fraud the tories who make costly mess of the tories who hand million to the rwanda government and have nothing to show for it the tories will my right hon friend give way maybe my hon friend have another example my right hon friend be absolutely right because every area of conservative spending have dimension of waste or profligacy do she agree that the of taxpayer money spend on settle the attack make by the secretary of state for science innovation and technology on british scientist an entirely unfounded and defamatory attack would have be so much well spend support british scientist to drive british economic growth think taxpayer will find it pretty grating to see their tax bill go up when that money be spend so callously and casually meanwhile the chancellor fail to do the right thing yesterday when he do not set out in the budget compensation for those affect by the infected blood scandal or for wrongly accuse sub postmaster that be an abdication of responsibility and betrayal of all those who have fight for justice for so many year and it will not be forgive be under no illusion about the scale of the challenge that we may inherit or the scale of the task of rebuild our economy and country labour economic plan will take britain from instability and short termism to mission base government prioritise economic growth and security for family and our country government build on the pillar of stability investment and reform stability be bring about by iron discipline guide by strong fiscal rule and robust economic institution investment be bring about by work with the private sector so that we can lead the industry of the future through modern industrial strategy new national wealth fund will invest alongside business in our automotive sector renewable ready port and the future of our steel industry reform start with our planning system we will take on vested interest to get britain build again support work people in develop the skill that they need to thrive in the change world of work and make work pay with genuine living wage and new deal for work people our economy need change britain need change the verdict on the budget be in there be no long term plan for growth and lead business organisation agree the institute of directors say that the budget fall short of deliver comprehensive plan for sustainable growth the british retail consortium say the chancellor have do little to promote growth and investment the trades union congress have highlight that real pay be still below where it be in whichever way we look at it the tories have fail on the economy the damage be do nothing this week will compensate for the fact that people be bad off under the tories take and hand back be swindle not giveaway work people pay more pensioner pay more and homeowner continue to pay more reckless and desperate promise be repeat the lesson from the budget be simple the conservatives can not be trust with the economy the question that people ask ahead of the next election be simple be my family and well off after year of conservative government do our school hospital police and transport work well than when the conservatives come to office year ago frankly do anything in our country work well than when the conservatives come to power the answer be resound no if the tories have any confidence in their plan and their record they would name the date of the general election it be time for the british people to give their verdict on year of tory failure only labour can provide the change that our country so desperately need rise order before call the secretary of state remind member that if they intervene on another member it be important to wait until the end of their speech before leave the chamber it be discourteous to leave before the speech have finish that be just reminder be sure that everyone will follow that rule call the secretary of state thank you madam deputy speaker the right hon lady commence her remark by say much about where labour be on tax she criticise the aspiration that the government rightly have to abolish national insurance at some point in the future she rather disingenuously reposition that as firm commitment rather than an aspiration but let we set that to one side the right hon lady know all about firm commitment because we have firm commitment from she to worth of spending every year over the forecast period that do not survive contact with reality indeed she have little to say that be original when she write about economic she have to cut and paste from wikipedia when she trumpet she ruinous billion spending plan she ultimately have to turn and run for the hill for this shadow chancellor when it be not cut and paste it be cut and run interruption think the right hon lady would like that the right hon lady have also accept our tax measure as set out in yesterday budget include the abolition of non dom status and the windfall tax on oil and gas she have hypothecate the money raise from those two measure many time over for the nhs dentistry breakfast club and so on now that she have accept all the tax measure in the budget invite she to come back to the dispatch box will give way to she if she will let we know whether she will turn again on her spending commitment on the nhs and dentistry or whether she will put up taxis and borrowing would be very happy to hear from she all right perhaps not when the secretary of state be chair of the treasury committee he be keen on office for budget responsibility assessment and forecast indeed he argue for they but his then prime minister and chancellor fail to listen to he and crash the economy he and his government want to pursue the aspiration as he now call it of scrap national insurance contribution altogether which would cost billion year will he commit to seek an obr forecast and assessment of that and show how the government would pay for that let talk about the general point that the right hon member for leeds west rachel reeves make about the tax burden it be as if history have be erase from her mind the fact be that the covid pandemic shrink the economy overnight by and this government step in support job and save million job as result of the intervention that we come forward with it be as if it have be erase from her memory that war be go on between russia and ukraine and that that have lead to an increase in energy price and inflation this government have step in to support the most vulnerable in society include family pensioner and the disabled up and down this country the government provide billion of support across that period and in all candour do not believe that there be single occasion on which she oppose any of our intervention she be up for spend the money to support people but not up for recognise that it have to be repay that be why the tax burden be indeed increase to go back to the point about the obr economic and fiscal outlook raise by the hon member for bethnal green and bow rushanara ali the obr make it clear that the measure take yesterday in the budget mean that the tax burden will be low than be forecast in the autumn as result of the management of the economy and the reduction in taxis that my right hon friend the chancellor bring forward the secretary of state might not be surprised that labour member take it little unkindly when he suggest that we be forget the past when he seem to have forget the immediate past and the state that the former prime minister leave the british economy in just year ago how much extra debt interest will the government pay as result of the chancellor unfunded commitment to abolish national insurance contribution at cost of billion it be an entirely disingenuous statement to say that there be any such unfunded commitment the only unfunded commitment in recent time be the billion that the labour party come forward with the leader of the opposition call it something along the line of absolutely critical only for the shadow chancellor to turn on it not long afterwards let turn to the comment that the right hon member for leeds west make about pensioner she neglect to point out that we have stand by the triple lock since there have be few pensioner in absolute poverty after housing cost that be result of this government make the protection of our pensioner key priority over many year among many thing that have be erase from her memory she have forget that on her watch when gordon brown be chancellor there be the increase in pension this morning the chancellor appear to suggest that income tax and national insurance contribution will be merge as part of his commitment yesterday as national insurance be not currently levy on some form of income will the secretary of state confirm to the house how much extra tax pensioner will pay as result of the chancellor policy decision there be no immediate government approach to merge income tax and national insurance and rather put that in the category of those comment about the apparent commitment of billion although think the hon member for bethnal green and bow nudge it up in typical labour way to billion moment ago let turn to the remark that the right hon member for leeds west make about growth as she know we have have technical recession of two quarter of negative growth one of which be the princely amount of most of the purchasing manager index datum make it clear that the economy be on very different path indeed to return to the comment of the hon member for bethnal green and bow the obr make it clear that over the period of the forecast there will be reasonable and decent growth great than that of france italy and germany that be on the back of exactly the kind of growth record that this government have have since on growth it be the former prime minister when seek election as leader of her party who characterise the growth record since as lamentable she be surely absolutely right about that particular point my point be that the externality that refer to such as covid and the war between ukraine and russia have impact economy around the world relative to other economy and look at the obr forecast over the next five year we will have growth record that be up there and well than many of our major competitor include country such as germany to clarify point that perhaps have misunderstood what be the growth per capita record for the last seven quarter my point clearly remain that growth be function of both the size of the population and the level of productivity as consequence of all the element that feed into growth the obr have confirm that we will be grow little fast at certain time than be anticipate at the time of the autumn statement and our growth will compare favourably with country such as germany this debate be mean to be about make work pay and the right hon member for leeds west have very little in fact next to nothing to say about that interruption as she say from sedentary position she mention the national living wage something the conservative party be proud that it bring into being indicate dissent you be think of the national minimum wage the national living wage be conservative decision interruption you do but it be pleasure to correct you on this order this be the problem with conversation across the dispatch box it be very difficult for the hansard writer to follow if we veer off into private conversation it should all come through the chair be sorry madam deputy speaker and be sorry for hansard but it be quite enjoyable this debate be about make work pay and the right hon member for leeds west have precious little to say about that wonder why that might be might it be because unemployment have always go up under labour government that be simple fact for she to think about it rise by million under the last labour government youth unemployment rise by under the last labour government and the number of household in which no one have ever work double during the last labour government find it particularly strike that under labour million people spend almost decade on out of work benefit labour should be ashamed of that record of its time in office the minister mention make work pay but unison have point out that number of social care worker be be disadvantage because hmrc mileage rate have not change since do the treasury not believe that the cost of run motor vehicle have change in the last year one of the principal cost of run motor vehicle be the fuel in the tank because of our stewardship of the economy the chancellor be able to announce yesterday that we be freeze fuel duty for the year in succession as well as beer duty to help those support our vital pub yesterday budget set the course for bright future for our country it be budget for long term growth with more investment more job and an economy that be turn the corner that have allow we to cut taxis because this government believe in rewarding aspiration and hard work be incredibly grateful to the minister for give way second time remind he that the tax burden have go up by billion in the last year and it will go up by billion after the election because of decision his party make people who earn less than will be bad off because of the budget two decade of lose pay growth that be the record of his government over the last year think have already cover this point but the reality be that the tax burden have have to go up to pay for all the support we provide around covid and because of the inflationary pressure create by war on european soil the hon lady can not get away from the fact that through this fiscal event and the previous one million hard work people employ in business up and down the country will be well off to the extent of per year some million self employ people will be per year well off she talk about those earn less than but those many million of people who earn above will have low tax burden than before when we take into account the interplay of the freezing of threshold and the cut in national insurance it have be widely report that the taxpayer be have to pick up the tab for of legal cost and damage incur because of the action of the secretary of state for science innovation and technology the right hon member for chippenham michelle donelan who be rapidly become know as the hon member for chip in will the minister confirm that the figure of be correct will he say whether he think it be morally right that the taxpayer should be pick up the bill for the outrageous lack of judgment and behaviour of one of his colleague what think will be absolutely outrageous be the taxpayer have to pick up the bill for future labour government have just explain the record of the hon gentleman party in government my right hon friend be make good case for yesterday announcement in the budget he have deal very thoroughly with labour record when in office but will he turn his attention to its present proposal if labour will not reverse the tax on non dom or the cut to national insurance do that not leave whopping billion in uncosted expenditure pledge my hon friend be absolutely right at the beginning of my speech invite the shadow chancellor to explain to the house what she will do give that the non dom status will be abolish and windfall taxis on oil and gas will come forward will she once again turn and run for the hill as she do with the billion or will she raise taxis or borrowing answer come there none when the minister have time he might want to read the shadow chancellor speech in hansard and help his colleague who will be speak later may take he back to the subject of ordinary people as result of last year mini budget people who remortgage be now pay more real money for they than they be previously if he do not accept that there be billion hole as result of yesterday announcement will he tell we what he think the figure be can he assure people who be remortgage this year that they will not be far impact by yesterday announcement and that there will not be further scare on those market can reassure all mortgage holder up and down the country that this government be absolutely determined to see inflation return to its target the obr economic and fiscal outlook publish yesterday make it clear that we will meet the target one year early than it forecast in the autumn the significance of that for interest rate be obvious interest rate will come down fast if inflation recede quick and that be exactly what have happen on that point will the minister give way have be very generous with my time but how can say no must then make some progress the minister be decent man the government make much of get value for money but they have little to say about the handing over of teesside great land asset to two private developer who have since bank ten of million of pound in profit leave crumb for the public that be after the investment of million of taxpayer money and no private investment be the minister content with that or do he believe as his own government inquiry into the tees mayor business dealing recommend that the deal should be renegotiate will not get into the weed of the issue that the hon gentleman be attempt to draw into other than to say that he make at least one comment that agree with be indeed decent man thank he very much for that inflation be fall fast than expect people wage be rise in real term and have do for the last seven month under this government our labour market have be strong and resilient deliver opportunity despite the headwind we have put incentive at the heart of our welfare we have grow fast than germany france or italy accord to the obr we will continue to do so over the next five year we be attract the business investment that be key to growth deliver quality job across the country from nissan to google to astrazeneca which announce million of investment only yesterday no matter how much the labour party seek to talk down britain the investment flow into our economy be huge vote of confidence in our country it show that our plan be work by contrast as have be lay all too bare this afternoon the labour party have no plan or credible record have already go through the tale of woe about the level of unemployment that labour have leave we in the past those poor young people have increase in youth employment on the watch of the shadow chancellor party and over million people be leave on out of work benefit for almost decade on the government benches we believe that work not welfare be key to improve living standard that be why we be incentivise and rewarding work in this budget make work pay and ensure family be well off mean tackle the global inflation that have refer to on which we be make significant progress as inflation decrease we recognise that there be still some people who need extra help be pleased to see the extension of the household support fund for further six month from april which be also push for by the chair of the work and pensions committee the right hon member for east ham sir stephen timms the minister be right that warmly welcome that extension be there not strong case for make the household support fund permanent not just extend it for another six month six month be meaningful period of time inflation be come down as the obr say in its report inflation be expect to hit target within the next few month which will make huge difference it highlight some uncertainty around that but million of investment over six month include barnett consequential be major move forward to support the most vulnerable the sustainable way to change life be through work and the evidence could not be clear it be good for the economy community and the individual concern want everyone who can work to have the opportunity to do so one of the great labour market challenge be economic inactivity and want to put that into context in the uk inactivity have come down since its pandemic peak and remain low than the average across the the oecd and the european union our progress have see significant fall in the number of people who be inactive because of care responsibility we have the second low youth inactivity rate in the and thousand of be return to work however the rise in the number of people out of work due to ill health and disability be stifle potential potential that be determined to realise that be why as we cut taxis for work people our multibillion pound back to work plan be provide substantial support to help the long term sick return to work and keep people in the workforce that include double the number of placement on universal support expand access to mental health support deliver work well give people early and well access to integrated work and health support reform fit note and work with employer to improve occupational health through our next generation of welfare reform we be break down the barrier to work our chance to work guarantee will enable people on incapacity benefit to try work without fear of lose their benefit if job do not work out as the obr have confirm our reform to the work capability assessment will reduce the number of people on those benefit by that be more people get the support they need to enter employment as part of our back to work plan we be also tackle long term unemployment because the long people stay in unemployment the less likely they be to rejoin the workforce that be why we be phase in more rigorous requirement for fit and able jobseeker with more time with work coach more intensive support and mandatory work placement ultimately if claimant do not engage with the support they be be offer they will lose their benefit underscore our belief that we should always be there for those who need our support but we must equally be fair to taxpayer by contrast for all the protestation from the opposition that they have change they be not fool anybody they be squeamish on conditionality weak on sanction and completely out of touch with the british public who rightly expect welfare system in which everyone meet their obligation rise rise be be ask to conclude so think need to do that interruption have be pretty generous in give way to just about everybody who have seek to catch my eye this be budget that reward work and will grow the economy it come on the back of once in century challenge that this government have meet we have turn the corner and this budget take we far still it reward work with low taxis it deliver growth it make work pay and it ensure bright future for we all call the snp spokesperson think it be interesting when the topic for these budget debate be set because those topic be what the government want we to believe the budget be all about there be no mention of public service the cost of living or climate change and net zero for any of the three day we be talk about rewarding work and want to talk about reward not only those currently in work but those who will be and have previously be in the workforce because all three group have be shamefully fail in this budget for rewarding work mean pay everybody living wage not minimum wage the minister should be listen but he do not particularly care about this wage that be not enough to live on be not living wage it be as simple as that there be nothing in the budget about ban exploitative zero hour contact there be nothing obviously about repeal the shameful anti strike legislation that the government be impose on great number of public sector worker wonder whether it be just that the topic choose be not that good and perhaps the chancellor say more about those subject in his speech have look at the speech on the treasury website all odd word of it the word poverty be mention once but low pay and zero hour not at all net zero get mention because the chancellor mention his colleague the secretary of state for energy security and net zero and zero emission be mention once climate have not single mention and brexit not surprisingly as we be not allow to talk about it any more have no mention by necessity some of my remark have to be about what be not in the budget as much as what be this government be head to become the bad government in history for fall living standard the institute for fiscal studies have tell we that it be unlikely that real household income will be any high at the end of this parliament than they be at the beginning how can we call it economic growth when people in their real life in real house with real job do not notice any improvement in their standard of live over an entire five year tax as percentage of gdp will soon be the high it have ever be we have see billion increase in the tax burden in this parliament alone and far too often it be people on low income who pick up the big share as have be mention the six year freeze on tax threshold will cost taxpayer an extra billion in stealth tax by even allow for the impact of the national insurance cut the uk interest payment as percentage of national income be about to become the high for year if someone be an international banker the reward from work can be rich indeed but they be not for someone try to scrape living in any kind of normal job this chancellor time in office have see the long unbroken run of decline living standard since record begin the government talk about rewarding work but it be quite the opposite income inequality in the united kingdom be high than in any other large european economy what have the united kingdom do that they do not and what have everyone else do that the united kingdom do not do germany for example have covid pandemic just as we do germany be impact by the war in ukraine just as much as we be possibly more so because it be physically close to it middle income earner in the united kingdom be poor than their equivalent in germany wonder what it could be that affect the economy and living standard in the united kingdom that have not have the same impact on germany france italy and other eu member state we be not allow to say the word so will leave the chancellor to work it out for himself as the child poverty action group have point out child poverty be not inevitable but choice it have say with the right policy change we can substantially reduce the extent and depth of child poverty across the country member do not have to take its word for what might happen if policy be change they need only look to what have happen in scotland despite the fact that the scottish government have substantially few fiscal monetary and legislative power than this place scotland now have the game change scottish child payment that be not our word but that of the child poverty action group we have the child winter heating payment support the most vulnerable young people with disability to cope with their fuel bill we have free school meal for everybody in primary to and for eligible child throughout their time in school the hon member mention the child poverty action group after the scottish government budget it say that it be bitterly disappointed and that as it stand the budget will at good stall progress hamper progress towards reduce child poverty do the hon member think his own government be reduce child poverty as much as they could be will come on to that in minute the scottish government be perhaps not reduce child poverty as much as they could because nobody be ever perfect but they be do bloom sight more than any government down here ever will as say we have free school meal for everybody in the first five year of primary school and for great many child right up until they leave school we have follow the example of our scandinavian friend by welcome every newborn baby in scotland with baby box contain the essential for the first six month of their life that be not just about practical physical help it be also about the difference it make to new mum it simply say to they we think your new baby be somebody special your baby be welcome as new citizen of our country we have more than hour year of early learning and childcare for every three year old and four year old and all eligible two year old just to correct an early point when the hon member say that the scottish government would do more than any government down here helpfully remind he that the last labour government lift hundred of thousand of child think up to million out of poverty and we would seek to do that sort of work again who be in government here in westminster do make difference do he not agree be not say that government here can not do it in fact be say that government here can do it the problem be that the government which the hon member party say we could trust with the welfare system be not do that we have also introduce free bus travel throughout scotland for million people include all young people up to the age of that be important because it not only significantly help those people with the cost of their travel and therefore the cost of living but it encourage young people not to get into the habit of travel by car it encourage they to get into the habit of see public transport as viable option in answer to the hon member for rutherglen and hamilton west michael shanks independent analysis have indicate that child in scotland will be keep out of child poverty this year because of action by the scottish government if the uk government be willing simply to do what have already be do in scotland there could be million few child live in poverty in the united kingdom child poverty be not inevitable it be deliberate political choice scotland have choose to say no to child poverty the budget have choose to allow it to continue and to grow as well as the right support for child in low earn family the government could have announce any number of thing to help people in work to have well and secure pay have already mention the living wage and they could have strengthen protection for worker instead of take away the right to strike of those work in all sort of public sector work on strengthen protection be it not true that the snp hire people on zero hour contract to deliver literature during the rutherglen by election read that in private eye it must be true then it be in private eye and therefore it must be true do not know if that have be fact check if the hon gentleman can provide with evidence from something other than private eye we will certainly look into it should say incidentally that the labour party record of industrial relation in its own workforce be nothing to boast about he might want to have look in his own house first of all among the other step that the government could take look forward to likely incoming labour government commit to do all this they could outlaw despicable fire and rehire practice and support the bill propose by my hon friend the member for paisley and renfrewshire north gavin newlands they could ban unpaid work trial as be attempt by my hon friend the member for glasgow south stewart malcolm mcdonald in his private member bill they could give people the right to flexible working rather than make it feel as if it be not really proper working they could finally take action seven year after the taylor review they could repeal the anti strike legislation incidentally the scottish government have undertake not to use any of the anti strike provision include in that legislation look forward to an incoming labour government undertaking not to use they as precursor to repeal they altogether there be some change in the budget that we can mention although they do not go far enough change to the high income child benefit charge be certainly welcome but they do not go far enough to catch up with the downturn in income people have suffer over the year of that freeze in the same way the vat charge threshold for small business which increase by year be welcome but that be not enough even to make up for the deterioration in small business income after seven year of that ongoing stealth tax of course we still have child maintenance liability for non resident parent base on assumption about wage level and cost of live level that be year out of date the government say they do not have time in the legislative programme to bring forward primary legislation to change it however last week the house finish three hour early because we have nothing to talk about come on if they be serious about it they would have do something about it mention net zero and climate change early and welcome the confirmation of up to million more although the word up to worry for the green industry growth accelerator which be to quote the chancellor to build supply chain for new technology range from offshore wind to carbon capture and storage official report march vol can we get an assurance that the government will not make the same mistake with that as they do with contract for difference the former bifab yard in methil in my constituency go into administration because although it could have make jacket for offshore wind turbine under contract for difference firm choose to import they from halfway around the world while worker who could have do that work in my constituency be be lay off we be pay to transport heavy engineer good from the other side of the world will the government commit to review the criterion for the giga to include the manufacture of those jacket they make up about of the total cost of turbine and of the supply chain but be currently exclude from that incentive scheme if include that could help to bolster the workforce in my constituency and number of other across the uk would like the government to welcome again the contribution that green hydrogen can make to our net zero future be very pleased that methil in my constituency be home to the world big ever conversion of domestic gas supply to run on clean renewable green hydrogen it be the big example of that kind of green energy innovation anywhere on the planet the next stage be even more ambitious the government promise to support what they call hydrogen town pilot to extend the same technology and the same practice into ten of thousand of house would love to see that happen in methil and the surround area but would rather see it happen anywhere than not happen at all the government promise an announcement in march last year that be now year overdue and many other with an interest in clean energy technology be concerned that the government be simply lose enthusiasm for this world lead work we throw away our world lead position on other green energy during the thatcher year we can not afford to do it again briefly point out that if we be talk about rewarding work we must also extend that to how we reward those who have finish their work career and now rely on the state pension to get by in spite of all the rhetoric we still have one of the mean state pension in western europe there be still million of waspi woman woman against state pension inequality but the government hope that if they just ignore those woman they will go away they will not so the government have well stop ignore they we have see more than billion illegally underpaid to pensioner that be utterly scandalous and woefully inadequate protection from pension scam both for people build up their private pension and as some member will be all too aware for pension fund such as those of london capital finance british steel and united kingdom atomic energy agency technology and dozen of other we have budget that choose to leave hundred of thousand of child in poverty choose to allow the scandal of low pay and exploitative work practice to continue and choose to continue inflict stealth taxis that hit low pay worker hard in answer to what the shadow chancellor say early do not have problem with debate progressive tax regime that have low taxation for the low pay and high taxation for those who be well off when we be talk about high rate of tax and low rate of tax though we should remember the entire tax burden and not just be selective about income tax for example let we look at council tax be the proud possessor of two council tax bill with one for my house in glenrothes and one that be pay by the taxpayer for the flat use while be down here so have the flat in london and fortunately for very nice detach house in glenrothes the flat in london already cost more in council tax than the house in glenrothes and this year the labour control council whose area live in be likely to increase the council tax by while the council in fife have accept the scottish government funding to allow it to freeze council tax the council tax on the flat in london will therefore be high than that on very nice spacious detach house in glenrothes when we be talk about the different tax burden on people between the two country let we consider the entire tax burden not just the narrowly define income tax burden of course as mention before one reason why some people in scotland pay high taxis be that they be pay more than their colleague do the same job south of the border the budget choose not to support the child of work people it choose not to support work people then when people work life be over it treat they far bad than people of similar age and similar background be entitle to be treat in almost any other civilised economy by contrast the snp have vision for country where every child and every parent be value and support and know that they be value and support every worker be guarantee fair wage every worker be protect from exploitation every pensioner be entitle to pension that be enough to live on without have to fall back on state benefit and people get the care they need as they grow old and less able to look after themselves value and fairly rewarding not only today worker but the next generation of worker and previous generation of worker all of whom have be let down by this budget hold out no great enthusiasm that an incoming labour government will significantly change the situation would like to be prove wrong but can not really see it happen during the shadow chancellor speech it may have be an intervention it be say that if the tories have any confidence in their record they should name the date for the general election absolutely can suggest that if the incoming labour government have any confidence in the record of the union they would have no hesitation in name date on which to put it to democratic test we will wait and see whether the incoming labour government be great respecter of the will of the people of scotland than the outgoing conservative government in his closing remark the chancellor say that those with the broad shoulder should pay their fair share and absolutely agree he also say an economy base on sound money do not pass its bill to the next generation official report march vol oh really agree with both those statement for that reason among other can not support this budget and it do not deserve the support of anyone else in this chamber it be great privilege to follow the hon member for glenrothes peter grant who speak for the scottish national party what do not really hear from he be the justification he and his party use for increase taxis something that be total anathema to almost everybody else speak in the debate who be complain about the high level of taxis we already have welcome the government rethink on national insurance as somebody who have regularly vote against increase in national insurance by previous chancellors of the exchequer be delighted by the change of heart also welcome the rethink on the unfairness of the high income child benefit charge when it be be legislate on put lot of time and energy into ask question about it and speak and vote against it however could not persuade anybody in the conservative government then that it be extremely unfair that household with an income of come from one person be subject to this charge while two earner be able to avoid it by each earn that will now be put right in my view it be long overdue but it be none the less welcome would however be interested in ask the minister specific question arise from what be say about this issue will the move to his majesty revenue and customs use household level information from enable the government to introduce transferrable tax allowance and end the discrimination in the tax system against married couple that would be an even big benefit of introduce household level information and from tax people on that basis hope that that will be one of the great spin off from this initiative and would be grateful if the minister could respond to that point when he wind up welcome the increase in the vat threshold from to however that be pretty meagre increase after seven year in which the threshold be frozen and would like to see it go even high also welcome the great british isa but why be it limit to last night we have an amazing gathering in the guildhall in london do not know whether any of my hon friend on the front bench be there it be celebration of the anniversary of the centre for policy studies and it be great occasion it celebrate the work that keith joseph margaret thatcher and alfred sherman do year ago in set up what have be the most successful conservative think tank of all time have to say however that there be universal disappointment in the audience that the overall tax burden have not peak and that the budget statement confirm that it will rise even far in each of the next four year and beyond despite the fact that we already have the high tax burden ever there seem to be no explanation as to why the conservative government be still pursue that policy of increase the tax burden as ever the prime minister speak eloquently echo the philosophy and found principle of the centre for policy studies he speak of the small state the need for low taxis and promote enterprise and supply side reform indeed his rhetoric chime with the chancellor own budget statement and will quote three of they the first be conservative know that low tax mean high growth official report march vol the second be keep taxis down matter to conservatives the third be that lower tax economy have more energy more dynamism and more innovation official report march vol could not agree more yet we have budget that be actually increase the overall burden of taxation and that seem to run counter to that rhetoric my constituent be concerned about action rather than word and hope that in respond to the debate my hon friend the minister will explain why the budget content do not fit with that rhetoric where do that leave we as we approach general election from my point of view the soon we have one the well want to be able to tell my constituent that they have choice between conservative government who be really committed to the enterprise economy follow in the step of the centre for policy studies margaret thatcher and keith joseph and labour government who be commit to ever high taxis and burden on individual with dire consequence for economic growth at the moment however be not sure that that be be spell out with sufficient clarity to enable we to make the case as strongly as would like when the general election come another issue raise in the budget be that of low if not decline public sector productivity which be scandal of the high order lip service be pay to address the problem of low productivity in the national health service but low productivity have be endemic in the nhs for year be look at book produce by lord crisp nigel crisp when he work for the nhs and in it he refer to the low or decline productivity in the nhs between about and the late figure also show decline in productivity in the nhs two year ago the government commit themselves to productivity increase of per annum in the nhs think that that be already policy but see in the budget statement that the head of the nhs amanda pritchard be say well with the extra initiative from the government we might even be able to get to productivity increase of will give the hon gentleman second to take breath do he accept that the nhs do not sit in isolation it be part of wide ecosystem of public service and it reflect local community so many preventive early intervention service such as those provide by local government have be take away and that have an impact like the hon gentleman will be aware that we have see few worker in local government since but more worker in central government and the civil service have grow too that shift have definitely have an impact on productivity agree with the hon gentleman that by expand the public sector and the number of administrator we be undermine our attempt to increase productivity the obr say that increase in productivity would give we billion dividend so instead of fuss about billion here there or whatever why do the government not concentrate on productivity one example of the lack of productivity be the increase in bed block have an example from my constituency which raise in parliamentary question recently on january patient in acute hospital in dorset be there with no criterion to reside which be how what use to be call bed block be describe these day if we take ballpark figure and say that each of those bed cost about night that be night if we multiply that by the day of the year we get an enormous figure money be be waste through the nhs inability to address that long stand problem despite the establishment of integrate care board the problem be get bad rather than well the whole essence of integrate care board be to try to link together all the player do the hon gentleman agree that not enough appropriate shelter housing have be build over the past year give the age population surely we should be make great provision my constituency have an enormous amount of sheltered housing and housing specifically for pensioner lot of it be vacant it have be build but it be not occupy at the moment be not give plug for churchill or any of the other housing developer but do not think that issue be really the key the key be knock some head together and get they to realise that when somebody be ready to leave hospital they do so and that there be significant penalty if they do not there be lot of other example of where we have productivity crisis it be worth recall that sir roy griffiths who be bring in by margaret thatcher in to try to introduce great efficiency into the health service say if florence nightingale be carry her lamp through the corridor of the nhs today she would almost certainly be search for the people in charge one could bring that up to date now and say that today florence nightingale would almost certainly be look for anyone willing to get to grip with low productivity in the nhs hope that the government will get lot more serious about the issue than they have be hitherto my final point be about the dynamism that come to the economy if we reduce taxis and encourage growth through that mean in his speech the chancellor make pass reference to arthur laffer and his curve some of my hon friend may have be present at previous dinner organise by the centre for policy studies at which the speaker be dr laffer himself still treasure napkin that have his handwritten curve on it why be we not apply the principle of his curve more widely in his aside about laffer in the context of reduce capital gain tax from to the chancellor be more or less say well at last my official be wake up to the importance of this but who be in charge if the chancellor of the exchequer and the prime minister believe in the virtue of the laffer curve and the dynamism that come from low tax low regulation economy surely they should be get grip on that rather than leave it to anonymous officialdom hope that we will be able to make more progress on these key issue and demonstrate to the public that there be indeed big chasm between the two party vie to form the next government we believe in the virtue of low taxis promote enterprise and increase productivity particularly in the public sector the other lot be beholden particularly to the union which take back to where start off in politic when be first elect to wandsworth borough council year ago this week in this budget debate want to focus particularly on school child and young people and the pressure face headteacher and local authority in struggle to balance their budget we get one chance at get child primary education right they will not get those year back and we will not get that opportunity back it be the one and only chance to set the foundation for their future and every child be building block on which our hope and aspiration for the country rest in january this year the local campaign group calderdale against school cuts conduct an anonymous survey of all calderdale primary headteacher about their budget and how they be manage school funding some of the school contact complete and return the survey represent broad cross section of school from right across calderdale community the survey reveal that in this financial year half of all headteacher have make reduction to teaching staff while have not replace staff who have leave some have reduce support staff and of primary head be plan to make staff redundant to balance the book some of school have be force to cut back on maintenance and building repair perhaps most worryingly of the head who respond anticipate that their school would be struggle to cope in the near future with concern about balance the school budget for the next three year an ever increase number of school now face the prospect of deficit budget force they to make redundancy within both their support and teaching staff the result show that because of financial constraint the non replacement of staff be no long choice but necessity which place even great demand on the already stretch remain staff headteacher be keen to stress that it have become increasingly difficult to recruit support staff to work in school give that they can earn more work in local supermarket for example in addition to the financial pressure face all school there have be what we can only describe as an explosion in the number of child with emotional behavioural or mental health difficulty and school be especially struggle with resource funding and specialist support for that cohort of child calderdale council have predict million overspend on high need child it also report increase in the number of child with education health and care plan since covid when school have child with additional need recognise by an ehcp it have to find from its exist budget the first to provide support for that child in reality the only way that be achievable be by divert money away from the day to day provision of teaching and learning the halifax courier run the survey result on its front page with headline about how cut be push school to the edge the article include this quote our survey confirm that cut to funding rise poverty and send be push school to breaking point nationally accord to the department for education own figure one in eight local authority maintain school be in deficit in the high number of school in deficit on record the observer also run the survey result with quote from yorkshire primary head teacher we be approach time when it be safe to open there will be child who be be violent and there will be enough staff to manage she say that she have not be able to justify replace teacher and support staff who have resign over the past year and that in september she will be force to merge year of child contain many who be vulnerable and have additional need with the year above because they be lose yet another teacher she say you have to do it to make your budget work but what about the impact on the child mungo sheppard the truly outstanding headteacher at ash green primary school which serve the mixenden area of halifax in my constituency tell the observer head be force to balance the book rather than say how many staff do we actually need for our child it terrifying he say that some local school be have to cut pastoral role as well as teach job and that many no long have enough classroom support staff to cater for the ever grow need of child he add that despite be over subscribed his school will have large deficit by april next year and other local school be already in perilous situation run out of money ash green serve one of the most deprived part of my home town lead by mr sheppard the staff deliver food and voucher during covid just to make sure that child and their family have at least some food on the table just when staff be start to get some respite from the soul destroy challenge of covid the school be hit by deliberate arson which tear through several classroom the school run breakfast club because so many child be go without and it have also set up lending scheme for family and parent who have nowhere else to turn the staff at ash green represent school staff up and down the country who have to overcome so many challenge before they can start the school day it be just not right that the staff and headteacher spend so much time worry about how he will balance the book in order to cover the basic of pay the staff wage and keep building and child safe school be increasingly pick up the piece of our broken society the government have finally wake up to do something about non dom tax status adopt our long stand policy and we be still committed to fund breakfast club additional teacher and mental health specialist in school pledge that we know be necessary and that we be incredibly proud of there be nothing in yesterday budget for council which have limit mean of provide any additional support to school the labour leadership of calderdale council and some truly dedicated officer be work their sock off to balance its budget they will find way but they be struggle financially and morally to do so in the last financial quarter calderdale council budget for child and young people have million overspend which have increase by million this financial year the big driver of that overspend be the rise number of require placement for child in care with the cost rise significantly the lack of placement availability nationally and locally be key factor as it be everywhere the chancellor have something to say on this issue yesterday state too many child in care end up be look after by unregistered provider that be much more report march vol he announce some new investment with the government pledge to develop proposal on what more can be do to combat profiteering bring down cost and create more sustainable market for residential placement which they will publish later this year really struggle with the use of the word market to describe placement for child in care it reveal everything that be wrong with child social care but the announcement come two year after the competition and markets authority conclude that the profit of the large private child home and foster provider be high than would be expect in well function market with average margin of in residential care between and that beg the question of why it have take so long to do anything about this issue why have the government allow the system to become so broken to the detriment of both local council and some of the most vulnerable child in our society with that in mind why on earth be the government not do more to support kinship carer in it be estimate that there be child in kinship care but this figure account for just of child in the care system urge ministers to look again at the family rights group call to extend the financial allowance pathfinder to more local authority and to remove the perverse criterion that child must have previously be look after to be eligible the pilot scheme for new kinship financial allowance be under way in only small number of local authority with very narrow eligibility criterion we know that it could be way forward for council carer and most importantly vulnerable child so will the government please accelerate that work make this issue priority and roll out support for carer beyond the pilot scheme the obr have confirm that this will be the bad parliament on record for living standard and the only parliament on record in which living standard have fall the bbc report that nottingham city council birmingham city council and woking borough council all go bust in follow thurrock council and croydon council for the third time in it be even more harrowing that half of all council be warn that without reform they will be effectively bankrupt within five year do the government think that this be some kind of phenomenon or could it be direct result of their decision making and their action the budget will come as no relief to school or council that be desperately try to undertake their statutory duty to educate child and keep they safe we need to be in position to deliver labour commitment we need general election it be pleasure to follow the hon member for halifax holly lynch she be do so well until she mention thurrock perhaps could give some clarity on why thurrock council get in such bad financial trouble over the last decade as some members will know thurrock be the subject of very aggressive three way politic with the uk independence party hold the balance of power between labour minority administration and conservative minority administration frankly it be impossible to get balanced budget pass because sensible decision would not be take to either increase council tax or reduce spending that lead council officer to pursue risky borrowing strategy in order to plug the gap the lesson we should learn be not so much about the government overall strategy on local government but about the need for all of we wherever we be in public life to take sensible decision base on positive outcome for those we serve listen very carefully to what the hon lady say about special educational need and she be absolutely right it be an issue that we really need to get to grip with the budget be great for provide plenty of knockabout between the front benchers but her speech remind we that we really need to think in more granular way about whether we be deliver the outcome that we want for mature advanced society and particularly about whether we be deliver the good outcome for those who be most vulnerable and perhaps least able to speak for themselves we be witness some very real challenge for child with statement in our school for whole host of reason one of they be that for while there be fashionable view in the educational establishment that child with special need ought to be educate in mainstream setting that will work for many of they but we will fail other include other in the school if we continue with this model overall it have lead to under investment in special provision which have result in so many school have to manage more and more child with special need have see that at first hand in my constituency we have report of massive post pandemic increase in child with statement not all of which be relate to have be out of school some of these thing be genetic there have be massive increase in child present as non verbal and we have not really get to grip with why that be we need to acknowledge that the explosion in special need be be absorb by our school sector let we pay tribute to those work in the sector who be do their good have see at first hand the real effort be make in some of my school to manage this issue and to give the good possible education to all pupil recently visit tudor court primary school in my constituency where be tell that of the school intake now have statement be also tell that the figure be low compare with that for other school which strike as significant indication that this issue ought to become top priority come back to the fact that we must first and foremost look after those who need our help the most not those who shout loudest often say that this place work well for the pointy elbow middle class we really need to make sure that we focus on those who need our help the most the hon lady make an excellent point about special need provision in most authority across the country regardless of the politic of place the situation be really damaging for young people bristol city council have become part of the government safety valve initiative along with neighbour run council and other do she agree that we need to take serious look at this issue across the country to understand both demand and the provision that already exist and that we need to work together for the benefit of child come through the system and their family who be so desperate for support agree and we should embrace this outbreak of consensus the hon lady be absolutely right because we can not tackle this in silo ultimately it be for the local authority to ensure that statement of special educational need be give but equally local authority budget be under pressure go to my local education authority few year ago to talk about the need to progress free school application for special provision and receive clear message we do want to encourage that because people will move here and we would have to look after they until they be we need to look at this at high level to make sure that we deliver the provision that be need across the board turn to the substance of the budget welcome the decision on national insurance which be clearly no long the contributory levy that it once be the idea be that people buy credit towards their pension and out of work benefit entitlement which have become much more universal so national insurance make no sense as separate tax that raise philosophical debate about whether there ought to be contributory principle for some service in particular we still await long term solution to fund social care although welcome the aspiration to remove national insurance we still need to sort out social care funding there be still uncertainty about how we fund social care and local authority be again leave to pick up the pressure it have be very convenient to give local authority that responsibility but we need to do our bit ultimately everything have to be pay for if we be to have mature and sensible long term decision at central government level we need to give local authority the same space while there be still uncertainty about how the cost of social care will be meet local authority can not make sensible decision and the disaster that the hon member for halifax describe will only become more common we need to look again at how to ensure that local authority make mature and sensible decision about their budgeting the audit commission have be replace by audit firm and the frank advice that ought to be give have simply not be give we use to have the surcharge which be very blunt instrument to ensure that councillor make mature and sensible financial decision but now councillor have no stake we often say in this place that we have great champion for local community but we have to show leadership and maturity in make sensible decision when it come to local council we have the same situation on speed they have great local ward champion who view themselves as street by street spokespeople for every problem but they perhaps do not properly recognise their corporate responsibility for make sensible judgment council be multimillion pound business that be there to deliver outcome for the whole local authority area not just individual ward as well as look holistically we need to make sure that where local authority get thing wrong there be an element of accountability outside the ballot box especially because local election turnout be so poor that be all our fault we be all politician and it be our job to motivate people to vote for we be often frustrate by the knockabout of political debate which be big turn off it be sometimes big turn off to sit here on wednesday lunch time for people who be not engage with politic it be an even big turn off the result be that particularly in local politic people zone out and switch off even after the big failure in local government finance the turnout in my local election in thurrock be less than in some ward be that not shocking it tell we that the public be think well it do make any difference it do matter who vote for nothing will change we should all think about that as the general election approach because detect the same mood out there the hon lady be never turn off for she be make some excellent point not least in respect of send child and kinship carer the need of those individual and group should be address on local government finance my local authority be coalition of conservatives independent and lib dems heaven know have criticise it an awful lot quite justifiably but we should recognise that all local authority include mine and thurrock have have to deal with huge cut over the past or year my local authority have have to cut million from its revenue spend be look at some figure and would it not be more sensible to change council tax order we have quite lot of time this afternoon but that be an incredibly long intervention be look forward to the hon gentleman speech in due course acknowledge that there have be cut to local authority budget but the root of this be that so much local authority funding come from the centre where be the accountability as far as local elector be concern the council can spend only what it be give give the cut it be incumbent on council to make sensible decision they can not have their cake and eat it they have to live within their mean give the rainbow coalition that the hon member for easington grahame morris have just describe suspect that there be an awful lot of play to the gallery we expect our councillor to be more mature do my hon friend agree that one of the problem be that we give local authority power of general competence and that we should have concentrate their mind on the thing that they really have to do yes agree with hindsight that be big mistake it be do with the good of intention give that local authority be in new set of circumstance there be desire to give they freedom to be more relevant and to have few constraint but it have give licence to risky behaviour we will see further consequence of that in due course clearly we would all like to be in much well place with regard to the strength and growth rate of our economy and the state of our public finance but we need to reflect that the last year have be challenge we have have three significant shock that have cumulatively make we poor than we would like to be that be just fact the financial crisis have to be manage and we have have the consequence of the pandemic one way or another we lock down our economy for the good part of two year which have clearly have massive impact on growth the billion that we spend on keep people in their job still have to be pay for there be also ukraine not only do we need to support the people of ukraine but we need to address the consequence for energy price return to the need for responsible leadership we should level with the public about what these thing mean the public be not stupid and they be not deceive by spin and rhetoric they know that these shock have consequence if we do not treat people with the respect that they deserve by level with they they will show we the same lack of respect they understand that this all need to be pay for if we do not face up to that we will end up compound the challenge create by those political choice return to the financial crisis clearly there be need for massive intervention to prevent the whole banking system collapse but we get addict to quantitative easing the correction that should have take place follow that financial crisis never happen because guess what we do not want middle class people who vote to have reduction in the value of their property by stick with that policy we end up with interest rate that be artificially low for very long time which completely distort asset class price that mean that everyone put all their investment into property which have contribute to massive generational unfairness because people can not now afford to buy house do that not just show the short termism and the failure to get real explain thing to the public and make long term financial decision that will do the most to grow this country we all bemoan the lack of growth in our economy but if we have generate system where there be more profit to be make by invest in housing than in business and wealth creation this be where we end up we all need to make determined effort to be more long term in our decision making and not just pursue the retail benefit of go up few percentage point in the opinion poll we spend billion during lockdown to keep people in their job but again that have to be repay by the taxpayer people do understand that they know that nothing can be make for free we also need to address the wide consequence of what we do in lockdown because there be long term impact on our nation productivity we be all psychologically damage by be take out of social circulation for two year and we have end up with work practice that be not always the most efficient bad of all we have an expectation that the state will deal with every problem again we need to get back to have the leadership that say we ve all collectively get to fix this problem fight covid be the equivalent of fight war after the second world war everyone know that there be go to be massive effort to get our country back together again we have pretend never more so than on public service that the situation be easy than it be hear over and over again about underfunding but what do that mean if there be not enough money to deliver what people be expect we have to be honest about that and cut our cloth we have to recognise that nothing can be deliver without be pay for so we must either increase taxis or look at what we be deliver we all want to get to position where we be much rich and can pay for lot more but concession will have to be make before we get to that place after the shock we have have to deal with we also need to have much more honest debate about what we should be spend our money on the situation in ukraine clearly illustrate the need to spend more on defence since we have take our eye off the ball but we now face more challenging and unstable world to keep our energy price low and stable the good measure be to invest in defence at an increase rate the two big challenge that face we be perhaps not the focus of mature debate or leadership by this place first there be no doubt that the public think we have too much immigration on which we have become dependent as source of cheap labour from the uk openness to immigration from eastern europe have very positive effect on growth but it be growth as in the overall quantum the impact on individual productivity earning and gdp per capita be poor because earning be depressed overall the resentment towards immigration come from lot of those people who find their earning diminish as consequence we think about the auf wiedersehen pet generation of builder and labourer who earn lot of money by go overseas they find that their earning be deplete because people here be choose to employ lithuanians and poles because that be cheap labour naturally they will have clear view that immigration have reduce their earning the hon lady account be completely inaccurate often uk employer have employ worker from the european union because the labour have not be available here that be why for example we now have crisis in recruitment to social care profession we have stop the europeans come in and there be nobody in the uk who be able to do the work on social care the hon gentleman have fair point but do not think that what he say be true as regard hgv driver builder labourer or anyone else in the construction industry it be true that we have rely on cheap migrant labour to deliver social care but that be largely because we have not value social care as profession while we have have that abundance of cheap labour in the sector we have also be able to kick the can down the road about how we fund social care and our later stage of life so the impact have be not just on earning but on allow policymaker to be lazy about grapple with these difficult issue my hon friend be make an important speech with the authentic voice of common sense conservatism which we need to hear much more of the point she make about the depressive effect on wage of the high immigration so far this century be incredibly important and relevant to the debate we be have about the workforce do she agree that at least our party have plan to reduce legal migration substantially in the year ahead which be more than we hear from any opposition party do agree that we have plan but say to my hon friend that it have to be more than word it have to be deliver on be sure he would agree on that he will have hear as many of we have about how many industry have lobby we to ensure that such and such profession be add to the skilled workforce list those employer do not want to pay those high wage and we as politician need to be robust about that and say you know what we genuinely want to deliver high wage high skilled economy if you want to employ hgv driver you be go to have to pay they the money they deserve that be how we will reward aspiration and hard work by the people of this country and overall we will have well growth it be not go to be painless get there because some employer will have to start pay high wage and that will filter through to high price but that be how we correct our economy and become the great world leader that we should be we should be the powerhouse of the give the skill and ability within our country we should be lead the world we have allow ourselves to become impoverished by quick fix to be brutally frank come to my final issue have say for long time that the big challenge face this country be the lack of affordable housing and the failure to build enough new home welcome the continue emphasis by the government on this issue but we be still fail to deliver yesterday the chancellor mention new investment to facilitate new housing in barking and canary wharf if we be to learn from what can go wrong encourage he to travel few mile east to my constituency to purfleet it sit on the river thames and it have railway station that can take people to fenchurch street in the city of london in minute we have be talk about build home in purfleet since if they be construct on the river thames minute from central london these home would have sell themselves purfleet centre regeneration limited public private partnership be develop to deliver these home it have million worth of public land gift to it it be grant million in to kickstart the work and it subsequently receive million in housing infrastructure funding the first house be promise to be construct by we be now in and we do not have single new home after all that public money want the government to register that while it be great to see capital funding be make available with all these wonderful brochure with nice plan for new home nothing be be deliver wonder whether there be something wrong with how we approach these thing from where be sit can see consultant who have manage to earn pretty penny over the past eight year out of purfleet but we have achieve nothing except the disappointment of the public the public have support and get behind these proposal but have find their hope and ambition dash they deserve well they have be seriously mislead by number of people it be not for to apologise to the people of purfleet have do my good to call out the fact that the emperor have no clothe for very long time but the public get very disillusioned when promise give by politician come to nothing if we really be to deliver more new home then we need to look at why we have not realise the ambition from such project in the past after year we need sober and serious plan to revive our economy boost productivity and encourage entrepreneurship and investment to power serious economic growth we need budget for growth instead what do we get we get reckless gimmick and political trickery when the country be cry out for renewal and investment in public service this budget put party before nation after year of conservative rule our economy have be wreck and vandalise before yesterday tinker around the edge we know that public debt as share of national output be at its high since the debt interest payment be at their high level since the second world war the economy be small per capita than when the prime minister take over after the mini budget fiasco when his predecessor and the then chancellor crash the economy this will be the first ever parliament in which living standard as measure of real household disposable income have fall the conservatives now expect we to rejoice in their plan expenditure of billion on tax cut which will be fund by increase borrowing this will be dwarf by the billion of tax rise that come into effect last year and the furth billion that be due to come into effect after the election because of the choice and the decision that they have make let we look at the impact of these measure on different group research by the women budget group show that single man will gain on average close to more year than lone mother from the combine national insurance cut in the autumn statement and spring budget the institute for public policy research estimate that half the tax cut will go to the wealthy household and just to the poor we also hear the chancellor boast yesterday of the conservative party intention to scrap national insurance altogether without any plan to fund this we would see billion black hole in the country finance every year that be deeply irresponsible the conservative party should have learn its lesson have crash the economy with the omnishamble of its mini budget and its billion of unfunded tax cut which come at very high price particularly in relation to cost and mortgage hike and people be still live through that crisis while the former prime minister remain in denial as she go off and earn huge amount of money din out on have crash the economy this be why my right hon friend the shadow chancellor have commit to uphold and strengthen the role of the office for budget responsibility only labour can deliver the economic stability that this country desperately need and put an end to the conservative party fantasy of unfunded and unsustainable tax cut just wonder whether there be any scope for special crash the economy tax so that we can claw back some of the money that the former prime minister have earn from her speak tour for start the former prime minister could certainly donate her earning to the million of child now live in poverty poverty that be worsen by she crash the economy the parent of child in my constituency be have to work even more to make end meet particularly to pay their mortgage which in some case have double that be the consequence of the rot that she and her chancellor cause by crash the economy on more serious note report allege that ahead of that mini budget the then chancellor brief certain hedge fund manager and they make significant financial gain off the back of it surely there should be some comeback on that my hon friend make an important point those report be well publicise at the time and it be shocking that there have not be an investigation or an inquiry into what happen shockingly the then chancellor and prime minister continue to behave as if they have do nothing wrong as if we should be grateful that they be in charge at the time they continue to go on speak circuit gaslighte the british public have crash the economy and ruin their life we be still pay for that the time can not come soon enough for this episode to be over for fresh start with new labour government of the current chancellor and his budget the former treasury minister david gauke say in an article in the new statesman that the budget be work of fiction he say he want to be prudent and responsible and he want to cut taxis the reality be that he can not do both have lot of time for the current chancellor who inherit an awful situation but he have not face up to the reality of need to be responsible his former colleague set that out in the article it be not labour that be attack the decision of the current chancellor it be his own former colleague who be respected treasury minister when it come to growth one do not need to be an economist to know that the government economic policy be fail wage have fall behind and accord to the resolution foundation real wage will only return to level by that be nearly two decade of lose pay growth nearly two decade of people not see an improvement in their living standard and nearly two decade of people have to face real term wage cut by contrast real wage growth across the oecd as whole have rise by almost on average over the same period this be cost british worker an average of per year it mean that they have have less to spend and on top of that they have have to live through the mini budget crisis make in downing street and the cost of living crisis that come after that the house of commons library show that uk food and alcoholic drink price be nearly high in january than the previous year base on the cpi measure of inflation what do that mean in practice in constituency such as mine and up and down the country it mean million more child live in poverty during the last year child in this country go hungry because of the failure of this government and parent have to work more hour just to keep their head above water that be the consequence of what the conservatives have do to people life in this country the budget leave those who earn or less bad off that can not be right the office for budget responsibility forecast show that gdp will grow by just in and in what about productivity the government have talk about the productivity puzzle for very long time but they have not manage to address it in the last quarter of productivity be estimate to be low compare with the year before accord to the office for national statistics what we have and have have be sluggish productivity flatline growth stagnant wage and rise price no wonder our country be in recession as consequence the government have preside over decline investment in our public service we have see the spectre of queue for dentist appointment people stick in hospital because of the failure to invest in local government and social care the police struggle to cope because of underfunding and cut in police number the criminal justice system face massive cut and as result people not get justice major infrastructure project cancel such as which mean that investor have lose confidence and so much more could go on but appreciate that other want to speak the question be whether people feel well off than they do in when the conservative party come into government the answer be no because they be work long hour and work hard after austerity which damage our public service and after the mini budget crisis which crash our economy and cost billion to begin with along with mortgage increase food price hike and much else people be not well off of course we have not mention partygate the abuse of power the billion waste in personal protective equipment contract and the money waste in fraud the billion that we could have use to support people instead go to waste and in particular case go into corruption which have not be address we have see an endless queue of chancellors and prime ministers one after another experiment on our country and let people down political and economic instability be cause huge distress to people in our country what do they have to show for it cost of live crisis often make in downing street and plaster budget design to help the conservative party to remain in power people can see right through it they will not be fool by what have be provide we need serious budget for productivity and growth no more waste opportunity and people talent we need government focus on national renewal and an economic strategy for growth which we do not get yesterday we could have have sustainable programme for support the small and medium sized business that power our of our business be in that sector they could be support much more to grow our economy we could have see much more support for those in the homebuilding industry by reform the planning system we could have have more investment in green industry and generate green job new national wealth fund to unlock billion in private investment skill revolution in the form of set up new technical excellence college and investment in the young generation and their skill education and early year we could have see shift in make work pay with genuine living wage ban zero hour contract and end fire and rehire those be some of the thing that the country desperately need we have see none of that we have see no vision for the future for renew our economy and our society those be some of the thing that we could and would deliver if we have the privilege of get into government it be time for change it be time to end the misery and destruction be cause by this government it be time for change in government it be privilege to follow the previous speaker and the hon member for bethnal green and bow rushanara ali today theme be make work pay believe that this be one of the key challenge face our country conservative believe in conserving but what be it that we seek to conserve in word freedom as ronald reagan say freedom be never more than one generation away from extinction we do pass it to our child in the bloodstream it must be fight for protect and hand on for they to do the same there be nothing more important to the cause of individual freedom for human being than the opportunity to work it be the only moral way to achieve financial security it be the path to well life it be not the meaning of life but there be no meaning in life without work it be the force that through the green fuse drive the flower as dylan thomas say god put adam and eve on earth to work believe that be wise decision because good hard challenging stressful and important work do well make people happy and purposeful it be not just means to an end for generate taxis the true gift of life be to be find in the struggle on the hard road we conservatives be not blind to the reality of human nature we do not pretend that people be not motivate by financial incentive it be not selfish to want to earn more for ourselves and to work hard for it believe that in the budget that be set out yesterday by the chancellor mrs thatcher would have find much to be pleased with in she say that the person who be prepared to work hard should get the great reward and keep they after tax we should back the worker and not the shirker it be not only permissible but praiseworthy to want to benefit your own family by your own effort how right she be in and how right we be as conservative to do that now that be why welcome the budget measure especially the cut in national insurance which will save the average worker and the average self employ worker we have lot of they in per year combine with the change to high income child benefit and the childcare support that we have previously talk about the reduction in inflation and the economy start to turn corner after very difficult time know that those measure will be welcome by hard press family in redditch juggling work and home life of course the welfare state and benefit be necessary in today world our fellow citizen rely on we when they be sick or strike down by life blow or can not sustain themselves but the pandemic have have worrying impact and have see loosening of the link of the social contract between all our citizen as result we can not ask shrink pool of worker to pay out of their taxis for grow cohort of people who can not or will not work benefit must only ever be last resort for those truly unable to work never lifestyle choice cause by faulty wiring in our system it be tempting to view the budget as single event it happen over day and there be headline in the medium we look at it through the obsessive lens of our hour news cycle and social medium feed but we should not judge it in that way and nor should we look at the event happen in our country as unique we be not an outlier every country around the world have suffer from the pandemic and the energy crisis cause by the war in ukraine as my hon friend the member for thurrock dame jackie doyle price rightly say the public be not fool they definitely understand and can see what be go on they can also see that over the course of year it be the conservatives who have make huge stride in reverse labour something for nothing culture we have ensure that welfare be truly target at the people who really need it mean that we can be more generous to really vulnerable citizen after all keith joseph first articulate the concept of the cycle of deprivation and he set about help people to break out of it conservative government implement the life change universal credit reform so successfully be roll out across our country those reform be conceive and lead by my right hon friend the member for chingford and woodford green sir iain duncan smith that be the true genesis of the value that work must always pay every time we have make reform to welfare the opposition party have howl that we be cruel and heartless it be totally fake outrage the true moral failure be to let people languish on benefit and not expect any well from they that be labour legacy and we see record level of unemployment in every age group when they last leave office in particular among young people and woman we be prepared to take the hard decision about universal credit have the scar on my back from stand here to defend the government decision at the time but guess what the apocalypse do not arrive instead we now see record number of people in work include record number of woman and record number of woman over government analysis have consistently show that universal credit be have positive impact on labour market participation for all group include single parent and other vulnerable group who face the most barrier when return to work most people who experience the benefit system will understand and support the need for more simplified one that work around work people the hon lady must also accept however that that be not the design of universal credit that meet such opposition the five week wait limit before entitlement be draw for example mean that people be get into debt unnecessarily when they be entitle to the benefit early she must accept that even give the principle of simplified system the way it be do be not right do not accept that and do not wish to rerun all the previous debate the government have listen to lot of the issue involve in the roll out of an incredibly complicated system and the evidence speak for itself universal credit have help more people get into work and work be always the good route out of poverty before move on will make few comment about mental health condition category of people in our country be the economically inactive which be sad to and many of we because those people be fundamentally not free they be dependent on the state my concern be that the number of working age adult who be out of the labour market because of long term sickness have be rise since from about million people then to about million in the summer of understand that that start before the covid pandemic the big relative jump in economic inactivity due to long term sickness be among the whose main complaint be depression bad nerve or anxiety have two psychology degree and fully understand mental illness and mental ill health also believe in use word precisely be therefore alarmed to see the conflation of the term depression and anxiety together with bad nerve bad nerve both anxiety and depression be clinically recognise condition bad nerve be not government statistic obtain follow several question that pose to the department do not break down the number of people self report under each condition and there be no datum or information on how that concept of bad nerve be define assess treat understand or prevent as separate condition from depression and anxiety that be because there can not be have bad nerve be totally meaningless phrase no one know what it be so how can people decide if they be unfit to work if they have it have bad nerve about stand to speak in this chamber and my constituent have bad nerve when they be navigate the day to day challenge of juggle work and family the phrase sound like something out of good housewife manual in the simply do not believe frankly that bad nerve be reason to be on sickness benefit and yet figure from the labour force survey indicate that million people be economically inactive due to some combination of bad nerve anxiety and depression we do not know how many be off because of each condition or how many be off because of bad nerve think it would be good idea for the department and the ministers can see on the front bench to understand on more granular level what condition be prevent our constituent get back into work so that we can target more efficiently the taxis of our constituent who be work hard for long hour and pay into the system so ultimately reduce the bill do the hon lady detect anywhere in the chancellor statement or the red book where he actually say we will put more resource into deal with mental health service over my time as member of parliament have detect many statement by many ministers on the treasury bench about invest in mental health service and back to work service nationally and in my constituency redditch have brand new local mental health hub deliver by the conservative government and the conservative borough council lead by the excellent mr matt dormer it be worth observe that total of million people report those condition be actually in work and that be credit to our mission to support people back into work which ultimately be the good way to improve their mental health have concern that follow the pandemic we have possibly see trend to over medicalise some of the normal up and down of daily life it be almost as though it be possible to live in state of blissful utopia and that if there be any interruption to paradise that be condition require help that be just not true the struggle of life define we and build our character take away individual opportunity and responsibility to face their fear by overprotect they be the bad way to develop resilience as any parent know the human condition be state mostly of pain and fear if we be fortunate we will experience love and happiness in some small interlude and we must appreciate those want to be very clear however that do not criticise anyone who be suffer from any mental health condition do not include bad nerve whatever that be if we have poorly design system with poor labelling it be not people fault if they respond to the structural incentive that we have design but we must not have bogus badly define phrase and cod psychology as pathway to lifetime on benefit really hope that the minister will return to that in the summing up my hon friend be give very brave and eloquent speech do she agree that there be real problem with overprescription in the nhs doctor of people who have mental health difficulty respond too quickly with chemical response in fact what would often be good be to encourage they either to work or to take part in social activity which the government support through the social prescribing programme thank my hon friend for that observation hesitate to agree with he definitively because just do not have the evidence but strongly agree with the basic point that we should not reach straight for the chemical solution we should look at other solution that be clinically much well for people include the social prescribing to which he refer could highlight many issue in the budget that know would be welcome in redditch have campaign long and hard for the alex hospital and the conservatives have deliver an million operating complex now open ensure that we be make progress in cut the waiting list people can get operation close to home and can get home quick and they can have more lifesaving surgery close to their home be glad to see the emphasis yesterday on productivity gain in the nhs as well as pour in money constituent know that healthcare be expensive and valuable staff time and public resource must be properly stewarde and not waste yesterday there be an unexpected but welcome announcement delightful one by the chancellor million to spend in redditch on cultural project that will be massively welcome in our area where the art play huge part in our local life will talk to local and community group about how we can well use that we have plenty of potential destination include the palace theatre arts in redditch our new library complex also boost by government levelling up funding and many more be particularly proud of the record of my local council which be lead by councillor matt dormer who instigate council house building programme that have deliver council house always appreciate the fact that we need to go far but that be significant move because they be the first true council house build in redditch for year for all the year that it be in control labour do not build single council house even though they be much need hear hear be glad to hear the hear hear from behind we all know that those council house be route for local family to have decent home put down root build and raise their family and well themselves through work it be platform for the life that they can build for themselves that be the conservative way ultimately observe that as roger scruton remind we free economy be an economy run by free being and free being be responsible being our plan for work be make our country place for free and responsible people to realise their full potential it set out pathway to freedom through work and it will make work pay strongly welcome it and will back it in the voting lobbies family in my constituency have feel the consequence of the government political chaos and economic incompetence five prime ministers seven chancellor and plan for growth have all leave they worse off than they be year ago the budget will not change that and crucially the government know it if the conservatives have grow the economy at average oecd rate household would be an astonishing well off each year that sum would make huge difference to family in my constituency it could have provide some financial security to they help they to pay their bill support their family and maybe even have that holiday but no instead family in bristol south be struggle to make end meet food price be still high than they be two year ago rent be up by we know that people be experience high mortgage as result of the mini budget the tax burden remain the high in generation work people have pay the price for the year of tory chaos the government failure to grow the economy have go hand in hand with the cut to local spending that we have hear all about today people be pay more and get less they be be force to make do with struggle public service parent know that school have have their per capita funding cut people know that there be few police on the street they know that bus route have be cut crucially they know when they try to get local appointment that the health service be under increase pressure everyone know that they have lose out everyone have see that the government have take resource away young people family the vulnerable all leave without vital support and local facility after the past year council of all political stripe have declare bankruptcy because the conservatives piecemeal funding have fail local government as we hear early the movement of resource from local government to national government have devastate council ability to run local service some people who be work in local government have move to national government as we hear from my hon friend the member for oldham west and royton jim mcmahon bristol labour run council have manage to maintain some vital service despite not because of the conservative government as my right hon friend the shadow chancellor say early it be deep irony that the government have take away all those resource and crucially give the scale of waste and the fraud that we have see at national government level be now start to tell bristol and other local council how to run our local service it be absolutely astonishing the idea that they can start tell local council how to run service be for the bird the budget have do nothing for people in bristol but the council be still able to maintain basic service we have protect the most vulnerable there be more home dwelling have planning permission we be on track for more affordable housing and we be accelerate the delivery of council own home if we have labour government work with that labour council we could really transform life if we be in government we would rebuild the foundation of local government work in partnership with council not against they through long term funding settlement to develop strong more secure and prosperous local economy to kick start growth across the country we need to invest in the workforce decline in skill and training be hold britain back as my hon friend the member for leicester west liz kendall announce this week that be why we be so focused on help people particularly young people back into work give they the chance to have good healthy life with new skill specialist employment support new career advice and work experience proper early mental health support and real opportunity particularly for disabled people come back into work employer desperate for skill know that we be not train people in the skill of the future the tories fail apprenticeship levy have prevent employer from do the good for young people in particular as see at first hand at my job and apprenticeship fair last week while billion of funding from the levy go unspent the budget have again fail to deliver the levy change that be need labour have listen to business that be concerned about the levy our reform growth and skill levy will give employer great flexibility to use their funding so that people can gain new skill and access well job we need to match the skill need in our local economy to young people in particular but also to people who be retrain so that we can get the growth that we need to drive well prosperity by develop skill for the job of the future we can unlock growth in the economy in our approach to growth we want to grasp the green agenda we will establish gb energy clean power create right here in britain will mean more job and low bill for household our national wealth fund will invest in industry to fund green initiative people and business in bristol be desperate to transform our economy and get new skill particularly in the construction industry to build environmentally sustainable house as well as in digital and cyber where the tories have ignore the potential offer to we by growth in green industry and job labour will invest in our future under the conservatives people living standard have fall family and young people in particular can not afford to get on the housing ladder price in the shop have rise and the tax burden be the high in year yet the prime minister and the chancellor still come here yesterday full of smile laugh and say frankly you ve never have it so good my constituent know that that be completely false no number of tory budgets can rewrite the past year of economic failure and the damage that it have do to our society people need fresh hope sustainable plan for growth and labour government who will put bristol and our country first the chancellor of the exchequer make one announcement in the budget statement that have not be refer to today but be relevant give the contribution make so far the government will sell the last of their remain stake in natwest bank formerly the royal bank of scotland group of course we all remember that the royal bank of scotland group once the world large bank run out of money and would have collapse if not for complete government bail out it would have go down and take with it the livelihood job and mortgage of million of people in this country have an effect on the entire banking system it have take we nearly year to get to position in which the government can sell their stake in the bank and return it to fully private ownership that be an important benchmark because it be easy to pretend as number of hon member have try to do that when the conservative party be elect be year zero and there be no issue from the past that we have to deal with we come into government on the back of that banking crisis both party acknowledge that the bail out of the bank be necessary inevitable and the right thing to do but it come with cost attach it come with the recognition that the huge amount of increase government debt require to take that stake in the bank would at some point have to be pay back and that the massive shock to the global economy and our economy and the recession it create would lead to consolidation in public spending however it be the conservative party work in coalition at the time that have to put those plan in place we inherit no detailed plan from the labour party no difficult political decision be make about where spending would be cut or how debt would be repay that be entirely leave to the conservative party to do and that be what we do we fix the roof when we have the chance to do so and because we control debt and get it fall again when the next shock come in the form of the covid pandemic nothing anyone could have predict or know about we be in position to respond we could increase borrow again to make the necessary decision to protect people job and home create the furlough scheme and give the economy the support it need we could make those decision because we have regain international trust in the british economy and in our government and we could borrow money to do so will the hon gentleman give way will in moment yes borrowing have go up and taxis have go up to pay for it that be an inevitable consequence of those two massive global event that take place one under the last labour government and one under the conservative government in the shape of the covid pandemic do not remember the labour party ever criticise the furlough scheme or the support that be put in place or suggest that it should not have be do they want more my hon friend be quite right if anything labour want the lockdown to carry on long mean that the debt would have be even high have the conservative party not put the public finance back in order we would have start that pandemic with much high level of debt than we do the necessary decision be make to put the economy right the borrowing have go on because of the need to pay for covid it have be complicate by war in ukraine again have not hear any labour members say that we should not have support the ukrainian people the hon gentleman speech be give the impression understand why that the world be rosy up until covid come and that the problem follow afterwards but before covid there be million more people on the nhs waiting list than under the previous labour government the nhs be in fragile state as be the national debt which be over trillion before covid hit the hon gentleman can not say that that be strong foundation no do not say that at all what say be that we pick up the piece of an international banking crisis with no plan from the previous government for how that would be pay for it be entirely down to the conservative party to find that money the criticism be that the previous labour government be increase borrowing before the banking crisis hit they be already borrow for political reason to sustain spending they could not afford and then have to bail out the bank on top of that if member be go to criticise the past year of government let we start where the problem start which be before we come into power we be require to pick up the piece of the mess we inherit there be big thing that happen which require responsible government to take big responsible decision that sometimes mean that they have to put up taxis in order to pay for borrow to get through crisis let we not pretend that that be not the case but the question be whether government have serious credible plan and whether they be prepared to be honest with the british people about what that plan entail on the back of the pandemic we have have to put up taxis and borrow to pay for that we have do that and we be now at decision point as the economy recover and the obr project that debt will fall what can we do what path should we go down as the chancellor have set out the priority of this government be to recognise that because taxis have to go up to pay for the pandemic we want to reduce taxis when we can we want to lift that burden from the british people and start to reduce taxis if any hon member want to come in at this point be happy to give way will because be try to intervene few moment ago as the hon gentleman will hopefully recall my point be simply go to be that during the there be fantastic opportunity to invest in our infrastructure repair our school and so on when interest rate be at record long term low and that opportunity be miss do the hon gentleman not regret that do not agree with that just look at my own constituency we have have two brand new secondary school build big new special need school and primary school as well there have be investment in most school building and we have see huge amount of investment in the infrastructure of this country reference have be make to the decision not to complete the northern leg of high speed of course that money be not be take out of infrastructure spending it be just be spend on different thing that be point that have not be make as the economy recover and debt be predict by the obr to fall we have decision to make the priority of the government be to reduce taxis and they have do so through the national insurance cut make in the autumn statement and again in the budget cut in national insurance and yes long term ambition that that tax may go altogether that be not an unfunded commitment it be say that be the priority that be the decision we would take the direction we would go in will the hon gentleman give way in one moment what we have hear in today debate particularly from the shadow chancellor the right hon member for leeds west rachel reeves be that labour would go down different path labour would spend more they call it investment but basically labour would spend more labour priority be not to cut taxis it be begrudgingly go along with the tax cut we have announce because it do not want to oppose they but there be certainly no statement make today that suggest labour would seek to cut taxis labour would seek to spend more so that be the choice for the british people at the next election and move forward as the nation recover from the shock it have be through and as the chancellor have get the discretionary money to spend do we give that money back to the british people do we let they keep more of what they have earn or do we just spend it on their behalf that be the classic separation between our party which have exist for generation the belief to which the labour party be still wed be that growth be create something that we both want to see by the government spend more what have be demonstrate over the decade be that by back the british people and their ingenuity and hard work we generate the growth we need that be the separation that we see now the shadow chancellor say at the beginning of her speech that she would not make unfunded commitment on spending or taxis but she have do so today because now that the money from the non dom be no long available to fund the thing that labour want to spend it on there be no plan in place on the radio this morning she say that she would find the money today at the dispatch box she say that there would be detailed piece of work to seek it out but we still do not know what the plan be the only thing the labour party could point to today that would increase revenue be taxis on private school which will not pay for much at all so we have an unfunded commitment to spend more we do not know how imagine that it will be borrow more but it could be taxis go up and some specific unfunded commitment the labour party will not say where the money will come from but what it have say today loud and clear be that cut taxis be not its priority there have be no ambition today to say that we should cut taxis at all thank the hon gentleman for give way twice he have mention number of time the need to repay any debt and borrowing he will know that part of the borrowing for be go to be service through the revenue from ticket sale and through move more freight off road and on to rail to be carry by the track that be free up be he absolutely confident that the new transport project include on pothole that will be fund by the spare capital that have be free up will be service through revenue or will that be funding gap in the future be confident that the robust plan that the government set out for spend that money on other transport project will deliver what would say about high speed in the north base on my own constituency experience in kent where we have high speed be that folkestone in my constituency have benefit enormously from high speed rail believe that these big infrastructure project deliver benefit in time that be sometimes intangible and difficult to predict at the beginning however for the train only go at high speed on the high speed line as far as ashford the same rolling stock then run on the traditional railway to folkestone dover canterbury ramsgate and other place on the kent coast high speed rail service that run at high speed on the high speed line from birmingham to london but with those train start elsewhere in the north of england will still deliver huge benefit in reduce journey time and attract other investment that have certainly be our experience in kent and that be why have always support high speed rail for the north think it can deliver the same thing still think it will deliver big benefit for the north west even though the train will only go on the high speed line from birmingham down into london in addition to the point have make about the very clear difference between the two party with regard to tax and spend whether we want to cut taxis or put spend up will focus on one or two specific thing the chancellor note in his speech that britain have become global centre for television and film making sometimes that be say as if it be happy accident that despite the fact that people could have invest anywhere in the world they decide through serendipity to invest in the uk the reason that the uk now have this leadership position which be not one that we have in be that we have invest in make it happen we have recognise that in highly global market production tax credit mean that people will bring production investment to the uk rather than take it elsewhere in the world that generate revenue for the treasury my hon friend the member for christchurch sir christopher chope be not in his place but that be another great example of mr laffer curve at work when we reduce the tax burden the investment go up and the revenue go up with it that have have huge benefit for this country the investment in our creative industry the job that people have in studio and film production job that simply do not exist before and the fact that we remain massive global centre for investment we have introduce tax credit for high end television production animation video game orchestra and touring exhibition be very pleased to see in the budget yesterday that those tax credit will be extend to small budget independent production which will massively open up opportunity for small film company to attract investment however the big thing we have see be the investment in studio space britain rival any place in the world for studio size which make it after california the global home of film and television one of the barrier to further investment in studio be think of very exciting and ambitious studio project just outside my constituency in ashford an investment that will benefit the whole of east kent be that if someone build film studio on derelict land which studio be often on the business rate cost would go up massively be that fair give that the uplift be generate by massive external investment if the chancellor recognise that and give new studio reduction in business rate uplift for year it will unlock further pipeline for investment allow we to consolidate our global leadership and be huge boost for the creative sector in this country want to mention nuclear technology and small modular reactor have constituency interest in this dungeness nuclear power station be in my constituency and it would be an ideal site for small modular reactor the government have launch competition to design they and the chancellor be encourage people get their tender in hope that we will consider that the benefit be not just we produce the clean energy that we need for the future but we back british industry british design and build smr manufacturing process in this country will meet our need but this could also be fantastic export industry for britain urge the government and the chancellor to carry on back this new nuclear technology to support the design competition and to back one of the bidder ideally british company such as rolls royce would be great but there be other excellent bidder the government should also support the roll out of this technology through their civil nuclear road map they have establish how they intend to do that and they acknowledge that they need more nuclear site as result of the road map and the consultation on it hope that other site such as dungeness in my constituency will be identify where this technology can be deploy huge investment in green energy and new nuclear have be deliver under this government in when we come into government we still have not complete the national policy framework on nuclear energy and there have not yet be any decision about where nuclear would go the new fleet of power station and the investment and there be lot have entirely take place under this government which be something heartedly support in closing number of hon member have talk about housing and lot of important point be make about level up in the budget and in the statement release by ministers alongside it new house building be incredibly important for deliver economic growth and growth of our community be very pleased that folkestone town centre be beneficiary last year of significant levelling up investment encourage the department for levelling up housing and communities and homes england to continue their discussion with folkestone and hythe district council about back the new garden town proposal in otterpool park in my constituency which will not only deliver home that people need but create great many new job in east kent for the come decade it be pleasure to follow the hon member for folkestone and hythe damian collins absolutely concur with his point about the creative sector it be one of the absolute gem of the uk and we need the concerted effort of those not just in the government but across the house and the support of our university and college to ensure we have the stream of investment to deliver talent echo his point on nuclear development and particularly on the work of rolls royce if the public be listen yesterday to the last chance chancellor they would be forgive for assume that they have never have it so good the chancellor conveniently forget to mention the kamikaze budget in september when the right hon member for south west norfolk elizabeth truss and for spelthorne kwasi kwarteng crash the economy force up borrowing rate and cause mortgage market mayhem leave average mortgage payment month high and business struggle with high rate of interest the chancellor now seem to think that we be see lamontian green shoot ignore the economic wreckage wreak by the government own vain ideological vandalism after an economic experiment that cost the uk billion when say lamontian be of course recall the damage of previous conservative government in the early in his first budget month ago the chancellor promise budget for growth call stickler for detail but what do we get recession the prime minister may try to blame covid and russia illegal invasion of ukraine but the truth be that our growth be the low in the and there be absolutely no reason why the uk should be more affected than any of those nation meanwhile mayor andy street be preside over the worst perform region for growth in the united kingdom there be pattern emerge ask the secretary of state for work and pensions about this early and it seem that he confirm that nationally we have have seven consecutive quarter of negative growth per capita in other word output per individual which be far contribute to year of failure include decade of decay that be underline by the fact that real income will be low at the end of this parliament than at the start the joseph rowntree foundation have find that household average earning at the start of this year be year low than at the start of in the month to september more people in england be make homeless than buy their first home and the year of austerity have lead to million child live in relative poverty yesterday the chancellor announce this year spring budget with plan to grow the economy instead we get budget of what would view as deception delusion and dither the chancellor do not address any of the urgent issue face the country right now it be as though he be rearrange the deckchair on the titanic there be nothing on reinforce autoclaved aerate concrete in school hospital and our university nothing on dentistry nothing on the contaminated blood scandal and nothing on the post office horizon scandal yesterday budget be more an act of smoke and mirror the chancellor claim that gdp have rise that growth be on the up and that taxis be fall because he want to set october as year zero however the public know differently because they have see tax rise and be feel the high tax burden since world war two the resolution foundation have find that tax rise of around billion be introduce in the last year and that the government have furth billion of tax rise set to come into effect immediately after the general election meanwhile unprotected departments such as the home office the ministry of justice and dluhc local government will by face real per capita spending cut of around likewise the ministry of defence will face major cut the government must be honest about their mistake they have to be realistic about the state our country be in and they must address these issue with long term solution instead what they present we with yesterday be to put it simply weak it be weak on energy price which continue to dominate household bill the chancellor extension of the windfall tax to fail to address the fact that million household include ten of thousand in my constituency be live in fuel poverty in october meanwhile british gas profit increase tenfold to million last year be afraid that the government be not do enough the budget be weak on the housing system which be break the chancellor offer nothing for those on low income in the shape of social rent property which be so need in area such as warwick leamington whitnash and the village in my constituency the government be yet to meet their target to build new home in england meanwhile the chancellor solution be to scrap tax break for owner of holiday let property agree with that but it be not enough despite the obr forecasting that real household disposable income per head will fall by in the chancellor have offer an extension of just six month to the household support fund that be not enough the private rental sector be break and people be break the government be weak on find long term solution to these issue overnight we learn that the chancellor have offer billion of unfunded tax cut once again the conservatives be gamble with the public finance and economic stability they can not make these promise lightly we see the impact of that or month ago the government be weak on support the need of motorist paltry year in potential save fuel duty pale in comparison with the government insurance premium tax take base on the astronomic increase in insurance premium the insurance premium tax be another tax introduce by conservative government meanwhile car driver year be make insurance claim for damage from government pothole more parochially be interested to hear that warwickshire county council will receive devolution deal though no detail be provide on what that mean for the leadership of our area that be of concern because the county council be already unable to fulfil its obligation will follow that proposal closely elsewhere in his speech the chancellor claim that the government be do great deal for small business yet last year the office for national statistics report that more than more business close than open in the uk the federation of small businesses late quarterly survey show that great proportion of small business expect their performance to worsen over the come year than expect it to improve the chancellor increase in the threshold at which small business have to register for vat do not compensate for the seven year for which the threshold have be freeze again it be not enough business investment be falter interest rate be sticky at base of although they be likely to fall just marginally later this year that ensure that the uk already woeful productivity remain bad than that of all our major competitor for year successive conservative government have reject the need for an industrial strategy although welcome the chancellor investment in life science yesterday the government be fail to harness the extraordinary power and innovation of our high education sector labour will do well despite all that the conservative still claim that they have do good job it concern that they may believe that we have suffer year of they put their party first and our country second we have suffer tax rise while ordinary people struggle to pay their mortgage put food on the table get gp appointment and register with non existent nhs dentist they be struggle in rishi recession prime minister who float loftily above we in his chopper burn up taxpayer money contactless with the people below be afraid that the public view this government as out of touch out of idea and in denial about how they have let our economy go into recession our school hospital university and infrastructure crumble and our people suffer they do not feel the cost of that failure but the rest of we do the people want change they have lose confidence in the conservatives and they look to labour change party to bring stability strategy and sense to the governance of this country the country be scar by year of failure that have spawn decade of decay labour will reduce nhs waiting time and introduce emergency dental appointment and free breakfast club it will establish gb energy for cheap clean renewable energy an industrial strategy council and national wealth fund and it will close the energy windfall tax loophole that be what the country need and the public want they want to see their doctor they want an nhs dentist in their community they want their school to be fully open and they want their road resurface the public will see through the government attempt to steal labour clothe evidently they do not quite fit the prime minister first they borrow our suggestion for furlough scheme then it be our nhs workforce plan follow by water down version of our windfall tax now they be hijack our non dom tax however they remain silent on climate change and the need for green new deal we need plan project and an ambition let we look to what biden be do in the us and the growth that the us be enjoy of it be right up there with china and india where be we flatline at the government have have more reset than my broadband router and be even more unreliable the public be disconnect and tune out they do not want to wait minute long for the sake of the great british people let we have general election and may it be on may be delighted to have catch your eye in this important budget debate madam deputy speaker be also pleased to follow the hon member for warwick and leamington matt western although disagree with almost every word he say that be the nature of this place we be entitle to debate these matter have listen to the speech from opposition members today both they and most of the financial commentator who have criticise the budget totally agree with my hon friend the member for folkestone and hythe damian collins on this have fail to mention that we have be through two catastrophic world shock namely the pandemic and the unexpected war in europe in ukraine they have have catastrophic effect on our economy ask all the opposition members who have criticise the budget this would they not have spend the money on the furlough scheme or the business loan scheme would they not have help people out with energy loan of course they would have so they would be in exactly the same place as we be grapple with today economic problem number of measure in the budget be to be warmly welcome and will come to one or two of they be particularly pleased that inflation have come down from high of to today and it be forecast to be below the bank of england target of by the end of this year that be the most important thing we can do for the cost of living of all our constituent above all tax reduction or anything else warmly welcome that will turn to some of the individual measure in the budget before move to public sector productivity measure after that as my hon friend on the front bench will not be surprised to learn will mention the tourist tax my constituent will welcome number of measure set out in the budget particularly the cut in employee national insurance contribution take with those of the autumn statement they amount to for the average work person in this country earn suggest to everybody across the house that that be significant increase in the take home money that our constituent will see in their pocket today that combine with the number of our constituent who be self employ particularly important and grow sector mean for someone earn which be also warmly welcome that will encourage our hard work constituent to work long hour and become more productive as my right hon friend the chancellor say yesterday national insurance be double tax on work people national insurance combine with income tax be an unfair tax arrangement for work people if we be to start make tax cut which hope we will it must be right to try to drop one or other of they and that be why warmly welcome the cut in national insurance will the hon gentleman give way let make one important point which hope the hon gentleman will consider when he intervene yesterday the chancellor say that through our tax cut and by raise the personal allowance the tax on ordinary work people today be at its low level since and possibly since the war although we do not have record to prove that it be low than in america france germany or any country the ordinary work person tax burden through national insurance and income tax be extremely low at the present time it be clear that the tax burden be actually the high it have be in year the hon gentleman raise point about national insurance contribution assume that he have see the email that the chancellor of the exchequer send to all conservative party member make it clear that the plan be to scrap nic in the next parliament do he accept that that be the government plan because it be in that email in black and white do he also accept that that would leave billion black hole in the public finance think the hon gentleman be misrepresent what my right hon friend the chancellor say yesterday have hansard here can not look through it quickly enough to give the exact wording the chancellor use but he basically say that when the economy be in fit state to so do and when economic condition allow such move be an ambition that be not promise or commitment to anything at all it be just as my right hon friend say commitment to travel rise will give way to the hon gentleman but hope he be not go to misrepresent what the chancellor say will have to get it in hansard but will give he one more chance as the hon gentleman will be aware be an avid reader of the chancellor email to conservative party member he state we want simple fair tax system where you only pay tax once if we stick with our plan that work we be able to make progress towards that goal in the next parliament if that be not commitment to scrap nic in the next parliament leave billion black hole why do they not just own up to it and then explain how they be go to fill that black hole be grateful to the hon gentleman for intervene second time because now have the exact word from hansard the chancellor say when it be responsible when it can be achieve without increase borrowing and when it can be deliver without compromise high quality public service we will continue to cut national insurance as we have do today so that we truly make work pay official report march vol do not think it be as the hon gentleman be say think he be misrepresent the word of my right hon friend the chancellor and hope he will not persist with that line of questioning think we can all recognise conservative campaign headquarters rebuttal on its own chancellor when we hear it the substantive point be that the nics cut mean there be low tax burden but we must be clear for the record that that be not correct this be the high tax burden since the hon gentleman must recognise that freeze the personal tax allowance have significant impact on all taxpayer again hope we will not have my right hon friend welcome ambition to reduce national insurance traduce in the way that it have be do not think we will get very far by continue that argument indeed you will probably reprimand madam deputy speaker if go too far down that rabbit hole be go on to say that it be not just worker through the reduction in national insurance who will benefit from this budget because of course pensioner will too pensioner will see significant increase in their pension through the triple lock of huge this year together with the enormous rise in the personal income allowance that we have introduce over the year from to that will affect not only those on the basic state pension but also those who earn little bit of income on top they will see that our measure have considerably benefit the amount that they receive in their pocket move on to our commitment to family we recognise the importance of ease the financial strain especially for parent have listen closely to those constituent in the cotswolds who have contact about how they have have to tighten their purse since the covid pandemic when so many find their work interrupt as well as about the cost of food and energy price rise in the year follow people in rural area will be particularly pleased to see another freeze on fuel duty because they rely very much on have to use their car be pleased that the threshold for the high income child benefit charge have rise from to it will directly impact nearly family provide an average boost of per household empower family and ensure that every child have the support they need to flourish welcome the british isa which allow for investment it should have be more also welcome the incentivisation of nuclear investment asset rather than hit saver we bolster economic resilience and pave the way for bright future for generation to come welcome the disclosure move for local government pension that will encourage investment in uk infrastructure project our commitment to family and business remain unwavering from child benefit to increase vat registration from to that should have be more but it will help number of business one of the key measure yesterday alongside what happen in the autumn statement be the extension of full expense relief to lease asset which will drive up growth growth be now even track as percentage of gdp business investment be now the high it have be for many year substantially high than in the whole time labour be in power my hon friend be entirely right the chancellor announcement in the autumn statement of billion for full business expensing be one of the most important economic announcement of this entire conservative government he be try to address the problem of lease that my hon friend just ask about that be contain in the red book and the chancellor be now look at that important piece so welcome my hon friend intervention before turn to public sector productivity let put it in context paragraph be one of the most important paragraph in the red book it say that over the next year growth will be at but spending will be at that be unsustainable and every government in the next year will have to address that when average growth be and health spending in modern civilised country like ours be grow at that too be unsustainable so we have to do something to address public sector productivity from my role as deputy chairman of the public accounts committee know that one of the quick and easy way to deal with that be to increase the use of digital method as the committee find when we visit denmark the danes have their health service properly digitalised and they be long way ahead of the nhs everything from book patient appointment patient experience in hospital procurement of equipment and medicine and everything to do with the health service be digitalise it work incredibly efficiently that be why welcome the billion for nhs digitalisation such investment in productivity can yield huge dividend in future output it be not just in the health service where digitalisation can have an impact the secretary of state for levelling up housing and communities be currently consult on relatively small investment in the digitalisation of the planning system every business everywhere want to do anything complain about the slowness of the planning system and that local authority do not have enough planning officer digitalisation will cut some of the bureaucracy for planning officer allow they to take well and quick decision it will help productivity enormously and have huge knock on effect for business as promise the minister will now turn to tax free shopping he would be disappoint if do not mention this subject as there be disappointment that there be very little mention of it in the budget there be small mention in the red book and the obr have produce separate report which will come to shortly in the debate on the autumn statement in response to an intervention make the chancellor say we change policy on this issue year ago because it cost around billion year and we do not think we could afford to continue it but we be look again at the number in the light of the most recent datum and we can see what have happen to comparative shop in paris and milan we will review this to see if it be still that expensive and hope that it be not official report november vol yesterday obr review be not full review all it do be review its very limited forecast and its own figure with no reference to how badly the uk be perform relative to our continental competitor the obr make no mention of the cost and benefit to the exchequer of extend the scheme to eu visitor and the obr have never be ask to look at that give the government credit where credit be due we have new doctrine in the obr and it start to address some of the point that my hon friend the member for christchurch sir christopher chope be make the chancellor say that if we reduce the high rate that exist for residential property we would in fact increase revenue because there would be more transaction for the first time in history both the treasury and the obr have discover their inner laffer curve official report march vol if they can do it for the cut in capital gain tax why can they not do it for the reintroduction of the tourist tax will acquaint the house with one or two figure because have some figure for what be go on in the real world economy if the minister will bear with be not sure the treasury be truly take they into account when he and the house hear the figure they will begin to think we should be invest in this first let refer to two independent report one be the well respect and well renowne forecasting by oxford economics which predict that restore vat res the vat retail export scheme or colloquially the tourist tax could increase gdp by billion another report predict billion we be deal with huge stuff here and potential huge benefit so can not see why the government will not at least do proper study we know from our figure that british business lose out by billion in and by even more in the measure would benefit many of our big retailer hospitality venue airport and cultural destination particularly tourist destination such as the cotswolds the report also show that britain be lose out on billion eu market and that the measure would give the exchequer net benefit of million in vat alone the figure on how we compare with our competitor be stark in spend by american visitor to britain be at of the pre covid level of but guess what in france it be in spain it be in italy it be of pre covid level as compare with our level peg with the situation pre covid this be big stuff and can not understand why the treasury will not study it properly in spend by visitor from the gulf co operation council state in britain be only at of level but it be in france in spain and in italy those be not my figure but figure from real trader that have give the association of international retail their actual figure audit from their book they be not make up gently suggest that the chancellor and the industry industry would fund it if necessary jointly commission proper independent study into the full impact of free shopping on british business the economy and the exchequer so that we can have real evidence base decision on this huge and important area will the chancellor meet and industry representative to discuss it far be delighted that we have see inflation fall from to wage be rise mortgage rate be start to fall and interest rate will hopefully fall towards the latter end of this year it have be tough few year pandemic and war cause economic strain that few country have manage to avoid be vocal last year on rise energy and food price which be regressive cost hit low earner the most be pleased now to see the cost of live easing the people of the cotswolds want to see their hard work pay the innovation of small and medium sized business encourage and public service such as school and the nhs well fund but operate efficiently however those service can improve only if our economy be strong and thriving and the uk be see as the good place to do business that be why be so pleased that yesterday my right hon friend the chancellor budget cover so many world lead sector include the creative economy unicorn artificial intelligence and the financial and pharmaceutical sector we have much to be proud of in so many sector and the chancellor do lot yesterday to encourage every single one of those business with their innovation and energy commend his budget rise order before we proceed hope that we can manage the rest of the day without have formal time limit but approximately minute be leave for back bench contribution so hope that member will take about nine minute each that be quite long time it be not curtail debate to take nine minute or so each and if we can do that we will not need formal time limit if we can not achieve that by simple courtesy and arithmetical calculation will impose formal time limit thank you madam deputy speaker shall of course be guide by you it be now almost year since first have the immense honour and privilege of be elect to the good job in the world member of parliament for newcastle central but over those year it have be heartbreaking and outrageous in equal measure to see the consequence for my constituent of tory economic failure first we have austerity the cruel gutting of community public service and job which dampen growth instead of drive it tory austerity be why the resolution foundation tell we that the average wage will not return to its level until we then have covid global pandemic but one that disproportionately impact the very community the poor the black and minoritise the unwell and infirm and the disabled and disadvantaged which austerity have undermine and weaken while strain our nhs to breaking point yet member of the conservative government see it as an opportunity to help their mate get rich my hon friend in the opposition have destroy the fake tory fig leaf that everything be rosy before covid then we have cost of living crisis make in downing street with energy and food price mortgage rent and transport cost all soar the budget be the tories last chance to try to repair the damage they have do and stop the rot and what do we get more of the same fail economic policy that have plunge we into recession my constituent work incredibly hard to provide for themselves and their family and local business be also work hard through the tory economic gloom we can see that in our fantastic start up spin out and scale up and newcastle world renowne hospitality sector which offer so many from all over the world great geordie welcome as well as add million of gross value add each year to my constituency note that ukhospitality say that the budget offer little for this sector with so much growth potential labour member believe that work should pay the tories break economic model increasingly mean that too often it do not the average person in the north east be bad off since than if the economy have grow at the rate it do under labour shamefully child poverty across the north east of england have climb by more than third since accord to the end child poverty coalition increasingly those child parent be in work the north east child poverty commission find that the proportion of north east child in poverty who be from work family have rise from to than percentage point in under decade put on record my gratitude to both those organisation and to other researcher for their work only wish that the government would take their evidence as seriously as it demand madam deputy speaker would like to wish you and all woman as well as our ally happy international women day for tomorrow also want to highlight the particular struggle of woman in my region our economic trouble and the run down of public service have mean that many geordie woman face spiral problem with debt poverty and housing and be struggle to access mental and physical healthcare in its recent report change life charity work with vulnerable woman in the north east find that woman live in the north east be more likely to live short life to spend large proportion of time live in poor health and to die prematurely from preventable disease at risk woman in the north east be time more likely to die early as result of suicide addiction or domestic murder compare with the average for england and wales that be just disgrace tory disgrace and it perfectly demonstrate the human cost of bad government if we have have labour workforce plan in place the nhs back on its foot and able to provide consistent high quality care and productivity improvement labour new deal for work people to give people security in work and action on housing poverty and bill the difference that that would have make would have be life change and lifesaving be disappointed to hear nothing in the budget about the government approach to the loan charge scandal constituent who retire after lifetime of hard work be be bombard with letter from hmrc threaten he with retrospective demand and possible bill of we can imagine how he be enjoy his retirement the issue absolutely need an independent review the chancellor and the government have fail my constituent fail to make work pay and fail to get the economy grow the tax burden be at year high so of course welcome the cut to national insurance contribution however rishi tax double take mean that household will be bad off on average also welcome the new devolution deal for the north east but my constituent would be much well off if the conservatives get the basic right in our economy provide the vital change we need in housing energy industrial strategy transport and so on the north east mayor who will be elect in may will have difficult job to fix the tory mess fortunately kim mcguinness our excellent labour candidate be determined to hand power to our community and to create real opportunity for everyone who live in the north east and labour government would be the partner she need this budget have be determine by politic and by attempt to manage tory division and to desperately save the skin of tory members instead of do the responsible thing look at the way the government have adopt some of the opposition proposal on non dom tax regime not as part of long term plan but because they have be bounce into it my constituent do not care about tory infighting they be sick of it they want to see real action to kick start our economy through stability reform and investment that be what labour be offer our industrial strategy would bring together our excellent university across the north east our skilled workforce and our deep capital market to turbocharge growth in constituency such as mine in fact we have plan for the life science prescription for growth which highly recommend to help grow the economy and get the nhs back on its foot labour would support business in newcastle through our plan on business rate skill and the planning system and would get britain build again we would bring bill down by switch on great british energy new british company that will create new high pay job across the north reduce bill and leave we less dependent on tyrant such as putin this morning on radio today programme the presenter interview the chancellor set out just some of the fact and figure that demonstrate tory economic failure the chancellor respond by say that such characterisation be unworthy of the bbc well he have just be call the fiscal drag queen which clearly annoy he but that be no excuse for say that fact figure and evidence be unworthy of our national broadcaster the government would do well in remind their ministers in particular the secretary of state for science innovation and technology whose libel bill the taxpayer have just pay that fact matter labour evidence base mission drive government would give the people of newcastle upon tyne central our future back yet again this budget will only hold they back we need general election and change of government have enjoy the debate which have be useful we have hear important contribution from both side and welcome the constructive tone however do think that the comment just make by the hon member for newcastle upon tyne central chi onwurah reflect labour party commit to ever increase public spending while simultaneously complain about the high tax burden that the country labour under that come without any commitment to reduce taxis far than we be in fact the party just make ever increase spending commitment will the hon gentleman give way be very happy to when do ask for increase spending will he clarify that now for the benefit of the house well we hear repeat complaint about the underfunding of service and the requirement for improvement that be what the hon lady believe in if she be happy to say that she do not believe in additional spending will be delighted to hear it thank the hon member for give way again as he know we have set out our spending commitment and crumble service be consequence of the tories absolute failure to give growth to our country and our fantastic business which can drive economic growth across our country we have make repeat investment in public service but recognise that there be all sort of problem across our country on the subject of crumbling there be also major hole in the labour party public finance plan follow yesterday budget we look forward to see how it will plug the new hole in its plan make the remark because think there be common recognition across the house that improvement need to be make to our economy there have be significant challenge to the uk in recent year be pleased to hear yesterday that significant improvement be now under way inflation be fall wage be rise mortgage rate be start to come down and debt be on track to fall all that be welcome also very much welcome the combination of the autumn statement and yesterday budget which together have see cut to national insurance totalling billion benefit the average worker by over and tax cut of around for the average self employ person recognise the point about fiscal drag we have to acknowledge the reality there but give that the threshold have not be raise the tax reduction be welcome particularly welcome the change promise for the high income child benefit charge by the raising of threshold and halve of the rate at which child benefit be withdraw that important step will benefit some family by an average that be welcome as be the commitment to end the unfairness on single earner family altogether by april welcome those significant development particularly welcome the extension to the household support fund have be call for that on behalf of wiltshire council to which pay tribute for its really good work in support household in need with essential such as food and utility that extension be really important development the chair of the work and pensions committee the right hon member for east ham sir stephen timms make the interesting suggestion that the household support fund should be make permanent recognise that there be voice on my side of the house who think that it be only stick plaster measure during these difficult time actually agree with the chair of the select committee it be important to ensure that local authority have discretionary funding that they can use they should be accountable to their local resident for how they use that money would like to see the money raise locally as well but the principle of discretionary fund for local government be important there be obviously still significant concern about the state of the economy and be somewhat concerned by the obeisance and genuflection that the chancellor feel oblige to make towards the office for budget responsibility recognise that he would have like to have do more in the budget if the obr have allow he it be the wrong way round to outsource responsibility for fiscal forecasting to an unaccountable body in this way it be wrong that he regard the only measure of the budget success to be whether the obr give it green light fundamentally we be restrict the reform that we need to make in this country come to broad concern welcome the budget and all its measure be good and helpful but there remain profound and powerful structural problem with the model of our economy all of which start before we come into power it be cross party responsibility the liberal democrats the conservatives and labour be all responsible for the structure of the economy under which we operate in this country and will describe it briefly in the follow term we have have cheap money and decade of artificially low interest rate follow by money print from the bank of england that go on too long create chronic asset inequality in our country essentially there have be transfer of wealth from poor to rich we have have cheap labour create low wage and we have pressure on housing public service and community cohesion that have be cause by import million of people from abroad to work for low wage in our economy we have an economy build on cheap import we burden our own producer with cost while we import cheap product from abroad that be make to lower standard regret all these condition in our economy the result be huge geographic inequality long tail of unproductive business and be afraid too low real term wage growth suggest that all this be endemic to the economy which be make by labour and the financial crisis but which have not be sufficiently address over the last decade and half by the conservative government we fix the damage that be do to the public finance under labour imagine what the party would have do if it have be in power after but we do not change the economic model be glad the budget indicate that the government be commit to reform in the right direction particularly welcome the recognition that debt will fall during the next parliament if we be in charge it be impossible to see how the opposition will get debt fall without policy to drive growth and improve public sector output that be good commitment also welcome the commitment to improve public sector productivity and my hon friend the member for the cotswolds sir geoffrey clifton brown make some very important point about the way in which we need to improve output and efficiency in the nhs particularly welcome the government focus on improve private saving and investment want to quickly mention the wiltshire economy in my wonderfully beautiful traditional and old look county we have some of the most hi tech business in the uk produce really innovative product for the global economy highly positive story be develop in wiltshire lead by the agritech sector one of the great benefit of our new brexit freedom be that we can liberalise and enhance the opportunity for biotech and agritech but we need more and will quickly run through what they be first welcome the minor uplift of in the vat threshold for business regret that we could not do more and particularly regret that the reason we could not do more be as understand it due to the windsor framework we be effectively tie into the eu vat regime because we do not want to diverge from northern ireland in gb quite rightly but regret that we could not raise the vat threshold to significantly more than we should find way to make that possible secondly other hon member have make this point powerfully we need to grow our rate of house building significantly would like to see more new town be create would also like to see land reform to get the cost of land out of the price of housing which seem to be the fundamental blocker particularly on housing in rural area we should greatly enhance and expand community land trust which have such useful role to play not just in urban setting but in rural setting to create low cost affordable housing for local family we also need to reform the labour market today debate on enhance the world of work be so timely and relevant to the reform that the government be try to bring about welcome all that the secretary of state for work and pensions whom meet this week be do to get more people into work we have chronic problem with economic inactivity significantly million of people be not able to contribute to the economy and to their own prosperity there be major disincentive to work and train fuel by our high migration economy which be simply subsidy to employer at the expense of work people it be very good that the government be focus on gdp per capita which be the fundamental measure despite the poor record of gdp per capita in recent year as opposition members have point out there be many reason for that poor record but the primary reason be the high rate of migration low pay worker have drive down contribution and income per capita welcome the work that the government be do to get people off benefit and into employment particularly through the workwell programme finish with plea on behalf of wiltshire and the whole country more than anything regret the budget slow and frankly insignificant uplift in defence spending it be good thing that more money be now go into the defence budget and welcome the commitment that have be make in recent budgets but the increase of less than in the defence budget yesterday be disappointing give the current global crisis and the historical underfunding of our armed force under many government be proud to represent the british army large garrison on salisbury plain it would be great thing for the nation and for wiltshire to see the significant investment in the army that will be necessary for our security it would also boost our economy rise we will try an eight minute formal time limit which do not prevent member from take intervention listen to part of this debate wonder what universe some conservative members have be occupy for the last four year in fact wonder whether someone have be slip soma or something into their tea the house will recall that soma be the magic potion that be feed to the character in the aldous huxley novel brave new world to quell their unhappiness and blind they to the reality of life around they that be how it feel listen to part of this debate try as they might this government can not escape responsibility for the state of our economy the cost of live crisis and the damage they have do to family budget and to the people they have plunge into debt in my pre budget survey selly oak constituent be clear want the chancellor to prioritise the cost of live crisis he have not want he to concentrate on grow the economy he have not and be against apparent giveaway follow by public service cut that be exactly what he have do this be not tax cut budget because as we have hear tax be still go up the chancellor be preside over the high level of tax for year and he have the effrontery to prance around pretend to be tax cutter he be bit like prime minister who profess love for equality while boast of transfer fund from poor area to rich area people be not stupid they know that the continue freeze on allowance mean that they be pay more people like teacher and nurse be now pay high rate tax and since the tories come to power the average income tax pay by pensioner have rise with million more suck into the tax system in the last year and of course there be the hide cost prudent chancellor would have put something aside for the contaminated blood scandal the victim of the post office horizon nightmare the waspi women against state pension inequality campaign woman debacle and the lgbt ex service personnel those be all thing that he should have sort by now but have ignore probably deliberately perhaps he be plan to leave those issue for someone else if the chancellor want to grow the economy he would have do more to help small business for example attic brew in my constituency be popular little business that have weather covid have create about full time and part time job but it struggle with high energy bill and taxis which hit sale of locally produce beer acknowledge the alcohol duty freeze but he do nothing about energy bill or reduce duty on draught beer and cider which would have do far more to help small independent producer that be how to reward work and enterprise grow our economy be the only way to get enough money to pay for good public service where in the budget be the support for skill investment which be essential if we be to grow and provide job for the future hear conservative members laugh yesterday at the idea of gb energy just as they use to laugh at non dom tax gb energy will allow we to take control of our energy sector and protect we from hostile power and will help to wean we off fossil fuel labour know the value of that because we have do it before when we create the british national oil corporation we create structure that could have rival the norwegians for provide dividend and sovereign wealth fund for our people have not the tories squander the proceed of north sea oil receipt they understand the need of oil giant but they show little understanding of or care for the need of ordinary people and small business finally we have see the classic tory deception the chancellor end his budget speech by plant story about something that he will probably not do he want we to talk about the total abolition of national insurance an unfunded proposal worth more than the tax bonanza from the right hon member for south west norfolk elizabeth truss which almost wreck our pension fund of course that assume that he be promise to scrap only employee ni if he be also consider employer contribution we would be talk about black hole of not billion but billion we can see why we need clarity from these people about what they be actually promise my hon friend be make an excellent speech do he think that it be extraordinary give what happen after the so call mini budget that the conservative party seem to have learn nothing and be still make all sort of unfunded commitment which could wreak havoc on our economy just as happen last time around this be extremely serious and be not surprised that the conservatives be try desperately to get away from it because we can all see the risk that be pose this be budget base on the kind of fantasy reality that could well have come from an aldous huxley novel we have chancellor with nowhere to go represent government no one believe it be time to let the people decide hastings and rye be vibrant and dynamic place that be home to amazing and resilient tourism retail and hospitality business hundred of small and medium sized enterprise and robust manufacturing sector specialise in vacuum and precision engineering however it have pocket of deprivation that be why welcome the measure take by the chancellor in yesterday budget which be bold than it seem reflect dose of optimism and good dollop of resilience and build on policy that have halve inflation reduce debt and promote grow economy particularly welcome the measure take to support hard work family the budget address the cost of live burden by reduce employee national insurance contribution by another they have go from to and now to it be give thousand of people in hastings and rye tax cut cut of over for the average worker let take this opportunity to correct the shadow chancellor and dispel the nonsense be spout by opposition members the chancellor do not promise to abolish national insurance contribution yesterday he express an ambition to do so without compromise public service but say that it could not be achieve any time soon and would require responsible fiscal management cut class national insurance contribution from to will help self employ people in my constituency and alongside the duty freeze on fuel and pub pint and the extension of the energy price guarantee it will help put hundred of pound back into people pocket also welcome the historic investment in early year and childcare which will help hard work family the budget build on the significant stride make in when an unprecedented sum of more than billion be allocate for early learning and childcare the increase in funding for early learning and childcare for will directly benefit our child our hard work family and the dedicated professional who nurture our child growth the enhancement of teacher training will hope help to ensure early intervention and prevention of problem for all child include those with special educational need so that they receive the support that they need to reach their potential address the unfairness of the child benefit system will benefit thousand of family in hastings and rye promote equity and social justice and ensure that family receive support base on their need also welcome the measure take to help the most disadvantaged in my community such as the increase in the repayment period from to month for those on universal credit who be force to take out advanced budgeting loan and the fact that the charge to take out debt relief order will be scrap completely the household support fund be set up temporarily to help the poor through the cost of live crisis with one off payment of depend on circumstance its continuation for another six month be vital for number of reason not least because it provide immediate relief to vulnerable household face financial hardship its extension mean that particularly vulnerable family in hastings and rye can continue to receive essential support during challenge time and avoid debt however it be worth note that the fund be temporary fix and the government need to continue their focus on long term solution to address poverty and prevent family slide far into financial distress work be the only route out of poverty that be why the department for work and pensions back to work plan and our family hub which support family in so many way be vital policy measure it be really good news that despite the challenge pose by the pandemic and the war in ukraine our economy be show sign of recovery the obr revise growth forecast for show modest improvement from to that may seem incremental but it do signify progress small and medium sized enterprise be the backbone of our local economy welcome the billion tax cut for business through the radical policy of full expensing and through capital allowance reform this move will drive investment stimulate growth empower our entrepreneur encourage innovation and create job in hastings and rye but we need to encourage more local young people into science technology engineering and math further education and apprenticeship university technical college and utc sleeve will be real step forward in provide skill for the future while tourism and hospitality have greatly benefit from generous government support over recent year include the extension of relief into would have like more of boost for our tourism and hospitality business from the chancellor clear pathway for reform of business rate in england up to include relief and action on vat the british retail consortium say some time ago we need business rate tax that ﬂexe with overall economic performance be share equitably across different industry and come with positive incentive for business will briefly mention student loan we all recognise the punitive rate of interest pay on student loan by our graduate and it be not feasible to write off all the debt could the chancellor please ensure that no graduate pay interest at rate high than the average available commercially that will help million of graduate who deserve fair rate of interest allow our young professional some financial stability and give they the certainty to make sound life choice let we embrace this budget with optimism the last few year have not be easy for the british economy with the legacy of covid and war in ukraine and the middle east it be only because our economy be in well state as result of the government policy since that we could afford to protect people and business and support ukraine our economy be now turn corner we can not allow the labour party to play fast and loose with our economy again and take we back to the economic tatter of after all we have be through in the past few year this budget be road map to bolder bright future for britain future in which business flourish our family thrive and our community can stand resilient it be interesting to follow the hon member for hastings and rye sally ann hart will leave it there the test of any budget be simple and we all know it in politic and elsewhere in life be work people well or bad off the fact be that britain be bad off there be high taxis low wage and stagnant economy the tax burden be at its high for over year since and the national debt be at its high since the average household will still be bad off after all the budget measure and this will be the only parliament on record in which living standard fall lower at the end of it than they be at the start the real cruelty be not that the budget be miss opportunity for the conservative party to gain some ground it be that work people do everything that be ask of they and more but that work be not reward real pay have go up by just week over year of conservative government compare that with the last labour government under which wage rise by week over year even the national insurance reduction pale into insignificance when we consider that the personal tax allowance freeze will take billion from work people in the end work people be bad off and they know it work people know that the community where they live and work and that they care about and be invest in be feel the strain as be public service people be wait long for nhs treatment than ever before even before the pandemic which have be use number of time as reference point million more people be on waiting list than when labour be last in office today waiting list stand at million impact more than million patient what of the nation productivity when there be low life expectancy which in some case be go down and when quality of life be compromise by pain worry and stress how can we talk about productivity in the economy when the nation be simply not well there be firm poverty postcode lottery the king fund report that people who live in the most deprived area of england be twice as likely to wait more than year for treatment as those who live in more affluent area it be postcode lottery on health and an inequality that be not right in the modern age there be no healthy economy without healthy society that the chancellor do not get it be one thing but for chancellor who be previously health secretary not to get it beggar belief frankly we all know that health and social care be interlink and that people wellness and the economy be interlink labour will get the nhs back on its foot we do it before and we will do it again but we be disappoint not to see more interaction between health and social care yesterday like the local government association be disappoint not to see focus on adult social care let focus on oldham borough of nearly quarter of million people good decent people who should have be front and centre of this budget there like everywhere else they know that good public service be the foundation of good economy not burden place on it they know the cost when public service be overwhelm by demand staff be under immense pressure and those they love do not get the care they need many mp will know this from our surgery but not that long ago if people be have struggle with housing adult social care send support or range of other different public service it would have be the exception and not the rule that they be find to be in difficult position now however we all know that when people come to we to say that they have housing crisis we have to reply that the rule for many it not the exception any more when people say that the person they love can not get adult social care we say unfortunately that the rule now for too many it not the exception any more when parent come and say that they be fearful for their child because they have not get the send assessment and support need we say too often that not the exception any more it the rule for too many people the public service infrastructure for too many people have completely be erode in many place the market have completely fail we see that in adult social care and in child service where the cost of placement be significantly impact on local authority budget then we come to temporary accommodation which have to be mention in oldham the cost of temporary accommodation have increase from million to million in just few year that be not the real story of course that be just financial pressure the real story be that behind every figure be family family in desperate need in oldham people be in temporary accommodation include boy and girl in temporary hotel accommodation share room mixed gender mixed age group and often in mixed hotel where the hotel be not even block book to stop private client be able to access the facility that be not right it be not safe and it reflect broken market in the end we need to rewrite the british contract because it have fail too many work people the idea that if people roll their sleeve up work hard and make contribution they can get on in life and build something for themselves and their family have be take away from people more than that the generational progression that should be there have be deny look at my child grow up now and see housing market that be move far and far away from they not close people in my community see that the good well pay skilled working class job be something of the past and not the future that fundamentally hit at the heart of the british contract so we need different way as chair of the co operative party would say that we should be look at many example in the co operative movement ownership matter we have see complete hollowing out of ownership in our community look at our high street and our town centre we do not even know who own the building that have be board up for or year ownership matter on energy we see that people be pay more and more for their gas and electricity to oligarchs and offshore interest when here we be not build something that we can own together that be where the labour party be set out different path with onshore and offshore renewable through great british energy we can own something together where we get to share its value where we can take back control of our energy supply our energy security and our energy bill in the end this come down to the government decide to choose path and course think that some of those issue should be beyond politic part of the problem with british politic be that thing follow the parliamentary cycle far too much when some be far more structural such as adult social care and the future of health and social care there should be big response to that than whatever the chancellor of the day think at moment in time great consideration should be give to the future world of work and ensure that work pay and give people the opportunity to live decent life when we do not have that big politic and those big idea be afraid we end up in the same situation that we find ourselves in yesterday frankly vacuous and without idea it be pleasure to follow my hon friend the member for oldham west and royton jim mcmahon my constituent like his in oldham have sense of disappointment about the budget failure to address many of the challenge that they and other in former coalfield and industrial area face taxis in the uk be unfairly distribute penalise our poor community rather than support our fragile regional economy government policy and decision making take money and resource out of our community datum from the office for budget responsibility show that despite the headline cut to national insurance the uk tax burden be the high it have be in year and that it rise every year of the forecast period it be true that anyone in my constituency live on the national minimum wage earn around will receive an extra year or per month from the reduction in national insurance however we need to look at the overall tax burden around of that extra income will be lose to the increase in council tax my council website which give some example say that those live in band property will be charge more next year of course that figure will be much high once we have add increase to parish police and fire precept the problem be compound in area that like mine have small council tax base because the majority of property be in band to indeed the additional money that council raise will not even cover the rise cost so we will have to pay more but see service cut durham county council will receive have check this million less in revenue support in compare with indeed survey by the county councils network find that of local authority be increase council tax by the maximum permit in east durham that mean that our poor community be pay the most here be an interesting example band property in easington colliery face council tax bill of which be not far short of the prime minister council tax bill for his band flat in downing street if the prime minister be pay council tax on band property in horden in my constituency his council tax would be despite our property price be significantly below the national average our poor community and resident in my constituency be face council tax bill similar to that of the prime minister council tax be new poll tax in all but name often feel like lone voice advocate for proportional property tax but should not be because it would benefit of uk household proportional property tax be flat tax charge of property current value it would effectively be an annual economic stimulus to the regional economy worth billion year increase disposable income of household in the poor community which do not enjoy the same level of public and private investment as household in london and the south east service that take up the large part of durham county council budget be adult social care and look after child those be important service but they should be fund nationally base on need assessment those cost should not fall on local taxpayer particularly as we have see rise in some council and service provider effectively outsource those with complex need by move their people into our poor community if the minister be not aware of that issue and want to understand how council in the south be game the system at the expense of my constituent recommend that he read an article by the express journalist zak garner purkis do not normally recommend the express but he be an excellent journalist far from give our community chance the government policy taxation and investment decision be widen the economic divide in our country through high taxis and lack of public investment which impact on the private sector willingness to invest in my constituency of course there would be opportunity if we have the right investment and growth policy we have large area with derelict and run down housing that would be ideal for redevelopment and the creation of decent family home but we have tax and investment system that hold back our regional economy and deprive they of opportunity we have government who refuse to take any step to address widen economic disparity think that be the whole purpose of level up there be other national issue that affect my constituency include the nhs there be long wait in and nhs dental provision be collapse we have over subscribe school lack of home to school transport and school in poor state of repair not only those affect by raac or asbestos but some quite new school build by disreputable construction company that have fleece the taxpayer the conservative party have now have year either in government by itself or in coalition with the lib dems and other to improve the opportunity for constituency such as mine however year on the problem that our country face today be just as deep rooted and extensive as ever the chancellor and the prime minister say that they be proud of their record well think my constituent have reach the same conclusion as many other they say it be time to put that confidence to the test if this government have shred of integrity we should be go to the poll on thursday may for general election the chancellor budget have lift the lid on year of tory economic failure taxis be still rise price be still go up for consumer mortgage be go through the roof and the chancellor do nothing yesterday that be go to change that we need government that can rebuild britain it be time for change it be time for general election it be real pleasure to follow my hon friend the member for easington grahame morris we on the labour benches talk lot and rightly so about the conservatives crash our economy and send mortgage up by almost rent up by and food price up by we talk lot about the fact that the prime minister be utterly blinker about the truth that he have go from be low growth chancellor to no growth prime minister with the introduction of rishi recession and that work people be pay the price in this cost of living crisis we talk lot about tory waste the fact that the prime minister have blow billion on covid loan fraud and million on rwanda plan that have fly three home secretaries to kigali but not single asylum seeker we know that the tax burden be at its high level for year while debt have rocket and be still go up however we should probably talk more about the underpinning mismanagement of our economy and the broken economic model that have see tories under investing turn our country into stagnation nation we have record high nhs waiting list of more than million people school that be literally crumble because the prime minister cut the school building budget when he be chancellor of crime go unsolved with rape victim wait three year for their day in court and three time as many child live in poverty today as do six year ago the reality be that the past year have be an omnishamble as result nothing in this country seem to work any more yet the british people be be force to pay more and more for less and less what idea have the conservatives put forward to fix this mess none whatsoever instead they resort to pilfer labour policy like some sort of embarrassingly bad tribute act when the cost of living crisis hit we know we need to support household through it so we propose windfall tax on the excess profit of oil and gas company the conservative party eventually cave in and deliver that policy but poorly and riddle with loophole this week the government have make feeble attempt to mimic our policy of end the non dom tax loophole just think if they have act when labour first suggest end this loophole two year ago they would have generate billion for the policy area we suggest they could have deliver million extra operation million emergency dental appointment and free breakfast club for nearly million child the conservatives be follower not leader they be slogan monger not servant of the people they believe in government by gimmick rather than the hard graft of govern in the national interest labour meanwhile be take long term responsible approach to get our economy back on its foot and grow again which be why we have our five core mission we will get business grow and put demand back into the economy start with our new house building programme for million home over five year create new job and get young people and family the housing they need we will deliver clean energy by and switch on great british energy our transition to modern economy will deliver half million good job low household bill and make our energy supply secure from putin we will get the nhs back on its foot and fit for the future and bring down wait time with the big ever workforce expansion include more doctor and nurse and million more available appointment we will put police back on the street and halve the number of incident of violence against woman and girl we will spread opportunity for young people everywhere by shatter the class ceiling through well early year provision and improve technical education instead of the government hand off not my problem guv approach to the economy we can deliver an active industrial strategy back our business to make buy and sell more in britain this include labour billion steel renewal fund with that be urge tata steel to step back from the cliff edge which would cost people their job in aberavon and wales and not do anything that can not be undo before the next general election what disgrace it be that the conservative government have give million to tata to make people redundant we will work with industry to secure bridge to the new economy so that steel company can seize the opportunity of the future and britain can maintain its sovereign capability to make its own steel from scratch this be vital security issue in the dangerous and turbulent world in which we live if we want to get putin boot off our throat we have to sustain our vital steel industry we on these benches be also commit to support small business we will legislate to tackle late payment unlock billion in unpaid invoice we will scrap business rate and replace they with system that be fair for brick and mortar business these be the kind of growth measure we need to get aberavon wales and britain fire on all cylinder last year the prime minister say we ve turn the corner and promptly plunge britain into recession with an economy small now than when he enter downing street mortgage through the roof house building fall off cliff worklessness rise homelessness never higher crime go unsolved and rape victim wait year for their day in court we have river full of sewage which be the perfect metaphor for the stench of decay that be emanating from this clap out government household be bad off on average under sunak the prime minister tax plan with just give back for every take from our constituent he be give with one hand and take twice as much away with the other that be not plan that be scam it be con from this government who have run out of idea run out of energy and run out of road we need an election this spring and we need labour government who will rebuild our public service re energise our economy and get our country back on track rise order let remind member that we do not use the christian name or surname of current serve member think the hon member for aberavon stephen kinnock know what be refer to but do not want to stop he in his flow all hon member be incredibly bright and be sure that they will think of another way of make their point fourteen year of tory government and they still can not find chancellor who understand poverty inequality and the need for public service despite the late one be former health secretary he do not understand health and the role it play in our society remind government members that they cancel the new hospital for stockton in and health inequality in my area have since widen despite the tremendous work of nhs worker and other today will try to help the tories understand the consequence of their year in power over decade of austerity and now somebody recession at the weekend be appal to hear that life expectancy in the north east compare with the rest of the uk will continue to fall for the next year report by the institute for public policy research north state that wealth health power opportunity and systematic inequality be just few of the reason why the north east be set to see the north south life expectancy divide endure for decade it state the number of year you can expect to live in good health in the north and midlands would be two and half year shorter than the south and three and half year shorter than in london extend these overall trajectory the gap in healthy life expectancy between the north and the all england average would not close until while the gap between the north and south east would endure until after year of conservative government nothing have happen to close the gap and national comparison be widen far it be even bad locally people in the town centre ward in stockton be expect to live year few than those down the road in ingleby barwick that news come after report of huge increase in child poverty people be unable to see gp for week on end dental appointment that be simply not available and waiting list for operation stretch and stretch some appointment for operation that take just few week in now take many month or in some case over year welcome the new diagnostic centre be build in stockton but it be only one small piece of very large jigsaw of provision need to do the good for our people the author of the report and ippr north research fellow marcus johns have confirm that urgent action be need to tackle the inequality he say no one should be condemn to live short sicker less fulfilling or poor life simply because of where they be bear it hard to avoid the conclusion we be head in the wrong direction on inequality in health wealth power and opportunity while local government finance languish in chaos let turn to another report demonstrate regional inequality the north east child poverty commission february report highlight that there have be no child poverty strategy for england or the uk as whole since however the proportion of north east child in poverty from work family have rise from to in less than decade the report also find that the intensity of child poverty in the north east be get bad with one in five child in our region now live below the deep poverty line and more than one in north east child live in very deep poverty almost one in five north east child be live in food insecure household mean that they do not have access to sufficient food to facilitate an active and healthy lifestyle child in our region have be let down in range of other childhood health measure have either the high or second high rate in england of attendance emergency hospital admission and hospital admission for asthma diabete and dental treatment all of those be associate with high level of deprivation on child in care the north east have the high proportion of look after child of any english per child compare with the england average of in the tees valley all five local authority be among the area with the high rate of look after child in england indeed the link between high rate of child poverty and social care intervention be flag by the north east director of child service which make joint submission to the independent review of child social care back in it say exceptional level of poverty in the north east be drive dramatic rise in child protection intervention and the number of child in care the cost of this can not be afford exacerbate by reduction in government funding spend on early help have reduce at time when it have be most need this vicious cycle can only be break by different way of working back up by adequate investment do we not want the good for every child whether they grow up in the south east or the north east we will not have it unless every child basic need be meet it be deplorable that the government with their failure to act have become complacent with child in my region go to school hungry unable to concentrate unable to learn and unable to have the future for which they have the potential be pleased that labour be committed to ensure that all primary school child have free breakfast club that set they up for the day so that no child start the day hungry and there be safe space in which to be support with friend there be another matter of great importance to teesside there be one area where there have be colossal amount of taxpayer investment in the north east but sadly those same taxpayer be be rob of the benefit of billion invest at teesworks my advice to the chancellor be to get the forensic accountant to pore through the book and report and they will find ten of million of pound that could have be reinveste in the people of teesside instead of be pocket by two private sector businessman after the teesworks tory mayor gift they of the asset teeswork be probably one of the most important project in the country but private individual will benefit most from the hundred of million in profit expect over the come year individual who be yet to invest their own money have wonder how the ten of million of pound pay out in dividend to those two individual could have be use on teesside where all our local authority be be force by the government to cut service and hike council tax if those local authority have just million each they would not have to cut service and our social care could be give major boost the chancellor also need to look at the recommendation in his own government inquiry into the appalling way the tees mayor have be run his business recommendation because of the lack of transparency poor value for money and total disregard for proper process recently the mayor land we with legal action bill in excess of million against pd ports it leave the legal fee of the secretary of state for science innovation and technology look like chicken feed if the chancellor be serious about value for money from taxpayer he would show the gut that the secretary of state for levelling up housing and communities have fail to show and order the national audit office to see exactly how the billion of taxpayer cash have be use at teesworks and who be derive the benefit think he will discover that teesworks be not work for our community and we have see only few hundred of the ten of thousand of job promise actually create in conclusion we have have the year of austerity and we now have the prime minister recession the ramification have be immense appalling regional inequality poor health and cost of living crisis but above all poverty on scale we should be ashamed of it be pleasure to follow fellow scot my hon friend the member for stockton north alex cunningham decade ago george osborne remember in this place to deliver the first tory budget he speak about budget that recognise the hard work of the british people and set out plan for britain to keep move we from low wage high tax report july vol decade later after year of conservative government where be we in recession whether the chancellor call it technical or otherwise and with taxis high than at any point in the past year we have have year of lose pay growth with the resolution foundation confirm that the average wage will not regain its level until shamefully this be the first parliament since record begin to see living standard fall the most significant year on year decline in living standard since the that be the reality of yesterday budget record of economic incompetence and squander opportunity will the public feel any change in their circumstance after their pocket have be raid by tax increase and with mortgage soar food bill continue to go up and up and wage stagnate who on earth will feel any well off in those circumstance give the lacklustre response from those on the government benches during the budget yesterday and in today debate have enjoy it enormously but there have be more contribution criticise the budget than support it it seem that they be not particularly impress by it either and no wonder less than hour after the chancellor stand up the chaos have continue we have floated promise of billion cut to national insurance without single thought give to how it would be fund although now hear that have be downgrade to the chancellor express an ambition which apparently be different it be perhaps how liz truss express an ambition to crash the economy not that long ago order do say not to mention the name of current sit member forget she be sit member mr deputy speaker apologise the government be put off any long term spending plan to the next government to avoid face up to the reality that public service be crumble shamefully they be not put aside penny for the victim of the contaminated blood scandal or the victim of the post office scandal minute after the chancellor sit down we have the spectacle of the under secretary of state for energy security and net zero the hon member for west aberdeenshire and kincardine andrew bowie refuse to say whether he would back his own government plan to expand the windfall tax on the oil and gas industry be not sure if he be still on resignation watch or whether his chat with the chancellor have move he back to strong position but yesterday the tories in the scottish parliament have debate denouncing expand the windfall tax and the leader of the scottish conservatives the hon member for moray douglas ross have say he will vote against it this morning the chancellor say it would present little local difficulty this be utter chaos less than day after he deliver the budget with any other government at any other time they would be the laugh stock of the country but so low have our expectation fall that it be not even get the attention it should we should welcome the government conversion to labour economic plan follow where labour have lead on the non dom tax loophole or expand the windfall tax now it be only the snp that be out on limb say that it do not support increase tax on the billion week profit from oil and gas while happily put up taxis for those earn year in snp scotland teacher plumber police officer and nurse pay more oil and gas giant do not the hon member mention the specific case of nurse his colleague be reluctant to acknowledge the fact that nurse in scotland start off with much high pay than those in england do some check while other be speak newly qualified ward sister in scotland on rate even allow for slightly high income tax on part of their earning be take home year his or her equivalent in england be take home why do the hon gentleman want nurse in scotland to earn less when move to england know be in different party to the hon member but be in the same country so it concern how nurse in scotland be treat and they be pay more tax than their colleague in england that be the reality of the snp budget the truth be that lack of economic growth across the uk mean less for public service despite the scottish government receive almost million in consequential include million from increase spending in the nhs hope that the scottish government use that to invest directly in public service and especially in scotland nhs where statistic this week have show damn picture of the snp year in power the list of in patient wait more than week have go up time in decade cancer treatment within day be three time bad than decade ago all the while taxis be go up in scotland and wage growth be stagnate the house of commons library have carry out some research that show that weekly real earning be low today than in when labour leave office in scotland and the snp first come to power the analysis show that real wage continue to rise until when the labour government leave power in the uk but under the tories and the snp the average scot earn less in real term now than they do in ey this week find that average employment growth in scotland between and be expect to be just lag beyond all other part of the uk there be some really tough long term issue in scotland labour market that we must wrestle with long term sickness appear to be particular factor in economic inactivity in scotland account for nearly of inactivity compare with across the uk there be difficult demographic trend too these issue be not easily resolve but they require government with laser focus on the problem not one from hopelessly distract party the secretary of state speak about level of employment in the uk recent research by the work foundation and lancaster university find that of those in employment be in extreme job insecurity worker who experience involuntary part time work involuntary temporary form of work and precarious work and further suffer from low or moderate insecurity in other word more than half of people currently employ have degree of insecurity in their work the uk be become less secure precarious place for people to work and part of the cause of low productivity and rise level of in work property be that problem it be challenge for we to wrestle with but we must do so the tories be the architect of this economic mess ably assist by the grow incompetence of the snp neither can be the solution scot will rightly ask themselves after year of the tories and after year of the snp whether they feel any well off the answer will come back no they will ask if public service and the nhs be well now in scotland than they be year ago and the answer will be no the only way out of this doom loop of economic chaos high taxis and stagnant living standard be real change with government focus on grow the economy make work pay and turn the uk into green energy superpower that be the change that scotland need that be the change that the uk need that be the change that labour will deliver we need general election so that we can get on and do it liz twist will make the last back bench contribution so anyone who have take part in the debate should make their way to the chamber now listen to yesterday budget we could be forgive for think that the chancellor be live in different universe from the rest of we wage be stagnate taxis be rise growth be stall and nothing the chancellor announce yesterday have change that the obr own figure tell we that this will be the bad parliament on record for living standard after year of economic failure his legacy be less money in people pocket and the high tax burden since the chancellor tell we that absolute poverty have go down and that growth can come only from high wage high skill economy which we be suppose to believe his party be on the way to building let tell he that that be not the reality that my constituent be deal with the chancellor may try to tell we that people be well off after cut to national insurance contribution but for every that my constituent get back they will be pay double that in extra tax accord to his plan and the package people be be squeeze far and far as price continue to rise even reduced inflation rate mean that price be go up and cost people hard for those already on low pay the benefit be even less the cut be well for high pay worker and come at the cost of lower pay worker many of whom live in my constituency for generation parent have hop that their child would have it well than they do grow up of course that have never be guarantee but for too many people today it be far off dream there be million young worker in this country who have never see sustained average wage rise this be the only parliament on record where living standard have fall consecutive conservative governments have see inequality outstrip that see in any other large european country and our public service on their knee just as people need they more than ever many of we in the house will recognise the story behind these statistic in the constituent who come to our office door in the most desperate of circumstance with nowhere else to turn report release in january by the joseph rowntree foundation lay out the extent of rise poverty and destitution which be hit family with child and disabled member hard it say this be story of moral and fiscal irresponsibility and it be one that affect constituent in blaydon and across the north east in the north east the proportion of child in poverty who be from work family have rise from to in less than decade that be the impact of tory government decision on real people live day to day time be really hard for people and we know that there be well establish link between socioeconomic factor such as financial distress and mental health problem and vice versa it be therefore disappointing to see nothing on offer in this year budget to tackle our mental health crisis and organisation such as the samaritans youngminds and the mental health foundation have all comment on that despite uncertainty and anguish in the sector about the ringfenced funding for local suicide prevention plan which be set to run out this financial year we do not hear word about those plan on wednesday nor do we hear anything about specialist mental health support in school suggest that the government aspiration remain limited to cover just of school the hon member for redditch rachel maclean who be just walk into the chamber talk about people with mental health problem and bad nerve would it not be great if we could tackle nhs waiting list for mental health service so that people could get the support and diagnosis they need and could improve their life in the meantime the picture on social care also remain bleak with the government ambition fail to meet the essential need of old people disabled people and their carer and with local authority struggle to balance their budget there be nothing to tackle that issue as north east mp notice the chancellor reference to deep devolution deal for the north east be pleased to see the north east get more power and many more power be need regionally however our aspiration in the north east be even high than those in this deep devo deal and have no doubt that we will continue to press for even more measure to reduce regional inequality if one thing be clear from yesterday budget it be this the government be out of touch and out of idea unable to face up to the crisis they have preside over they be leave spin and scrabble try to tell we that we be out of the wood while our constituent feel the impact of the recession and tell we about it the government plan have fail it be time for new approach it be time for general election we come to the wind up call liz kendall thank you mr deputy speaker yesterday the conservative government seventh chancellor give his second budget thankfully the last before the general election minister have repeatedly claim that the economy have turn corner but they have drive it into dead end our economy be small now than when the prime minister enter downing street not only be gdp per person down in every quarter last year but it will be low at the end of this year and low too in four of the next five year in this parliament we have have the big hit to living standard on record and we have the high tax burden for year but people in this country do not need statistic to tell they the dire state we be in or that they be pay more but get less they see it every day in the high cost of the weekly shop and in their gas and electricity bill they see it in high mortgage and rent and in soar childcare cost they see it in their crumble school building and in the am scramble to see their gp the argument want to make today be that one of the central reason why the government have fail on the economy be that they have fail on work for all the claim make by ministers the obr lay bare the scale of their failure and the appalling cost to the british people the official unemployment rate be low but that be not because record proportion of people be in work we be the only country in the whose employment rate have not return to pre pandemic level yesterday the office for budget responsibility reveal that our employment rate will be low by the end of this year than it forecast in november that the rate will be low in five year time and that in it will still not be back to where we be before the pandemic that be the truth of what another five year of the conservatives will bring the reality be that increase number of people be leave the labour market and not even look for work whatever the secretary of state say he repeat it today the obr say that economic inactivity be increase not decline it say that economic inactivity be prove more persistent than it previously think it be no long decline from the post pandemic high and have instead rebound to total of million people the high in over decade much of the problem be drive by poor health an issue raise by many hon member in this debate on the labour side of the house we know that healthy nation be critical to healthy economy and that the government be fail on both some million people be now not in work because of long term sickness an all time high many of they be over often woman struggle with bad hip knee and other joint often care for elderly parent at the same time there have be an extremely worrying increase in young people out of work due to mental health problem with many lack basic qualification as the centre for cities have show all those problem be far bad in northern town and city which the conservatives promise to level up but which have once again borne the brunt of their economic failure in place such as blackpool blackburn middlesbrough and hull if we include the hide unemployed in the figure it take the official unemployment rate from to the labour party think that unacceptable the waste of individual potential be appal as hundred of thousand of people who want to work be write off and deny help to get back on their foot this be waste for british business which be desperate to recruit and need the talent of everyone in our country to grow and succeed it be an appalling waste of taxpayer money too over the next five year more people will be on sickness and disability benefit which will cost an extra billion more than our day to day expenditure on defence the impact on our economy be profound yesterday the obr say that high and rise level of inactivity be offset increase in the size and growth of our population and will leave gdp in five year time unchanged and the level of gdp per person low there it be in black and white the conservatives failure on work be drag on the economy drag on growth and drag on living standard and money for our vital public service that be not good enough rise will willingly take an intervention thank the hon lady she be rightly not happy with the level of economic inactivity that be why we be bear down on it give that the level of economic inactivity be high during every year of the last labour government would she like to comment on their record on it will not take any lesson from government who be oversee economic inactivity at record level the number of people out of work due to sickness be at record level result in soar cost for individual and livelihood if be the secretary of state would put in place proper plan for reform not offer half bake programme rehash and re announced scheme and more of the same empty rhetoric on benefit if our plan be half baked and rehash why have the obr confirm that by the end of the forecast period few people will be receive the long term sickness and incapacity benefit to which the hon lady refer if our plan be half baked why will few people be on those benefit the obr say that there will be more people on those benefit and the total cost will be billion the secretary of state try to deny that the scheme be rehash well let we look at the reform to fit note announce in back in what do the chancellor then health secretary announce reform to fit note take they beyond gps the government recently announce that there will be mandatory work placement in what do they announce mandatory work activity programme in the current chancellor as health secretary say we will appoint an expert working group on occupational health they be the same policy with the same failure it be absolutely time for change we do not have to go down this road we can choose different path under labour government we will do so our back to work plan will tackle the root cause of worklessness by drive down wait for nhs treatment and we will recruit more mental health staff we will ensure that employment support be tailor to individual and local need by overhaul jobcentre to end the tick box culture and devolve employment support to local area in every part of the country we will create more good job in clean energy and through our modern industrial strategy we will make work pay and improve the quality of work by ensure genuine living wage ban exploitative zero hour contract and strengthen right to flexible working and we will do more there be now who be not in education employment or training one in eight of all our young people that be terrible waste for they and for our country as whole give that half of all mental health problem start before people turn we have to intervene early so the first part of our offer to young people be about provide specialist mental health support in every school and walk in access in every community that way we will tackle one of the key driver of worklessness before it take hold secondly we will deliver new career adviser and good quality work experience so that young people leave school ready for work and ready for life thirdly we will overhaul skill by create new technical excellence college and reform the tories fail apprenticeship levy which have see apprenticeship start by young people fall by third our new growth and skill levy will help young people to get the skill that they need include by offer they second chance at basic skill and pre apprenticeship training if they do not get the right qualification at school fourthly we will provide new employment adviser for young people in our young future hub they will offer join up specialist help and support because the old one size fit all approach will not work when it come to tackle this problem finally we will overhaul access to work for young disabled people who want to work so that they know what equipment adaptation or personal support they will get before they start give they the confidence to take the plunge our proposal be fully cost and fund and will be pay for by scrap tax break for private school and close the tax loophole enjoy by private equity fund manager that be our offer to young people this year they and the rest of the british public face choice another five year of stagnation low growth high cost and worklessness under the tories or long term plan to get britain build again grow again and work again under labour the public know it be time for change let we have an election and let we have the gut to have it now it be my pleasure to close the first full day of debate on this spring budget which my right hon friend the chancellor of the exchequer bring before the house yesterday thank everybody for their contribution today the past few year have be sobering lesson in live through history they have not be easy for the british economy or the british people as we face the challenge and the legacy of covid war in ukraine and now war in the middle east we all know that we be in an election year but it be important that we focus on the policy as well as the politic and on the fact not just the spin so let we have look at some of the fact inflation have fall from last year to now we know that reduce inflation be the single most important thing for help family and it have happen real wage be now rise and some mortgage rate be start to come down the economy have also perform well than forecast it be project to grow by this year and by next year defy expectation that we would enter long recession the international monetary fund forecast that the uk will have the third fast cumulative growth in the over the next five year and will grow fast than japan germany france and italy we be on track to meet our fiscal rule underlie debt be forecast to fall as share of gdp in the fifth year of the forecast and by the end of the forecast borrowing will be at its low share of gdp since of course it be only because we responsibly reduce the deficit by between and that we be in position to provide much need support to the tune of billion during the pandemic and the recent cost of living challenge that follow the invasion of ukraine as have be repeat by many colleague we do not hear the opposition complain about that support the support inevitably lead to high taxis because public expenditure be high how on earth do the opposition think all those intervention would be pay for this reality have be forcefully emphasise today by my hon friend the members for folkestone and hythe damian collins for the cotswolds sir geoffrey clifton brown for devizes danny kruger and for hastings and rye sally ann hart all of whom make important contribution but the job and the recovery be not yet do because of the progress we have make though the economy be turn corner and we have be able to afford tax cut as part of our plan to reward work and grow the economy it be astonishing that on day two of the budget the government still want to tell the country that it have never have it so good will the minister address some of the point make by my hon friend the member for leicester west liz kendall what do he say to those young people who can not work because of disability or ill health what do he say to woman in their who be not work how do he propose to get those people back to work we be the party of work and we have hear lot of myth today from conservative members we believe in well pay good quality work the clue be in the name of our party what will the government do for those woman and for those young people with disability that be quite amazing open my speech by say let focus on the fact be labour really claim to be the party of employment every single labour government in history have leave office with unemployment high than they begin with the secretary of state for work and pensions outline how we will help the very people whom the hon member for bristol south karin smyth mention far from say that everything be fine and that people have never have it so good we be be honest with the public by say we know that you have be through an incredibly difficult time that be precisely why we intervene to such an extent provide over billion of support during the pandemic and since it be out of necessity that support be need it be important that we be honest with the british public that the money clearly need to be pay back we have high taxis out of necessity but as my hon friend the member for folkestone and hythe say we reduce taxis out of choice when we can we increase they out of necessity and we reduce they out of choice the opposition do not have that philosophy from april we be far reduce national insurance contribution and employee across the uk will see their national insurance contribution rate cut from to alongside the cut we already make to nic at the autumn statement this be total annual tax cut of for the average worker on year self employ national insurance will be cut far too to million self employ will also get tax cut worth on average year those measure will incentivise encourage and support more people into work or to work long hour the obr say that when combine with the autumn reduction our national insurance cut will mean the equivalent of more people in work fill one in five vacancy and add to gdp and to gdp per head this late cut to nics be the late step towards our long term ambition to end the unfairness that mean that if somebody get their income for have job they pay two type of taxis nic and income tax but if they get it from other source they pay only one when it be responsible and when it can be achieve without compromise high quality public service we will continue to cut nic make work pay believe that my neighbour my hon friend the member for the cotswolds outline the precise wording from the chancellor yesterday on that of course this should be see in the context of our overall record on job which be impressive since more than million more people be in work that be equivalent to job create every day of the lead administrations do the minister agree however that many of those job be part of low wage economy the obr which he cite say that in the year of the conservative government pay have go up by just week which contrast with the year of labour when it go up by week do he agree that many of these job be low pay and precarious the hon gentleman be clearly not listen yesterday to the chancellor who have key focus on job that be precisely why we be lift so many people out of poverty and why we have have focus on increase the national living wage over the year let we not forget that the tax free allowance be about under labour whereas it be more than now we have lift so many people out of pay tax altogether and that have be key focus and strategy of this government on low income tax payer by the government own assessment how many people have be bring into taxation because of the freeze on the personal tax allowance the hon gentleman be make an important point say early that unfortunately we have have taxis at high level than we want but now we be in position to reduce they reduce they and focus on nics be impactful for million worker anybody earn above people now need to earn more than month before they pay any tax whatsoever as say when we come into power unemployment be near but it be now about we should not take full employment or near full employment for grant we all know that every labour government have increase unemployment that be not an impressive record but it be consistent one particularly want to reflect today on how our plan reward hard work family the government believe that people career should support rather than undermine another important role parenthood that be why at last year budget the chancellor announce the big ever expansion of childcare from september extend the hour free childcare offer to all child of work parent from nine month old that will result in an extra parent enter the workforce in the next four year but to deliver on that we need to support the private sector to play its part too so yesterday we confirm that the government be guarantee the hourly rate pay to childcare provider to deliver the free hour offer the minister have not yet mention the government damascene conversion on scrap the loophole for non dom but there be point here about what they could have generate if they have listen to labour and do that two year ago it would have generate an extra billion of revenue which could have pay for free breakfast club for nearly million child so on the point of childcare do he think that be relevant the hon gentleman give quite wish list early which by my calculation could come out as be quite expensive do not know whether he have have conversation with the hon member for leicester west who be on his front bench on the hon gentleman point about non dom we will be scrap the non dom status but we will be replace the system with one that be residency base include measure that will encourage and incentivise further investment into the uk because we will be implement transition measure do not hear the opposition talk about they those transition measure be likely to encourage billion of additional investment into the uk non dom at the moment pay about billion in taxis we want to welcome people but we recognise that those with the broad shoulder must carry the great burden none the less we want to be internationally competitive and the new system that we have propose will be return to the childcare measure that outline early this commitment would mean over million of additional investment in childcare over the next two year this will give childcare provider the confidence to invest in expand at crucial time to deliver the free childcare expansion and help bridge the gap between parent career demand and their childcare need this approach complement further change that we be make to the tax system to incentivise parent to increase the hour they work yesterday the chancellor announce that from april the high income child benefit charge threshold will be raise to in addition the level at which child benefit be withdraw completely will increase to that be very much welcome by many member on the conservative benches include my hon friend the members for devizes for the cotswolds and other as result no one earn under will now pay the charge this will put pound in parent pocket save nearly half million family with child an average of year accord to the obr this change will also result in an increase in hour for those already work which be equivalent to around more people enter the workforce full time be grateful to the minister for give way one of the remain injustice with the high income child benefit charge be that single person earn will have to pay the charge but couple earn each will not because it be assess on single earning do the government have plan to amend that anomaly if so when can we expect to see that happen if the hon gentleman have not intervene and give just one more second would have say that go forward we will also consult on move the high income child benefit charge to base system to be introduce by april that point be also raise by my hon friend the member for christchurch sir christopher chope who point out the potential opportunity in other area relate to household income it be important because our tax system be base on the principle of individual taxation and there be many aspect of confidentiality and so on that be important in that as well the government will consult shortly on option to enable well target of economic support to household in time of crisis too very much welcome that commitment to move towards household basis for taxation do my hon friend recognise that most other country particularly european country operate on household basis for taxation because they recognise the obligation that family have to dependant yes hear my hon friend but as have say there be some challenge in move to household system there will be consultation and be sure that he and other will participate in that and we will have further discussion in the house rise do need to make some progress and respond to comment and my right hon friend the secretary of state be extraordinarily generous in take intervention early on will the minister give way be afraid that can not take any more intervention as have to respond to other colleague question my hon friend the members for christchurch for the cotswolds and the right hon member for leeds west rachel reeves and other talk lot about the tax burden it be important to point out that take together this budget package and the autumn statement will reduce the tax burden by in the tax burden be forecast to be low than expect in the autumn the tax system be competitive when compare with other european nation such as germany france and italy which have much high tax to gdp ratio the hon member for glenrothes peter grant and other raise the point about green policy and green energy of course the uk have halve its emission since which be fast than any other country since september alone company have announce plan for billion of new energy investment and the budget deliver on the green industry support announcement in the autumn statement include an additional million for the green industry growth accelerator and other measure my hon friend the member for redditch rachel maclean who be my constituency neighbour on the other side not only proudly quote margaret thatcher which of course always go down well among conservative members but give she consider insight into mental health and resilience she also mention productivity as do several other member which be key theme of the chancellor speech yesterday my hon friend the member for thurrock dame jackie doyle price and other make important point about the role of local government and local government finance on january the government announce an additional million for local authority in england take into account that additional funding the final local government finance settlement for be increase in cash term on several hon member mention the importance of house building which of course be priority for this government and central part of our plan for growth we be on track to deliver million new home in this parliament and have already deliver more than home on average each year since the hon member for bristol south say that there be nothing in the budget for the people of bristol south respectfully suggest that the national insurance cut that we announce in the budget will impact thousand of her constituent she may not appreciate or value that but assure she that her constituent will will the minister give way very briefly my point be about the change that we do not yet really understand in the budget and their effect on woman in particular will there be an equality impact assessment show how these change will affect woman as the hon lady know there be always tax information and impact note impact assessment as part of the budgetary process my hon friend the member for folkestone and hythe in his very strong contribution remind we of not only the context in which we take power in which be far from the golden legacy that the opposition receive in when they take power but the challenge that we have face in power over the last few year he be also very enthusiastic as be about the opportunity and progress of the creative industry that be exactly why we have focus on they and provide more support measure in the budget follow on from several measure over the last few year the creative industry be vital to our economy and future growth grow on average at about double the normal pace of the economy have to call out the comment of the hon member for warwick and leamington matt western regard the west midlands mayor andy street who have do so much to grow and attract investment in the west midland gently remind the hon gentleman that the labour council be not without its problem in birmingham will the minister give way will happily follow up with the hon gentleman but not now my hon friend the member for the cotswolds mention vat res which be absolutely expect he make some really important point in many area will happily follow up with he regard vat res the government be consider the obr finding about vat res in the context of the wide public finance but the chancellor have express that he be always happy to receive further representation the hon member for halifax holly lynch mention several area include send which other colleague mention as well we know that it be really important part of the education system and our overall social provision the government be invest an initial million over the next four year in build new special free school and successful alternative provision free school as well be aware of the time so will conclude my comment genuinely thank all member for their contribution there have be some extremely interesting contribution today the hon member for leicester west liz kendall outline her vision of clear choice which think we might be hear quite lot over the come month do believe that there be clear choice this year sustainable economic recovery sound finance low taxis more productive public service support for business and household optimism confidence and opportunity for all with the conservatives or reckless spending unfunded promise high taxis pessimism and negativity from the labour party with no hope no clue and no plan we have plan it be work and encourage everyone to stick to the conservatives and not to risk labour government order that the debate be now adjourn mr mohindra debate to be resume on monday march pavement parking motion make and question propose that this house do now mohindra rarely have the chance of speak two time on one day in quick succession be glad to have secure this debate but be sad that we be have to revisit the topic my first adjournment debate in this house on june be on pavement parking be sorry that nearly six year on we be still only talk about prevent it be by no mean the only person to have raise this subject as the minister know since that debate we have have promise to resolve the problem few government announcement and even consultation three year ago but still no government response much less any action guide dogs set out well what have be happen it point out that it have support private member bills in the house of commons in and which contribute to the department for transport decision to commission research on pavement parking the department subsequently hold consultation on manage pavement parking between august and november explore three option first to improve the traffic regulation order process by which local authority can already prohibit pavement parking secondly legislative change to allow local authority civil parking enforcement power to enforce against unnecessary restriction of the pavement and thirdly legislative change to introduce london style pavement parking prohibition throughout england guide dogs support all three but it strongly emphasise the third option to introduce law across the rest of england thank my hon friend for secure this important debate in manchester pavement parking continue to prevent people from participate in everyday life especially vulnerable and disabled people back in may petition parliament to outlaw pavement parking across the country that have huge support from my constituent and local authority but the government have do nothing about it do she share my concern that the government continue to show their contempt for the people of britain by fail to enforce simple measure that would greatly benefit the public absolutely agree with my hon friend the argument for pavement parking ban need little restatement all the organisation that have contact since secure this debate be largely in agreement they say that pavement parking put pedestrian in danger include disabled and old people as well as parent with child and that the government must take action locally know there be major issue with the school run for parent and child negotiate park car from my constituent who raise this issue know it be clearly one that be deeply feel be sure that they be not alone in that in blaydon resident regularly tell about the problem pavement parking cause outside the little shop in winlaton along the high street in birtley or even just up from my home along the main road in ryton guide dogs uk have do lot of work on this issue because pavement park vehicle pose particular risk to people with sight loss block their route create trip hazard and force they to walk on to road full of traffic which they can not see research by guide dogs have find that virtually all people with sight loss have be force to walk in the road due to pavement park vehicle some of respondent say that pavement parking affect they weekly while one in five say that they have be injure as result of it third of people with sight loss say that they be less willing to go out alone just in case they come up against vehicle block their path it be deeply unjust that people with sight loss should have their everyday life disrupt because of this issue in my last adjournment debate talk about my experience of meet margaret and laurel constituent of mine who be both visually impaired and take walk with they blindfold or with restrictive glass on my local street at the time they tell that they have lose confidence in go out alone and that their independence be at risk because of the number of vehicle park on the path have the chance to catch up with laurel ahead of this debate and be sad to say that little have change for she in the past six year she share with the follow message where live all the house be build in the and many do have their own drive as result everyone park their car on the pavement you can get past they and often tasha my guide dog and have to walk in the road it not just the one car we have to get past frequently have to go in the road to get past few of they which be so frightening as you can hear bike or quieter car if try to get past without go on the road find that often hit my head on the wing mirror which be unnerve in itself want to be independent and use the pavement without have to get help but there be so many car about that it get hard all the time recently go to catch the bus but find there be car park each side of the bus stop pole stop from wait there and prevent the bus from pull up have to step out into the road to get to the door of the bus which be nerve racking you do know what might be come towards you and you be put yourself and your guide dog in danger because have to step down into the road the step onto the bus be at the height use to and miss it and fall really hurt myself the driver do help and just say he report the problem on another occasion when be come home the bus get to my stop and struggle pull into the curb because of the car the driver actually stop right in front of the pole so that it be right in front of the door when they open if get out have walk straight into it but fortunately my son be with on that occasion and he grab hold of to stop feel really angry because people park on the pavement just do realise what problem they cause tasha and when we out and want someone to stop this happen the focus of my debate be the problem that we be have in my blaydon constituency which as the minister know it be next to his constituency be in the north east note that the north east deep devolution deal which be publish yesterday contain section that address pavement parking the north east mayoral combined authority state intention to develop consistent approach to enforcement be laudable and know that my local authority gateshead council have previously look at what it can do to help with the problem but identify street and issue traffic regulation order be lengthy impractical and costly process and local authority civil enforcement officer have few power where there be no line or sign present that be why so many organisation and local authority have call for system that allow for blanket prohibition such as the one that currently operate in london with the potential to allow for exception where local geography or street design make they necessary the national consultation be set up to consider what the government could do to support council to take action on this issue gently remind the minister that that consultation take place in and it state that summary of response would be publish within three month of its closing it have now be day since the consultation close but we be without substantive update that be without consider the dawdling that take place prior to the consultation which understand the government have initially plan for early or to look even far back the time that have elapse since the hon member for north dorset simon hoare introduce private member bill on this issue in in debate in the house of lords only few week ago the under secretary of state lord davies of gower tell that house yes it be time and be hopeful that in the not too distant future we will come out with report on this official report house of lords february vol can understand that the response that believe be submit need to be look at and that consider they take some time but from hear those word from lord davies one could be forgive for assume that the government be just run tad over the deadline we be now more than three year on and it be disappointing that the government can not promise we anything well than vague hope for response thank my hon friend for be generous in give way recent sustrans report find that of people in greater manchester wish to walk or use their wheelchair more and want to cycle more do she agree that if the government ban pavement parking nationally that would improve the accessibility of our footway make our street safe and encourage people to choose active travel alternative to car my hon friend make an important point we be all look to develop active transport policy and make it easy for people to walk on pavement and use public transport safely be real issue so very much welcome that report as have say response might be lot of paperwork to get through but they also suggest high level of public engagement and interest in this issue the government owe it to disabled people as well as the wide public to ensure that they complete this process as such ask the minister whether the department for transport will commit today to urgently publish the response to the consultation on manage pavement parking and to set out timetable for introduce legislation everyone should feel safe and confident when use pavement in their local area but so many people include many family walk to school be suffer people like my constituent laurel and margaret be suffer from social isolation and loss of independence due to the lack of action on this issue people with disability must not be an afterthought so hope that the government will stop take they for ride crack on and address their concern congratulate the hon member for blaydon liz twist who be my constituency neighbour on secure this adjournment debate on what be genuinely very important issue do not diminish it in any way whatsoever acknowledge that the hon member for manchester gorton afzal khan have also previously raise this matter in the house have have my brief for about day and have take the trouble to read transcript of the previous debate be also acutely conscious that vast amount of evidence have be provide by large number of organisation like the hon lady have meet guide dogs uk and know that this be very serious issue that affect individual up and down the country in genuine and serious way include people who be disabled those who have child those with pram and buggy those who be walk their dog and those who be engage in active travel for which be also the minister we have increase the budget for encourage active travel by and we be try to persuade people to get behind it so do not want to diminish the importance of this issue in any way acknowledge that it be very serious as the hon member for blaydon know and have previously outline there have be total ban on pavement parking in london since however to be fair successive government of different political persuasion have decide since that there should not be nationwide ban that be partly because london be clearly different environment from other part of the country particularly in term of rurality however she will also be aware be repeat thing that both she and the hon member for manchester gorton know that there be traffic regulation order as well as prescribed traffic sign and bay marking to give some context the transport select committee report in september be highly detailed and take huge amount of evidence and to certain extent trigger the government to respond that committee seek reform of the tro process change in the legislation govern the enforceable offence of obstructive pavement parking as will deal with later that legislation be not simple by any stretch of the imagination and consideration of nationwide ban in some shape or form as result and follow consideration and rightly extensive debate in the house on an ongoing basis there be the consultation as the hon member for blaydon say people respond to government consultation be probably more than any other that be aware of certainly in the transport space when be the employment minister be not aware of such detailed consultation clearly there be some that do generate more than that but this be not just on the three main point because bear in mind that there be response on different issue that produce as she rightly outline thousand of piece of individual feedback all of which need to be read and analyse an awful lot of different departments need to consider different matter and local authority be utterly key to that as be the department for transport and the like want to make the point that we understand the issue and if we do not understand they before the consultation we most definitely do now there be obviously inherent danger for all pedestrian and the hon lady rightly identify the particular situation for her constituent for whom have genuine sympathy however it must be recognise that many town and city as be clearly set out in the transport committee report and the consultation the government undertake be not design to accommodate today traffic level and in some location the pavement be the only place to park without obstruct the carriageway not least because there need to be free flow of traffic for the emergency service which be factor that the government have to consider understand that issue and understand that one of the proposal be to have blanket ban but allow opt out in particular circumstance that be clearly necessary and do not think anyone be argue that there be not circumstance in which that would be the case however this be sound as though we be not get to conclusion and that we be not go to have decision on this issue because it be too difficult be that right no think that be slightly unfair with great respect endorse entirely the comment of my noble friend lord davies of gower who respond to that specific point in the house of lords very recently he specifically say that the government be come to conclusion very soon have unquestionably become aware of that since have take up this post and it will unquestionably be decide in the very near future do not want the hon lady to walk away from this debate thinking that this be not under consideration as the hon lady know exist legislation allow local authority to introduce traffic regulation order to manage traffic example be one way street or ban turn and the tro also allow local authority the freedom to decide if and how they wish to restrict pavement parking in their local area however we acknowledge and the consultation clearly show that the process of make tro can be time consume and burdensome for local authority and it be clear that that require reform what reform look like be not simple but we unquestionably feel there be capability to do that there be also scope to reduce the cost of this process because there be undoubtedly lot bureaucracy and time that go with it if one could introduce digitise non paper base system that would speed up application and clearly make communication well there be clause to make that change in the automated vehicles bill which be go through the house and have its second reading early this week and that will make it quick and cheap for local authority to implement tro the second recommendation be about unnecessary obstruction of the road there be already some criminal offence in this space and we be look at how we amend the regulation to make unnecessary obstruction of the pavement enforceable by local authority while leave obstruction of the carriageway rightly as criminal matter this would label civil enforcement officer to address instance of unnecessarily obstructive pavement parking as and when they find it the enforcement of these offence would be more targeted than for general prohibition of pavement parking the minister have accept that we have law in london but not in the rest of the country would it not be consistent to have the same law across the board after all london be not the only important city city such as manchester or birmingham be also important this option have challenge parking offence currently subject to local authority civil enforcement be violation of clearly define restriction indicate by traffic sign and road marking by contrast unnecessary obstruction that could not be indicate by traffic sign or bay mark as an obstruction be general offence which may occur anywhere that be difficult to define and will require case by case assessment the department will likely need to issue very specific guidance to steer local authority on what might be deem unnecessary obstruction in order to prevent inappropriate and inconsistent enforcement the third option be national prohibition that be be consider but there be considerable pushback against it in certain circumstance as the hon member for blaydon outline one would have to assess how it would possible in circumstance where there be significant and large local authority particularly rural one which would struggle to make the specific decision on exemption however we be look at that particular situation to make decision on where pavement parking would be necessary local authority would have to limit the necessary exemption and install traffic sign and bay mark to indicate all the place where pavement parking be to be permit that would be extremely difficult particularly in rural area however it be not by any stretch impossible consideration also need to be give to whether ban would be disproportionate mention the rurality issue but want to finish on one key point one can talk about the relative merit or otherwise of local government and whether the london approach be the panacea that we all seek to say it be but this be ultimately about the personal responsibility of the vehicle owner really want to ram home the point that as be set out in the gospel do unto other as you would have do to yourself rise will not take further intervention it be unquestionably the case that we need to send strong message to the driver of this country that it be incumbent upon they to park responsibly to look after their neighbour and to be conscious of the wide impact of their decision to own car so that in their street and community they be accommodate the people who be struggle question put and agree to house adjourn
