compliment my good friend the hon member for norwich south clive lewis on his passion commitment knowledge and determination if may say so be also grateful that he mention the late great david graeber in his introduction he be good friend to both of we an amazing young man and an amazing philosopher sadly take from we too soon think his family will be really chuff that the hon member have include he in his speech on something so fundamental as the right to fresh clean water for we all this bill seek to protect that right it recognise that water be an essential and basic need and therefore something so universal and so essential surely ought to be completely in public hand most country around the world do not even countenance the idea of privatise water they say it be our public responsibility to ensure that we can provide clean and safe water for everybody when the government of margaret thatcher and other privatise water in the many of we strongly oppose it think be the only member in the chamber who have the privilege of voting against privatisation at the time we predict that it would lead to rip off of the public sector and to asset stripping of the land and other resource that the water board have build up we also point out that the water infrastructure we enjoy the reservoir in wales in scotland and all over england the piping the sewage work and all the other hugely complex element of infrastructure be for the most part build by public enterprise and public investment we all laud the work of bialetti in produce sewage system for london that be not do by the private sector it be do through victorian investment in public structure to bring about proper treatment of sewage and provide clean water for the people of london we should be proud of the public investment that bring about the water system that we have and should recognise that since when water be privatised billion have be take out in dividend by the water company that amount to billion year not invest in water not invest in new pipe and in protect the system we have those profit be extraordinary the hon member for hackney south and shoreditch dame meg hillier rightly talk about the amount of pollution flow into our river can not get my head around the fact that hour worth of sewage be pump into the thames in the last year alone when we add that to the amount be pump into the severn the trent the humber the mersey and all the great river across this country we realise the scale of the problem we be deal with we then realise what happen to that the sewage go into the sea and it come back in fish it pollute water which do not stop at the river mouth it go into the ocean create further global water pollution surely we can do much well therefore welcome the bill and invite member to look seriously at clause and clause set out the measure that will be require in the secretary of state strategy include measure on prioritise investment collaborate with local authority and use natural flood management technique and requirement for local authority to take into account the need for conservation all incredibly sensible measure that can only be deliver by public authority privatised water company do not have as their top line the conservation of the natural world and the environment they have as their top line their middle line and their bottom line the profit they can take out of it and please nobody tell that the billion pay out in dividend have be reinveste in the british economy it be in tax haven all over the world we be subsidise tax haven all over the world on the back of our polluted and privatised water industry clause relate to the commission on water which be fascinating proposal the commission would include representative of water company which be privatise at the moment but would hopefully be publicly own union representative in the water industry environmental or conservation group water user which would be local business and local authority strongly support public ownership of water but do not envisage situation in which the prime minister as gift to his friend put they all on british water board would like to retain the exist system of manage river basin area thames severn trent and so on that make sense because that be where the primary water supply come from that would be manage through commission that include the workforce trade union all the local authority in the area local business because they use water and supply service locally and other who can be appoint from elsewhere we would have public buy in to the structure which would give we much well and more democratic system urge member to look with some imagination at what the hon member for norwich south have put forward some say we can possibly bring this into public ownership because it might cost money the labour government start by nationalise the bank of england in and go on to bring many other industry into public ownership even the ted heath government in bring rolls royce into public ownership and create rolls royce ltd because the company be fail the agree share price be set by parliament it be not set by the market in all those case we can do the same in this case
