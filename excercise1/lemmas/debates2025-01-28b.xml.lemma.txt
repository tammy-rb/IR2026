oral answers to questions justice the secretary of state be ask crown court backlog what step her department be take to help reduce the backlog of case in the crown court what step her department be take to help reduce the backlog of case in the crown court when her department expect the crown court backlog to decrease the last government leave we with record and rise backlog case be take year to be hear and the number of victim drop out at police stage have nearly double we have take step to deliver swifter justice by increase sit day to year high and extend magistrate court sentence power but we must go far that be why have commission sir brian leveson to conduct review of the court ask he to propose once in generation reform we all want justice to be serve as quickly as possible and many of my constituent have contact recently with concern about law and order give the various medium report about unused capacity in court up and down the country what be the secretary of state department do to ensure that every aspect of the justice system be work efficiently and at full capacity the hon gentleman make good point and share his concern and those of his constituent indeed see many such case in my own constituency advice surgery we be work at pace to ensure that every bit of the criminal justice system be work at its maximum efficient capacity that include everything from police stage right through to sentencing in the court be sure that he will be aware of the very strained situation we inherit it will take some time for those change to take effect but we be drive forward system efficiency and sir brian leveson review will give we policy package with which to reform the system for the benefit of all victim constituent across bromsgrove and the village be sick and tired of violent criminality and lawlessness creep over the border from birmingham into our constituency in the past year romsley co op and wythall post office at drakes cross both of which be on the northern fringe of my constituency have be raid and it be hard to believe that proximity to birmingham be not factor in that what step be the secretary of state take to ensure that prosecution be pursue and custodial sentence be give in the first instance to crack down on crime and make our area safe again through our landmark review of sentencing this government be ensure that sentencing be fit for purpose that will ultimately put we in position where we can crack down on reoffende thereby cut crime and the number of victim be not sure whether the hon gentleman be propose carve out his part of the world from any other part of the country but his argument about boundary can apply to any part of the uk that be why we need function justice system for the whole of england and wales and that be what this government be go to deliver the justice secretary have say that she agree with the old legal maxim that justice delay be justice deny we currently have record backlog of in the crown court rape case be not be prosecute for three or four year and in particular on any one day of case do not take place for variety of reason what be the justice secretary do to speed up the whole system agree with the chair of the public accounts committee that the backlog be far too high he will know that no matter what we do in term of system efficiency and capacity that backlog be project to rise because the demand come into the system be particularly high and be itself rise that be why have ask sir brian leveson to consider once in generation policy reform so that we can make the legislative change necessary to bring the backlog down that be the change that be require alongside system wide efficiency and productivity call the chair of the justice committee the secretary of state have announce two major review of the criminal justice system the leveson review and the gauke review and have say that very impressively they might report by the spring which could be march there be difference between report and take action so could she set out exactly when she expect the result of those two review to have direct impact on case number the chair of the justice committee be tempt to pre empt what the review will find those finding will of course dictate the pace at which change can then occur he will be aware of the acute pressure on our prison system despite the emergency lever that have have to pull that have only buy we some time as have say when regularly update the house the sentencing review measure have to take account of our remain problem with prison capacity once the review have be publish we will move quickly to decide which recommendation to take forward on the court package it be likely that any measure will also require legislative reform again will seek to move at pace on that but that rather depend on the package of measure that sir brian leveson ultimately recommend call the shadow secretary of state the court backlog be grow by case every month and the ministry of justice have not set date for when it will come down victim be be force to put their life on hold while they wait for trial date yet today at the old bailey half of all the courtroom sit empty the lady chief justice have say that there be additional sit day available that could be use now who be the obstacle to resolve this be it the justice secretary who be content for rape trial to be schedule for as far off as or be it the chancellor and the justice secretary have just have ring run around she by the treasury what an absolutely outrageous set of remark the right hon member completely forget that only six month ago his government be in charge the government of which he be part all but run our justice system into the ground do not recall see he stand up and speak about delay for rape victim or indeed any other kind of victim when he be on this side of the house be glad he have now realise that the system ought to try to put victim first his critique would have more force be it not for the fact that this government have come to office only six month ago have increase crown court sitting capacity by day prison officer recruitment if she will make an assessment of the potential impact of the term and condition for prison officer pension on the recruitment of prison officer may take this opportunity to pay tribute to our prison staff for the essential work that they do we be committed to improve the retention of experienced staff because they be vital to keep our prison run the lord chancellor have request advice from official on the pension age of prison officer and we will continue to engage with trade union as this be consider thank the minister for his warm word and encourage remark he will know that in scotland the be too late campaign by the prison officers association enjoy cross party and scottish government support but the uk government have refuse to take action on this important issue the current retirement term ignore the reality of the frontline role that prison officer perform in prison on daily basis across the uk it be dangerous role and no less so than that of firefighter or the police who enjoy very different term although justice be devolve to the scottish parliament the pension of scottish prison officer be control by the uk government so will the minister or the secretary of state commit the government to review the current prison officer retirement age of and will he meet to hear this case in more detail as have say the lord chancellor have request advice on this matter we promote our strong employee total reward package as part of our recruitment the term and condition of the civil service pension scheme be some of the good in the public sector with low employee contribution rate and significant employer contribution rate of however that do not mean it be not right and proper question to ask and if the hon member wish to have meeting with be quite happy to meet he support for female offenders what step her department be take to support female offender what step her department be take to support female offender what step her department be take to support female offender what step her department be take to support female offender this government plan to support woman be clear and ambitious to reduce the number of woman go to prison and to have few woman prison our women justice board which meet for the first time last week will support implement this vision would also remind the house that as the minister responsible for youth justice have initiate review of the placement of girl in custody on which susannah hancock will report at the end of this month what family support be available for woman at foston hall prison and young offender institution we know that family support be very important to woman in custody which be why grant funding have be award to the charity parent and children together pact to provide resettlement family engagement worker in hmp foston hall as well as in seven other woman prison gaie delap the mother of constituent of mine be recall to prison just before christmas despite comply with her curfew condition because the government electronic monitoring service contractor could not fulfil its contract and find tag to fit frail year old woman can the minister and the secretary of state help to find solution so that gaie delap can be release on her curfew and so that woman be not disadvantage by the failing of the contractor electronic monitoring system thank my hon friend for raise this matter in this case the court decision be to impose prison sentence and neither ministers nor official can intervene in sentence pass down by our independent court understand the frustration and can assure the house that we be work hard to find alternative approach to ensure secure resolution to this issue there be more than woman prisoner in england and wales number that the ministry of justice project will rise to by november like many welcome the newly establish women justice board which will oversee effort to tackle this issue and ensure tailored approach to female offender what measure be be implement to provide support through community sentence and residential woman centre we be award million for the upcoming year to community organisation and local area that be already support woman in the community we be also employ option to increase the use of residential provision as an alternative to short custodial sentence that include engage with the judiciary to ensure that the option of community order with residential requirement be consider in appropriate case welcome the launch of the women justice board which be intend to reduce the number of woman in our prison cut reoffende and well support our child will the minister work with organisation from across the country include north wales women centre to ensure not only that their voice be at the heart of the work go on but that they have the resource and support need to support the most vulnerable in our society pay tribute to woman centre across the country such as that in north wales for the excellent contribution that their work make agree that short custodial sentence can be problematic they exacerbate woman underlie need without allow time for rehabilitation and they separate mother from child and mean that woman be more likely to reoffend that be why the women justice board be grateful to my hon friend for welcome it aim to increase the number of woman support in the community the board will also look at how we can well support mother with young child do the minister accept that allow biological man into woman prison increase the risk to female offender do he far accept that only biological woman should be house in woman prison the vast majority of transgender prisoner be in man prison we have continue the policy of the previous government but all policy be always under review across the uk we face the bizarre and worrying reality that common sense protection for woman be be dismiss for example in northern ireland motion to ensure that biologically male prisoner who identify as woman be hold in male prison have be oppose by many elect representative in the northern ireland assembly and it be an issue that extend across the uk what assurance we do want assurance can the minister give that woman safety be take seriously and that they be guarantee single sex space in prison and other setting free from biological male who identify as woman safe space for woman be crucial and no priority in everything we do the minister refer to keep under review the question of place biological man in woman prison will he speak to the justice minister in northern ireland and ensure that she review that policy only last week she be defend the very policy that put woman at risk from biological man who be claim the right to be retain in woman prison that be devolved matter though clearly we be happy to speak to the devolved government about any issue southport attack what assessment she have make of the potential implication for her policy of the lesson learn follow the southport attack be sure that the whole house will join in say that our thought today be with the victim of these horrific crime and their family last week we see measure of justice do but over number of year there be widespread state failure that mean that this attacker be not stop it be right that there will be an inquiry the ministry of justice will play its full part and will ensure that any lesson for we be learn when the tragedy of southport happen crucial detail about the case could not be reveal to ensure that the trial do not collapse and the vile perpetrator do not walk away as free man however some on social medium be play by different rule do the secretary of state think that our contempt rule be fit for the modern world my hon friend raise an important point the government would not say anything that would risk collapse this trial the medium follow the law and so do everyone in this house but the same be not true online as the prime minister have say this challenge clearly must be address the law commission be review contempt law we will look closely at that work and consider these issue in the round but the information release shortly before the trial do not collapse the case have it be release in august it might have have dampening effect on those unhelpful voice on social medium might it not as say in my previous answer it be clear that the fast pace of the online world have some significant challenge for our present arrangement around contempt law the government approach which be to do nothing that might risk collapse the trial be the right one hope that will have support across the house it would have be in no one interest to take any risk with the safety of the trial as have say the online space pose some challenge for our contempt law arrangement and the law commission be rightly look into that call the shadow secretary of state contempt of court law be guardrail that ensure fair trial do the justice secretary accept that as the independent reviewer of terrorism legislation have say by fail to provide basic information to the public that have be disclose in previous case information that would not prejudice trial the authority create vacuum in which misinformation spread that misinformation could itself have be prejudicial to the trial do she agree that in an age when most people consume their news through social medium say nothing be not cost free will she commit to review this issue now rather than wait for the law commission there will always be differ view among lawyer about what can and can not be say it be right that the government take their own position and that we do nothing that could risk collapse the trial agree with the shadow secretary of state that the online world pose significant challenge to our contempt law that be why that be already be look at as there be piece of work already under way do not want to pre empt where that could land the law commission have good track record of consider major law change because of the inquiry and the fast move nature of these thing will keep this area under close review myself sentencing attendance of offenders if she will bring forward legislative proposal to enable court to order the attendance of offender at sentencing hearing by fail to attend their sentencing hearing criminal add insult to injury and deny victim and their family vital part of see justice do iusb will be legislate to give judge the power to order attendance at sentencing hearing and will make it clear in the law that reasonable force can be use to make sure that happen the prime minister and meet cheryl korbel last week to discuss these proposal and we will ensure that the family of other victim be involve before the bill be put before the house thank the secretary of state for that positive response and thank she and the prime minister for meet and my constituent cheryl korbel the mother of olivia pratt korbel the nine year old who be tragically murder in cheryl be pleased that the government have commit to implement olivia law without delay can the minister ensure that cheryl be involve in the development of this law place victim and their family at the heart of the justice system pay tribute to my hon friend for the work she be do on behalf of her constituent be pleased to be able to discuss these matter with she she be absolutely right and it be crucial that we make progress in this area we have commit to introduce that legislation before the summer and will as promise last week consult olivia family and the family of other victim for whom non attendance at sentencing hearing have cause problem there be small number of people who through due process appear in court and be convict but who decline to come up to the court room for sentencing the secretary of state have indicate her intention to move on this do she agree that the government need to show very robust approach so that people who show disdain and contempt for the rule of law be show that there be no room for manoeuvre and that they must and will appear in court the hon member be right it be already expect that defendant will attend sentencing hearing but we know that some take the opportunity not to face the family of their victim which cause huge trauma to some of the family we will clarify and put on statutory foot the expectation of attendance at sentencing hearing along with sanction for deal with offender who still despite be compel to attend court even through the use of reasonable force seek to disrupt hearing prolific offenders what step her department be take to help tackle hyper prolific offender what step her department be take to help tackle hyper prolific offender the government have inherit situation where of offender account for of all offence we have also inherit an epidemic of shoplifting the kind of antisocial crime that blight community have commission david gauke to review how sentence could be reform to address prolific offending reduce reoffende cut crime and ultimately make our street safe believe in second chance and perhaps even more chance in some case but the excellent policy exchange report the wicked and the redeemable long term plan to fix criminal justice system in crisis find that hyper prolific offender those with more than previous conviction be send to prison on few than half of the occasion on which they be convict of subsequent indictable or either way offence give that those people commit such high number of crime which usually affect our least affluent constituent what consideration have the government give to the report recommendation particularly on introduce mandatory two year sentence for hyper prolific offender who be convict of subsequent indictable or either way offence the right hon member raise an important point about an issue that blight community across the country agree that we need specific strategy for deal with prolific offender of course different organisation use different definition of what count as prolific offender or hyper prolific offender and that be why have ask david gauke to look specifically at this cohort of offender in the independent sentencing review the revolving door of prison and other type of sentence for they be clearly not have an impact we must think about the intervention that will make the big difference to the large number of those offender so that we can cut crime and have few victim the lord chancellor rightly say that less than of criminal account for nearly half of crime understand that sentencing review be under way but any decision be for minister to make will the right hon lady please rule out here and now any possibility of allow career criminal to avoid prison even for short sentence the hon member will know that be not go to pre empt any of the finding of the sentencing review the point of have an independent review be to allow for look at all the issue in the round have make it clear that be particularly concerned about the people who she rightly term career criminal and be particularly keen to think about the intervention that could make the big difference so that we can reduce this blight on our community that be clear statement of intent from the government show how seriously we take prolific offending but the measure that we choose to take forward will be clear once the sentencing review have report call the shadow minister as the secretary of state mention the approach to manage hyper prolific offender be part of david gauke review which could consider for example the wide use of gps tag and home curfew but the department have be undertake its own assessment of the effectiveness of gps tag will the government commit to publish that review before or alongside the sentencing review so that we can properly judge the merit of any propose expansion as have seek to do throughout this process will ensure transparency in the government approach when it come to not just the emergency release datum but other information that underpin future policy choice do not quite hear yes but will take that as an encouraging commitment that the secretary of state will publish the gps tag review ahead of any sentencing review however be afraid that in minister discussion of these issue they risk lose sight of the fact that imprisonment also serve the important purpose of punish offender in the interest of justice importantly how will the government decide whether any of david gauke proposal that they be minded to accept sufficiently punish offender how will that judgment be make before any recommendation be accept have say on many occasion in this house that believe in punishment and in prison prison have core role to play in the punishment of offender however we must not run out of prison place we must balance the need to punish and imprison people with intervention that expand the use of punishment outside prison interruption the hon gentleman say build more from sedentary position we be we be move forward to solve the prison place deficit leave by his government at the last election this government will build prison but as he know we can not build our way out of the prison capacity crisis we must consider other measure as well but let be clear we will always seek to punish offender and prison will always have place this government will build more prison place than the previous one prison capacity what step her department be take to increase prison capacity what step her department be take to increase prison capacity we take immediate action to prevent the collapse of the prison system by implement we be build new prison place and have publish our year capacity strategy we have launch an independent sentencing review so that we never run out of prison place again welcome the government action to increase prison capacity but be worried about youth custody my local police force be particularly concerned that there be simply not enough space in the secure custodial estate many vulnerable young people be at risk of be exploit by organise criminal gang that be less to do with young offender institution and more to do with the lack of capacity in secure child home that capacity have fall since the number of ministry of justice contract space be now around only for the entire country which be appal how will the minister work with department for education to increase capacity and protect vulnerable young people and our resident we certainly do not wish to reduce capacity can confirm that we contract with local authority secure child home and place child there in we contract for bed and currently we contract for that correlate with decrease in the number of young people in custody mostly over the period when the conservatives be in government we do not currently intend to reduce overall capacity in the youth custody service estate which comprise young offender institution secure training centre secure school and sch bed however we be recommissione secure child home place and can not predetermine the outcome of that exercise but assure my hon friend that we will not run out of space december annual report on prison capacity state that of the prison place available be occupy and it estimate that by we will have prison capacity of around but the central estimate of the number of prisoner stand at what will this government do to ensure that everyone who commit crime worthy of prison be send to prison assure my hon friend that that will be the case people who commit crime worthy of prison will be send to prison as we have assure the house we have plan to build new prison place as set out in our year capacity strategy in six month we have add prison place it take year for the conservatives to do that we have also launch an independent sentencing review so that we never run out of place again take together these measure will ensure that the country do not have more prisoner than we have space for in our prison on building capacity armed force veteran concern and many in this chamber they often live with post traumatic stress disorder and have emotional memory and nightmare of what they have do in uniform for this country what extra can be do to well look after our veteran in prison they fight with demon every day we have to look after they the armed force covenant affect we all his majesty prison and probation service ensure that veteran issue be properly address with the individual concern to give they the proper support that they need support for domestic abuse survivors what step she be take to support survivor of domestic abuse and violence against woman through the criminal justice system this government be commit to support victim and survivor of violence against woman and girl these be abhorrent crime we be therefore fund the rape and sexual abuse support fund to the tune of million as well as fund independent domestic and sexual violence advocate we be also strengthen the power of the victims commissioner to improve accountability where those victim need be not be meet constituent of mine from somerset be seriously sexually assault in another county more than two year ago despite report the assault in she have be give court date in december she tell that the legal process involve both the court and the relevant police service have be more traumatising than the incident itself what well support can we offer woman who find themselves stick in these process for such length of time be terribly sorry to hear about this case we know that such case be not isolate which be why this government be bear down on the crown court backlog we be increase the number of crown court sit day and increase magistrate sentence power to free up capacity in the crown court so that we can get swifter justice for victim we be also invest in the victim transformation programme through the crown prosecution service to provide precisely the kind of support that would benefit the hon lady constituent keep she engage in the process and bring those trial date forward it have be reveal that just of rape and sexual offence report to lancashire police in the past year result in charge or summon what step will the ministry take to restore confidence in the criminal justice system for my constituent my hon friend will know that this government have landmark ambition to halve violence against woman and girl and the criminal justice system have an important part to play in that while set that priority whether it be for the cps or our police we want to drive charge decision and drive up the conviction rate provide swifter justice for victim be go to require once in generation reform to bring down the crown court backlog call the liberal democrat spokesperson in recent write parliamentary question ask the government how many domestic abuser there be in prison and what their reoffende rate be under the system this government inherit from the conservatives they say that it be not possible to robustly calculate the number that be shocking and be in part because there be no specific offence of domestic abuse in the law to properly reflect and recognise these crime my domestic abuse aggravated offences bill would correct that loophole when will the secretary of state honour the commitment she make on good morning britain to meet to discuss my bill and how we can well protect victim and survivor tackle domestic abuse be priority for this government the domestic abuse act set out broad statutory definition of domestic abuse which be improve our understanding of the wide range of behaviour that can constitute this abuse while not constitute stand alone offence domestic abuse be consider an aggravating factor routinely throughout our criminal justice system and rightly so that be the reason why that data be not collect and that be the position we will maintain prison conditions what step she be take to improve prison condition the right hon lady be right to raise this issue we inherit historic under investment in maintenance and rise prison population that be why we have already publish our year prison capacity strategy and have plan to invest million in prison and probation service maintenance in and up to million in rise as the co chair of the justice union parliamentary group the emergency extra money to tackle the squalid state of our prison be welcome but give the billion maintenance backlog the reality be that the extra money will not touch the side this show exactly why the privatisation of prison maintenance be fail model private contractor may win contract on low bid but billion come in as extra cost later do the minister seriously think that current prison maintenance provider offer good service and value for money to the taxpayer the right hon lady be right we inherit contract that be already well progress for good value and to move thing forward quickly we decide it be important to keep go with that process however can assure the house that we have an open mind regard private and public sector contract in the future the important thing be to get good value for money and get the job do katie allan be beautiful and bright young woman and would have be constituent of mine but for the fact that aged she find herself after youthful stupid mistake in polmont young offender institution where she die from suicide the fatal incident inquiry recently publish into her death and the death of william brown find that they both might be alive today be it not for catalogue of error by the scottish prison service the family of those who have lose child in such circumstance be campaign for crown immunity to be remove from prison across britain so that there be proper accountability and more young life be not lose will the minister meet the family to discuss that proposal thank my hon friend for his question he draw attention to deeply disturbing case be very happy to meet he and the family concern public confidence in the justice system what step she be take to increase public confidence in the justice system the last government give the public plenty of reason to lose confidence in the justice system include rise court backlog and prison on the edge of collapse we have already avert crisis in our prison and have raise crown court capacity to year high we be now embark on reform of our court and our prison the work of restore confidence in the justice system have start it will of course take some time jason hoganson be wrongly release under the government early release scheme last week he be convict of assault his ex partner just day after he be free under that botched scheme do the secretary of state agree that this shocking case and case like it continue to undermine the public trust and confidence in our justice system what undermine confidence in the justice system be run out of prison place which be the inheritance the conservative government leave for this government that be the mess that we be clean up the hon gentleman will also be aware that the previous government end of custody supervise licence scheme be also an early release scheme but without any of the measure on accountability and transparency or the wide set of exclusion that that we introduce with the scheme on friday meet my constituent hayley johns she have give permission to share her story in this place hayley be victim of domestic abuse and actual bodily harm perpetrate by an ex partner be absolutely shocked to hear her story her ex partner be convict for three year for his crime however he be be consider for release after serve just three month do the justice secretary agree that give the legacy of the previous government we need to redouble our effort and the effort of this government to improve confidence in the criminal justice system can please ask she to take personal interest in this case will happily look at the fact of the case some of those number do not sound like they should be possible but that could be down to specific factor relate to that case if my hon friend write to with the detail will make sure he have full response call the liberal democrat spokesperson confidence in the criminal justice system can be achieve only if support for victim and survivor be adequately fund but charity such as victim support whose service have personally benefit from have say that for they the hike in employer national insurance contribution amount to real term budget cut of victim need more support not less will the secretary of state fight to reverse that damaging cut and help restore victim confidence in the criminal justice system the hon gentleman will be aware of the difficult fiscal inheritance for this government and that we have have to make some difficult choice we receive good settlement from the treasury at the last budget but it be not without its challenge give the high demand in our system he will know that we have protect funding for victim of violence against woman and girl include rape and sexual offence we have seek to protect the most vulnerable victim when make decision on our victim funding package grooming gangs sentence what step her department be take to ensure that people convict of charge relate to groom gang receive adequate sentence the right hon member raise very important point on these heinous gang and the crime that they commit the recommendation make by alexis jay in her independent inquiry on child sexual abuse be ignore for far too long the government be work at pace to respond to they we will also legislate to make groom an aggravate factor in the sentencing of child sexual offence ensure that the punishment fit these horrific crime as in bradford last week where more of the groom gangster largely of pakistani origin who rap white girl there and elsewhere be sentence the paucity of the home secretary audit whereby authority mark their own homework be make clear will the justice secretary agree to wide range review of these matter with statutory power surely those whose life have be ruin and those whose life may yet be ruin deserve more than the weak reticence of people with power who refuse to face the fact hope that the right hon gentleman and have share objective in make it clear that there be desire in all part of the house to ensure that we face the full fact and that the victim of these heinous crime receive the justice they deserve be sorry to hear that there be concern in bradford about the audit order by the home secretary will ensure that they be pass on to the home secretary because as the right hon gentleman will know these matter fall directly within the purview of the home department youth justice system what assessment she have make of the effectiveness of the youth justice system in prevent reoffende the number of child in custody have fall significantly over the last decade but those who be detain be now more complex and violent cohort our turnaround programme provide fund that enable youth offend team to intervene early to address child offending only of child who complete such intervention receive conviction in the first year of the programme but we be continue to take stock of what more can be do last week tragically year old leo ross be stab to death in birmingham as he be return home from school his year old killer have be arrest several time for violent offence in the month run up to the killing can the minister tell what the government be do to reform the youth justice system to address and prevent the knife crime among our young people that be result in terrible tragedy like the one we see last week be deeply sadden by this tragic crime and my thought and be sure those of everyone else go to the family of leo ross such horrific event underline just how important it be to deliver our manifesto commitment to ensure that every young person catch in possession of knife be refer to youth offend team and that appropriate action be take we be also pilot new more robust form of community punishment for child involve mandatory gps monitoring and intensive supervision deputyship applications what step she be take to reduce processing time for deputyship application by the court of protection application for deputyship to the court of protection play vital role when people need to be able to make decision for love one who lack capacity it be important to support those people through prompt and efficient process his majesty courts and tribunals service have be implement an improvement plan drive down waiting time by recruit more staff enhance judicial capacity digitise application form and implement new case management system one of my constituent have contact to ask why he have be wait nine long month for decision from the court of protection on his deputyship application he need to secure the deputyship in order to make crucial decision for vulnerable love one another constituent in similar position wait for two month without any acknowledgement that his application be be look into their experience be not unique solicitor and judge alike acknowledge the systemic delay plague the system do the minister agree that such long delay in processing time be unacceptable and what do she think be acceptable agree with the hon lady that such delay be not acceptable and be sorry to hear of the distress that this will have cause it be right that we continue to invest in our improvement plan and continue to see progress with digitisation digitise the application form be first step but we want to see end to end digitisation which we know be result in decent progress and have speed up those time over recent month there be more to do and we shall do it violence against women and girl what step her department be take through the criminal justice system to help tackle violence against woman and girl as have say the government be commit to halve violence against woman and girl within decade it be an important ambition and the criminal justice system have vital role to play in it in november we launch pilot promote domestic abuse protection order in select area and we have ambition to roll that out far we will also introduce independent legal adviser for adult rape victim ensure that victim have the legal support that they need and deserve last week the domestic abuse commissioner find that just of report domestic abuse result in conviction do the minister share my concern that lengthy investigation into non crime hate incident be potentially divert vital resource from the criminal justice system and from prosecute actual violence against woman and girl the hon member be right to remark on the low charging and conviction rate for domestic abuse we have an ambition to drive those up that be why we be put more funding and more prioritisation into this area and call on our agency whether it be the police or the crown prosecution service to really focus on it because right now we be not do enough for woman and girl the tragic reality for many woman who suffer domestic abuse and then have to go through family court proceeding on top of it be that the presumption of parental contact provide another opportunity for perpetrator of domestic abuse to prolong it the government be rightly review this will ministers ensure that we make the most of this opportunity to well protect woman who suffer domestic abuse through the family court system my hon friend be right to make that point our family court should never become site of retraumatisation for victim of domestic abuse we be review the presumption and when we be ready we will publish the finding and our policy response to that review topical questions if she will make statement on her departmental responsibility this government inherit record and rise crown court backlog and prison on the point of collapse serve as breeding ground for crime that create well criminal not well citizen the work of restore safe street in this country will be long and hard but we be take immediate action since the last justice oral we have increase the number of sit day in the crown court by this financial year and boost criminal legal aid by up to million year to get case move through the court more quickly we have publish year prison capacity strategy set out plan to build new prison place to ensure we always have the space to lock up dangerous criminal we launch the women justice board with one clear goal to send few woman to prison we be do what it take to deliver swifter justice for victim and punishment that cut crime minister have talk quite bit today about expand power for magistrate court could the secretary of state tell what additional funding be be make available and what training there will be for magistrate to assist they with this expand role the change in relation to magistrate court sentencing power be make by the previous government due to prison capacity issue and they be work well we have restore those same power so do not think those issue around training be necessarily engaged however we will ensure that legal adviser and the full package of measure that magistrate need to fulfil their obligation be in place what support have the ministry of justice put in place for those serve indeterminate sentence for public protection especially where they have additional need it be right that ipp sentence be abolish last week host roundtable for mp to discuss their concern about ipp sentence and share the work the department be do the prisons minister in the other place host similar roundtable for peer we be determined to make further progress towards safe and sustainable release for those serve ipp sentence while recognise that at all time public protection be paramount call the shadow secretary of state two week ago three groom gang member be sentence at bradford crown court for the most appalling rape of child but they receive only six seven and nine year sentence respectively six year out on licence in four for the rape of child do the secretary of state agree that those sentence be disgracefully short and will she commit to use the sentencing review to mandate full life sentence for these evil people if she will she will have our support we have share objective in make sure that these evil individual feel the full force of the law will not comment on individual sentencing decision and the shadow lord chancellor might wish to reflect on that decision it be not appropriate to do so give our collective commitment to the independence of the judiciary however as say in response to early question we will legislate to make groom an aggravating factor and this government will make sure that victim get the justice they deserve have write to the attorney general ask he to review those sentence as potentially unduly lenient two of the man who be sentence at bradford crown court for groom gang offence be absent they be think to have abscond abroad can the justice secretary confirm how many groom gang defendant the government be currently pursue overseas and what effort be be make by the government with in this case the pakistani authority use every lever of the british state to locate these evil man and get justice for the victim will happily write to the right hon gentleman with detail on the specific case that he raise he be right to say that we have international agreement and arrangement with other jurisdiction to ensure that offender can be bring back to face justice in this country be sure that those arrangement be be apply appropriately but will make sure that he get full answer on the case that he have raise today we learn not only that yevgeny prigozhin sanctioned warlord use frozen fund to make legal threat to silence british journalist but that the enabler of this textbook example of lawfare have since go unpunished with the solicitors regulation authority ruling that prigozhin lawyer break no rule that inaction in the face of such clear cut wrongdoing show that our current framework be inadequate can the minister outline what step the government be take to create tough deterrent against harmful lawfare tactic particularly when they be deploy by insidious individual like prigozhin thank my hon friend for his question and for the campaigning work that he be do in this area journalism be the lifeblood of democracy and strategic lawsuit against public participation represent an abuse of the legal system they be use by those with deep pocket to harass and silence journalism such behaviour be intolerable my focus and the focus of this government will be on the implementation of the economic crime and corporate transparency act which introduce an early dismissal mechanism and cost protection for slapp defendant last september the secretary of state confirm that foreign national offender block up our jail be be remove and deport will she update the house on how many have be remove and deport and do she agree that the fast way to free up capacity in our prison be to remove the vast majority of they agree that we need to do everything we can to remove foreign national offender from our prison between july and january foreign national offender be return increase on the same period in the previous year and we be currently on track to remove more foreign national offender this year than at any time in recent year humanist marriage have be legal in scotland for year but continue to wait to be legalise in england and wales the law commission make recommendation two year ago on clarify the law but when ask to set out timetable for action the minister in the other place could only respond in the fullness of time official report house of lords december vol can the minister set out the timetable or alternatively say when the government will make an order to end the long wait for humanist marriage understand that humanist have be campaign for legally bind humanist wedding the government be commit to strengthen the right and protection available particularly for woman in cohabit couple we will look at the law commission work and publish our response in due course gamble with life be charity that support family who have be bereave by gambling relate suicide jo from cullompton lose her son daniel to gamble suicide and speak powerfully about it what be the minister do to ensure that accurate datum be record for each death link to gambling may express how sorry be to hear of the case of the hon gentleman constituent be happy to write to he he ask quite specific question but it be important that we provide support to all sort of victim that be why we have the victim code which strengthen the power of the victims commissioner but will write to the hon gentleman on that specific matter last week the court of appeal overturn first instance decision regard the anonymity of judge who preside over the tragic sara sharif case in the family court do not expect the minister to comment on individual case and it be certainly not about that individual judge but will the government use this opportunity to reaffirm our commitment to open justice and press freedom as my hon friend rightly say can not comment on that specific case but we adhere to the principle of open justice and transparency in our legal system that be why we have the publication of sentencing remark and transcript and the broadcasting of many of our hearing so that the public can see exactly how justice in this country be administer we know that the attorney general have recuse himself from advise the government but he will not tell we what for and he still refuse to be transparent about potential payment by former client do the secretary of state for justice really not believe that the public have right to know the hon lady should know there be robust process in place in government to manage conflict of interest which be in place under the previous administration as well but this be not something that any government minister will be give running commentary on call the chair of the select committee andy slaughter we have just witness the chair of the criminal cases review commission be prise out of her job six month after the secretary of state describe she as unable to fulfil her duty when will new chair be appoint and will this be accompany by wide review of the ccrc to restore confidence in that damage organisation my hon friend be absolutely right to say that we need to restore confidence in the ccrc that be why we be take the decision not only to appoint an interim chair to steady the ship but more importantly to implement the recommendation of the henley review so that we can restore confidence in this important institution particularly in the light of the appalling miscarriage of justice in the case of andrew malkinson with an ever increase prison population and monumental delay be experience in the court and throughout the justice system what step be the secretary of state take to address the significant delay that arise from the period of time require to download and analyse digital material the hon gentleman raise an important point we believe that much more can be achieve through the increase use of ai and other digital technology to speed up some of the paper process that create delay across the criminal justice system as chair of the criminal justice board have ask for cross system criminal justice response on this and will update the house in due course no doubt we all agree that preventable death should be prevent and tragedy like hillsborough and grenfell must not be repeat because we fail to make change so what consideration have the secretary of state give to create national oversight mechanism to ensure that lesson be learn from every state relate death the government will shortly be publish the bill that campaigner refer to as the hillsborough law which will reflect issue relate to the duty of candour which this government be commit to and know that campaigner be make representation to the home office on the national oversight mechanism that it be currently consider can the secretary of state explain to the house in what circumstance the police and the crown prosecution service be allow to deny access to evidence after trial have conclude to defence lawyer who be seek to appeal as have happen in the lucy letby case and believe in other the right hon gentleman will appreciate that as justice secretary be not able to interfere in any independent decision make by the police or the crown prosecution service but he have make his point and will ensure that it be deal with by the appropriate individual either the home secretary or the head of the cps there be serious question about the transparency of the police the cps and the government in the day and week follow the southport attack in write answer to the government have refuse to provide the date when the prime minister be tell that rudakubana possess ricin and an al qaeda training manual can the justice secretary tell why the prime minister have respond to the other question that have be raise the appropriate information be make available at the appropriate time to either the prime minister or the home secretary it be right that the government do not give any commentary that could have collapse the trial on the specific charge relate to ricin that decision require law officer approval which be seek and immediately give know that the justice secretary be aware of the tragic case of my constituent sara sharif will she consider reform family court and end the presumption in favour of parental contact despite the fact that there be safeguard concern that case of that little girl sara sharif be one of the most tragic of recent time and know that that view be share right across the house that be why safeguarding review be under way to look at all the agency that be involve and should have be protect that little girl from those who end up kill she we be look at the presumption there be review and we will consider the finding of that review and publish our response in due course my constituent who be british citizen and the mother of two young child face the prospect of be force to return to poland to accompany those child under the hague convention on the civil aspect of international child abduction have flee escalate domestic abuse if she do her inability to speak the language or work will leave she entirely dependent on her abuser even though he be bar from contact she will the minister work with to ensure that domestic abuse be explicitly recognise as valid defence against return order of this type thank the hon lady for her question and invite she to write to about that specific case which sound like it throw up very difficult set of factual circumstance that would like the opportunity to consider extremism review urgent question to ask the secretary of state for the home department if she will make statement on the government extremism review report on today in our manifesto the government set out our commitment to redouble effort to counter extremism include online to stop people be radicalise and draw towards hateful ideology number of strand of activity have be establish to progress this work which among other thing have lead to the appointment of an interim prevent commissioner lord anderson to drive improvement we have publish plan to introduce youth diversion order to tackle young people at risk of terrorism many document produce across government as part of commission work be not implement and do not constitute government policy this work do not recommend an expansion in the definition of extremism and there be not and have never be any plan to do so to be clear the leak document be not current or new government policy as we have say repeatedly islamist extremism follow by far right extremism be the big threat we face last week the home secretary set out our plan to carry out an end to end review of prevent threshold on islamist extremism because we be concerned that the number of referral be too low ideology particularly islamist extremism follow by far right extremism continue to be at the heart of our approach to counter extremism and terrorism but as the horrific southport attack show we also need more action on those draw towards mixed ideology and violence obsess young people as the home secretary set out in the house last week there have be troubling rise in the number of case involve teenager draw into extremism include islamist extremism far right extremism mixed and confused ideology and obsession with violence this include threefold increase in investigate for involvement in terrorism some people be refer to prevent last year for concern relate to school massacre our five eyes counter terror partner have also warn about the grow radicalisation of teenager and young people we will continue to drive work to counter the most significant extremist threat in the week and month ahead as the home secretary and the prime minister have already set out call the shadow home secretary yesterday evening policy exchange put into the public domain the home secretary review into extremism or at least version of it it contain some deeply concern proposal that would like the minister to directly address the report apparently say that the definition of extremism for the purpose of prevent and other programme could be extend to include the spreading of misinformation the so call online manosphere and misogyny first do the minister agree with prevent reviewer william shawcross that we need to focus the attention of prevent and counter terrorism police on those with extremist ideology and not risk dilute attention with these much wide issue ninety four per cent of terrorism cause death since be cause by islamist terrorism do the minister agree that combat islamist terrorism be more important than police the manosphere the wide issue reference such as violence against woman and girl and more general violence obsession be of course serious however they be well deal with by the police the criminal justice system social service or mental health service which have the power to section people that pose risk secondly will the minister commit to retain the change to non crime hate incident make by the last government police should not be look into matter or record personal datum where there be no imminent risk of criminality to do so would waste police time and infringe freedom of speech any move away from that will enable the thought police to stop anyone tell uncomfortable truth that leave wing lawyer do not like finally the report the home secretary commission repeat the prime minister previous smear that campaign against rape gang which we now know consist of pakistani heritage perpetrator be far right the report also say that comment on element of police policy be extremist and far right that be nonsense campaign against rape gang be not extremist or far right and comment on policing whether we agree or not with the comment be simply the exercise of free speech will the minister categorically disown those remark which be contain in the home secretary report let gently remind the shadow home secretary that his remark refer to leak report which could not have be clear do not and will not represent government policy the work as understand it because it be not entirely clear which version of the report be leak do not recommend an expansion in the definition of extremism and as say to the house early there be not nor will there be any plan to do so the shadow home secretary mention william shawcross again will gently remind he that this government have implement all but one of the recommendation in the shawcross review he also ask about non hate crime incident again the home secretary have be very clear about that consistent and common sense approach must be take with regard to non hate crime incident the government have again also be crystal clear that our top priority for police be to deliver on the safe street mission rebuild neighbourhood policing restore public confidence and make progress on the ambition to halve knife crime and violence against woman and girl must be careful here mr speaker because think you be right to allow this urgent question however can my hon friend the minister explain just exactly why we be here it seem to be think can answer that it be because have decide we do not need to pursue it any far the shadow home secretary seem to have come here to ask question about document that be not government policy and to stand there make indignant statement about issue that be not government policy either do my hon friend not think that we should be take much more level head approach to this issue than that which have be display by the conservative party be grateful to my hon friend for his observation which entirely agree with this government and ministers be always happy to come to this place to discuss and debate government policy the leak report be not government policy call the liberal democrat spokesperson there be no place for extremism or hatred of any form in our society it be right that the government work with community to stamp that out not least after the previous conservative government seem to seek out opportunity to sow more and more seed of division from what we have hear about the extremism review report it do not bring the right answer forward and risk be counterproductive now it be up to the government to develop counter extremism strategy that be strong effective and alive to the modern challenge face our society that include address an increasingly complex online world and its role in incite extremism would welcome more detail from the minister on how the government will do this to be effective the work must also properly engage community will the minister set out how community will be consult on any upcoming counter extremism strategy be grateful to the hon member for her entirely sensible and reasonable question she be absolutely right to say that there be no place for extremism in our society this government will work across party across government and use all available lever to ensure that we have the right resource in the right place to tackle what be an increasingly challenging threat she be right that an important element of that be the work that we need to do and be do with regard to the online space she will be aware that the online safety act will come into force soon and we have consistently say that we will look very closely at how effective that will be and that where we need to make change we will of course do so as she can imagine the conversation continue with the social medium company we expect they to do the right thing and where there be illegal content online to remove it at pace the hon member be also right to stress the importance of work with community that be why counter extremism work be do properly across government with the ministry of housing communities and local government as key partner thank the minister for his unambiguous statement have feeling that he be go to say something along those line because read similar unambiguous statement from the home office in this morning newspaper therefore do not understand how the shadow home secretary have struggle to follow the government position do the minister agree that the correct way to deal with extremism be to focus on what drive it as we hear in the house last week in relation to the southport attack weaponry include knife have devastating effect across the country what step be the home office take to restrict access to knife and weaponry for those with extreme view my hon friend raise an important matter over the weekend the home secretary announce strict age verification check and ban on doorstep drop to protect people from knife crime these measure be set to be include in the crime and policing bill which be expect to be introduce to parliament by the spring under these new rule two step system will be mandate for all retailer sell knife online require customer to submit photo id at the point of sale and again on delivery delivery company will only be able to deliver bladed article to the person who purchase it and it will also be illegal to leave package contain bladed weapon on doorstep when no one be in to receive it in the early year of margaret thatcher government lord scarman be commission to write report on what be they do not use this phrase at the time concern among the black community about two tier policing in response to those concern the police listen change their procedure and engage in consultative work with those community so why be it that when community complain about two tier policing under this government they be brand far right extremist the right hon gentleman will have work throughout his time with our police force not just as former home secretary in that great office of state but elsewhere and very much hope that he share the admiration and respect answer the question be answer the question hope that the right hon gentleman share the admiration and respect that we on these benches have for the incredibly difficult and challenging work that the police do have to say that those who seek to progress narrative of two tier policing do no favour to our police force all they seek to do be make it more difficult for those extraordinary man and woman who step forward to serve in our police force to do very important job in all the commentary overnight on this leak advice be strike by one comment from the shadow justice secretary the right hon member for newark robert jenrick that be report on gb news he say of course violence against woman and girl and some of the other issue raise in this report warrant attention by the police warrant attention be it any wonder that sexual violence be allow to become endemic under the previous government and that the good previous home office minister could say be that it warrant attention the shadow justice secretary be home office minister for considerable period of time it might be worthwhile if he reflect on the record of his government while he be minister so this report that have just be leak be commission by the home secretary after the southport horror last july the truth be that it have come out and all the recommendation have basically be immediately write off by the home secretary do that not confirm that the people in her department be completely out of touch with her wish and those of the british people not at all the hon member be simply not correct this work be be progress before the dreadful incident in southport be sure and certainly hope that he will appreciate that secretaries of state will routinely commission advice from civil servant some of the recommendation of that advice will be accept and agree some will not but it be routine practice in government to ask civil servant to look very closely at particular issue ultimately it be for ministers to decide and ministers will decide as interesting as it sound have no idea what manosphere be as far as be concern the only real question that the security minister need to answer be what action the government be take to ensure this kind of disgraceful politically motivate leak to former tory adviser can not happen again especially on issue of national security we proudly have an impartial civil service so will he ask the cabinet secretary to order an immediate leak inquiry and put on gardening leave those tory adviser and civil servant who be still work in downing street and those who be regard as close associate of andrew gilligan be grateful to my hon friend for his helpful point it be standard procedure in circumstance such as these that the cabinet secretary order leak inquiry and that would be the right way to proceed under these circumstance in keighley we have see how label legitimate concern around groom gang as far right have distort conversation silence victim and inadvertently give space to bad faith actor it be therefore incredibly concern to see this report write by home office official use similar language call groom gang an alleged problem and once again frame this issue through the lens of the far right rather than the eye of victim do the minister agree with the language use in the report around groom gang if not how can he or the home secretary have faith in the home office official the hon member have be consistent in raise his concern in this particular area hope he will understand that be clear early that many document be produce across government as part of commission work that be not implement and that do not constitute government policy to be absolutely clear with he this be leak document but the work do not recommend an expansion in the extremism definition these be not government plan this be not government policy if the conservative now consider it okay for public servant to leak document relate to national security hope they will not object if we see leak on matter relate to their time in charge such as the risk arise from russian donor to the tory party and to our great country whatever happen to british value do the security minister agree order mr shelbrooke your voice have continue even though do see as much of you these day thank you mr speaker be not surprised conservative members be wind up by that do the security minister agree that at least one party in this house need to behave within our value when it come to security and that security leak be wrong all leak be wrong but let take this opportunity to say that be actually very proud of the civil servant in the home office who work extremely hard day in day out to keep our country safe from diverse range of threat number of conservative members here have work in the home office and very much hope that they share my view that we should be extremely grateful to those civil servant who work around the clock to keep our country safe and be grateful for their effort the horrendous event in southport show that people who do not fit the profile of islamist or far right extremism can still present serious risk do the minister agree that there be real danger in the promotion of misogyny and opposition to feminism online and that to combat the scourge of violence against woman and girl which see one woman murder almost every three day in the uk the government must take misogyny seriously as form of extremism be grateful to the hon lady she make an incredibly important point and hopefully she will know and understand how seriously this government take those issue we make an ambitious manifesto commitment to halve violence against woman and girl over year that be something that as ministers in the home office with the home secretary and the safeguarding minister my hon friend the member for birmingham yardley jess phillips we be work at pace to address we take these matter very seriously and she be absolutely right to identify the particular challenge that exist online the safeguarding minister will have more to say about this in due course be grateful to the security minister for his word today he have successfully expose the report about the leak as the nonsense they be but there be serious issue here include around how we respond to the rise level of youth violence and extremism and the increase availability of online material that fuel that obsession with violence and death will he tell we how the intelligence service be approach this challenge and what more the government can do to stop young people disappear into this dangerous abyss my hon friend raise an important point and the prime minister and the home secretary have both recently refer to this include during their statement on february she be right that there have be troubling rise in the number of case involve youth man boy and teenager who be be draw into extremism as say to the house early that include range of different area include islamist and far right extremism but also there be particularly concern rise in those draw into what be refer to as mixed and confused ideology and those young man and boy who have an obsession with violence this threat be not unique to the united kingdom it be be experience internationally but assure she that the intelligence service and our law enforcement partner be work with government at pace along with our international partner to look at what more we can do in this particular area may first echo the minister point that we should be grateful to those civil servant who be work night and day to protect we from terrorist threat suppose we should also be grateful to the right hon gentleman for denounce the document which certainly emanate from his department without make any personal criticism of those civil servant but do that document not demonstrate that large body of opinion have completely lose its way on how we deal with extremism and terrorist threat urge he to encourage the department to return to what prevent be intend to achieve and not get distract by all this political correctness give that most of the country have no idea what non hate crime incident be we need to return to proper language that people understand or the government themselves will be drive people disillusion and despair about these matter be grateful to the hon gentleman as always for his observation and for his point about civil servant he talk about political correctness have serve together in the house over many year hope he know the home secretary and well fundamentally this must be about the threat we will leave no stone unturned to ensure that we have the appropriate level of resource in the right place at the right time so that the ever evolve and complex nature of the threat we face both in the united kingdom and abroad be appropriately address by our law enforcement agency give the hon gentleman categorical assurance that we will continue to work around the clock to ensure that we protect the public thank the security minister for clarify the timeline of when this report be commission we should remember that since it be commission we have see the brutal sadistic murder in southport and the riot that come after they clearly we be live in time of rise and worrying extremism which should concern member on all side of this house do the security minister therefore agree that member on all side of this house should be work together to deal with extremism rather than play political game my hon friend make an important point hope the house know that it be always my default setting if you want to put it that way to try to work collaboratively with member across this house give my hon friend and the house an absolute assurance of the seriousness with which we take these matter think member will understand that it be right to commission civil servant to look very carefully at the profound nature of the threat that we face and to bring forward policy suggestion and solution for how we as government be well place to address they that be what be happen but this government will always do the right thing to ensure that we protect the public we have to tread very carefully when we enter into this territory the leaking of this report have already raise alarm bell with number of different group and have give the right another opportunity to spread division and further disinformation what reassurance can the minister give campaign group environmentalist and those who have take up campaign that they will not be include when he finally bring forward his plan in the future be happy to give the hon gentleman an assurance that this government will always approach these matter in level headed and consensual way it be the case that previous government seek to use these issue as political football indicate dissent it be the case that previous government be on occasion motivate as much by desire to score political point that will never be the approach of this government we be motivate only by desire to protect the public echo the concern raise by my hon friend the member for edinburgh east and musselburgh chris murray just this weekend in my own constituency we have an incident in our community with young people and knife although can not comment on that particular incident be extremely concerned about the availability of knife particularly to our young people do the minister agree that the sale of knife be too easy particularly online and can he tell and my constituent what the government be do to restrict that availability and the fear it spread in our community the government share my hon friend concern about the availability of knife online that be why as say to another hon member moment ago just this weekend the home secretary announce strict age verification check and ban on doorstep drop in order to well protect people from knife crime we will do everything that we possibly can work with online retailer and the police to ensure that the availability of knife be very significantly reduce in order to protect the public the repudiation of the content of this report be step back from thought crime but the danger remain of two step towards it be it not outrageous when individual be harass by the police when they have not break the law the right hon gentleman be right in the sense that of course the police should and will be guide by the law as an experienced member be sure he will have work very closely with the police over many year my experience of work closely with the police be that they make the right judgment for the right reason but where there be issue that require further attention the government will of course look at those matter it seem that advice to ministers on national security issue have be leak to former tory special adviser and as result of that leak the security minister have be summon to the chamber to answer question even though the leak do not represent government policy and the minister have make it clear that the advice have be reject do he agree that this set dangerous precedent and may encourage more disgruntled individual to commit politically motivated leak and that it show that his majesty official opposition be sadly sink into the mire of populism which can only undermine our national security and indeed our democracy in the future as hope have make crystal clear be always happy to come to this house to debate and discuss matter relate to national security will do that whenever the house wish to do so but on this particular occasion as think have also be crystal clear about this leak be about something that do not represent government policy there be no place for extremism in our society or country from anyone prevent unfairly associate certain ethnic minority and religious group with extremism and the programme vague definition of extremism have lead to inconsistent implementation with concern about overreach what step be the government take to address the discrimination and failing in the prevent programme and make it impartial and effective to prevent extremism and violence across all of society the hon member be right to say that there be no place for extremism in this country of course that be the case but do not agree with his characterisation of the prevent programme that programme consist of some extremely dedicated and hard work public servant but the hon member will know that the home secretary have announce the appointment of an interim prevent commissioner lord anderson he will be look very closely at how the prevent programme work and how it can be make to work more effectively in the future when tackle extremism whether violent or non violent be the security minister satisfy that the current division of labour between counter terrorism policing and the security service be understand well enough by those two organisation and be deliver and work well be always very grateful to the right hon member he speak with real experience and authority on these matter and he raise an important and reasonable question yes be happy to give he that assurance work incredibly closely with both counter terrorism police and operational partner on daily basis of course we look at these thing very closely and keep they under review and if we think that we need to change the balance in any particular area we will not hesitate to do so if the security minister think that there be not two tier policing in this country then quite frankly he need to get out more this report state that anybody who call out two tier policing be far right extremist and that grooming and rape gang be an alleged problem do the minister agree the point be seek to make early which be happy to reiterate to the hon member be about the importance that we on the labour benches attach to support the police we think that the police do an incredibly difficult job and while the hon member might think that need to get out bit more perhaps he might consider spend bit of time with police officer on the beat in his constituency and in his area if he be to do so be quite confident that he would see that they be exceptional people do difficult work under difficult circumstance there be real risk that seek to progress this narrative undermine the important work of the police it be good to see the minister at the dispatch box to distance himself from the conclusion of report commission by his department but report do not leak themselves why do he think that whoever leak this do not agree with he that there be nothing to see here ultimately that be matter for the leaker but as have say it be standard procedure in circumstance such as this for the cabinet office to initiate leak inquiry think that would be the right course of action under these circumstance so if be the leaker would not be too comfortable at the moment in draw up policy the minister need to consult with representative of all community particularly those suffer the bad attack by the far right in britain so can he assure we that he will be meet the muslim council of britain and other muslim organisation and that the policy of non co operation with the mcb have be bring to an end despite statement by his office that there be no plan to do so the right hon gentleman be right that the government have responsibility to consult with all community of course that work be share across government which be why we work very closely with other departments not least the ministry of housing communities and local government which be progress its own bit of work on all this on his specific point about liaison there be not change to the government policy with regard to that can the minister explain why the review appear to focus on the symptom of extremism rather than its underlie root cause can he assure the house that that mindset be not direct policy in the home office can assure the hon member that the mindset that direct policy in the home office be what the home secretary and think be in our national interest the home secretary and will use every tool and every lever at our disposal to ensure we keep the public safe that be what we get out of bed every morning to do and that be what we will continue to do trust the minister will agree that terrorism in all its form be always deserve only of punishment and repudiation never of glorification particularly by political leader do he therefore agree that it be beyond reprehensible that the first minister of northern ireland michelle continue to attend ira celebration of the action of ira terrorist just before christmas she lay wreath and speak at the commemoration for three ira terrorist who blow themselves up with their own bomb what message do that send on extremism to future generation hope the hon and learn member will understand that do not think that it would be appropriate for to delve into matter in northern ireland in the context of this response but his remark at the beginning of his question about there never be an excuse or justification for terrorism be point of consensus around which we can all unite the security minister recently tell that it remain government policy not to engage with the muslim council of britain last week the minister for social security and disability attend the mcb annual leadership dinner do that minister breach government policy or be engagement with the mcb now tolerate after all the hon member ask question previously at home office oral specifically in the context of engagement by the home secretary and her ministers answer the question the shadow home secretary be chuntere from sedentary position but be literally show the hansard transcript before this urgent question interruption if he will allow will respond to the question the hon member ask previously about engagement with the home secretary and home office ministers clearly can not account from the dispatch box for other ministers activity however be happy to look at the circumstance he have raise be happy to confirm to he that government policy have not change and if there be specific point need to come back to he on be very happy to do so extreme misogyny associate with far right ideology be major factor in extremism it should be deal with to counteract the one woman kill every three day in this country and to ensure that the horrendous southport killing the five killing by jake davison in plymouth and the massacre in christchurch new zealand do not happen again no one want violence ideological or political do the minister agree that our obsession with focus solely on islamism have leave repeat government blindside to real threat face we from elsewhere the hon member be right to say that extreme misogyny be frankly disgusting blight on our country that be why this government make manifesto commitment to halve the level of violence against woman and girl it be an ambitious commitment that have not be make previously as tell the house early the home secretary and the safeguarding minister be work at pace to seek to address these issue it be big priority for the government and we intend to make good on the commitment we have make thank the minister for his answer and in particular welcome his commitment to support the police which he have mention few time have great concern that the revival of non crime hate incident will mean more work for our overstretched police force and that it will mean get involve in war on offensive word rather than the war on drug the war on terrorism or the war on violence against woman and child will the revival of non crime hate incident come with substantial increase in police funding and if so where will that come from be grateful to the hon member as ever and be very grateful for the support that he have provide to the police over many year let seek to reassure he because the home secretary have be clear that consistent and common sense approach must be take to non crime hate incident the government have be crystal clear that our top priority for policing be deliver on our safe street mission airport expansion urgent question to ask the secretary of state for transport if she will make statement on government policy on airport expansion know that the hon member feel passionately about the issue of airport expansion but would like to make it clear that the press story that have generate this urgent question be speculative and can not comment on their but we do have world class aviation sector in the uk the government be commit to secure the long term future of the aviation sector and we recognise the benefit of the connectivity it create between the uk and the rest of the world it be sector that be incredibly proud of in the air transport and aerospace sector directly provide around job in the uk of which just under be in aerospace in the air transport and aerospace sector directly contribute around billion to gross domestic product of which around billion be from the air transport sector and around billion be from aerospace we have be clear that any airport expansion proposal would need to demonstrate that they contribute to economic growth be compatible with the uk legally bind climate change commitment and meet strict environmental standard on airport quality and noise pollution there be currently no live development consent order application for third runway at heathrow airport and it be for scheme promoter to decide how it take forward any development consent order application for that runway the government would carefully consider any development consent order application for the third runway at heathrow in line with relevant planning process the secretary of state be currently consider advice on luton airport and gatwick airport expansion as these be live application can not comment on they far today understand the concern of many member of the house about how airport expansion may be compatible with our climate change target would like to assure they that the government have commit to deliver green transport through sustainable aviation fuel and airspace modernisation this will help meet the uk net zero target and it support the government mission to make britain clean energy superpower airport expansion will need to be consider carefully alongside these commitment be grateful to you mr speaker for grant this urgent question and thank the minister for his response it be vital that parliament be not sideline when the government form new policy especially policy that could wreck our climate ambition do the minister understand that expand london airport and build third runway at heathrow would be vastly irresponsible in the midst of approach climate breakdown and would literally be fly in the face of the climate change committee advice how can ministers even be consider that when be the year that we go over warming the limit that we commit to not break in the paris climate agreement how can minister see catastrophic wildfire in california deadly flood in spain last year and devastating flood this year in the uk and still pursue wrong policy yesterday the secretary of state for energy security and net zero tell the environmental audit committee that any aviation expansion must be justify within carbon budget can the minister explain why we be hear trail announcement of multiple airport expansion exactly in the month before new advice from the climate change committee be deliver the committee could not have be clear in previous report that without framework to manage aviation demand we should not expand airport have he see research from the new economics foundation estimate that approve airport expansion plan for heathrow gatwick and luton airport alone will serve to cancel out the carbon saving of the government clean power action plan the government argument that have see appear to rest on the idea that there be new technology ready to go that will cut carbon emission and allow large airport expansion in reality do the minister accept that such innovation many of which be still not ready for commercial use can not be rely upon will he act in line with the science and our climate commitment do the responsible thing and rule out reckless airport expansion policy there be always trade off to be have if application come forward between noise carbon and grow our economy we recognise that heathrow have operate at over capacity for most of the past two decade which have present limited opportunity for growth in route network and passenger number we live in an interconnected world where people want to visit their family member and do business across our planet this government have move fast in the first six month than the previous government do in year by introduce the sustainable aviation fuel mandate so that of all fuel source from january this year must come from renewable source where be the hon member when we introduce that in this house it be one of the most forward think sustainable measure that we have bring to this place in the next few month as part of his majesty legislative agenda we will be introduce the revenue certainty mechanism to create world class saf industry here in the uk hope to see the hon member support the government from the opposition benches as we clean up our transport sector our aviation sector and our economy as whole call the chair of the transport committee third runway at heathrow have significant implication for uk wide growth for our carbon commitment and for the people who will live in the new db corridor of significant noise pollution as well as air pollution do the minister agree that such an announcement should be make in the context of national aviation strategy if he do when will we see it thank the chair of the transport committee for her question the airport national planning framework under the last government have not be update for some time and we will shortly bring forward proposal to do that as part of our package while there be currently no development consent application for heathrow we have be clear that expansion proposal would need to demonstrate that they contribute to economic growth be compatible with our climate change target and meet strict environmental standard for air quality and noise pollution the four test call the shadow secretary of state in recent day we have hear that the chancellor be about to announce her support for airport expansion at luton gatwick and heathrow his majesty opposition be supportive of airport expansion because we recognise the huge economic benefit that would bring for luton and gatwick as the minister have say planning process be well under way but the situation at heathrow be rather different complete third runway at heathrow would undoubtedly bring economic benefit which we would support but deliver that will not be straightforward because there be major logistical barrier to its construction those include but be not limit to hundred of thousand of additional people be bring on to heathrow flightpath the potential for significant disruption to the and which could harm the economy for year to come the fact that large incinerator be in the way and would have to be demolish and the need to address local concern about noise and air pollution the uncertainty do not end there because to date heathrow have not apply for development consent order and neither have it confirm that it intend to do so that all leave the minister with many question to answer what assessment have he make of the impact of build third runway on the and which be two of the busy motorway in europe how certain be he that any propose plan will have the support of affected community what be the estimate cost and who will pay not just for the runway construction but for the massive additional work that will need to be do include among other thing reroute motorway demolish the incinerator and rebuild it elsewhere perhaps most importantly what assurance can he provide that there will be an application for development consent order sincerely hope that the minister can answer those question because if he can not it will be clear that this be not serious policy but rather panicked and rush attempt by the chancellor of the exchequer to distract attention from the state of the economy which be currently wither under this flounder labour government well the brass neck the last government crash the economy send mortgage through the roof and call an early election to avoid have to make difficult decision transport policy should be enable growth as priority in this country so that we can bring about the change that the british people vote for for year we have government who have become so sclerotic in aviation and indeed maritime that be also part of my brief that no decision be bring forward on decarbonise the maritime or aviation sector or make the difficult decision that this country need to make as the hon member rightly say there be currently no development consent order before we and that be for heathrow or related party to bring forward for and for you mr speaker there be more than an element of déjà vu in this debate the minister have say that what we have hear be speculative but the chancellor statement seem to be more authoritative than that have the department provide the chancellor with an assessment of where the to people in my constituency who will have their home demolish or render unliveable will live if heathrow expansion go ahead have the minister map for the chancellor the flightpath of the additional quarter of million plane fly over the home of people in those marginal seat of uxbridge watford harrow and elsewhere have he advise the chancellor on some of the figure that be be bandy about regard the economic benefit which seem to derive from airports commission figure that be out of date and that his own department rubbish very thoroughly in recent year my right hon friend be doughty campaigner for his constituent but there be no dco at the moment and we do not know the impact that will be matter for heathrow or third party to bring forward would like to hear more full throate support for our airspace modernisation plan which will improve resilience capacity and flexibility when it come to aircraft noise over affect community when it come to growth my constituency as you well know mr speaker have see billion of the manchester mix scheme at manchester airport with the development of the hut group and the most advanced amazon fulfilment centre on the planet we know that aviation bring growth and job we know that there be trade off to be have and we will have those conversation if development consent order be bring before we call the liberal democrat spokesperson the minister give an admirably delphic yet still disappointing answer while we must grow the economy we must not do so at the expense of the environment expand heathrow gatwick and luton airport will drive or even fly coach and horse through our climate commitment add million tonne of carbon dioxide to our carbon footprint by do not just take my word for it the mayor of london his previous deputy mayor for transport now the transport secretary the environment secretary the chief secretary to the treasury and the prime minister have all previously be oppose as be the secretary of state for energy security and net zero can ask the minister three question first why have his boss the former london deputy mayor for transport change her mind secondly how can the government reconcile this massive growth in carbon emission with our climate commitment thirdly why if the government be look to grow our economy be they not re engage meaningfully with europe by negotiate custom union that last one floor ever so slightly delphic the hon member say or ambiguous and obscure which be slightly like liberal democrat policy on aviation they be one foot in one foot out shake it all about they say one thing to one community under flightpath and another thing about job to another community under flightpath whatever say will end up on the focus leaflet but they can not have it both way they can not support growth job airspace modernisation and sustainable aviation fuel and then say to their constituent look what this terrible government be do we have firm plan for aviation in this country and we be go to carry it out do the minister agree that plan for the third runway have go cold over the past decade since the airport commission as he say there be not even an application for development consent order do he agree that there be no chance of spade in the ground this parliament if there be that be when the problem would really start for too long and on too many issue this nation just have not make the tough decision when it come to airport expansion our world class aviation sector admire across the world and decarbonise our sector we be make huge progress more in the past six month than in year under the tories we will continue on our mission of renew the national airport strategy and will look at development consent order as they become live that be quasi judicial matter and can not comment on luton and gatwick as member know we will wait to see whether heathrow or related party bring forward development consent order manston airport in kent in my constituency have be fallow and the subject of legal action for far too long but that be happily now behind we we hope and expect that within the next few week there will be announcement on funding that will lead to the development of state of the art net zero airport in kent manston do not appear to feature in the government plan can the minister assure that his eye be on that ball and that manston will become part of the growth programme have speak to the right hon member about manston in opposition and in government we wait to see what will be bring forward there but it could be an exciting opportunity particularly for cargo we could have zero emission vessel ship content into the port of london we will wait and see whether the airport come with development consent order and we will judge that on its merit be old enough to have be there the last time this question be vote on in the spirit of gordon brown and his test over the euro we apply test of our own on capacity carbon commitment minimise noise and environmental impact and ensure benefit for the whole uk can the minister tell whether those sensible test still apply can he add another one about cost to the public purse and deliverability for my constituent who will be the most affected they want well not big heathrow re emphasise that there be no development consent order for heathrow at the moment we know that for all airport surface access be essential the public transport penetration rate within an hour be key to the market that airport can access from across the planet to support their growth we have world class transport system in the south east but in any development consent order heathrow or its related party will have to prove how we can get new people to that site if as we expect the chancellor announce her support tomorrow for third runway at heathrow that will be massive turn from the prime minister previous position and it be patently clear that third runway will fail all of labour four test on growth across our region on climate on air pollution and on noise pollution the economic and environmental case be in tatter and no airline want to foot the bill for third runway will the minister concede that any such announcement would simply be virtue signal by chancellor in search of growth where she will not achieve it and would damage our environment and our community at the same time support the chancellor pursuit of growth for too long we have be stagnant and we know that this area can provide growth have see that in my constituency as have point out where be the hon member when we talk about sustainable aviation fuel where be she when we commit million to the advanced fuel fund to help the saf industry grow in this country we have announce billion for the aerospace technology institute to look at zero emission flight would it not be great if one day minister could stand here and say that all internal flight will be zero emission want to leave my successor whoever they be the opportunity to say that within the next decade many of my constituent in ealing southall work at heathrow or in its supply chain and they will welcome the good quality well pay job that airport expansion will bring however have other constituent who worry about the environmental impact of any expansion in take any decision on this matter will the minister ensure that he balance the need for growth and for good quality local job against the need to minimise air pollution and noise pollution what terrific question interruption well it be it hit the mark in that there be trade off between noise carbon and grow our economy for our people airport create high pay trade unionise job not just because of the aircraft that come in and out but because of the ground handling service we know that aviation community be much well off because of the job that be create and we have to balance the trade off in the year ahead as we make tough decision to grow our economy remind the minister that sustainable aviation fuel be not an answer to poor air quality which be the main reason why attempt expansion at heathrow have fail in the past it be also the reason for the chancellor trenchant opposition to the expansion of leeds bradford airport which would affect her constituency have be around since the day of the terminal planning inquiry find it clear that the business case for heathrow expansion rest on significant cost be impose on taxpayer they would be expect to foot the bill for the impact on the and the and for the loss of waste incinerator that provide energy for many local authority can the minister assure the house that any dco for heathrow that come forward will be subject to no less rigour and no less consultation than those bring forward in the past can assure the hon gentleman of that saf be stick in the muck under the last government we wait year for announcement and we have do more on that in six month than tory administrations do in year we be invest in clean up aviation fuel and funding technology on contrail so that the air people breathe be always as clean as we can make it in spirit of cross party collaboration praise the shadow spokesperson the hon member for orpington gareth bacon for expertly outline some of the logistical challenge of heathrow expansion it be surprise and shame that the tories do not answer those question before vote for expansion in when in government do the minister agree that any future application for heathrow expansion we do not yet have one must address and solve those key issue look at those logistical challenge and say how expansion be compatible with our climate commitment and with local concern about air quality pollution noise and congestion my hon friend be exactly right our four test remain and they have to be pass again we be speculate that development consent order will come before we be sure that he as doughty campaigner for his constituent will make his voice hear the economic benefit of the expansion of london airport remain unproven on heathrow the department for transport update appraisal report show that the net present value of third runway range from just billion to minus billion while heathrow finance be of severe concern due to the significant debt that it have incur what new economic analysis have the government consider that make third runway at heathrow viable when consider alongside their commitment on climate noise and air quality say again what say early capacity in london be at on average and at at gatwick and heathrow what be the liberal democrat answer to that do we not want people to fly across the world to bang the drum for british business do we not want they to visit their friend and family be the liberal democrats for constrain people fly there be lot of question but no answer from liberal democrat members vote against the framework for heathrow airport in because be not satisfied that the legislation before we would deal with air quality noise climate change and surface access issue do my hon friend agree that if we be to go ahead with third runway at heathrow we must satisfy ourselves in this house that those issue have be address and that they can not be set aside by developer once they have permission to go ahead my hon friend be exactly right those test must be meet include through the development consent order just for the record vote for the framework in because think that it pass those test many of my constituent in wetherby and easingwold use leed bradford airport and the same will be true of the constituent of the under secretary of state for transport the hon member for wakefield and rothwell simon lightwood for year have want expansion of heathrow so that morning flight from yorkshire could come down to heathrow airport allow transatlantic flight to be board in yorkshire may urge the minister when consider the expansion of heathrow to always give firm attention to regional airport especially leed bradford airport in yorkshire it would allow the economy to grow significantly if people could check in at leeds and get off in new york could not agree more with the right hon member though it pain to say it we have five great northern runway stretch from john lennon to manchester leeds bradford and newcastle and we should be focus on regional connectivity in particular on leeds bradford my recollection be that because of the lack of decision making by the last government confidence be lose in its development let we see if we can get framework for improve connectivity at leeds bradford include for those in the constituency of the under secretary of state for transport my hon friend the member for wakefield and rothwell simon lightwood come to london yesterday by rail as usual and must say that both lumo and london north eastern railway be do fantastic job of get people out of plane and on to train between edinburgh and london interruption always like to talk about train be concerned that any increase in air capacity will take people off train and help they make less sustainable transport choice will the minister commit to speak with the rail minister to understand any impact of airport expansion on that service my hon friend be exactly right we have to join up the mode of transport we have have break transport system as result of year of complete under investment whether we be talk about rail connectivity to glasgow what will happen if heathrow development consent order come forward or just get northern train work across the north of england link up leeds bradford liverpool manchester and newcastle will be key start to improve job and growth at those airport in order to meet the problem of increase demand for flight what be the government do to improve rail connection with western europe include direct train to germany as well as holland think that that involve fix the problem with eurostar we be see other come into that market and european union colleague be run overnight long distance train service which be reduce the need for aviation across the continent and reduce carbon we should be ambitious as country that we can tap into that network the right hon gentleman be right on this matter newcastle international airport tell that heathrow expansion would mean increase access to global market for north east business new destination for north east tourist and easy access to our brilliant north east university for student from around the world more broadly give that air travel of emission be dwarf by road travel emission do the minister agree that the important work that his department be do to promote electric vehicle and the work that the department for energy security and net zero be do on the decarbonisation of the electricity network be fundamental to demonstrate to my constituent that address climate change be not about say no to travel and transport but about say yes to an economy that work for people and the planet we have make tough decision about the phasing out of internal combustion engine up to when visit newcastle airport see wonderful operation it be also produce solar energy to power its operation we need well connectivity between newcastle and london and have raise that with carrier if we be to develop our offshore wind carbon capture and green energy technology it must be link up with the cruise industry newcastle airport and the great north east coast that provide so many job service and industry for people across our nation have be enjoy the minister lively presentation but then do not live under potential new flightpath be the government consult their back benchers about the possibility of aviation and airport expansion versus net zero if so will they be advise they to clean up what they have say on this subject on the internet before it be hoover up by the opposition in preparation for the next general election there have be lot of ai news in the press today say gently to the right hon gentleman that grow up under flightpath in my home town in wythenshawe and sale east grow up under the the tridents the concordes and the guppys interruption see that my hon friend the member for manchester withington jeff smith agree with remember how dirty noisy and smelly those plane be technology have come forward leap and bound and the noise envelope around most of our airport have reduce considerably through our investment we hope to improve the technology far under this government and the next this weekend the sunday times feature great cartoon by morten morland show the prime minister the chancellor and the energy secretary tear up whitehall office look for the growth lever be supporter of the welsh freeport programme and airport expansion where there be environmental mitigation will the minister please say more about the government sustainable aviation plan and the use of low carbon tech to help economic growth thank my hon friend for his support for growth at our port which include our maritime port there be million for the advanced fuel fund and billion for the aerospace technology institute to look at net zero emission we have already introduce it be almost the government first act out of the gate it come into force on january the saf mandate so this year of all fuel will have to be from sustainable source and we will shortly legislate on the revenue certainty mechanism to kick start the saf industry in the uk the government could not have do more in the six month we have have in office note that the minister do not mention noise pollution in his statement as he grow up under flightpath hope that he enjoy the noise eight route currently pass over my constituency sometimes after midnight my constituent struggle with the noise one say that it be like have an uninvited dinner guest every night it not only disturb sleep but have profound health implication with that in mind be the minister go to ignore the health impact of third runway can not comment on the third runway because there be no development consent order before we but the hon lady make an extraordinarily valid point about noise that be why the liberal democrats should get behind we and support airspace modernisation we have an analogue system in digital age which be design more for the day when yuri gagarin go into space than for today we can give people under flightpath more choice in future by differentiation if we have well system of airspace modernisation my local airport stanste be huge employer for resident in my constituency and it be have lead the way in develop sustainable aviation fuel do the minister agree that sustainable aviation fuel be vital to achieve our decarbonisation target sustainable aviation fuel be vital to meet our climate target commend manchester airports group which include stansted and east midlands and manchester in my own constituency on its work to decarbonise it be ahead of the game it fly one in six people in and out of the uk when it get it right that represent huge emission reduction do the minister agree that one of the many benefit of third runway at heathrow be that it would require the removal of one of the large waste incinerator in the country when this matter come before he will he ensure that there be no reprovisioning of this monster in densely populate area but that we see its deletion altogether so that we deal with waste in truly sustainable way there be no dco currently if one come forward be sure that the right hon gentleman will make his voice hear be grateful to my hon friend for repeat what we hear from the secretary of state for energy security and net zero at the environmental audit committee yesterday that no plan will be approve unless they be in line with the government environmental commitment my hon friend can not comment on gatwick and luton because they have live dco and he can not comment on heathrow because it do not have live dco which be handy let ask he about something that he can comment on what change will we make to ensure that any airport expansion plan be in line with our environmental commitment can he explain more about what the offset will be to ensure that the government be able to meet the commitment that he have confirm they will make thank my hon friend for his chairmanship of the environmental audit committee of which be proud member for many year look at the circular economy which this government be take forward the government have commit to deliver green transport include through saf airspace modernisation and the other measure that lay out be proud of that range of measure the front bench across this department be decarbonise the transport sector far and fast in the first six month of this government than in year of the last the minister have make great deal of the position of my party on heathrow airport as he be such fan of our focus leaflet be sure he will know from my own that have consistently raise airport noise opposition to the expansion of heathrow sustainable aviation fuel and airspace management in this place how will he make the airspace management plan fit with any forthcoming emission and capacity management framework we have yet to hear from the government about that but the liberal democrats consider it vital to the future sustainability of the air transport industry in this country be generally very grateful for the liberal democrats support for airspace modernisation it be complicated and difficult we be throw our hat over the wall in try to reach it it will be easy in certain part of our country than other but we have already take action we set up the airspace modernisation design service we be bring the good and the bright together if we can make the plane fly in straight line we will use less carbon it be the low of low hang fruit for carbon reduction in the aviation sector and we be move at pace on it welcome this government commitment to the aviation sector the closure of doncaster airport on december with the loss of job and the smooth access to flight in the country be devastating the reopening of the airport have be long fight campaign that have the backing of my constituent in bassetlaw today they will be say bring the flight and the infrastructure to our area will the minister put his shoulder to our campaign without doubt people be proud of their airport mine be year old few year ago and see people turn up in drove to show their pride in aviation in this country feel sorry for the people of doncaster sheffield and the environ when they lose their airport commend the mayor the council and the local mp who have lobby relentlessly on this matter the council now have deal with the operator and the first flight take off very recently wish they every luck with it and they will have my full backing to do what need to be do like my right hon friend the member for wetherby and easingwold sir alec shelbrooke and other want to focus on the role of our regional airport surely the minister would agree that the expansion of some of they could help the government growth agenda and provide boost to local economy with improved rail connection many of our regional airport could serve traveller to and from london the work involve could be complete long before dco for heathrow could be conclude airport near the hon member constituency will have key part to play for worker across our nation with respect to the decarbonisation agenda and sustainable fuel because immingham sit within his constituency that will be key to the uk plan to decarbonise our economy along with good rail connectivity airport be market within the private sector plane want to go to particular place but if we can expand and grow our economy across all our region as we hope to hope that this will be golden age for all our airport my right hon friend the member for hayes and harlington john mcdonnell be correct to say that this feel like déjà vu here we be again debate huge transport infrastructure expansion in the south east of england while constituent right across this country especially in the north east think what about we do the minister agree that if expand transport infrastructure in this country be the key to growth that growth must happen everywhere agree as have say airport that make the right decision in the next few year on improve the airspace and improve their connectivity through surface access all have the potential to grow like my airport have grow exponentially urge member to get behind their airport and support their growth and decarbonisation agenda globally half of aviation emission be result of flight take by the wealthy in the uk of flight be take by the rich be expand aviation capacity not matter of fairness it will facilitate the very rich who be already frequent flyer to be able to fly more while the noise carbon emission and air pollution impact will be inflict on the most ordinary people in society include the poor at home and around the world think it be woody allen who say that of success in life be turn up and must gently ask once again where the hon gentleman be when we be introduce the sustainable aviation mandate in this house hope he will be here when we introduce the revenue support mechanism in the month ahead and decarbonise our aviation sector think people have the right to go on holiday at least once year to do business across the planet and to visit friend and family be not sure what the hon gentleman policy be if he want to send they to will put they on one of my labour rose follow on from the question from my hon friend the member for bassetlaw jo white do the minister agree that it be important to also support regional airport in the north include doncaster airport the reopening of the airport be support by all my neighbouring parliamentary colleague together with my hon friend the member for doncaster east and the isle of axholme lee pitcher be work with doncaster council and the south yorkshire combine authority to get this critical piece of transport infrastructure back the growth agenda will be success only if place like doncaster feel it too it be important that the people of doncaster and south yorkshire can take off once again have to say my hon friend be so tenacious on this matter that sometimes go pale when meet she in the division lobby because every day she ask after it she be such campaigner on it see she go around party conference lobby the industry and airline to do what her constituent send she to parliament to do and to try to come up with solution for her local airport can only commend her tenacity to the house will the minister confirm what compensate measure the government will take if airport expansion be to go ahead to ensure adherence to carbon budget they must have already be agree on by now thank the hon gentleman for his consider approach in all these matter be pleased to receive he at the department the other day to talk about particular constituency issue that relate to gatwick we do not have development consent order but noise and pollution be the test to meet our climate commitment and they will remain the test it will be up to the chair of the transport committee my hon friend the member for brentford and isleworth ruth cadbury and member across this house to hold the government foot to the fire on this matter the reopening of blackpool airport for commercial flight be top priority for my constituent as have raise previously with the minister do he agree that we need to work with our regional airport to deliver the growth and the job we need in place such as blackpool that be forget about by the previous government over year what breath of fresh air my hon friend be in his by election and he be now on these benches campaign for his airport in blackpool be really look forward to visit the airport and to my night out there hope that will come with fish and chip on the prom as well the expansion of heathrow feel bit like the schrödinger cat of expansion at the moment it be both happen and not happen depend on what one perspective be today realise that the minister will not be tempt to comment on gatwick either as it be live dco process give that the shadow minister the hon member for orpington gareth bacon and the minister have both assert that growth be an inevitable consequence of airport expansion can ask the minister what evidence he have to support that assertion thank the hon lady for her question but do not think will take any lecture from liberal democrat members about sit on the fence theirs be the politic of lick their finger put it in the air to see which way the wind be blow and then put it in leaflet there be no development consent order for heathrow yet be sure the hon lady will have her opportunity to raise her concern at later date in this place could not agree more with the minister when he point out that any airport expansion have to be part of the overall picture of upgrade britain break transport network bracknell sit on the reading to waterloo train line which pass through feltham just south of heathrow journey time on the line have not improve since the and there be no direct connection to heathrow will the minister assure that any plan to upgrade airport will be part of the overall picture of an integrate plan my hon friend be exactly right be not usually quite so divisive at the dispatch box but we inherit such broken system it be almost untrue such be the thing we be find out about the sclerotic nature of the previous government the roads minister my hon friend the member for nottingham south lilian greenwood be invest million in fix pothole while the minister responsible for bus my hon friend the member for wakefield and rothwell simon lightwood have invest billion in bus we be move fast we be fix thing and we be deliver as fellow greater manchester mp the minister will undoubtedly know that manchester airport welcome million passenger through its door last year and that of those passenger come to and from the airport by car he will rightly acknowledge the valid concern across the house today about the impact of airport expansion on carbon emission the carbon footprint of manchester airport come only partly from air travel as lot of it come from road travel what update can the minister give my constituent on surface access improvement at manchester airport so that they can get to and from the airport whether as passenger or to work by bus or by train well the conservative build road but it just flood all the time maybe we can start by deal with that the hon lady be right that manchester airport be in my constituency mine be actually the most visited constituency in the north of england in fact million people visit it last year alone although they may not have stay as long as would have like the airport have be on an incredible journey especially with its decarbonisation hope to meet the airport operator shortly to continue that journey with they it be right that in this debate we all champion our local and regional airport include birmingham international however the reality be that no other airport be serious rival to the long haul hub capacity that heathrow provide and its exhaustion of that capacity be block on growth in every region of the uk do the minister agree that redirection of that pen up demand to schiphol and dubai be no good for the national account and no good for the environment my hon friend be absolutely right he be very good campaigner for his local airport and for the public service obligation flight out of that airport not make these tough decision do not mean there be no carbon it simply mean that customer vote with their foot and go to schiphol frankfurt or charles de gaulle to hub out to their destination we have to look at thing in the round when we be talk about decarbonise the uk aviation sector give the hugely contradictory evidence on whether expand airport capacity will boost gdp growth will the minister explain how the government can justify prioritise airport expansion over much need substantial investment in green travel and public transport which would benefit the economy in the long term and benefit far wide group of people in this country than the very small group of wealthy frequent flyer who will benefit from airport expansion be hear that member on the liberal democrat benches be against wealthy people and against our constituent fly in some case there be no big champion of active travel in this house than except for my ministerial colleague my hon friend the member for wakefield and rothwell and hope to do lot more on that when it come to port and airport all people regardless of their income should have choice about how they get around we have break system over the past year which mean people have no choice now they be get well bus their pothole be fix and we be invest more in active travel than ever before my hon friend the member for birmingham northfield laurence turner make an excellent point about hub airport at the moment there be flight between my local airport in newcastle and heathrow but week between newcastle and amsterdam dare say that some people from the north east may wish to sample the unique delight of amsterdam some will certainly be use amsterdam as hub airport instead of heathrow that be bad for our economy bad for passenger and because it be far away than heathrow bad for the environment too be it not right that we build hub capacity in this country because it be the good thing to do environmentally also understand that you can have good old party on the ferry from the port of tyne to amsterdam do not know whether my hon friend have take it he be exactly right if we do not invest in hub airport in the uk people will go point to point outside the uk to transfer to the place they want to go to that be bad for carbon emission than we take responsibility for the decision we need to make to decarbonise our aviation sector welcome the support the minister have give to the chancellor today he have make it quite clear if the speculation turn into reality where he will stand on the issue that be important give the need for hub airport to export our good build business link and give people the personal freedom to travel across the world but be he concern give the energy secretary obsession with net zero the large number of member who seem to be more concerned about long term climate prediction uncertain as they may be than the immediate need of growth and job in this economy and the potential for lengthy court battle because of our statutory commitment to carbon dioxide reduction that no investor will look at these project but will instead continue to look at hub airport in the rest of europe thank the right hon member who know be campaigner on this keep close eye on all matter of connectivity to northern ireland investor confidence in aviation be huge investor be queue up and look for opportunity we must ensure those opportunity come with job and growth but also that they be clean and decarbonise our sector say stick with the plan we will decarbonise the grid and our uk economy but we can grow it at the same time the two thing be not contradictory do the minister agree that it would be irresponsible to kick the can down the runway on airport expansion and other major infrastructure when this country be desperate for growth we need government willing to take the tough decision to overcome the blocker and get thing build in the national interest and in the interest of citizen all around our country can not agree more the government define mission will be growth the aviation sector be one where we can grow the economy because it provide the connectivity and the high skilled trade unionised job that support family and career right across our country before the minister ask where be during the sustainable aviation fuel debate be here have saf by still mean fossil fuel in aircraft fuel an awful lot my constituent be impact by bristol airport expansion meet regularly with my local group stop bristol airport expansion group they want to know what impact assessment have be make of the cumulative effect of the additional carbon emission that will be create by all the propose airport expansion plan take together thank the hon member she be actually right and well do to she for be there during the saf debate and support the government at the moment the technology do not exist to fully decarbonise aviation we be look at hydrogen we have the advanced fuel fund and we be invest billion in the ati but as the prime minister announce recently when he go to merseyside we be invest billion in carbon capture and other technology to offset those emission that be what we will have to do in the near future but envisage day when we will have aircraft in our sky particularly internally in the uk with zero emission come out of their tailpipe welcome the government commitment to growth also welcome their commitment to take the difficult decision require to generate it we know that any conversation about third runway will focus on the south but would like to ask about the north may ask the minister in my capacity as chair of the all party parliamentary group for yorkshire and northern lincolnshire if the project be approve what will be do to ensure that all region benefit from the proceed of the growth generate be grateful to my hon friend for his question and even from this lancastrian for his chairmanship of the appg for yorkshire will say couple of thing we have five great northern runway and we need to begin to improve their capacity and connectivity that be key to regional economic growth hopefully whoever come forward with the dco for heathrow will as they have in the past look at spread the wealth and at logistic hub right not just around our country but scotland wales and northern ireland my local community include flamstead markyate and wheathampsted be already plague by luton airport and very worried about expansion if the minister can not answer question about evidence for positive impact on growth and the economy can he at least guarantee that the government will listen to their own climate expert and have framework in place before any airport expansion yes be the answer we will come forward very shortly with policy framework we have not have one for many year it be more than time to update it the hon lady be right very much welcome the minister answer they have be both confident and progressive which be encouraging for as the mp for strangford my constituent have express some concern about the impact on the environment of the potential expansion but it have be highlight to that build for plane to land so they do not have to circle be highly beneficial for the environment will the minister confirm that our environmental obligation have be fully consider in any decision that be make for the potential expansion of heathrow will there be know the minister will say yes but want he to say it on the record more domestic connection with belfast international and belfast city airport the hon member be such doughty campaigner that think he have an urgent question in the house few week ago when his plane be cancel well do be all can say that day we have really good question and answer session on connectivity in northern ireland we have two great airport in belfast and derry londonderry airport serve the north west his first question be about plane fly in straight line an obscure piece of policy which be in our manifesto call airspace modernisation we can cut up to and be tell in the case of some easyjet flight even of carbon emission by just get plane to go in reasonably straight line and not circle around it introduce resilience at airport and make the passenger experience much well hope those on the opposition benches will support the policy when it come to this place thank the minister for his very full answer to question which mean be now on the seventh or eighth version of my question laughter there be two point would like to explore first on emission saf will only ever be transitionary fuel what effort be the government make to engage with industry to develop truly zero carbon power plant and harness our incredible industry and our company that can take advantage of the opportunity to lead the real zero carbon hydrogen electric power plant secondly on noise the minister mention airspace modernisation which will mean some resident face great noise frequency and impact do he agree that the answer to the first question on next generation power plant be actually the answer to the second question on noise please will he give we proper answer on what the government be do to take advantage that be the problem when new member be call last but he be agile mentally on his foot to get that in we be invest in hydrogen zero emission technology with billion for the ati hope the hon gentleman be sit on the opposition benches in the month ahead when we implement the revenue certainty mechanism so we can kickstart new age of saf production in the uk that will bring job and growth

the need for unrwa to continue its lifesave assistance to the people of gaza jerusalem and the west bank the knesset legislation take effect on january risk impede the progress make since the ceasefire israel must allow the agency to continue to operate the legislation do not and can not change the fact that israel have responsibility under international law to facilitate humanitarian

in the fcdo and we will continue to do that the right hon lady ask whether we be confident that aid will get to where it be need yes we be much of the contribution we have announce today be go from the crisis reserve into the pool arrangement which be system design to ensure that support be go directly into shelter food and medical supply it be critical we ensure that that support be available directly the right hon lady ask about unrwa we have speak about this before but to reiterate when the uk resume its support for unrwa we be very clear that the finding from the colonna report have to be implement in fact million of the million that we provide to unrwa at that point be earmark to support that reform programme have discuss this directly with the head of unrwa and know that my colleague have do so repeatedly have also discuss it with unrwa staff in the region and see for myself that work particularly around neutrality when be in the west bank so can assure the right hon lady of the uk government commitment in that regard the right hon lady ask about reconstruction and what conversation we have be undertake in that regard we have be work with the international community and have many discussion with partner bilaterally about this of course the most important thing be for the ceasefire to hold know she would agree with that but when it come to reconstruction and recovery we have be particularly work with the world bank she may be aware that it conduct rapid need assessment which be very helpful process and that be be update we have also be have those discussion intensely with the palestinian authority the right hon lady will be aware that sir michael barber who have incredible expertise have be support by the uk government to work with the pa have

ordnance what be happen about that finally what intervention have the government make about the imminent closure of the unrwa warehouse on the west bank be grateful to my hon friend for raise those issue as she have do consistently first in term of how the uk be work with the palestinian authority on these issue that support have include financial assistance around the reform programme but also the direct technical support around the reform programme that be necessary substantial reform be need there be clear plan that have be drive by the palestinian authority but we be determined to provide that technical support and we have be do so the issue of unexploded ordnance be of huge concern particularly as we see people come back to their home because there be great danger that in do so they will be impact there be need for education and awareness raise around this but there be also need to remove that materiel that be very important the uk have be work with other country and internationally on how we can ensure that that be the case so that these community be safe to return to finally my hon friend ask about the storage of unrwa supply we be very clear as we have be before that unrwa must have key role in deliver humanitarian support and health and education service to palestinians whether that be in gaza the west bank or the wide region call the liberal democrat spokesperson join colleague in support effort to uphold the ceasefire agreement and release the hostage wish to express my heartfelt condolence to the family of the eight hostage who have be kill by hamas while take hostage and join members of the house in call for the immediate release of all those still wait to be reunite with their love one want to denounce statement make suggest that palestinians should be forcibly displace from their home to other region in the middle east the only clearing out that should be take place be of the unexploded ordnance across gaza where un de mining expert estimate that to of all ordnance be unexploded what support be the uk government provide for the safe de mining of the region and for the unaccompanied child of whom there be estimate to be israeli legislation cease unrwa operation be due to take effect this thursday pose huge risk to the humanitarian response and the delivery of education and primary healthcare dismantle unrwa now outside political process will undermine the ceasefire agreement sabotage gaza recovery and weaken the international humanitarian response what step be the minister take to ensure the continuity of humanitarian aid to the occupied palestinian territories give the ongoing existential threat to unrwa operation be grateful to the hon lady for the point she have make wish to join she in express sincere condolence to the family of those eight hostage who will not be able to be back with their family as be their right and as so many of we hop would be the case their family must be suffer intensely now the hon lady point about displacement be well make the uk position be very clear the uk believe that international humanitarian law must be hold to and that it must be feasible and indeed reality that gazan be able to return to their home include in northern gaza that have consistently be the uk government position the hon lady ask about mine clearing and unexploded ordnance as say it be really important that those area be safe for people to come back to speak with some specialist in this area last week know how meticulous and difficult the work of remove unexploded ordnance be the uk be actively engage with expert and consider what role we might be able to play but above all we be ensure that there be co ordinate approach to this across our partner and international institution the hon lady ask about child the situation for child have be priority for the uk government as it be for the previous government we have ensure that support from uk med be provide for child unfortunately we have see the pressure on child health come through the uk be heavily involve in seek to deal with polio through the vaccination campaign and we will continue to ensure that we do what we can to support child particularly follow the trauma that they have experience finally on the issue of unrwa the hon lady be absolutely right the deadline be come up speedily and be in two day time the uk government remain absolutely committed to our position that no other organisation can operate at the scale or depth of unrwa it be absolutely essential for provide both direct humanitarian supply and health and education service to palestinians and we will continue to make that very clear as we have do repeatedly to our israeli counterpart multilaterally and to our other partner as well be glad to hear of the uplift in funding for gaza and share the minister serious concern about the effective ban on unrwa come into force this week of course of the food that have enter gaza during the ceasefire have be deliver through unrwa which play vital lifesaving and stabilise role in the west bank by provide education to palestinian child as well as healthcare clean water and rubbish collection what reassurance have the minister have from israel that if unrwa can no long operate there be viable and humane alternative way of get support to the palestinians like other member of the house my hon friend have considerable experience of these issue with background in humanitarian service the uk government be very clear that unrwa underpin the entire humanitarian response in gaza it have vital role in deliver the uplift in humanitarian assistance that we need to see follow the ceasefire and as she rightly mention education and health service we be oppose to the knesset legislation that be previously pass and we call on israel to work urgently with international partner include the un so that there be no disruption to this vital work may commend the development minister on her statement to the house today think she would agree that it continue the drive and commitment of the last government particularly applaud she for make it clear that the policy of the british government be that any plan for the future governance of gaza will involve reform palestinian authority and categorically rule out any role for hamas in week when we have see the anniversary of the liberation of auschwitz and the release of terrified young hostage do she agree that it be deeply depress that antisemitism be alive and well and often express through hatred of israel be grateful to the right hon gentleman for his remark and be indeed grateful for the work undertake by the previous government when it come to humanitarian support in this area obviously we have seek to build on that and deepen it and to make sure that we be at the forefront of our responsibility in this area be happy to confirm that he summarise the position of the uk government when it come to the future of gaza it must be future that be determine by palestinians and gazans themselves with the pa have role but not hamas on the issue of antisemitism in this week of all week we must redouble all our effort to ensure that we never forget the horror of the holocaust and that we always resolve to combat any form of prejudice and discrimination include antisemitism may thank our colleague on the front bench for the work that they have do and for the commitment that they have show to ensure that we do our good to deliver today focus on gaza be critical but my concern be that gaza could easily be destabilise by what be happen in the west bank particularly the invasion of the tulkarm refugee camp in the last few day and the killing of further palestinians may ask our government to make representation to the israeli government to show restraint and to prevent the further loss of palestinian life through attack by the idf as my right hon friend rightly say stability in the west bank be crucial to ensure that the fragile ceasefire in gaza can last all side must work to ensure lowering of tension in the west bank at this time can reassure he that we have continue to call on the israeli authority to exercise restraint adhere to international law and clamp down on the action of those who seek to inflame tension which be in no one interest before the current crisis construction in gaza be make much more difficult by the surprisingly long list of proscribe material which include thing like drain pipe which israel fear could be use as componentry for weapon and be understandably uncomfortable with what can we do to ensure that the strip can be rebuild with all the material that will require while give israel reassurance on diversion of material by hamas or what remain of it and other iranian proxy be grateful to the right hon member for ask that critical question he be right to suggest that key enabler of gaza recovery will be the ability to get good and material in at the require pace and scale our position be that the enable condition for early recovery must be provide in the come week include secure access corridor which be really important and the resumption of basic service welcome the minister statement and the announcement of additional vital uk support for palestinians at this crucial time and join she in recognise the central work of jordan will she join in condemn the legislation pass against unrwa by the israeli knesset which jeopardise the entire international humanitarian response in gaza what concrete action will our government take if the israeli government move ahead with implement that legislation at the end of this week be grateful to my hon friend for underline the role of jordan on both my visit to jordan see for myself how commit the jordanians have be to ensure that aid get into gaza we be really grateful to they for that and for the partnership that they have show with the uk when it come to the legislation on unrwa the uk government have be very clear that the decision by the knesset be wrong it will undermine the ceasefire and prevent the delivery of much need humanitarian aid and prevent the delivery of education and healthcare that be why once again we call on israel to change tack and not implement the legislation over the weekend president trump insert himself into the debate on the future of gaza and its people by say you talk about probably million and half people and we just clean out that whole thing be it the government view that he be talk about the forced displacement or ethnic cleansing of almost million palestinians from their land if that be not the government understanding of what he mean what exactly be their interpretation of what president trump say the uk government recognise the critical role that both the current and previous administration in the us play in obtain the ceasefire as well as the effort of qatar and egypt on the hon gentleman question about whether gazan be able to return they must be allow to return that be very clear under international humanitarian law as he know thank the minister for come to the house with this statement be sure that member across the house be watch to ensure that this agreement last and that people can return to their home and build some sort of future tomorrow be due to meet the kennington bethlehem link voluntary group in my constituency dedicate to help palestinians catch up in the conflict it have raise with the alarming situation in the aida camp an unrwa fund refugee camp between bethlehem and jerusalem sadly the israel defence forces have repeatedly vandalise the camp and intimidate worker the minister have outline the situation on unrwa funding give that israel be due to sever tie with unrwa later this week can she please look at urgently direct any support that the uk can give to the aida camp be grateful to my hon friend for raise the critical role of uk civil society in support people whether in gaza the west bank or the broad region that really be incredibly important be also grateful to she for raise the issue of aid worker safety this have be the most deadly conflict for very long time in fact believe since record begin on these matter for humanitarian worker of course the uk government will look closely at where our support be be provide as say to the right hon member for witham priti patel and ensure that it be get to where it be need we see horrendous scene at the weekend of hamas terrorist parade the brave hostage before they be return and shoot fellow palestinians for alleged collaboration also the hamas leader and his team have vow to return to rule gaza and to carry out repeat atrocity like those that be commit on october that show that hamas be not go away it be quite clear that they be determined to get back in control in gaza we all agree that hamas should not be in charge of gaza so the key issue be how will that be achieve agree with the hon member on those scene the foreign secretary have be very clear about this include from this dispatch box the uk government position could not be clear hamas be terrorist organisation it must not play role in future arrangement for gaza and we will seek to work with all our international partner and indeed with the un towards that end while hamas be busy smuggling weapon and spend money building tunnel in which to hold hostage ahead of their barbaric attack on october the people of gaza rely each and every day on aid come in for those of we who want two state solution with peaceful and prosperous palestine will the minister set out her assessment of the long term role that unrwa can play in that and how we can ensure that aid get to those who need it not to the terrorist who be try to take it away be grateful to my hon friend for raise the importance of the lodestar of the two state solution which we must always aim at israelis and palestinians rightly deserve state of security and the sovereignty that he be committed to on the role of unrwa we have have many discussion with its leadership and other international partner ultimately two state solution would enable the normalisation of the economy that be need and hopefully shift away from the humanitarian problem there have be for so many year my hon friend mention reconstruction and we be discuss that with number of un partner but would again mention the world bank which have be do so much work particularly on how finance can be access of course precondition for that be the ceasefire hold which we continue to push for accord to the un million people in gaza be currently displace which be of the population half of they be child how will the minister work to secure the right of return and self determination for palestinians in gaza especially in the light of the call from the us president to clean out palestinians from the region the figure that the hon member quote be right and in some case gazans have be move up to nine time because of recent event she describe gazans as have the right of return and would underline that word right they do have that right that be clear under international humanitarian law and it be right that the uk will seek to ensure become reality we must build confidence on both side to help sustain the peace but how be we go to do it there be family who leave palestine before the war and never get back many of they still have their key have see friend and family who never get back to see their grandparent or who get back once year how can we build anybody confidence to move out of the destruction particularly in northern gaza while it get rebuild we can not do that how will we build the confidence of the family and love one of the hostage who be still be hold there they fear that netanyahu will sacrifice they so that the war will return the idf say that there will not be second phase of this peace how do we build confidence my heart be with everybody involve know that people want peace but these be the fact we have to identify and resolve the risk do not know how we will do it god know the passion with which my hon friend speak be share by many member in this house it can sometimes be almost impossible to see way through particularly after conflict in which so many thousand of people be kill but it be the uk responsibility work multilaterally with our partner to reach towards peaceful future in which there be two state and palestinians and israelis can live in security we must aim towards that it be particularly important for all of we parliamentarian and the uk government not to shift away from this crisis as the medium coverage start to diminish in day and week to come we must keep up the pressure so that we can ensure the future that the israelis and the palestinians deserve deradicalisation must form key plank of any plan for reconstruction in gaza along with ensure that hamas have no role in its future running as the minister say however sickening reality on the ground be that in textbook and school curriculum in unrwa school in gaza there be material that promote antisemitism that incite hate against jews and israel and that promote violence unless we stamp out that hateful incitement to violence that be be put in front of schoolchildren in gaza there can be no successful and peaceful future what be the minister do in her conversation with unrwa to stamp that out in its school the issue of what be often call the neutrality of unrwa be incredibly important and have discuss it in detail with the leadership of unrwa have also go to see this in practice to understand the reform that have be undertake we talk previously about the important colonna report which set out practical step to deliver that neutrality the uk government have directly support that we earmark million of funding for it part of the million that we announce some week ago so we be absolutely committed to this and to those reform be not just implement as many of they have be but sustain no one can fail to be move by the powerful scene of palestinians return to their home in gaza even though their home have be reduce to rubble by israeli force of course it be important that we do everything we can to rebuild gaza but justice for war crime be also important do the minister agree that we must stand up to all those who wish to undermine the international criminal court investigation and do all we can to ensure that justice be do think we have all see on our television screen those scene of gazans return to their home which in many case have be destroy or heavily damage of course many of those people will also have lose family member so this have be an incredibly difficult process for many gazans my hon friend talk about the international criminal court and the uk government have make it absolutely clear that the uk respect the independence of the international criminal

healthcare facility in the west bank and the role that unrwa play in the provision of essential service include aid to palestinians be unique and irreplaceable the implementation of the knesset decision to ban unrwa could therefore amount to the denial of health service education and essential aid to population that have already suffer unbearably for the past month can the minister say not only that the uk government oppose the decision but what will be do to hold the israeli government to account for the impact of that decision if it be implement later this week the uk have already act

resident can the minister tell the house what specific and concrete step the government be take or will take to facilitate an end to israel siege and ethnic cleansing in the west bank the hon gentleman ask about the uk government representation in relation to the west bank and we have be very clear that the risk of instability be serious and the need for de escalation be urgent we continue to call on israeli authority to exercise restraint to adhere to international law and to clamp down on the action of those who seek to inflame tension welcome the minister update on the government effort to get aid to those in need in gaza give the serious allegation of war crime occur in gaza what step be the government take to ensure that they be properly investigate and that those responsible be hold to account as have say the uk be fully commit to international law and respect the independence of the icj and the icc any such determination on the conduct of war by whichever party would be take by those independent body by expert and by judicial actor and lawyer not by government in follow your request for brevity madam deputy speaker may ask the minister when be the correct time to recognise palestine as state the hon gentleman will know that the uk government be commit to recognise palestine but we be commit to do so in manner that ultimately support the peace process the foreign secretary set that out in detail from this dispatch box just few day ago when the ukraine war start mechanism be put in place for the evacuation of injure child from ukraine to hospital here to ensure that they have appropriate treatment it seem to work effectively and it be the right thing to do in the light of the ceasefire in gaza and the fact that northern gaza healthcare facility have be decimate will the government now instigate scheme for the seriously injure child of gaza include orphan as we do for ukraine by establish system to ensure that they can be bring here for medical treatment it be vital that israel ensure sustained passage for patient who need treatment that be not available in gaza during the first phase of the ceasefire we announce million for the egyptian ministry of health and population deliver through who egypt to support palestinians medically evacuate from gaza official from all relevant whitehall departments be explore avenue to ensure that our support well meet the need of critically ill people in gaza we welcome the release of the hostage though for eight family it will be sad day as they realise that their love one be murder in captivity israel have take considerable risk by withdraw troop open border and agree to the ceasefire while hamas continue to attack in the west bank and continue to humiliate hostage to show that they be in control give that hamas have previously use aid to exercise control of the palestinian population and give the huge link between unrwa and hamas what step be the minister take to ensure that uk aid be not use by hamas to re exercise control in gaza the right hon gentleman be absolutely right about the devastating time that the family of those eight hostage be go through it be really terrible and it be important to underline that at the same time there be extreme relief for those who have be able to return to their family the uk have consistently work hard on this we need to ensure that aid get to where it be really need we have be work on that with number of un agency as well as with body like uk med at the weekend president trump call for clean out of the gaza strip propose to forcibly deport gaza more than million palestinian inhabitant that would amount to ethnic cleansing and crime against humanity will the minister join in condemn president trump remark and will she set out what action the uk government would take to prevent the ethnic cleansing of gaza refer my hon friend to my previous remark the uk government have be very clear that gazans must be able to return to their home that be matter of international humanitarian law despite genocide displacement and destruction palestinians be return to northern gaza and remain rooted in their land in respect of president trump remark the minister have be ask number of time about what appear to be yet another forced displacement what be the position of the minister and her government in respect of president trump remark have say perhaps five time that the uk government be absolutely clear that gazans must be able to return to their home include in northern gaza that be very clear matter of international law thank the minister for her statement and her even handedness both in state the british government position on increase aid to unrwa and in confirm that there can be no role for hamas in future governance the uk have strong track record of bring people together across community to build peace no more so than in northern ireland what lesson on support for civil society and peacebuilde in israel and palestine will the government draw from the last labour government experience in northern ireland my hon friend be right to be clear that the uk have considerable expertise in the area of peacebuilding as it do on so many other question that we have be discuss this afternoon it will be important in future that we do all we can as country to pursue that goal of peace the two state solution that we talk about before however we must in these immediate month make sure that the ceasefire be hold too the fundamental issue be israel occupation of gaza and the west bank what assurance have the minister have from the israeli government that they will withdraw all their force from gaza and that they will eventually if not soon withdraw from the west bank to allow the palestinian people to decide their own future in peace have discuss many of those matter directly with israeli government counterpart have also be to the west bank so that could understand the situation with illegal settlement more directly the uk government position be very clear illegal settlement be illegal they be not allow under international law and we remain determined to make that very clear not just to the israeli government but to all our other partner and multilaterally as well thank the minister for her statement and for the foreign office diplomatic effort in secure the early release of emily damari which we have all be hop and pray for here in the house will the minister assure the house that she will use those same diplomatic effort to secure the early release of british relate hostage in phase and to ensure that the next phase of the deal be agree we be absolutely determined to do all that we can to ensure that the uk link hostage who remain eli sharabi oded lifshitz and avinatan or be bring home to their love one we call for their immediate release and will do all in our power to secure that no one can gainsay the need for humanitarian aid but look forward to the reconstruction phase what enforceable assurance be there that aid provide by this government will not be divert to rebuild terrorist tunnel as happen in the past can the minister trust the united nations relief and works agency when it come to that give its record and give the suggestion that tunnel be build under its very headquarters and that there be data centre there flow off unrwa electricity supply can we place trust in an organisation with such record absolutely the prevention of diversion of aid not just in this context but more broadly wherever the uk be provide aid be incredibly important we take it very seriously indeed and we will always seek to ensure that there be absolutely watertight control around that wherever uk taxpayer money be be use as it be here to support some of the people most in crisis on earth the hon gentleman ask about the issue of unrwa neutrality we have cover that previously in the statement but just point again to the work that the uk have undertake by provide support for unrwa to implement the colonna report there be about million child in gaza to put that in context we have about million child in scotland too before be elect work for save the children and have meet the child of the palestinian refugee camp of course we welcome the ceasefire which be long overdue those child now face homelessness hunger and lack of access to medical supply not to mention disruption in their education all child life be equal whether they be scottish or gazan what be the uk government do to protect the child of gaza at this time we be deeply alarmed by the disproportionate impact of the conflict on child in gaza my hon friend talk about education and will just mention that area in the interest of time he be right about the extreme disruption at least of school building will need full or major reconstruction and most if not all student in gaza have not have access to education since october the uk have be support work on that include through the un office for the co ordination of humanitarian affairs and unrwa rise call kim johnson to ask the final question since the ceasefire we have see an increase in killing and atrocity in jenin on saturday israeli force be responsible for the killing of two year old girl the extremist settler be act with impunity against the palestinians will the minister explain what action this government have take to put pressure on israel to prevent the ongoing atrocity in the west bank the uk government have be absolutely clear on that settler expansion and settler violence have reach record level the israeli government seize more of the west bank in than in the past year that be completely unacceptable the matter have be raise by number of member of the ministerial team not least the foreign secretary he also announce new sanction in october which target illegal settler outpost and organisation that have support violence against community in the west bank thank the minister for her statement as point of clarity member need to be present in the chamber for the minister statement if they wish to ask question sudan and eastern drc with permission madam deputy speaker will make statement on the situation in sudan and eastern democratic republic of the congo the late conflict in sudan have now last month this weekend the rapid support forces attack the last functional hospital in the besiege city of el fasher in darfur the world health organisation assess that some patient and their family be kill the attack be far from isolated in recent week the rsf shell the zamzam camp where displace people be trap outside el fasher while there be disturb report of extrajudicial killing by militia align to the sudanese armed force in wad madani the government condemn those attack in the strong possible term they show callous disregard for international humanitarian law and innocent sudanese civilian exact figure for those kill and displace in sudan be hard to come by but we know aid be be block from reach those in need this be without shadow of doubt one of the big humanitarian catastrophe of our lifetime see that for myself last week in adré on the chad sudan border in the first ever foreign secretary visit to chad feel duty to confront the true horror of what be unfold to bear witness and to raise up the voice of those mainly woman suffer so horrendously eighty eight per cent of the refugee at the adré crossing be woman and child meet nurse in clinic fight to save the life of starve child meet woman who show her scar she have be burn she have be beat and she have be rap turn to drc conflict have grip the east for more than year an rebel offensive at the start of this year have already seize masisi and minova this weekend see they enter goma the region major city which last occupy in brave un peacekeeper from south africa malawi and uruguay have tragically be kill and with hundred of thousand have already flee to goma there be potential for further humanitarian catastrophe have not yet travel as foreign secretary to meet those flee eastern drc but the report speak for themselves this be one of the most dangerous place in the world to be woman or girl child as young as nine be be attack and mutilate by machete wield militia around quarter of the drc population be face acute food insecurity and there be frequent bombardment of the makeshift camp that shelter those who have flee their home regret to say that foreign secretaries update the house on conflict in africa be something of rarity as discuss yesterday with african ambassador and high commissioner the surge in global conflict include the number in africa almost double in the past decade this be cause untold damage and hold back economic growth the bedrock of our future partnership with african country but where be the outrage again and again in adré be ask what be the world do to help we the truth be that if we be witness the horror of el fasher and goma on any other continent or for that matter see the extremist violence in the sahel and somalia anywhere else in the world there would be far more attention across the western world indeed one recent survey of armed conflict in contain spotlight on europe eurasia asia and the americas but none on africa there should be no hierarchy of conflict but there be one every human life be of equal worth the impact of these war be clear for all to see we have only to be willing to look could not face atrocity such as these and shrug my shoulder however the house will also recognise the uk national interest in address these conflict irregular migration from sudan to britain alone increase by last year unscrupulous smuggling gang be look to profit from the misery in place such as sudan and the drc the long these war last the great their ripple effect neighbour such as chad be work hard to manage this crisis alongside other nearby but further escalation only increase instability and the risk of conflict elsewhere with sudan sit along the major trade route of the red sea and eastern drc one of the most resource rich region in the world this be something that we can not tolerate this government therefore refuse to let these conflict be forget work with sierra leone the uk prepare un security council resolution on sudan to address the humanitarian crisis shockingly despite the support of every other member include china russia wield its veto but russian cynicism will not deter we we will continue to use our security council seat to shine light on what be happen and work with our african partner on broad un reform we have also double uk aid to sudan support more than million displace people see our impact at the adré crossing and announce furth million to support food production and sexual and reproductive service the uk be the third large donor in the crisis have offer almost million in support this financial year we have be redouble our diplomatic effort as well in the spring be look to gather ministers in the uk to galvanise international support for peace we need to see three thing first the rsf and the sudanese armed force commit to permanent ceasefire and the protection of civilian secondly unrestricted humanitarian access into and within sudan and permanent un presence and finally an international commitment to sustained and meaningful political process instead of new and even more deadly weapon enter the conflict we want consistent call for all political party to unite behind common vision of peaceful sudan we will engage with all those willing to work to bring the conflict to an end on the drc as well the uk have react quickly to the current crisis we now advise british national not to travel to the rubavu district in western rwanda on the border with goma we be continue our humanitarian assistance have provide million this financial year this enable lifesave assistance such as clean drinking water treatment for malnourished child and support for victim of sexual violence ultimately however we need political solution we know that rebel could not have take goma without material support from rwandan defence force my noble friend lord collins of highbury and have be urge all side to engage in good faith in african lead process lord collins speak to the rwandan and angolan foreign ministers last week and in the past few day have speak to rwandan president kagame and south african foreign minister lamola for all the complexity of such long run conflict we must find way to stop the killing civilian in sudan and eastern drc must feel so powerless power seem grip by those wag war around they the government and our partner can not simply will ceasefire into being but that be not licence for inaction as with gaza it can take hundred of day of diplomatic failure to reach even the most fragile of ceasefire so for our part the uk will keep do all in our power to focus the world on these conflict and somehow bring they to an end commend this statement to the house call the shadow foreign secretary be grateful to the foreign secretary for advance sight of his statement and for the way he have speak about sudan and the drc both conflict be truly shocking and be result in an ongoing displacement crisis with million of innocent people have to flee their home as he have highlight in his statement and in his discussion with the african nation and their diplomat armed conflict in africa continue to cause immense human suffering and of course great pressure on united nations peacekeeping the scale of food insecurity be enormous the most horrific crime be be commit against civilian systematic human right abuse sexual violence torture and mass civilian casualty we be deeply concerned by the intensification of the fighting in eastern drc and its humanitarian consequence we continue to urge all party to deliver on their commitment which be agree through the regional peace process we welcome the mediation effort facilitate by the angolan lead luanda peace process and continue to urge all party to commit to further political dialogue in government my party be commit to the protection of civilian in and around goma the foreign secretary will be deeply aware of the long stand work that take place there include through the three year humanitarian programme for the east of drc which seek to deliver lifesave emergency assistance to more than million people and to protect and build resilience for the most vulnerable despite all of that it be important that we learn more and understand what the root cause be and how we can bring great stability and peace to the drc what be happen in darfur must also not be tolerate the conflict in sudan have put pressure on neighbouring country which be already under immense strain and be create level of human misery that be totally unconscionable our main overreaching objective be clear and we both agree that we need an immediate ceasefire and an end to all hostility in sudan the uk government work with international partner must leave no stone unturned as they try to press the war party into ceasefire the government must also do everything within their power to hold those responsible for the atrocity to account because red line have be cross in this conflict and we can not stand by the foreign secretary will know that the conservative government apply range of sanction in the past on those support the activity of the rapid support forces and the sudanese armed force as the penholder on sudan at the united nations security council will the foreign secretary update the house on what action be likely to follow at the unsc the world can and should be do much more as the foreign secretary have rightly say so what recent discussion have he have with other country that could be do much more to leverage their own influence that also apply to the neighbouring region will he provide an update on the work of saudi arabia and other help with the important jeddah process and whether that be on track on sanction do the foreign secretary intend to go far perhaps follow the us lead do he discuss the matter in his call with secretary rubio because sudan be not in the read out and be not reference at all will he speak more about the united nations reform that he have just touch on the us administration be also review all their aid programme so be that discuss in his call with secretary rubio beyond sanction be he work to identify other hard hit way to put pressure on the leadership of the rsf and the saf and those support those awful war machine while the conflict continue to rage we need laser like focus on the humanitarian assistance and do not just mean on the type or volume important though that is if british aid be be send and be get through we must ensure that it get over the border and be distribute to the people it be intend to help will the foreign secretary share his late assessment of the state of the border crossing in sudan how much aid be get through each day and from which crossing point when the aid get inside sudan be the safeguard there to ensure that it get to the people who need it and do he have the mechanism in place to measure the impact on the subject of aid this might be premature but will the foreign secretary speak about the government plan for the future of aid funding give the forthcoming spending review while this dreadful war persist what be he do to increase effort to collect evidence of the crime commit so that those responsible can be hold accountable and face justice the foreign secretary have speak in recent day about the vile people smuggle gang he mention the matter not just in this statement but in his previous write statement will far comprehensive action be take to target those miserable vile and evil criminal gang what more will the government do to put this whole issue to an end and ensure that this destruction and displacement across these two country come to an end be grateful to the right hon lady of course know that she too draw some heritage from the african continent and so will take these issue very seriously also know the work of the right hon member for sutton coldfield mr mitchell before come to office he do lot on the humanitarian aid side particularly in relation to sudan the conflict in sudan have create as say the world large humanitarian crisis thirty million people half of sudan population be now in urgent need to make it clear to the house that be more than afghanistan bangladesh gaza and mali combine that be how bad the situation currently be that be why raise this issue with secretary of state rubio when speak to he yesterday although because of all the issue in front of we it be brief conversation we both say we would return to the issue and we discuss the fact that be keen to convene group of nation include regional partner on this very same issue on sanction since the conflict the uk have freeze the asset of nine commercial entity link to the party involve in the conflict we obviously do not talk about what more we might be consider but of course we keep that under review the right hon lady rightly ask about un reform be pleased to see that the united states recently make statement under the last administration but be sure that that be cross party position that africa should be represent on the un security council that have be our long stand view over here my assessment of the adré crossing be real concern that the government in sudan be say that that crossing should be close on february we disagree with they it should remain open there be real issue about access and one of the thing be press for with international colleague be that the un should be represent its agency and body should be able to work unfettered in sudan and civilian must be protect recent event at el fasher be very worrying indeed but hope that with regional partner and those internationally engaged we can at least come to an agreement that the un should be present and that civilian should be protect particularly when they be overwhelmingly woman and child do also raise the position in the drc with secretary of state rubio when speak to he yesterday in fact he raise that issue with and his real concern about it be clear with president kagame on sunday that rwanda must act to de escalate this conflict and return to dialogue say that an attack on goma would provoke strong response from the international community and from speak to other nation my sense be that that be what rwanda can expect rwanda receive over billion of global aid every year include around million of bilateral uk assistance all of that be under threat when you attack your neighbour and we in this house be clear that we can not have country challenge the territorial integrity of other country just as we will not tolerate it in the continent of europe we can not tolerate it wherever in the world it happen we have to be clear about that the uk have sanction and other armed group through the sanctions and anti money laundering act there be currently individual and nine entity list under un sanction and again we keep that list under review the shadow foreign secretary have rightly talk about the work of the last government in relation to humanitarian assistance and put on record the work that they lead on both side of this horrendous conflict we be provide million this year for programme in eastern drc thank the foreign secretary for his update and for his clear and deeply feel commitment to sudan it be the large humanitarian crisis on record yet both of the war party be choke humanitarian access the saf have block the un from reach area control by the rsf while the rsf be increasingly impose bureaucratic obstacle to delay and block aid what measure be the foreign secretary take to ensure that both of the war party and their international backer be allow vital aid to get in there have be effort in the past the us try to lead effort and all regional partner the egyptians and the chadians want to see those effort bear fruit however the truth be that the people meet be suffer horrendously when you be at crossing meet those flee for their life you be always aware that you be often meet those close to the border and those with the mean to arrange for smuggler to get they out despite the million who have leave and be now displace ten of million more be still stick in sudan unable to leave for all those reason we have to be crystal clear about the access issue not just the fact of aid but the fact that we want the aid to get through and reach the people who it need to reach call the liberal democrat spokesperson welcome the foreign secretary statement and thank he for advance sight of it he be right to say that the crisis in sudan will go down in history as one of the big humanitarian catastrophe of our lifetime welcome the foreign secretary visit to this region and his personal engagement with it and for update this house on conflict in africa my party agree with he that our level of concern for those affect by conflict overseas should never be influence by their location the foreign secretary be also right to draw the house attention to the escalation of violence by in goma pursuit of mineral resource remind we of the drc tragedy of have such rich that trigger such violence the announcement of increase uk aid to sudan in november be welcome as be the furth million deploy at the weekend the foreign secretary be right to say that the uk aid budget not only reduce suffering but reduce the pressure on refugee to make hazardous journey in search of sanctuary elsewhere yet the uk ability to respond to humanitarian and conflict situation be reduce by the government failure to commit to the target for official development assistance will the foreign secretary explain to the house why it be report yesterday that million have be cut from the integrate security fund which would likely mean less money for conflict reduction work can he say what assessment he have make of the impact of the trump administration instruction that all us aid programme be suspend welcome the foreign secretary plan to convene foreign ministers to galvanise international effort to seek ceasefire but can he say by when this meeting will take place and how he plan to leverage the uk position as the security council penholder on sudan can he confirm that the government will not prematurely recognise any allege authority government in sudan when the country be so divided and how do he propose to reduce the interference of external power include russia iran the united arab emirates and now china in the conflict be very grateful to the hon gentleman on what be happen in rwanda and the drc many year ago in this year an all party parliamentary group on the african great lake region be set up be member of it and the then mp for bethnal green and bow oona king chair it for while that be when first go to the region in the wake of the awful horrendous ethnic member genocide and genocide we see in rwanda back in that period and that be when become familiar with the issue the hon gentleman raise the issue of the target on development spend understand why those feeling be strongly feel about development but he know that we have billion black hole we want to get there eventually but it will take we some time notwithstanding that the uk still make major contribution in development aid spending at time when we be see right across the global community aid spending fall because of the cost of living crisis with inflation and the effect that it have on western population it be too early to make an assessment of some of the change we have read about with the trump administration be tell and advise that there be an day process for the new administration to look at these issue however it be interesting to that secretary of state rubio raise the drc with before raise it with he we head to the munich conference in few week time where these issue will of course be discuss and hope we will be able to convene and come together on the issue of sudan shortly thereafter welcome the foreign secretary statement and the work he be do to shine light on the crisis as he say this be about not just the amount of aid but the crucial issue of access there be quite clearly unequal access for the un in distribute aid in sudan can ask how we be support organisation on the ground in sudan particularly sudanese aid organisation to deliver aid in the area be very grateful for that question because there be lively civil society still at work in sudan and ngos be on the ground in sudan do what they can in the absence of un agency able to do that work be grateful that the world food programme facilitate my trip to the chad border with sudan and to see truck go in with the world food programme name emblazon on they that may bring some alleviation to the suffering however must say that in my conversation with the driver they talk about truck be hijack the change the barrier and not be able to get as far as they would like there be still serious issue on the ground thank the foreign secretary for his kind remark on sudan commend the foreign secretary for go to chad visit the same location last year and he will have see the clear and horrific evidence that this be the world bad humanitarian crisis while he be there do he make it clear to the president of chad that the use of his private airport by foreign power to arm and assist the rsf be completely unacceptable on the drc as the foreign secretary rightly say everyone should draw back and engage with the luanda process do he agree that it would help if the congolese army do not so clearly make common cause with the democratic forces for the liberation of rwanda who perpetrate the genocide to which he refer and who pose serious threat to rwanda security and be responsible for the murder of nearly million tutsi in my bilateral conversation with the president of chad be extensive be accompany by the foreign minister for most of the hour that be there and my concern for the woman and child be heartfelt recognise the huge burden of displace people that chad bear as well it can underline the uk clear position on the conflict the action of the party and the need for regional partner to support political process to end the bloodshed on the situation in the drc have speak to president kagame also speak to south africa minister of international relations and cooperation follow the murder of its peacekeeper and lord collins have speak to range of african partner all of whom have stake the kenyans and the angolans have be do lot to move forward the luanda process which urge kigali to continue to work on accord to un expert the uae have be provide arm and support to the rapid support forces through its network in libya chad the central african republic south sudan and uganda those arm and supply have reportedly be disguise as humanitarian aid raise serious concern about the uae role in exacerbate conflict and suffering in sudan the uae be one of the uk large arm buyer with billion of pound worth of defence export license in recent year give the gravity of those allegation and the uk obligation under international law will the government commit to end all arm sale to the uae unless it can be unequivocally verify that they be no long supply the rsf say to the hon gentleman that we the hon lady forgive be still suffer from jetlag we hold regular discussion with all regional partner about the conflict in sudan include saudi arabia the uae egypt and african partner as she would expect any sustainable process for peace in sudan require the support of all those in the region and beyond thank the foreign secretary for come and make this statement he be right to say that these devastating conflict in africa be often overlook and thank he for that as it be something number of member have mention in the past will he review the conflict budget as some of the international ngos be often there when nobody else be and no other attention be be pay on sudan in particular and secretary blinken remark around genocide be commit what implication do that have for uk foreign policy on the drc the foreign secretary mention the material support from rwanda but what action be he take regard all those who have facilitate the conflict and what action and change in policy will we see from the fcdo on the first point let be clear we have come in as new government and we think there be an important role for conflict mediation build on the historic role that this country have play include in northern ireland we have real strength and we want to work with partner such as norway and other on conflict reassure the hon gentleman about that of course recognise that there be broad regional issue that be why want to convene and the uk will continue to play its role that be why we bring the un resolution with sierra leone and why have be try to rally support globally frankly that be why visit take the opportunity of ceasefire in gaza to draw attention to this issue and galvanise the world welcome the foreign secretary visit to malnutrition clinic on the border of chad and sudan and the additional funding for the region sudan have one of the high rate of malnutrition in the world he say he have have discussion with regional actor but can he go far and update we on where those discussion be what process be under way can he give further detail on his assessment of how aid be currently get in across the adré border especially ready to use therapeutic food which be vital in stop malnutrition and starvation in child the experience of visit with médecins sans frontières small clinic in chad with malnourished baby child and their mother know be make ministerial trip but also not know whether these small baby would survive in the day ahead be heartrende thank médecins sans frontières for all it be do to keep those child alive and to support those mother it be why we be not only double our aid to sudan but increase our aid to chad next door which be bear the brunt of all those displace people who have come my hon friend ask how we be continue to work on this issue with our partner chair sudan session with foreign ministers during the plus the arab quint we discuss collective action and how the and the quint could take the war party and push for improved humanitarian access the protection of civilian and increase aid will continue to redouble my effort in that regard the foreign secretary be right to come here to express his dismay and frustration which we all share but what assessment have he make of the effectiveness of the united nations in this it seem that its mission be fail even the measured and balanced resolution that he put together with sierra leone fail to get through on november would it not be well to look instead at underscore the importance of an african solution to this in that respect what discussion have he have with the african union notwithstanding that it be crucial that currently suspend member be involve in the process the right hon gentleman be right to raise the important role of the united nations be hugely disappoint that russia continue to block progress in the un security council notwithstanding the pressure applaud the work of the un agency in particular and what they be attempt to do remind he of the work of the world food programme the office for the co ordination of humanitarian affairs and other it be important that there be un presence in sudan and that its agency can work unfettered there clearly the fact that unesco have pledge to withdraw in the drc be real issue give what be happen and therefore what could flow from it end its period in the country despite the pressure over the last year thank the foreign secretary for his statement an article in the lancet this month illustrate an alarming rise in multiple life threaten infectious disease include cholera dengue fever malaria measle and polio due to the destruction of health and sanitation infrastructure how be the uk support progress in secure humanitarian access to life save treatment for these disease such as malaria and do he agree that this support be need as these infection have an impact worldwide if we allow these infection to fester it will have implication for humanity thank my hon friend for her work in raise these issue from the back benches there have be worrying outbreak of dengue fever in particular meet individual who suffer as consequence of that and malaria be rife we will do all that we can to support that work but the aid access issue in sudan in particular make that extremely difficult that be why we must have process that allow for unfettered aid to reach those in sudan who need it join hon member in thank the foreign secretary

sudan border and commend he for bear witness there be no substitute for do that since april there have be more than attack on healthcare facility in sudan and more than healthcare worker have be kill the foreign secretary will know that attack on hospital and healthcare be grow and grotesque phenomenon across the world do he think we could use our position on the un security council as the lead on the protection of civilian to bring together country and drive forward action to protect healthcare and health facility across the world my hon friend raise an important issue we can not live in world where the rule be disregarded and where aid and peace worker be murder as they go about their business this have be the most horrendous period for the loss of life of good people do good work will

outline on the broad agenda how we will make this the year we actually protect woman right in conflict and ensure that their voice be hear be very grateful that that be the subject of the last question one reason why the world be not pay attention to these crisis be that they be in the continent of africa the second reason fear be gendere it be woman who be suffer it be man who be do the fighting and woman who be be leave behind we can not go backwards for all those reason urge parliamentarian to secure debate and raise these issue with the colleague they meet from other parliamentary democracy so we get attention back on these woman and child in both conflict and across so many other who be suffer horrendously thank the foreign secretary we get through quite lot of question point of order on point of order madam deputy speaker seek your advice the children wellbeing and schools bill be make its way through the house of commons indeed we be well into the committee stage yet still we do not have an impact assessment to show what effect it will have that impede the ability of member to properly scrutinise the bill therefore seek your advice on what more we can do to force the government to publish the impact assessment be grateful to the right hon member for give notice of her point of order the government own guide to make legislation make it clear that final impact assessment must be make available alongside bills introduce to parliament do not know why that have not happen in this case but clearly it be unsatisfactory that the impact assessment be not available to the public bill committee be sure that those on the treasury bench will have note her remark on point of order madam deputy speaker you will be aware that there have be major disruption in northern ireland and indeed in part of scotland due to last week storm hundred of thousand of home business and family be leave without electricity and some without water ten of thousand be still in the same position five day later know the matter be raise yesterday in the house but in rural area along with major disruption they have no online facility mean no business can be do include last minute tax return to his majesty revenue and customs have the prime minister the secretary of state for northern ireland or the secretary of state for scotland indicate that they will come to the house to spell out what additional step they be propose to help we bring this crisis to speedy but overdue end be grateful to the hon member for give notice of his point of order have have no indication that any minister be come to the house to make statement today but he will recall that the chancellor of the duchy of lancaster make statement to the house yesterday in which he describe the measure the uk government be take in scotland and northern ireland to address the impact of the storm on point of order madam deputy speaker on january in response to question on child protection the prime minister tell this house reasonable people can agree or disagree on whether further inquiry be necessary official report january vol yet over the past week the hon member for stockton west matt vickers the shadow policing minister have use social medium to link councillor who vote against new national inquiry with groom gang in accordance with the custom of this house have inform the hon member for stockton west that intend to name he madam deputy speaker those post have incite vile comment online include councillor be accuse of be paedophile one comment chillingly read hope people find out where they live and start persecute they we know too well that such word online can lead to real world consequence one councillor be specifically target through pay social medium advertisement people turn up at her home and terrorise she with yobs bray at her door other councillor have be verbally assault member of this house have benefit from the good office of mr speaker who have champion their safety and security be sure madam deputy speaker that all be appal by the depraved behaviour of child grooming and rape gang but to exploit that suffer for political gain be frankly sicken would be grateful if you could advise on the most appropriate way to highlight the potential consequence of our word to all member in particular the shadow policing minister if indeed he be consider fit to continue in that role thank the hon member for give notice of his point of order and note that he inform the hon member for stockton west that he intend to refer to he in the chamber the chair be not responsible for comment make by member on social medium but urge all member to reflect carefully on the likely impact of what they post online woman state pension age ombudsman report and compensation scheme motion for leave to bring in bill standing order no beg to move that leave be give to bring in bill to require the secretary of state to publish measure to address the finding of the parliamentary and health service ombudsman in its report entitle women state pension age our finding on injustice and associate issue to require the secretary of state to publish proposal for compensation scheme for woman bear between april and april inclusive who have be affect by increase in the state pension age and for connected purpose do so with no joy whatsoever indeed my reason for do so be bear more out of complete and utter frustration but because it be the right thing to do for number of reason it be the right thing to do because we require trust in politic and think that all of we at this moment in time certainly in this chamber be conscious of the breakdown in trust between ourselves in this parliament and the public outside for those of we who have stand alongside the waspi woman for many year for those of we who have pledge to support the waspi woman for many year for those of we who promise to take action if we be ever to gain government office it be important that that trust be repay and my bill seek to do that it seek to do the right thing by those to whom we make promise this be also the right thing to do because for many of the woman who be impact this injustice be not alone throughout their life many will unfortunately have be impact by the fact that they do not receive salary comparable to that of their male counterpart these be woman who will have face the injustice of know that they be not able to get themselves up the career ladder simply because they be woman and there be male counterpart they be the people who will have know that whether or not they be go to have child might well decide what their career opportunity be it be an unforgivable injustice that they have to experience and we should not be compound that injustice by not give they the compensation they deserve for have their pension entitlement change this be also the right thing to do because the parliamentary and health service ombudsman tell we it that be the right thing to do if we do not have trust and confidence in the estate in which we operate and if we do not support the outcome of our ombudsman must simply ask where be the public to go where be they to place their trust the ombudsman make it abundantly clear that these woman be the victim of maladministration and that the department for work and pensions have not act in the way that it should have do much bad than that however the ombudsman be clear that the dwp could not be trust to rectify the wrong that it have impose on those woman so what happen we be effectively delegate the responsibility to respond and what do we see we see government turn their back on those woman but not before of course they have hold placard not before of course they have give warm word when they have feel that it be politically expedient to do so let we listen to some of those warm word let we start off with the prime minister of the united kingdom who say all your work life you ve get in mind the date on which you can retire and get your pension and just as you get towards it the goalpost be move and you do get it and it real injustice let we look at what the deputy prime minister say they want their money back and quite rightly so let we look at what the chancellor of the exchequer say pleasure to speak in the state pension age debate and talk about woman who be be treat so badly govt please listen waspi the home secretary say want to keep fight for fair deal for the waspi woman the business secretary say have always support local campaigner and will continue to stand up for the waspi woman of tameside know you will fight on the defence secretary say labour will correct this historic wrong for those of we in scotland let we look north of the border the leader of the labour party in scotland anas sarwar say under my leadership waspi woman will finally receive the justice they deserve the wide labour party in scotland state labour will right the historical wrong of pension discrimination by compensate more than woman in scotland with an average of when labour win scotland woman win what happen parcel of rogue indeed be one of many who be in this chamber prior to christmas when the secretary of state for work and pensions decide to make statement right before parliament break off to confirm that the government be sorry for the maladministration that take place that they be go to make sure the department for work and pensions which inflict this wrong upon those woman would never do so again and that lesson would be learn but that be your lot the evidence they use to back up their decision not to award any compensation in fact not even to discuss the concept of compensation in this chamber be base upon the datum as understand it of just respondent from many year ago the government then go on to say that there be no money at all as if they be not the one who get to decide how money be spend as if they be not the one who have decide to box themselves in on pretty much every tax lever that exist as if appreciate that not everyone in the chamber will agree with on this point they be not the one who have decide to simply accept the broken economic norm form by leave the european union and reject access to the single market and the custom union and to accept that it will cause economic damage and limit the money be available to they none of that be their fault at all how very dare they do they think the public be zip up the back do they think the waspi woman be not listen and watch the decision they have choose to take this be defining issue many of we in the last parliament watch on as tv show change the mind of the government in respect of the post office horizon scandal many of we watch on as parliament force the government to change tack on the infected blood scandal many of we have speak about the equitable life scandal the hillsborough disaster the loan charge debacle and indeed the waspi campaign define issue of the last parliament can still be define issue of this parliament but only if the government act to provide the compensation and redress that these woman so badly deserve there be man who go on to become the prime minister of the united kingdom who say the wall of westminster be so high he be infer that we do not listen to what the public want nor do we see what they be fight for and what they believe in but we know where the public stand on this issue we know that they believe the waspi woman should be give the compensation that they deserve and with this bill we will seek to provide it question put

on the amendment table by the government for consideration on report which will take the opportunity to speak to now will start with government amendment which be minor and technical amendment that ensure that clause encompass new enforcement function arise from the change make to clause in the other place government amendment clarifie that cost recovery power for the environment agency expand by the provision in clause also extend to cost incur when enforce the requirement to publish implementation plan that requirement be add on report in the lords after cross party discussion and

in wales as well as for plan cover england which be already include in clause such clarification ensure that the ea regulator in both england and wales can fully recover cost for the extent of their water company enforcement activity and carry out their duty and function effectively the government have table amendment to in order to commence clause on royal assent that will give ofwat and company certainty on when the power to make rule on remuneration and governance will come into force and will therefore be useful to company in plan for the financial year commencement of clause on royal assent will ensure ofwat can implement its rule as soon as possible follow its statutory consultation with relevant person which include the secretary of state welsh ministers and the consumer council for water know that some member have express concern around the timeline over which ofwat rule will come into effect therefore hope the alteration to the commencement provision for clause will reassure those member that the government and the regulator be absolutely committed to ensure ofwat rule be put in place as quickly as possible now turn to new clause which be the most substantial of the government amendment as have state before this government be government of service and we be absolutely committed to take action to address water poverty we be work with industry to keep exist support scheme under review to ensure vulnerable customer across the country be support we also expect company to hold themselves accountable for their public commitment to end water poverty by and will work with the sector to ensure appropriate measure be take to deliver that that be why we have table the new clause which add to the exist power to provide for special charging arrangement for customer in need the new provision will enable water company to provide consistent support for consumer across the country it will also allow for automatic enrolment on any future scheme and broad information sharing between public authority and water company the clause impose requirement for consultation on any future scheme and it also amend the digital economy act to ensure that water company identify eligible customer and that they get the full support to which they be entitle be grateful to the minister for give way and for her ongoing discussion about drainage and local authority and other water relate matter on the issue of water poverty can she confirm that either as part of the bill or as an adjunct to it when water company fail to deliver an adequate service in new build situation where new house be build but the water infrastructure be insufficient to furnish those new house with the proper supply of water the bill and the regulatory environment that she have just describe will allow customer to get their entitlement and to free themselves from water poverty as she put it thank the right hon gentleman for his intervention and also for the many time that he have talk to about internal drainage board since become minister on his question if customer be not get the service to which they be entitle that be absolutely something that should be take through ofwat and the regulator be more than happy to pick that matter up with he outside the chamber hope that member across the house will agree that new clause be welcome addition to the bill ensure that the government have the necessary power in place to bring forward secondary legislation in future once we have thoroughly consider all option for improve the support available for vulnerable customer do the minister agree that it be supremely unjust that in wales customer face some of the high bill for their water despite have some of the low income in the united kingdom bill have obviously have to increase in the late price review because we have have record level of under investment in our infrastructure however new clause be intend to ensure great fairness it be important for struggle customer that he as the local member of parliament be talk to the water company to ensure that they be inform about the support mechanism that be available and about how they can access they and everything else to which they be entitle be extremely grateful to the minister for give way she will know that just of outfall be monitor when labour last leave office be pleased to say that that figure be now do she not agree that new clause would ensure that the fine collect from pollute water company through the water restoration fund which be found by the conservatives in be use to improve and prevent further deterioration of our waterway include our precious chalk stream will she now do what we all look to ministers to do which be pirouette at the dispatch box recognise the rightness of the cause and change course the right hon gentleman be indeed an eager beaver as much as do not wish to pour water on his enthusiasm will of course respond to all the amendment at the end of this stage of the bill as protocol expect hope he be able to contain his excitement and be look forward to my final comment on that area and shall be practise my pirouette in anticipation wish to pay special thank to the welsh government the deputy first minister and the official who have work so openly and collaboratively with the uk government throughout the development and passage of this bill also thank the senedd for their consent which we receive on january look forward to continue to work closely with our welsh counterpart to protect our river lake and sea particularly those that cross our border thank my hon friend for all her work on this bill do she agree that we have make much more progress on ban boss bonus in the six month that we have be in office than the conservatives do in year that excellent point be well make by my hon friend hope all hon member agree that the amendment table by the government will only strengthen this bill and will support new clause rise order we have many contribution to come and quite tight deadline so back benchers will be limit to four minute call the shadow minister appreciate the opportunity to discuss this vital issue of water quality once again as his majesty most loyal opposition have maintain through the passage of the bill it be just an attempt to copy and paste some of the work do by the previous conservative government and the measure take to identify the problem we will not shy away from the fact that the conservative government be the first to identify the scale of the sewage problem and actually to start to address it as my right hon friend the member for beverley and holderness graham stuart just say when labour leave office in only of storm overflow be monitor when we conservative leave office last year be monitor and our landmark environment act pave the way to improve the quality of our precious water however we be under no illusion there be always more that can be do and we have always say that we will seek to work constructively to make the bill as effective as possible in that spirit thank the minister for her willingness to discuss matter of the bill with and with colleague across the house the minister in the other place baroness hayman show an equal willingness to listen to suggestion from colleague also thank member of the bill committee for their constructive approach and all the bill team department for environment food and rural affairs and parliamentary staff support this legislation and our scrutiny of it as result of that dialogue the bill now include welcome improvement in several area such as company requirement to produce implementation report to outline how they envision their commitment on improve water quality happen as well as consideration of nature base solution in licensing activity however in that same constructive spirit the opposition today ask the government to go even far we want the government to back our new clause mandate the water restoration fund which have cross party support in committee thank the good folk of the conservative environment network and wildlife and countryside link for their support and campaigning on the new clause as well as the angling trust for its discussion also thank the former mp for ludlow and former chair of the environmental audit committee philip dunne for his assiduous effort to see the fund introduce these be very substantial sum water company in my region be fin million the year before last it be vital that these amount go to our chalk stream which be in desperate need of they totally agree with my right hon friend it be right that if water company do the wrong thing the money levy from they be plough back into improve the water and not back into treasury coffer the water restoration fund since be introduce by the previous conservative government provide million for community to repair their local waterway and restore they to the quality they should be to follow up the point make by our right hon friend the member for new forest west sir desmond swayne that money will ultimately come from water bill payer it will be ordinary family across the country who must contribute to the million fine or whatever be impose on our water company for that to be take and then swallow by the treasury rather than use to improve water would be disgrace do he not agree that the government must accept new clause thank my right hon friend for that intervention will come on to an amendment we have also table to ensure that if fine be levy on water company customer bill go down accordingly so that taxpayer and bill payer be not penalise for water company do the wrong thing the government have make ejection in this house and in the other place to the principle of ringfence the funding and have state the need for the treasury to have flexibility on how it spend that money but in this specific case their argument still do not stack up where money come from taxation ringfencing be not always the most reliable way to ensure that the treasury can have the spending power it need to deliver that spending but here we be talk about something very different fine be much more uncertain and provide less of guarantee regard the amount of money they will bring in to rely on those fund for day to day treasury spending do not make sense ringfence those penalty for our water restoration fund be sensible measure that enable government to guarantee they can meet specific need water company pay the fine for the damage they have do and the local community affect be empower to have their local waterway restore it be worth repeat the fine detail of our amendment it should not go ignore that this will also improve chalk stream it be incredibly disappointing that over christmas the government reveal that they have abandon plan by the conservatives to recover our chalk stream give that england be home to of the world chalk stream failure to act on this issue neglect vital duty to protect key part of our environment in light of this we believe that the government need to think again about reject our important amendment which be matter of principle matter of justice in right wrong and fundamental commitment to water quality when it come to improve our water it be support those who be most affect when water company fail to abide by their duty that be at the heart of the opposition concern the british public as individual consumer bill payer and member of local community customer must not pay the price for water company failure to do their duty whether financial environmental or otherwise as such the opposition have table new clause which would require the defra secretary of state to provide that where water company have face financial penalty for failure to comply with the law financial amount equal to those penalty must be remove from the bill of that water company consumer this be very important as toxic cocktail of poor behaviour by water company and rise bill price have lead to many people feel that they be receive poor value for money and not get the quality water service that they deserve concomitant reduction in customer bill that people will see directly on their statement will be real and tangible sign that poor behaviour be not go unchecked the government have previously reject the proposal but we urge they to think again about this simple yet effective amendment that would do so much to underpin all the work that be be do and protect bill payer turn to some of our further amendment our concern about the water industry and finance extend to what be in the bill as it stand in particular the provision for special administration order in clause and which the opposition have raise in the other place and in committee those clause would give the government the power to recover any loss they make through place company in special administration by raise consumer bill my conservative colleague in the other place sound the alarm on this issue and put on record again my thank to they for do so if water company require the government to place they in special administration through their own failure why should consumer foot the bill for failure they have have no influence on or responsibility for that be particularly the case if customer bill will rise as result of mismanagement by company whose service they do not even rely on this proposal run contrary to the nature of all the action take in recent year to improve water quality whereby company that be responsible for fail to get their affair in order must take responsibility we have all be starkly aware of concern surround the financial resilience of thames water and as many will know ofwat monitor financial resilience report in november identify company that need an increase level of monitoring engagement concern financial resilience we acknowledge that the government believe that they expect to use special administration order as last resort and in limited circumstance however it be the opposition firm belief that an injustice remain with people have to pay for company that they have no connection to we have therefore table amendment and which would explicitly forbid the raising of price for consumer who do not use the service of the water company that be in special administration we believe this be fair and reasonable compromise that the government should accept so that we can work to improve the water industry financial practice we have also table new clause which would amend the water industry act to insert new rule regard limit on the amount of money that can be borrow by water company regrettably the government reject this sensible measure in committee so we have table it again to ensure that water company do not excessively borrow money which be ultimately bad for bill payer when we talk about financial resilience the heart of the issue be concern about borrowing and the resultant over leverage in the industry we will be push that new clause to division we will also be support the measure on nature recovery that we table in committee we will be look very closely at some of the amendment from the liberal democrats new clause which they table in committee would abolish ofwat at that stage we point out that the new clause be not explicit about what it would transition to so we do not believe that be sensible way forward new clause would grant the government power to create unified scheme of charge arrangement for customer in need of support regardless of the specific supplier and introduce consultation for that purpose although the opposition welcome look at that can the government please ensure that other consumer do not face rise bill as result it will be interesting to see what the government do with that to conclude we urge the government not to waste this opportunity to make this bill properly effective member on both side of the house want clean water system healthy water environment financially resilient water company and fairness for the consumer the government have the opportunity to work towards that with the constructive suggestion make by his majesty loyal opposition we have make those suggestion at all stage of the bill and we urge the government to take they forward back benchers be on four minute limit refer member to my entry in the register of members financial interests first thank efra ministers for the work they have do on this bill and for everything they have be do in work on the consultation it be quite clear to most of the public that not only be england privatised model of water fail but it be an extreme ideological outlier it be one of the bad for cost and result interruption the hon member for broadland and fakenham jerome mayhew be chuntere away in his place we need long term patient approach especially give the climate crisis and that be fundamentally incompatible with privatisation while the chief executive officer of thames water be get in bonus we in harpenden and berkhamsted see over day of non stop sewage in our river which be chalk stream the same be now happen again one year later with hour of non stop sewage do the hon member agree that the system clearly do not work and that such bonus do not provide the right incentive agree with the hon lady hope her party come to its sens at some point maybe in the same way that my party need to come to its sens and accept that some form of public ownership will probably be the good way to resolve that have you that be my personal view put that on the record these company have legal obligation first and foremost to their shareholder which mean short term profit maximisation when water be privatised to quote from unison recent report on this matter to ensure the commercial success of the company the government write off all the exist debt of the rwa regional water authority billion in total and give the private company billion of public subsidy in tax relief on profit it have come to my attention that even some former chief executive of water company fear for the future of the industry because good investor have by and large exit it it be now the macquaries and vulture capitalist of this world that dominate shareholding this issue go far beyond regulation indeed our own regulator ofwat have be find want as its own growth duty prioritise business as usual in other area the government have quite rightly recognise and embrace the value of public ownership such as in rail and with great british energy unfortunately when it come to water company there seem to be an inconsistency in government policy many of we on this side of the house run on manifesto commitment to reduce the cost of living and that commitment be one that think every labour mp believe in however the cost of corruption and of extraction by private water company should under no circumstance as be currently configure in the bill land on the head of our constituent should any of these company go bust or be take into special administration water be monopoly industry which mean that bill payer and taxpayer be the same what message would it send to our constituent if they be ask to pay via their bill or via tax to make payout for the mistake and excess of privatised water doubtless the behaviour of the privatised firm should be look at closely but one of the fundamental of have state run system for such long term asset be that they be chronically under invest they could never win out in the political battle between school hospital and long term water infrastructure and only privatisation allow the record investment that have go in since the hon gentleman ought to recognise that in try to get the balance right do recognise that and not for one second be call for nationalisation which be the model the right hon member be talk about there be plethora of possibility for public ownership from mutualisation through to give regional authority more scope and even work with the private sector we must ensure that the public have critical say over the future of water and there be multiple form that public ownership can take be not necessarily in favour of style nationalisation which be pretty much what they have in scotland at the moment will however ask those on the front bench to consider new clause and ensure that our constituent the people we come into politic for do not foot single penny more for the failure of privatised water investor shareholder and creditor should be the one who take the haircut they should be the one who foot the bill because of what they have do to our water this should not be land on the head of our constituent this be political choice and urge my government to make it clear that we will always back the public not the private company that have get we into this mess call the liberal democrat spokesperson pay tribute to the minister and the bill team from the department for environment food and rural affairs who be in the chamber as well as to all my colleague who sit on the committee for what be genuinely enjoyable and collegiate experience hope they will forgive for make few criticism in the next few minute we table amendment in committee but only today you will be delighted to know madam deputy know be fail will not speak to all of they for blindingly obvious reason we table those amendment because we in the liberal democrats humbly yet enthusiastically have take on the mantle in this place and beyond of be the voice for many thousand of campaigner volunteer and citizen scientist who continue to lead the way in expose the failure and injustice in the water industry and fight for meaningful change we be immensely grateful to those people all across the country our water industry have become money make vessel for speculator who appear to care little for the quality of our river lake and sea something can tell the house be source of great fury in england precious lake district the water company have accumulate billion in debt since privatisation while still manage to pay out billion in dividend that be more than third of the total spend on infrastructure during that time in the last year water company pay out million in executive bonus and thames water bonus double to million that year money leak out of the industry infrastructure be fail and it be our constituent who pay the price meanwhile the regulatory framework have fail utterly and be not fit for purpose as speak million in fine have be levy against water company by ofwat follow an investigation that begin four year ago of which it have so far fail to collect single penny thames water have have an increase in the number of pollution incident which go up in six month last year it have be issue with fine but that have not change anything do my hon friend agree that we need regulation with proper tooth and that new clause would do exactly that by put water company into special measure when they fail our constituent strongly agree with my hon friend the water company simply do not fear ofwat or indeed any other part of our fragmented regulatory system they dwarf ofwat in term of resource they flout the limited regulation that they face and they run ring around the regulator and obviously get away with it there be the outrage of the water company be permit just before christmas to increase water bill by by and what make it even bad be that third of customer bill be be spend just on service the debt debt that be in part run up to fund excessive dividend water company be already pass on the consequence of their complete financial mismanagement to our constituent their customer but this bill could enable that to go far and to be even bad accord to the government explanatory note follow the provision of financial assistance by the secretary of state to company in special administration clause of the bill as draft would require water company to raise amount of money determine by the secretary of state from its consumer and to pay those amount to the secretary of state to make good any shortfall in other word when water company go into special administration there be cost to the government of ensure that supply be maintain and the government need to recoup that cost that sound reasonable at first glimpse but it do not seem reasonable that bill payer should have to pick up the tab despite bear none of the blame for the financial mess water company find itself in my hon friend and be keen to press amendment which would make it explicit that it should be the creditor of the company the big financial investor that have load debt on to the water company that cover those cost instead the amendment would strike out the government provision in the bill that open up bill payer to carry the cost of pay off company debt even in the event of bankruptcy fear that the government drive for growth have mean that they have become fearful of the tough regulation that my hon friend suggest they see it only as an impediment instead of the basis for stable economy do he agree that weak regulation be not only bad for consumer and for the environment but also for investment over the long run somebody represent the water industry will say that the water industry as structure be deeply unappealing to investor there be case for change the model of how we structure those company when company go into special administration we do not think it be right that innocent customer should have to foot the bill the management of those company and their investor and creditor be responsible for the mess the company be in they take the risk and speculate in order to make money so it be only right that they should have to cover the cost of the risk that they take not our constituent one of the positive aspect of the bill be the government decision to deploy volunteer citizen scientist and campaigner to ensure scrutiny of the water industry only last week spend time speak with the leader of the save windermere campaign and the clean river kent campaign also enjoy get my hand dirty and my leg very wet alongside the eden rivers trust in the river eden not long ago we be lucky across the whole country to have passionate committed expert volunteer who be dedicate to clean up and protect our precious waterway yet we be sadden that the government have fail to provide those volunteer with the resource they need or the power they deserve do my hon friend agree that one kind of support that such community group need be water restoration grant those be vital and will flow from the water restoration fund which be the subject of one of his amendment those fund be vital to clean up bathing water across the country those fund be vital bathing water status be important we hope that defra will come out with new criterion soon so that place such as the river kent can bid to be include we have table new clause and which between they would strengthen the hand of those wonderful volunteer include by ensure that the government propose live database which we support retain comprehensive historical datum if it do not the government be expect campaigner to be watch that database if they have the temerity to go to sleep look after their kid or go to work they may miss something if we be to back campaigner and volunteer the least we can do be give they the tool to scrutinise water company performance knowledge be power and our amendment would give those campaigner knowledge and power new clause and amendment address monitoring event duration monitor tell we how long spill take place over for instance they tell we that last february united utilities spill into windermere for hour in one go but those monitor do not tell we anything about volume as result they do not tell we enough about the impact of sewage spill on the ecology and wildlife of our waterway it be equally possible to have long duration trickle or short duration deluge of sewage into our lake river and sea new clause would insist that water company have to measure and report on the volume of discharge and that regulator hold they to it new clause would put into law concrete pollution target and proper penalty when company fail to meet they company who fail to meet those target would be put into what we be call special measure mean that they would be subject to financial penalty be make to undertake specific improvement project no water company chief executive will quake in their boot if they be not hold to target that be ambitious and enforceable with penalty and which actually mean something water industry staff do amazing work give we the world clean drinking water and work their sock off to tackle and repair leak to bolster infrastructure and to oversee the operation of waste water treatment system to serve our community they be just as much victim as their fellow bill payer of the utterly fail system that we be face with the system have fail for two key reason inadequate regulation and broken ownership and financial model that be why we propose through new clause the abolition of ofwat and the creation of new consolidated super regulator with the power focus and resource to hold the water industry to account and to enforce strong rule new clause would migrate water company away from the fail privatised model and towards mutual ownership status this would prevent the water industry from be use as cash cow for speculator where bill payer pay the price through high bill and sewage infest river and lake and instead create form of ownership where low risk with modest but reliable reward model would ensure that we attract responsible investor and prevent money leak out of the system in the form of unearned dividend and immoral financing of colossal debt we recognise the government decision to present the bill now and hold out the hope of more radical change later in the parliament follow the recommendation of sir jon cunliffe review we confess however to suffer from extreme raise eyebrow syndrome today as it have be reveal that former thames water executive have be appoint to sir jon independent water commission that do not fill we with enormous confidence the bill be okay it be even good in part but it would be significantly well with the liberal democrats suggest amendment we humbly ask right hon and hon member to support those amendment and especially amendment to give the british people the radical water industry clean up that they vote for thank the minister for bring forward the bill so fast in the first six month of the government it be an honour to sit on the bill committee and to engage in constructive discussion with hon member from across the house however must take issue with the hon member for westmorland and lonsdale tim farron and his veritable smorgasbord of amendment and new clause will not support they because let we remember this be just the first step in clean up the appalling mess we have be leave with our water company be sure that the commission will bring forward idea for more legislation grow up in the countryside on farm and one of my favourite memory be run down the garden and out into the river at the bottom go for walk and splosh through the stream and my family take it for grant that we could just mess about in the stream apart from really annoy my mum when get back by leave messy puddle of water on the floor there be never any fear that would get sick or that have be wad through sewage what change there have be with parent now worried about their child go into the water they can not run helter skelter into the local chalk stream for fear that they will get an ear infection or an eye infection or perhaps encounter wet wipe or something much bad sadly the health of the wye and the usk our two majestic river in monmouthshire have really suffer over the past year have spend many happy hour walk alongside they see heron and kingfisher and we have have some of our happy family day out there the dreadful state that those two river be in make they two really good example of the year of conservative failure and flimflam we have record level of illegal sewage dumping in our river lake and sea and chronic ongoing diffuse pollution from agriculture in every constituency across the uk there be amazing group of citizen scientist who have really bring our river to the fore pay tribute to save the river usk and friends of the river wye in monmouthshire who be among the good in the uk interruption be afraid that will not give way as we be under extreme time pressure one of my key promise in the election campaign be to work to clean up our river feargal sharkey endorse my campaign when someone like he endorse campaign we know that we will be hold to account that be why be so pleased that in the last six month we have do more than the conservatives and the lib dems when they be in coalition be proud that we be already stand here debate the bill only six month in it will bring criminal charge against persistent lawbreaker with penalty include imprisonment in addition the cost recovery power of regulator will be expand to ensure that water company bear the cost of enforcement action take in response to their failing we have be leave very difficult legacy due to the disastrous inaction of the tories and the lib dems when they be in coalition it will take much more work and many year across border with both farmer and water company to restore our river but the bill make an excellent start to clean up the horrific mess it will mean that in future hope parent will be able to allow their child to run helter skelter into their local river and stream would like to speak to amendment and table in my name amendment would far strengthen the bill by make it criminal offence for water company to fail to report discharge from emergency overflow amendment would prohibit such discharge in river area such as the thames that be use for aquatic sport have the privilege of represent the town and village of beaconsfield marlow bourne end and the south bucks village unfortunately we be serve by thames water and we have some of the high level of fine in the country we be bless with beautiful waterway set throughout my constituency include the river thames our area be rich in watersport club the marlow rowing club the marlow canoe club and the upper thames sail club to name but three young people from high school and grammar school use the thames for their water sport as well amendment would give water use for aquatic sport the same protection as that use for bath it would establish clear consequence for water company and their chief executive where they fail to comply with clear duty to protect the water in which people practise aquatic sport particularly row that be particularly true of thames water and of the thames appreciate the cross party support in committee on these amendment aquatic sport be an important part of our sporting heritage in this country but storm overflow discharge into our river have adversely affect the health of participant create an ongoing health risk to rowing sail canoe and other aquatic sport club along the thames and across the country many club particularly in place such as marlow take their duty of care very seriously and be have to put in place their own monitoring system to protect their member amendment would ensure that water use for aquatic sport be put on the same statutory footing as bathing water it be time for water company to take responsibility for ensure that those water be safe to use and to protect our young people for the future the amendment set out reasonable expectation that water company must not discharge an emergency overflow within mile radius of an area use for aquatic sport the definition of such an area be clearly outline and further discretion be provide for the secretary of state to determine such area where need the amendment would bring much need support to our vital aquatic sport my hon friend and constituency neighbour and along with my hon friend the member for south west hertfordshire mr mohindra and the former member for uxbridge and south ruislip have hold number of meeting with local stakeholder and the canal river trust about these issue which affect the river colne which cross our respective constituency do she share my appreciation of the measure introduce by the last government which ensure effective monitoring will she join in thank conservative lead hertfordshire buckinghamshire and hillingdon council for their work to ensure that watersport user have access to good quality clean facility my hon friend raise an excellent point the previous government put in place monitor for all waterway so that we can hold water company to account he mention the cross border and cross party effort but mainly those of the conservative council that work together to hold thames water and other water company to account be surprised that the government do not readily accept amendment as it be not party political it be about necessary support for our vital aquatic sport club and would far strengthen the protection of waterway use for aquatic sport across the country that would include the thames and other river across england many in area where young people access waterway and where there be storm overflow urge the government to accept these reasonable and important amendment to strengthen the bill water quality and sewage pollution be one of the most pressing issue in my constituency in the past year alone we have have sewage dump the equivalent of hour of sewage spill at bournemouth pier as many member will know bournemouth pier be place where people surf paddleboard swim and walk their dog it be magnet for tourism this be more than just an environmental issue it be public health issue with people frequently get sick from swim in the sea it also have massive economic consequence for my constituency which thousand of people visit over the summer it be impact our reputation our business and our tourism industry however it be also matter of deep pride for my constituent we be proud to be one of the most beautiful bit of coastline in the uk we be often rank in the top in europe my constituent want to enjoy those coastal water not be afraid to go in they it be situation that can not be allow to continue be truly glad the conservatives have find some vim on this issue but gently remind they that we do not come to power in vacuum we be face victorian situation with the amount of sewage and that come from failure to deal with systemic issue interruption despite their protestation the conservatives action have speak louder than their word under the previous government we hear talk of scrap nutrient neutrality and they slash the environment agency budget with the then water minister instruct the environment agency not to publish datum we have hear all about the increase in monitoring but if they know so much about the problem why do they not do anything about it it be little too late for that it be labour that be bring forward the legislation to deal with this issue be proud to support this bill with its provision for criminal liability and ban bonus the amendment the minister have outline today in particular to improve transparency give industry certainty and speed up the implementation of these measure be so important end by say that my constituent will welcome the action take by the labour government we owe it to they and to the next generation to leave this country with sea river and an environment that be protect and thriving welcome the bill while its provision be modest none the less welcome this step to improve on the failure of previous conservative governments on sewage pollution for too long water company have be allow to operate without proper regulation and oversight since privatisation english water company have pay out billion in dividend while amass billion in debt shockingly with the bill still make its way through the house water company have brazenly say that they plan to circumvent the ban on bonus by jack up suite salary to compensate the bill must do more and be more ambitious to truly hold water company to account be therefore pleased to support the new clause in the name of my hon friend the member for westmorland and lonsdale tim farron which would strengthen the bill improve monitoring protect consumer and ensure responsibility fall on sewerage company to clean up their act will speak to amendment and new clause and amendment would ensure that creditor not bill payer pay for the bail out of water company in special measure it would protect consumer against the reckless financial mismanagement of thames water ordinary bill payer should not be require to pay for the mistake of company they have no choice to use and the folly of investor that indulge it new clause would require sewerage undertaker to install volume flow meter in all their location where overflow occur campaign organisation in my constituency include the famous henley mermaids tell that flow meter would help to inform they when it be safe to go in the water new clause be also of special importance to my constituency much of which be in the chilterns national landscape it would commit sewerage undertaker to secure and then maintain high ecological status in protect landscape it would require they to improve outflow from storm overflow in area such as goring in my constituency which lie within the chilterns national landscape my right hon friend the member for kingston and surbiton ed davey would very much welcome that as we both enjoy stand up paddleboard yoga in goring in july the hon gentleman paint beautiful picture how much do he think it would cost to implement and how much would that cost impact on bill payer the measure we propose should be take in the round all our amendment significantly improve the bill new clause would also improve sewage outflow in henley on thames and the village along the thames path national trail that be desperately need to end the shame of welcome the world to our beautiful town of henley at the royal regatta only to subject it to what we put down the toilet in conclusion welcome the bill and the protection it will deliver to my constituent but hope the government will consider go far very soon thank the minister for all the hard work she and her team have be do on the bill it be very important to my constituent to go back to the very basic we be talk about something that everybody in north east derbyshire use every day water believe that everybody in my constituency and in the whole country have right to know that the water in our river and stream be clean clear and free from pollution the reason have to state that now in this house be that we have not have the action we should have have over the past year that be huge failure of the previous government to get action take and complete on this important issue instead in water be pollute over time in north east derbyshire and that be in just one constituency last week meet local resident in ashover which be situate on the river amber in my constituency they impress on their concern about pollution in that very picturesque part of the river we have have good news in that severn trent water have improve treatment tank capacity in the area but my resident be worried that that will not be enough and indeed that we will not know whether it be enough they be already concerned that the water they see do not live up to the standard they wish to see that be why particularly welcome the fact that the bill be bring in independent monitoring of water quality be afraid disagree with the hon member for westmorland and lonsdale tim farron what think be important be not that we get carry away with volume but the impact on water quality that be what matter most they be not mutually exclusive be they know the duration of spill be important but know what go into it and how much also help to know the impact so we can regulate it be that not true the bill look at the result the impact do not understand why we need to look at the volume if we be look at the impact huge amount have be spend on boss bonus over million in to put that into perspective the average salary in my constituency be just over if bonus be receive we expect it to be for work well do and not just as matter of course for the failing those boss be responsible for time and time again we hear from the former government that the water industry would change unfortunately it do not under the previous measure and that be why welcome the action to ensure result as soon as possible the bill will mean clean river which be my hope for the river amber and what my constituent deserve well infrastructure well protection for those who use our water for leisure activity and well protection for the nature in our beautiful constituency that be why it have my full support my constituency of bridgwater have the rivers axe brue parrett and tone within its boundary together with countless stream brook and rhyne it be therefore of the utmost importance to my constituent that the water quality of our river be maintain and improve the town of burnham on sea and highbridge be coastal resort as be the village of berrow and brean it be important for the tourism industry as well as the local people who enjoy those beach that we improve the quality of our bathing water and therefore welcome the bill we be tell that it have four key aim to block the payment of bonus to executive who pollute waterway to bring criminal charge against persistent law breaker to impose automatic and severe fine for wrongdoing and to ensure independent monitoring of every sewer welcome all those aim build as they do on the work of the last government to improve our water quality want to speak in favour of new clause and new clause entitle establishment of water restoration fund establish the principle that fine should go towards environmental improvement rather than to the treasury be somewhat curious as to why the government would not support that but perhaps the minister can explain when she respond to the debate in november wessex water which serve my constituency be fin for pollute two river one in wiltshire and one in somerset that money should be use to improve the local environment it should not be swallow up by the treasury new clause state that when civil penalty be impose there should be an equivalent reduction in customer bill that be important because otherwise the water company that have be fin will simply pass on that fine to the consumer the new clause would ensure that there be no penalty for the customer be curious again to know why the government would oppose new clause along with new clause and look forward to hear the minister explanation thank the ministerial team for all their hard work in produce the bill within six month of labour election in july be there anything more emblematic of the decline and mismanagement preside over by the last government than the state of our river and water it be fascinating to hear from the shadow minister that the opposition seem suddenly to have realise that this be big problem than they ever think it be when they be in government as we have hear from member on both side of the house waterway throughout the country have be choke with record level of sewage in site in my constituency be pollute by severn trent water and united utilities across those site there be sewage dump and what be the punishment for the boss of those company do any of they face imprisonment be their bonus curtail or stop entirely do they feel the hard edge of enforcement action the answer be no if the hon gentleman as back bench mp be presume to tell regulator with criminal power how to investigate and prosecute company or indeed any defendant we need to be very careful because never before in our law have we permit members of parliament and ministers to direct independent investigator on whom to investigate and prosecute welcome that intervention from the shadow secretary of state but let suggest that if the measure in this bill have be implement by her government we might have see some of those enforcement action thank the hon gentleman for give way he be very kind remind he that in labour government allow through their regulatory regime the uplift in bonus that he outline can he tell the house how much sewage dumping happen in his constituency between the year and and can he justify why only of river be be monitor he will not be able to because we do not know welcome the hon member intervention simply say to he that his party be in power for year and do nothing to go back year seem rather extraordinary in the united utilities chief executive receive bonus of nearly million and severn trent lift its bonus to million that be million of pound that my constituent in high peak have put in boss back pocket to reward their failure when speak to resident on the doorstep in high peak they ask how do they get away with it how can they be allow to do this they get away with it because conservative members let they the previous conservative government cut the environment agency budget by half between and leave the agency toothless to tackle the disgraceful behaviour of our water company boss perhaps that help we to understand the enforcement issue we have be talk about also remember that just before the election the hon member for keighley and ilkley robbie moore in his previous role as water minister tell environment agency official not to publish the headline figure of the total number and duration of spill how typical of the conservative party approach rather than face issue head on and tackle they it choose to hide they and keep they in the shadow that approach to government have leave our water infrastructure crumbling by fail to confront these issue fail to invest in our break infrastructure and let consumer money be spend irresponsibly the conservative government leave my constituent in high peak pay twice these point underpin the importance of this legislation this bill couple with the government wide programme to safeguard the environment will ensure that the beauty of the peak district in my constituency with our nature rich river be entrench for generation to come the bill introduce tough penalty include imprisonment for water executive who fail to comply with or obstruct investigation the bill will ban bonus for ceo and senior leader unless high standard be meet on protect the environment and their consumer the bill will also introduce severe and automatic fine for offence close the gap in the environment agency enforcement power importantly the water company will have to start cover the cost of enforcement action unlike the previous government we will not let the water company hide from their wrongdoing the bill will see that every outlet have independent monitoring be proud to support this major step forward in the government wide reform to fix the broken water system leave behind by the conservative party this be great first step and commission will look at the whole water industry which will hopefully address some of the concern raise by member only by take these action with this ambitious plan which the government have do in their first six month in office can we begin to turn the page on year of decline and attract much need investment into the sector which will preserve the beauty of high peak and the peak district for the long term rise order unfortunately colleague make intervention have eat into time so now have to call the front benchers call the shadow minister dr neil hudson it have be wide range debate although shorter than we have hop for thank member for participate today thank my hon friend the member for beaconsfield joy morrissey for her passion for enhance the accountability of water company and protect watersport which we be all passionate about and my hon friend the member for bridgwater sir ashley fox for passionately advocate for the water restoration fund new clause would establish the water restoration fund to ringfence money from fine to restore local waterway not to balance the treasury book this be conservative fund and the labour government must not let ideology stand in the way of evidence base policymaking they must take the baton forward and ringfence this money so that waterway can be restore locally will the hon member give way no have no time new clause be design to ensure that fine on water company result in equivalent reduction in customer bill that be only fair and we urge the government to take forward the new clause new clause seek to strengthen the financial resilience of water company by enable the secretary of state to stipulate the limit of borrowing so that these company do not leverage too much debt that be an important new clause that need to go forward through amendment and we want to protect customer in different part of the country so that they do not have to pay for the misdemeanour of water company that do not serve they we urge the government to take forward our amendment and make this bill strong so that we can improve our precious waterway thank member for their constructive engagement throughout this debate as have say before it be wonderful to hear the share passion across this house for improve the performance of the water sector so that it well deliver for customer and the environment give the limited time that have to address over amendment be not look in any one direction the minister make reference to the very limited time why be that this be government who hold general debate on mondays and thursdays they have no business yet we have less than two hour to debate this really important issue the hon member and serve on the public bill committee where we spend much time discuss many of the amendment can not comment on decision about the business of the house and urgent question as say will do my absolute good to cover all the point raise by hon member hope they accept that generally try to be generous with intervention but want to put on the record my response to the amendment hope the house will give forgive number of hon member have table amendment that seek to increase transparency around water company operation and pollution incident the government absolutely agree that great transparency be need to well enable the regulator and the public to hold water company accountable although have previously explain why it be not practical to prohibit all discharge from emergency overflow which be necessary safety valve in our sewage system reiterate this government commitment to reduce the harm cause by sewage discharge ensure that all emergency overflow be monitor be critical step in enable the outcome that we all want to see information on the frequency and duration of discharge will help to direct investment to far reduce sewage discharge into our waterway and to well enable the public to make informed decision about access their local waterway will the minister give way will but have only minute thank the minister for be so generous with her time as she will be aware the united kingdom have most of the world chalk stream and the river chess run through my constituency how can she ensure that we continue to monitor our unique environment and protect it from the threat of overflow to which she just refer share the hon gentleman passion and love for chalk stream the rainforest of the united kingdom part of this bill will drive the performance change in the industry that we want to see and reduce sewage discharge which be do such damage to such precious habitat although some member have call for the government to go even far on monitoring reassure the house that we have carefully consider how good to increase transparency without drive unmanageable increase in customer bill as promise in committee have provide factsheet on this issue and can make it available in the house of commons library roll out event duration monitor over two price review period will provide the good value for money for customer and the environment and do not risk compromise water company ability to deliver other vital improvement to our sewage system it be important that we direct investment at improve the sewage network to decrease overflow charge and not just at monitoring particularly where it do not provide valuable insight into the harm associate with discharge there be balance to be strike and believe we have get it right the public know that there be too much sewage in our waterway whichever way we look at it be it through volume or duration they know there be too much the focus must be on reduce it my hon friend talk about the importance of water quality will she join in commending campaign such as the ilkley clean river group and other citizen scientist across the country in the absence of datum collect under the conservatives and the work of the environment agency they have to do the work themselves to expose the sewage scandal wholeheartedly pay tribute to the ilkley clean river group and to the work that my hon friend do in champion it in this house remind my hon friend how much this matter to my constituent in east thanet we be surround on three side by the sea yet we manage to clean up our water however be strike by the fact that the reform manifesto do not contain one word about water pollution or safety also want to point out the emptiness of the opposition benches in this debate that should be put on the record thank my hon friend for her intervention would have think that this would be an important issue for all political party resident in grosmont in my constituency have have van park in the street process raw sewage with pipe leave open in the street for month between the processing of the sewage and the hold tank be empty do my hon friend agree that disgusting incident such as these illustrate our crumble water infrastructure and the importance of the bill which will ringfence funding for vital infrastructure wholeheartedly agree with my hon friend what she be witness in the street of her constituency be perfect example of the crumble infrastructure that we have inherit rise let try to get through my remark if it become feasible in future for company to install monitor more quickly they will be encourage to do so in addition to reporting requirement for emergency overflow other measure in this bill will ensure that water company have robust plan to reduce pollution incident and empower the regulator to punish wrongdoing effectively this include requirement to produce pollution incident reduction plan and implementation report as set out in clause of the bill and requirement for water company to consider the use of nature base solution in the production of their drainage and wastewater management plan as set out in clause the transparency provide by these measure will drive culture change ensure that water company have the right incentive to reduce discharge of sewage into our precious river lake and sea let be clear that the bill also provide comprehensive power for ofwat to enforce the requirement introduce by the bill to increase transparency include through use of significant fine can reassure the house that where discharge be find to have breach permit condition the regulator will not hesitate to take action in relation to new clause also make it clear that ofwat have duty to secure that company be able to finance the delivery of their statutory obligation include meet pollution target the government be commit to act as fast as possible to reduce sewage pollution in our waterway and already have stretch pollution target in place inform by detailed analysis and extensive engagement these target will drive billion of investment between and and almost billion of that investment will begin this year improve storm overflow by hope this reassure the house that where water company do not comply with requirement around pollution incident and the reporting of those pollution incident the regulator will not hesitate to take action the water restoration fund be create by the previous government yet not one penny of the million levy on water company between and reach any restoration of the waterway do the minister agree that our precious chalk stream could be help by the water restoration fund be continue as have mention be huge fan of our chalk stream the hon member be right to point out that the much laud water restoration fund that some member be so keen to talk about be establish in november yet month later the grand total of the number of project support by it be zero number of hon member have also put forward suggestion to improve information and datum share more broadly the hon member for beaconsfield joy morrissey have put her name to some of these amendment although the government do not think it necessary to bring forward legislation in this space we be actively consider way of make datum more accessible to the public through non legislative mean this include information on water company performance and datum on local sewer network in map form which must be make available free of charge under the water industry act will the minister give way this be go to be my last one be grateful to the minister for give way her comment on this point will be welcome by many of our local resident will she provide further information about the great power for ofwat this bill will of course empower ofwat to take necessary action where it find wrongdoing include through change to remuneration under clause know my hon friend care lot about this rise be sorry but will have to stop take intervention if be to respond to all the amendment water uk have publish centralised map on its website of discharge datum from all storm overflow operate by english water company genuinely find it clear and useful so encourage all hon member to have look have hear call from across the house for reform the planning framework the regulator and the incentive that govern the water industry model although understand and believe fully share hon member frustration with the performance across the water sector the fundamental issue face the water industry and the regulatory framework in which it operate can no long be address in piecemeal way have speak at great length throughout the bill passage about the independent commission lead by sir jon cunliffe which will make recommendation to fundamentally transform how our water system work the broad range commission be bring together wide range of expertise to make recommendation in line with eight objective to deliver the necessary reset to ensure resilient innovative and sustainable water sector in england and wales it will report to the government by summer this include specific objective to review the role structure duty and power of the regulator the planning framework include the price review process and the resilience of water company that include financial resilience which know matter to many hon member point have be raise about take water company into public ownership and the government have repeatedly make it clear that we do not consider nationalisation to be within the commission scope nationalisation would cost over billion and it would take year to unpick the current ownership model at the expense of deliver and address more immediate public priority however the commission will consider alternative water industry model within its scope take this opportunity to invite all hon member to put forward their view to the commission through the upcoming call for evidence which will be launch soon be grateful to the minister for give way suspect that the government do not agree with our water restoration fund but if the cunliffe review say that the water restoration fund should be reinstate will the minister commit to do so despite our political difference the hon gentleman and have very interesting and what be the right debate in committee as we explain in committee conversation on the water restoration fund be still ongoing honestly do not believe that primary legislation be need which conservative front benchers know as they establish the fund without primary legislation gently point out as have already mention that within the month of its establishment under the previous government the fund do absolutely nothing will the minister give way have two minute remain so have to skip through as much as can as know member will want to answer question particularly on the sar some hon member have express concern about the rule on performance relate pay and consumer representation although the government agree it be crucial that consumer voice be hear and consider in water company decision making we have already take action on this it be not necessary to require environmental expert to be place on company board because follow the agreement make with my right hon friend the secretary of state for environment food and rural affairs in his first week in office nine of the company have update their article of association to include social and environmental commitment defra be work with all of they to ensure they do the rest as soon as possible agree with the hon member for westmorland and lonsdale tim farron about the representation of environmental non governmental organisation on company board member of water company board be subject to number of duty under the companies act include duty to promote the success of that company director fiduciary duty may conflict with the organisational objective of the environmental group in question thus prevent their objective participation in board membership we can not have situation in which an environmentalist on water company board be not comfortable with their duty to promote the success of that company produce factsheet detail how the sar be use to ensure the continue provision of vital public service however remind the house of the fact be be very clear the shortfall recovery power can only be use to recover shortfall in repay government funding for the last time hope it can not and would never be use to recover financial creditor or shareholder loss relate to investment in the company if the amendment be accept as propose it would involve radical change to insolvency policy which have be long establish practice since question put and agree to new clause accordingly read second time and add to the bill proceeding interrupt programme order december the deputy speaker put

economist and be prepare to launch public call for evidence within week the secretary of state talk about sir jon cunliffe water commission and we be obviously interested in engage with that do he think though that today appointment of former thames water executive to the commission will fill the public with confidence that it will be independent in any way of course it be an independent commission it be up to sir jon to appoint to the board whom he like however it be very balanced board and hope the hon gentleman will recognise that voice from many stakeholder group be represent as indeed they should be the commission will report to the uk and welsh governments this summer after which both government will respond and consult on sir jon recommendation include on further legislation the secretary of state be right that thing be get well in my constituency two new investment in water sector upgrade by wessex water and pennon be worth total of million clearly much more

will extend to wales consumer listen to this debate have be concern about the role of ofwat what reassurance can the secretary of state give they that ofwat the regulator will put consumer interest and environmental interest before corporation interest sir jon cunliffe commission will be review precisely those point and hope the hon gentleman will take the opportunity to contribute his view when the call for evidence begin in just few week the change the government have make in short amount of time show that with collective determination and ambition we can turn the water sector around the failure of the past be end the future of the water sector be full of promise our waterway have be poison by unacceptable level of sewage and other pollution for too long with these change finally we will clean up our river lake and sea for good thank everyone who have scrutinise and work on the bill in both houses include the shadow minister my hon friend the member for epping forest dr hudson our very efficient whip my hon friend the member for broadland and fakenham jerome mayhew and the noble lord roborough who lead very constructive discussion in the other place it be shame that the government reject the amendment put forward today thank the doorkeepers the hon member who chair the committee and everyone who help his majesty official opposition to scrutinise the bill across the house we can all agree that there be fundamental problem face the water and sewerage industry since the number of designate bathing water have increase we have see significant improvement in water quality rating with more water rat as excellent or good and an increase in blue flag beach but of course we want to see more we be in fact the first government in history to set out that storm overflow must be reduce and our landmark environment act give strong power to regulator and impose strict demand for tackle pollution we set legally bind target to improve water quality and availability and to reduce nutrient pollution we roll out catchment sensitive farming to all farm in england we step up the requirement for investment include investment from water company and storm overflow improvement and nationally significant infrastructure project such as the thames tideway tunnel super sewer when we come into government just of storm overflow be monitor when we leave government we have increase that to we support the bill but we do so with some disappointment at its lack of ambition frankly as we have say before much of what the bill try to do include monitoring block bonus and fine be bring in by the conservatives in government we say that the primary legislation be not necessary but we will of course support the bill be especially disappointed that the government have decline to accept our amendment in particular it be woeful that they have fail to put the water restoration fund into legislation interruption will deal with the minister comment in moment the public rightly want to see the government address water quality but rather water company fine be use to restore water body that money will be go into the gap hole of the treasury coffer presumably in an attempt to undo some of the damage cause by the chancellor disastrous growth block tax hiking job cutting investment plummet budget now be go to correct the minister and will do so from the dispatch box rather than through point of order last summer it emerge that thames water yorkshire water and northumbrian water would be fin record million between they for catalogue of failure over illegal sewage discharge subject to consultation however in august when this government be in power the treasury hold back those fine which be due to go into the water restoration fund to help clean up affected area the minister give figure early but it be her government fault that money be not pay into that fund we on the side of the house believe that the polluter should pay for their mistake rather than their fine pay for pay rise for the government trade union buddy interruption yes be sure that the train driver be very grateful will the right hon lady give way will give way with great interest sit on the public bill committee and must say that the tone that the right hon lady be strike be very different from that of her colleague on the committee just wonder whether she as any regret about her government record on tackle sewage or pollution would she acknowledge any regret do love be mansplaine to by labour back benchers suppose it be part of the labour party woman problem the hon gentleman be now throw his thumb up at goodness what will say be that throughout the passage of the bill we have say we have make some progress but there be more to do that be precisely why we be support the bill tonight although we will try to improve it and strengthen it will the right hon lady give way will not because want to allow other to speak the government have also sadly fail to recognise the importance of chalk stream refuse to confirm the continuation of protection put in place by we conservatives be afraid that warm word about rainforest much as we agree with they will not protect these vital habitat we want to see improved water quality and urge the government to take stock and seek to adopt more rounded approach that clean up our river and sea treat bill payer and taxpayer properly and build on our work to construct the water system of the future let say without go through all the flowery stuff that we do early that be grateful to member in all part of the house for what have be broadly collegiate debate however the shadow secretary of state say something that be worth reflect on think she be talk about what be about to mention namely the fine of million that ofwat have indeed propose should be levy against the very three water company to which she refer for what it be worth and be not here to defend the treasury this be not treasury decision at all it be because of ofwat weakness and culture of timidity that be evident when it come to gather money from the water company that the money be not collect that information be correct because it be give to in response to one of my freedom of information act request in any event the key feature be my disappointment in the bill will certainly support it should it come to vote and support it anyway but its weakness lie in the fact that it be not radical enough it do not go far enough and it do not tackle the weakness in regulation to which in roundabout accidental way the secretary of state have refer we will engage with the cunliffe water review and recognise it as independent my reflection be simply this the labour party have be in opposition for long time they be well fund opposition through short money we could only dream of such thing and surely have the capability to come up with set of plan that mean they could get on with it straightaway rather than kick it to halfway into the parliament this be an unambitious bill but it be good enough and it will have our support question put and agree to bill accordingly read the third time and pass with amendment on point of order madam deputy speaker need some assistance in understand how the house can express its displeasure at the government manipulation of the business of the house to stop proper consideration of this bill water be at the heart of the last general election it be really important to our constituent and yet the bill report stage be limit to less than one and half hour and not single back bencher have be able to contribute on third reading be there way that we can express our disapprobation of the government put forward two non urgent statement today on gaza and on sudan and the eastern democratic republic of the congo both of they important in their own right but suspect design to eat up time thank the hon member for his prior notice while that be not matter for the chair his comment be now on the record far to that point of order madam deputy speaker may gently refute what the hon member for broadland and fakenham jerome mayhew just say two important statement be make today it be for the chair to decide on urgent question of which there be two today with both run for considerable time it be not the government intention at all for this debate which be on matter of great importance to many people across the house to be curtail will certainly take on board what he say and there will potentially be further opportunity with the bill interruption there will be statement tomorrow and there be statement early this week there be lot of important matter we take great care to ensure that important government announcement be make to the house through oral statement and we be criticise when we do not do that business without debate speaker absence ordered that the speaker have leave of absence on thursday january to attend the funeral of the right

this house do now mccluskey thank you madam deputy speaker for grant this debate refer the house to my entry in the register of members financial interests as member of unite the union have spend my life in the trade union movement so it be no surprise that my first adjournment debate focus on the principle of collective bargaining dispute in my constituency appear to expose gap in the legislation whereby an employer can offer pay increase exclusively to non unionised worker an unacceptable practice that can be exploit by employer not just in knowsley but across the country livv housing the large housing association in my constituency manage home across liverpool and the north west in march livv report reserve of million over the past five year it have record annual surplus range from million to million yet the worker who keep livv run have face year of real term pay cut pay have fall by over in real term since it be no wonder that unite and unison member have be take industrial action since october last year livv have refuse to engage in meaningful discussion with the union but it have also declare the negotiation exhaust the stonewalling have prolong the dispute and it be evident from my inbox that it be have an impact on my constituent who depend on livv service the casework load involve livv be mount up and it be have bad effect on people life nothing be get fix because its management will not sit down and settle the dispute in december livv write to all staff to say that they could have pay rise if they reply in writing to confirm that they be not member of trade union the email say if you be non union member and would like to accept the pay award offer of please can you send confirmation of your acceptance and confirm that you be non union member one line email to confirm you wish to receive the pay award and that you be not union member will be enough this practice be completely contrary to the spirit of the employment relations act which seek to protect worker collective voice and to stop inducement and similar practice however some employer keep try to find way around the protection and we have to put stop to it have personally write to the chief executive officer of livv on multiple occasion urge the housing association to engage constructively with the union and to seek fair resolution but léann hearne have go as far as to inform that she will no long engage with in writing have write to livv and ask it to bring an end to the dispute as have mayor steve rotheram and knowsley council have pass motion that ask it to get around the table and solve the dispute with the union this be all that any of we want especially the worker currently in dispute instead of do that livv have focus its effort on undermine collective bargaining we all know that worker get the good deal when they collectively bargain for pay and condition the strength of worker stand together be the only thing that can balance the power of an employer which be why bad employer have do everything they can over the year to undermine the ability of worker to collectively bargain some member of the house will remember the case of kostal uk ltd dunkley in which the employer try to undermine the collective voice of unite worker before talk have be exhaust kostal make direct offer to the workforce and inform staff that they would not receive their christmas bonus if they do not accept it by deadline do that sound familiar like livv kostal think it have find loophole in the law but that be unanimously reject by the supreme court in its ruling lord leggatt say such conduct deny the union its seat at the table and do not allow the union voice to be hear today livv housing be do just that what this behaviour do be create two tier workforce pit colleague against each other imagine go into workplace with culture like that if some employer can get away with this you can bet that other employer will follow it be winston churchill who say the trade union be long establish and essential part of our national life we take our stand by these pillar of our british society as it have gradually develop and evolve itself of the right of individual labour man to adjust their wage and condition by collective bargaining include the right to strike understand that the minister can not comment on individual dispute but this be clearly something that can be exploit by employer across the country the employment rights bill provide clear opportunity to close this loophole that we think be close so long ago so ask the minister to commit to look at amend the bill to stop employer seek to undermine collective bargaining by offer non union member preferential treatment in pay award and to update on those plan thank my hon friend the member for knowsley anneliese midgley for secure this debate and for her excellent speech she have long and proud record in the trade union movement which she have bring to the fore today want to start by set out the government approach to the important subject of industrial relation we want employer and trade union to come together to grow our economy we know that the world of work be fair and more productive when people can come together to negotiate fair pay and decent condition that be why we be reset industrial relation through the employment rights bill we be repeal nearly every part of the trade union act which try to smother trade union in form fill and red tape and prevent they from do their core job of negotiation and dispute resolution commend the hon member for knowsley anneliese midgley for bring forward this debate speak to she beforehand and understand what she be try to do she have clearly outline the case for the union in her contribution tonight when start work for henry denny in belfast in my early they ask if want to join the union to be honest be not sure but the guy tell it be compulsory so say that okay but here the story have the union on my side when first start work at henry denny have it to back up whenever need something have have different opinion about what union be and what they could do for the hon lady have outline what the union can do understand personally what they can do and look forward to hear the minister tell we what he be go to do be grateful to the hon member for his support for union be little worried when the debate start because he be not in his normal place think there be go to be some sort of national emergency because the hon member for strangford have not attend the adjournment debate but be glad he be here and that he have speak very positively about the benefit of join trade union shall go back to some of the work we be do to improve the industrial relation landscape we be of course repeal the strikes minimum service levels act which to our mind only increase tension and fail to prevent single day of industrial action we be go far in strengthen the voice of work people by make it easy for trade union to get recognise give they the right of access to workplace and make sure that they have enough time to represent their member when the right of work people be flout our new fair work agency will be empower to investigate we have recently run consultation on modernise trade union law so that they be fit for the modern workplace and the modern economy that consultation close on december and we be currently analyse response we will publish government response to the consultation before report stage of the employment rights bill this be transformative package that mark new era for work people and hope that hon member be in no doubt about the government commitment to mark this new way forward it be way that bring new deal for work people make job more secure and family friendly ban exploitative zero hour contract support woman in work at every stage in their life and provide genuine living wage and sick pay for the low earner there will be further and fast action to close the gender pay gap to ensure that right be enforce and that trade union be strengthen to repeal anti worker anti union law to turn the page on industrial relation and to end fire and rehire while also give work people the basic right that they deserve at work from day one this be pro business pro worker pro growth bill from pro business pro worker pro growth government as we know range of protection exist for worker against inducement and detriment relate to trade union membership or activity of those will mention three that may be relevant to this particular situation section of the trade union and labour relations consolidation act protect worker against detriment be impose by an employer for the sole or main purpose of prevent or deter the worker from be trade union member or take part in union activity or penalise they for do so through clause of the employment rights bill we be enhance protection against detriment by confer right on worker not to be subject to detriment for the sole or main purpose of prevent or deter the worker from take protect industrial action or penalise the worker for do so section of the act protect worker against offer make by the employer for the sole or main purpose of induce the worker not to be trade union member or not to take part in union activity finally section of the act protect member of trade union that be recognise or be seek to be recognise by their employer against offer make by the employer for the sole or main purpose of result in worker term and condition not be determine by collective agreement negotiate by the union as my hon friend the member for knowsley indicate we can not comment on the extent to which exist legislation apply to particular case as that be ultimately matter for tribunal and court to determine however hope it have be helpful to state clearly some of the exist protection that may be relevant it be also worth put it on record that this government expect employer to work in partnership with union to resolve dispute through negotiation we certainly do not believe that pay offer should be frame in way that require an individual to confirm that they be not member of trade union at the very least as my hon friend say that go against the spirit of good industrial relation recognise that dispute be sometimes difficult to resolve and take this opportunity to highlight the important role that acas play in this space its remit be to promote good employment relation to advise employer and employee on workplace matter and to resolve individual and collective workplace dispute employee and employer in workplace dispute may wish to contact acas to get advice on employment law and workplace relation and to help resolve their dispute of course resolve dispute through acas require both party to participate and it be disappointing to hear from my hon friend that not only will livv not engage with she on this matter but it do not appear that it will engage with the trade union either hope livv reconsider because through our make work pay agenda we have be clear that it be our intention to ensure that workplace right be fit for modern economy empower work people and deliver economic growth that be why we have introduce the employment rights bill which represent the big upgrade to worker right in generation we will always listen carefully to any argument on how the law on inducement or detriment could be improve and we always welcome view on how we can reset industrial relation to create modern framework that be fit for modern economy and modern working practice would welcome the opportunity to hear more information from my hon friend about the specific of this issue and urge livv to engage with she and the trade union be open to look at the case in more detail to understand what action if any be necessary and be always happy to work with my hon friend to ensure that trade union right be properly observe in this country question put and agree to house adjourn
