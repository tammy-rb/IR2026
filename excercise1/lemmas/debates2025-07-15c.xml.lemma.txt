business before questions fuller inquiry phase report resolved that an humble address be present to his majesty that he will be graciously pleased to give direction that there be lay before this house return of report date july entitle independent inquiry into the issue raise by the david fuller case phase turley oral answers to questions energy security and net zero the secretary of state be ask renewable energy sector worker right what step he be take to support worker right in the renewable energy sector the government be commit to strengthen collective bargaining and trade union recognition the employment rights bill and the plan to make work pay will modernise right and improve condition the office for clean energy jobs engage union to ensure that renewable energy job support economic growth the net zero transition and worker move from carbon intensive sector many of my constituent in halesowen work in energy intensive industry such as forge and heavy manufacturing the government be rightly support those industry to become more energy efficient but worker need new skill as well as skill in the many new job in the renewable energy sector as they make this transition how be the department support worker in the west midland to get the right skill for these new industry my hon friend be right to raise that point support worker in energy intensive industry be essential as we transition our economy the government will provide over billion per year in skill fund by support training in renewable low carbon construction and advanced engineering we be also invest over million over three year to develop engineering skill in england and launch new technical excellence college to make sure that training stay align with employer need we will also push forward on the clean energy workforce strategy this year green industries supply chain jobs what step he have take with cabinet colleague to help increase the number of job in supply chain in green industry the industrial strategy publish last month set out our plan to build clean energy supply chain in the uk include new billion fund through great british energy to partner with the private sector to create job in britain and the new clean industry bonus which have the potential to unleash billion of pound of private investment in offshore wind supply chain we be determined that the clean energy future will be make in britain the power cable over the tyne be barrier to business secure work for large renewable energy structure risk possible net gva benefit of up to billion it have be propose that the removal of the cable will be complete in will the secretary of state help push for it to be bring forward so that tyneside be not hold back in the global race for green job first congratulate my hon friend on be such brilliant champion of the port of tyne and what it offer and she be right to draw attention to this important issue approval of any work to reroute the line be matter for ofgem but we stand ready to engage with she and indeed ofgem to try to bring this forward suggest that my hon friend the energy minister meet she to discuss this important issue despite the grow need for green job obviously we be all in favour of make sure we have green job few than one in employee receive any dedicated green skill training accord to an ovo energy survey what can we do to support business and what can the government do to accelerate that important training programme in all business where we need green job the hon lady raise an important issue later this year we will publish clean energy skill plan to address precisely this question how do we make sure we equip worker with the skill they need to take advantage of those job that be be lead by my right hon friend the education secretary in the work she be do with skills england but there be whole range of thing we can do for the first time the government will publish what the skill need be for clean energy job and how we will meet they which will be an important step forward as people fly off for their summer holiday the chance be that the steel in the aeroplane engine come from the stocksbridge speciality steels plant in my constituency be hopeful about the news that liberty steel which own the site have attract potential investor for this asset the asset be essential for our national security and provide opportunity for net zero infrastructure include wind turbine however uncertainty about the firm mean that pension contribution have not be pay to the skilled workforce for month cause significant worry and anxiety for local steelworker what reassurance can the secretary of state provide to stocksbridge steelworker about how the outstanding pension contribution will be pay include in any future ownership arrangement my hon friend raise an important issue about her constituency and the steel industry and would say two thing one be that what this government have do which be afraid be not do previously be set up dedicated fund for steel so that we be able to make the green transition we talk about this in opposition and we be now deliver billion of pound to help the steel industry transition the other be that will take up the specific pension issue she raise with my right hon friend the business and trade secretary the worker of grangemouth deserve far well than they get from the labour government to add insult to injury they have have to watch they pull out all the stop for scunthorpe and prax lindsey in write answer to the energy minister refuse to confirm how much money the uk government have spend to continue operation at lindsey will the secretary of state now come clean and tell we what price they be willing to pay to save job in england which they be not willing to pay to save grangemouth in scotland the hon gentleman be so wide of the mark it be unbelievable the grangemouth closure be foreshadow before this government come to power we have work hand in glove with his colleague in the scottish government all the way along gillian martin and have be work on it and for he to try to make party politic out of the issue be frankly disgrace call the shadow secretary of state the british oil and gas industry be resilient sector it have have to be give this government action over the past year and it take lot to shock it but shock it be when on july sadly the energy minister claim to the scottish affairs committee that there be no material difference between oil and gas import and production from the north sea might the secretary of state take this opportunity to apologise and clarify those remark because thousand of worker in the energy industry supply chain in aberdeen and across the uk be very worried that the department have such scant regard for they their work and this world lead industry first of all mr speaker let congratulate the hon gentleman on his promotion to shadow secretary of state laughter on the specific issue he raise we will take no lecture from the conservatives some job be lose in the north sea on their watch and here be the difference we be build the future the acorn project be talk about for year after year by the conservatives but nothing be do this government be deliver call shadow minister bowie the secretary of state will not apologise that be absolutely fine the industry already know that this be government who want nothing to do with it and who take every opportunity to talk it down and make every effort to shut it down in that same session last week the minister who be sit to the secretary of state leave also claim that much of the gas that be extract from the north sea be export that be simply not true of all the gas extract from the north sea be use in britain the secretary of state know that so why be he so determined to talk down this industry spout falsehood and myth drive investment out of the uk rely more on import and crucially cost people job and drive the skill we need out of this country that be exactly what he and his colleague be do here be the difference between they and we they would keep we hooked on fossil fuel for time immemorial they have learn not single lesson from the disaster they inflict on this country family finance ruin business finance ruin public finance ruin year on there be not word of apology clean power jobs what estimate he have make of the number of additional job that have be create in clean power industry in the north east since july what estimate he have make of the number of additional job that have be create in clean power industry since july what estimate he have make of the number of additional job that have be create in clean power industry since july what estimate he have make of the number of additional job that have be create in clean power industry since july since come to office the government have show how clean power can create job across our country with thousand of job in nuclear through our investment in sizewell and small modular reactor in carbon capture and storage in offshore wind and in home heating through our warm home plan this be what it mean to deliver reindustrialisation through our clean energy sprint thank the secretary of state for that answer the north east be uniquely place to be the home of the green energy revolution with the expansion of the energy academy in north tyneside provide skill pipeline how will the clean energy industry sector plan help to provide long term certainty for investment and deliver good quality job for community across my cramlington and killingworth constituency and the north east see the north east as an absolute powerhouse for the clean energy job we want to create early on in this government we do something which again have be talk about for year by the conservative party in deliver the east coast carbon capture usage and storage cluster which be project to create thousand of job include benefit for my hon friend constituency it be not just the direct job that will be create but job in the supply chain we have an opportunity the north east will be at the heart of this to lead in the clean energy job of the future declare an interest as the chair of the all party parliamentary group on critical mineral build local supply chain in cornwall be one of the primary mean by which local people can benefit if we be to dig nearly billion worth of stuff out of the ground every year or pump gw of offshore wind power onshore therefore what step be the secretary of state take to ensure that supply chain business particularly those of the size we have in cornwall and their workforce get the support they need so that worker and local community may share in the spoil of that investment let first say how much love cornwall love cornwall for many reason but one reason love it be the opportunity it offer to drive the job of the future know from my visit that whether it be through critical mineral geothermal or offshore wind there be huge opportunity in cornwall that be what the industrial strategy be design to superpower that be what the huge investment my right hon friend the chancellor make in the spending review will provide as part of our clean energy workforce strategy later on this year cornwall will be at the heart of it know that the secretary of state love harlow as well do he agree that the historic investment in clean energy secure at the spending review will mean thousand of job opportunity for young people include in harlow in renewable energy nuclear energy efficiency and so much more love harlow mr speaker and love harlow college the visit have make to the college have be incredibly inspiring have see with my own eye the enthusiastic young people there and speak to they about green skill and the job of the future when think about what this government intend to deliver it be absolutely about my hon friend constituent in harlow will the secretary of state join in congratulate tk murray ltd no relation honest an energy save contractor base in kilsyth on have already cross train more than half its workforce to become fully fledge installer of air source heat pump technology from gas boiler this have be facilitate by warmworks which have develop supply chain of more than small and medium sized enterprise to make more than green job reality love cumbernauld mr speaker my hon friend raise the important opportunity in heat pump technology the growth in heat pump that we be see be not just about well deal for consumer but about the manufacturing that we can see my hon friend have give great example of that if the secretary of state love shropshire and be sure he do hope he will not bulldoze over all our green belt but that be another story for another day the secretary of state talk about green job be sure he do not want our fire service to be deploy more and more but with solar energy feeding into battery energy storage system there be real concern at shropshire fire service and across the country that there will be fire that be very difficult for our fire service to control do the secretary of state agree that our fire service should be statutory consultee on future planning application for battery storage this be an important issue that we need to take seriously at the moment it come under the health and safety regime but we be consult on the good arrangement to ensure that we have the high standard of safety there be high safety standard in place but as we see the growth of battery we will endeavour to ensure that those standard be maintain it go without say that love burgess hill one brilliant business there be steve willis training which be this week celebrate year in business train the region future electricity plumbing and heating engineer do the secretary of state agree that such business be vital in deliver the skill of the future and will he join in congratulate steve willis training on be brilliant family business that provide key skill to the south east warmly congratulate steve willis training on its year in operation and on the work it be do the hon lady make an important point we can help to create job in the private sector but the question then be whether people will have the skill to fill they organisation and company like steve willis training be fundamental to that sometimes it require lot of training sometimes it require short amount of training to retrain people in new technology like heat pump it be vital that that training happen people across basildon and billericay and indeed across the country want to see more job in energy production and to see cheap energy what they do not understand be why the government be back some but not all form of energy why be the government insist on ship job in oil and gas abroad rather than keep they here while invest in green energy at the same time the answer be that we be not as the right hon gentleman know the reality be that the north sea have be basin in decline and that job be lose under the previous government the question be do we create the job of the future as well as maintain exist field for their lifetime this government be commit to do so if he want to see those job he should support our plan tempt as be to wax lyrical about the beauty of aberdeenshire will instead ask the secretary of state very simple question by this time next year how many job will gb energy have create in aberdeen and aberdeenshire gb energy will create thousand of job across the country include in aberdeen here be why gb energy really matter we have choose to put its headquarters in aberdeen as we recognise that aberdeen be the clean energy capital of our country not just for oil and gas which be important but for the future snp members be chuntere on the front bench but they never do anything to create that future for people in aberdeen electricity grid capacity what step he be take to increase electricity grid capacity we be work with ofgem and the national energy system operator to accelerate network infrastructure through reform to planning supply chain and other area deliver the capacity need to achieve clean power by and to drive economic growth in my constituency of bicester and woodstock the local plan anticipate significant new employment site to create job and growth tritax big box tell that it want to put solar panel on of usable roof area on the building that it intend to create local planning policy would support that yet be shocked to learn that tritax expect to install solar panel on only of usable roof space it can not get permit to generate electricity or consent to export to the grid will the minister or his official meet to discuss how we can turn this into win win opportunity for rooftop green solar that sound like fantastic opportunity our ambition be to see solar panel on as many rooftop across the country as possible it be win win opportunity as the hon gentleman rightly put it he and have speak about number of these issue previously and be happy to discuss this one with he if he could write to with the specific we will certainly look at the matter in the meantime we be look at reform all those process to make sure that we can get as much power as possible call the chair of the energy security and net zero committee the challenge of increase electricity grid capacity include the ability to get plan consent and to achieve grid connection as the minister know in the report that the select committee publish last week we refer to the problem of inconsistency in some of the guidance and energy plan over which come first the grid connection or the planning consent will the minister please address that and ensure that the government clear up that inconsistency so that we can move forward with increase electricity generation and grid capacity thank my hon friend for the question and for the work that he and the whole committee have be do on this matter his report have be my bedtime read every night this week as it be an important piece of work he be right about two thing first where process be not as well align as they should be we absolutely need to look at what we can do to make sure that they work much more coherently the second point his report make which we be also look at be how we bring together thing such as the strategic spatial energy plan the holistic network design and the land use framework to make sure that we have coherent plan across the country so that we can plan properly our energy system energy cost business what step he be take to help support business to reduce their energy cost we know that the cost of energy be huge challenge to business across the country that be why our mission to deliver clean power by be so important that be how we will get bill down for good while we try to get there we be take action to support business include through the new british industrial competitiveness scheme which will reduce electricity cost by around to for more than business when the government help business reduce energy cost include by aid their transition business such as the pub and cafés in dawley madeley and oakengates and manufacturer on stafford park and halesfield can then protect and create job and pass on saving to customer will the government back those business and ask the energy giant which continue to make ten of billion of pound of profit to pay for it my hon friend be completely right to stress the challenge face by business the government be commit to back business we be work with the regulator to make sure that the system be fair for everyone and as be set out in our industrial strategy from the new british industrial competitiveness scheme will reduce electricity cost by up to per megawatt hour which will benefit thousand of electricity intensive industry include the one in his constituency we be very clear that we be back business and we will do everything we can to support they in drive down bill energy cost be an issue that the prax oil refinery have bring to my attention over the year as problem it have be face appreciate the call have have with the minister for energy about this be able to visit the plant on friday and there be clearly grow concern with hundred of job at risk what assurance can the minister offer my constituent who be affect by this situation the hon member be right to raise this situation we know that it be very difficult and we have be engage on it there have be long stand issue with how the plant be run we be try across the piece to support business to make the transition and support they within the transition so that we can protect job across the country call the shadow minister when the price cap fall last month the labour party boast off your bill deliver by labour the minister know that energy bill fall as wholesale gas price fall and she know that her policy be to take the country off gas and keep increase policy cost on bill that be why she refuse to repeat the claim will she take this opportunity to apologise for her party say something that she know be untrue every time the hon member stand up to speak hold my head in absolute frustration he be gamble with fossil fuel and quite frankly the conservatives should hang their head in shame energy bill rocket under their watch and they do nothing about it they be happy with that that be not legacy that we be willing to contend with which be why we be take action in the short term to drive down bill through our sprint to clean power their legacy be one they should be ashamed of so they should not be lecture we new nuclear what assessment he have make of the role of new nuclear in support clean energy transition what assessment he have make of the role of new nuclear in support clean energy transition the clean power action plan make it clear that nuclear will play an important role in our future energy system provide low carbon baseload power to the grid we be deliver the big new nuclear building programme in generation have commit almost billion at the recent spending review be grateful to the secretary of state for show his love for hemel hempstead when he come to launch new scheme on solar panel the other month on the question of new nuclear and clean job could the minister outline how community like mine in hemel hempstead will benefit from these new job well my right hon friend the energy secretary say that we love hemel hempstead think we agree on that the nuclear sector be poise for significant growth that will help deliver on our energy need in the future and it be how we will deliver thousand of skilled job across the country the nuclear skill plan be collaborative effort between government industry and academia set out the target work we need to address the skill gap and bring forward the thousand of apprentice we will need to deliver this work in the future the regional skill hub we have establish will help to deliver training support locally to ensure that every community in the country benefit rolls royce in derby have recently be announce as the preferred bidder for the delivery of small modular reactor which mean that many of my erewash constituent will become the beat heart of the workforce that deliver the reactor can the minister explain how derbyshire fine smr will help to end our reliance on foreign oil and gas my hon friend be absolutely right the government be commit to deliver new golden age of nuclear secure an abundance of clean power after year of dither and delay from the conservatives and with that will come investment across the country on june follow robust two year process great british energy nuclear select rolls royce smr as its preferred bidder to deliver the uk first small modular reactor subject to final government approval and contract signature the government be make available billion across the spending review to enable this to be one of europe first smr programme have always be supporter of nuclear power unfortunately we do not have access to nuclear power in northern ireland but know from discussion with the minister that he be very keen to ensure that modular nuclear power opportunity be available in northern ireland business that have speak to want access to these opportunity as do the northern ireland assembly know that the minister be always commit to try to make thing well so have he have an opportunity to talk to the relevant minister in the northern ireland assembly about ensure that access to modular nuclear power be available to we in northern ireland regularly engage with ministers in the northern irish executive include in the department for the economy which have responsibility for energy policy in northern ireland and we discuss range of issue we be happy to support the northern irish executive in any way we can either with technology or through roll out the regulatory framework we be really excited about the opportunity pose by smr and be happy to discuss that in northern ireland as well industrial electricity prices what step his department be take to help reduce industrial electricity price what step his department be take to help reduce industrial electricity price we understand that high energy bill be challenge for business and particularly energy intensive company we be clear that in the long term our mission to deliver clean power be the only way to bear down on that cost but while we get there we be provide the support need through the british industrial competitiveness scheme and the supercharger scheme protect over business the uk industrial electricity price be among the high in europe and it be quite clear that the government current policy be fail manufacture business in constituency such as mine will the minister commit to introduce support that genuinely reduce electricity cost for manufacturer include by tackle high wholesale energy price rather than prolong the uncertainty which sadly put local job at risk gently remind the right hon member that industrial energy price rocket on the conservatives watch gas price for non domestic company go up by which be catastrophic for uk plc we be take action to support business through our sprint to clean power and critically the measure we be provide through the british industrial competitiveness scheme those measure have be support by make uk the british chambers of commerce uk steel and the chemical industries association the conservatives dither delay and do nothing to support business we be crack on and get on with the job on friday visit precision ltd small manufacture company in my constituency electricity represent easily its big cost what be the minister do to listen to small and medium sized enterprise like who feel that their voice be simply not be hear we be listen to business particularly small and medium sized business we have hear company complain for example about be lock into expensive fix term contract that be why ofgem be work to deliver blend and extend contract so that business can benefit from low price we have hear their frustration at the lack of redress system which be why last december we expand the ombudsman service to of business so that they can get redress and financial award of up to we have also hear their frustration about energy broker which be why we have consult on introduce regulation of third party intermediary we will respond in due course last week the energy security and net zero committee hear from make uk and representative from the chemical petrochemical steel and ceramics industry that close alignment and collaboration with the eu on energy pricing be critical to reduce bill that be also recognise in the government industrial strategy what more be the department do to bring that forward quickly my hon friend make good point industry voice have be call for that close alignment particularly on the emission trading scheme we have hear that from uk steel the cbi make uk and the energy intensive users group and we believe that those strong linkage be the right thing to do to cut red tape at the border to protect consumer from high cost and critically to boost trade and growth which the government be absolutely committed to do one way to drive down energy cost include for energy intensive industry could be to help cut curtailment cost by encourage the co location of new energy intensive industry sector with some of the renewable sector that we be currently have to pay to switch off as we start to roll out more datum centre across the country what conversation have ministers have about how such centre could be optimally locate to help reduce our energy bill at the same time my hon friend make good point as always we in the department be work across government as part of the ai council as well as with colleague in the department for business and trade to ensure that we have the co ordination and collaboration to support business on the ground clean energy supply what step he be take to help increase the supply of clean energy we will continue to support new renewable through the contract for difference scheme in conjunction with initiative such as the warm home plan the future home standard and the boiler upgrade scheme great british energy and great british energy nuclear will together invest more than billion over this parliament in home grow clean power welcome the government mission to achieve clean power by know that the minister will agree that it be vital that we make the transition to net zero as quickly as possible not only to fight climate change but to low energy bill do he agree that whereas previous government have fail to deliver for the british people our plan be the single good way to bring down energy bill for family include in my battersea constituency and to provide they with much need energy security completely agree my hon friend make the point that this be not just about action on the climate as important as that be and create thousand of new job but about bring down bill and crucially deliver on that energy security point the truth be that even though our clean power mission be about do all four of those thing at the same time the conservative party oppose all of that action would leave we much more vulnerable to the volatility of the fossil fuel market and would turn its face against the economic opportunity of the century the minister will recognise that one way to increase the supply of clean energy be to enable community energy project to supply local energy market when minister be ask about that as he know they have be many time they generally say that there be no technical obstacle to it happen but will the minister recognise that there be world of difference between on the one hand something be technically possible and on the other that same thing be facilitate and encourage so it really happen will he focus on the latter as the government develop their energy market reform completely agree the right hon and learn gentleman be absolutely right there be no technical barrier to do it but that do not mean that it be straightforward process to be honest thing that think would have be much more straightforward like how we define community be more difficult to get right but we be absolutely determined to do it he be right to make the point about deliver clean power that benefit local community so that they can buy it locally and really see the benefit of host it that be exactly what we be determined to do and we will continue to work to make it happen warm home discount what assessment he have make of the potential impact of extend the warm home discount to all household in receipt of means test benefit on people receive those benefit we know that household be under huge pressure with the cost of living and energy cost be big part of that the expansion of the warm home discount scheme will mean that nearly million more family will receive vital support with their energy bill this winter this will provide much need help at time when people desperately need it will the minister confirm how many resident in my north durham constituency will benefit from the extension of the warm home discount to all household in receipt of means test benefit sadly we do not have datum at constituency level but can tell my hon friend who be brilliant champion for his constituency that around extra household in the north east will benefit from the expansion an increase of around the minister will be aware that many home particularly in rural area be old property that be difficult to insulate do she agree that we all need to concentrate on those old type of property many of which be the home of elderly people who can not afford expensive energy we need to concentrate on ensure that those home be properly insulate and that the warm home discount scheme be extend to such property the hon member make an important point we be very clear that we need to make sure that we have the right solution for every household include those in rural community have meet representative from rural community council member and some of the company that be try to do work in rural community we be absolutely committed to get this right as part of the warm home plan renewable energy private sector investment what assessment he have make of the adequacy of mechanism to encourage private sector investment in renewable energy source since the election last year we have secure over billion of investment into the uk clean energy industry last year renewable auction for allocation round be the most successful in our history and we will shortly open the auction this be the way to deliver energy security low bill and good job for our community private sector investment via community energy scheme be popular way of engage people to get behind renewable energy project in their area great example be meadow blue community energy in my constituency of chichester which put money back into the community with grant scheme and be now fund solar panel on local school roof do the secretary of state agree that community energy project would attract more private sector investment if grid access cost be reduce and the delivery of local supply be make easy the hon lady raise an important issue which be also raise by the right hon and learn member for kenilworth and southam sir jeremy wright she be right about the virtue of community energy great british energy be go to partner with local community to deliver community energy up and down the country because sometimes public capital it could be loan it could be grant can help lever in the private capital that we need she be also right about some of the barrier as the energy minister mention want to assure she that we be go through the different barrier in granular nerdy detail to see how we can break they down must declare an interest as crofte tenant of knock and swordale common grazing as good definition of community as you can ever get but knock and swordale along with several other community power scheme in my constituency can not get grid connection except through active network management connection which basically mean that the community can supply power to the grid only when the big boy the commercial company be not do so these connection offer be next to useless and the national energy system operator ofgem and the transmission company have to be tell from this dispatch box that they can not be agnostic about what kind of grid connection they offer and to whom they must put community first if community be go to support this transition my hon friend who have talk to on number of occasion about these wide issue raise really important point be just talk to the energy minister about it let take away my hon friend point about access we be commit to drive forward community energy and we will talk to neso and ofgem to get it right and make sure it happen net zero policies what step he be take to ensure scientific evidence be use to support his net zero policy yesterday the secretary of state make an incredibly important statement to this house outline the crisis we face when it come to climate change and the decline of nature tackle this start with be honest about the science and what the expert be tell we we know that we can only have climate security for future generation by act at scale today thank the minister for her answer energy security be important not just to help bring bill down now do the minister agree that it be also vital for the future and for protect future generation include in my constituency of eminently lovable watford because those young people be the one who will face the climate change consequence in the year to come as someone who grow up in luton be not sure be allow to say that love watford because there be an age old rivalry there but yes we know that act now with our clean energy superpower mission scale up renewable reinforce the grid and reduce our reliance on volatile fossil fuel market will mean clean more secure future for generation to come that be why unlike the conservatives we be follow the science and show the leadership that be need at home and abroad around beverley there be proposal for five solar farm total mw can the minister assure my constituent that the scientific evidence that will be use to assess this will include the cumulative impact of these project on the area around beverley yes of course we look at the cumulative impact of these development have be in the department the right hon gentleman will know that we have an excellent team of scientist lead by professor paul monks who want to pay tribute to because he be stand down later this year be sure the right hon gentleman would want to do so too call the shadow secretary of state and congratulation on your marriage thank you mr speaker the secretary of state try to argue yesterday that he be climate change believer and everybody else who disagree with he be deni because he do not want to engage with any legitimate criticism of his policy he be offshore british industry in other word replace british good with dirty import with high emission can the minister confirm what the scientific evidence be that do so will help to tackle climate change perhaps if the right hon member have be here yesterday she would have be able to engage with the secretary of state on this the science be absolutely clear every avoid fraction of degree of warming make difference to the severity of climate impact that be why the prime minister go to the global leader summit at last year to announce new align nationally determine contribution and we will continue to show international leadership radio teleswitch service what step he be take to manage the radio teleswitch service switch off the government have step in to ensure more control and carefully manage phase out of the radio teleswitch service have be engage directly on this and meet energy uk and ofgem fortnightly to discuss progress and the supplier phase out plan my focus and priority be absolutely clear to ensure that there be no impact on consumer and that we minimise any consumer detriment welcome the government change in course because the previous hard deadline would have leave many people include people in my constituency of edinburgh west vulnerable and indeed unaware that there be any need to change their meter but there be still big problem in scotland as people be still wait on meter and may be unaware of this issue on engage with the community will the minister please tell we what she be do in scotland to ensure that rural community be approach about this and vulnerable people get protection we have be work closely with the scottish government and engage with scottish mps we know that about meter need to be replace in scotland all those household have be contact multiple time in addition because we know that there be particular challenge in some rural community we have do sprint in which supplier be work in collaboration with the local authority to bring down the number of replacement need can reassure the hon member that no area will be switch off without we contact consumer to inform they without we allow they to book in emergency appointment and critically without we inform mp and local authority so that we do this in the good possible way climate change committee report what assessment he have make of the potential implication for his policy of the climate change committee report entitle progress in reduce emission publish on june the climate change committee report make clear the progress we have make in the past month on overturn the terrible legacy of the conservatives who turn their back on climate action we know that clean power be the route to energy security low bill and good job it be shame that the tories and reform be still stick in the past the climate change committee say that the uk should be proud of its approach to consistent and sustain decarbonisation but there be much more to do this week bracknell forest community climate action be host summit to discuss what can be do locally to address climate change and support nature do the minister agree that local initiative like this demonstrate the strong public support for action on climate change we know that there be strong public support and we be keen to engage more at local level with group like bracknell forest community climate action that be why we have set up the local net zero delivery group to work with council and mayor and why we will produce public participation strategy later this year very much hope that my hon friend constituent will get involve in that will the minister join in congratulate the fantastic lib dem run winchester city council on be rat the green council in the uk by climate action uk that be lot of work by politician and it show what politician who dearly believe in this issue can achieve if they crack on and deal with it rather than weaponise it in some kind of culture war be happy to join the hon member in congratulate his local council visit the local government association the week before last think with the local net zero delivery group on which we have representation from all area of local government be keen to learn from the good and translate that into action for other who need bit more encouragement renewable energy what step he be take to increase the use of renewable energy our clean power action plan set out our pathway to deliver clean power to support that plan we recently launch the solar road map which confirm plan to increase domestic solar installation through the future home standard and warm home plan over of our food and billion in lifesave medicine depend on the cold chain but operator face soar energy cost and grow grid instability in epsom and ewell sunswap be pioneer battery and solar power refrigeration which cut emission while protect vital supply chain will the minister commit to target support for renewable energy innovator like sunswap whose technology can strengthen both sustainability and national resilience the hon lady be right that we have an enormous amount of innovation in this space and real potential to meet our future need not just as result of the pathway that we have outline but through innovative solution like the one she mention which provide specific support to target industry be happy to look far into her proposal and at the funding available for innovation if she want to write to with any detail will happily follow up business in the village of fradley in my constituency have plan to put million of watt of solar on the roof of its business unfortunately it can not proceed with that application because there be not sufficient export capacity on the site it would never export watt of that electricity which would meet only fraction of its energy need will the minister meet so that we can discuss how we can make regulatory change to support project like this one my hon friend make point that other have raise we be look in granular detail at how the system work to ensure that the regulatory landscape allow such opportunity to be take be very happy to meet he to discuss this far we be take detailed look at every single aspect of the system so that community business and other can benefit from be able to export power to the grid that will help the country with its energy need and deliver benefit for local community household energy bills what step he be take to help reduce household energy bill what step he be take to help support low income family in the context of trend in the level of energy price what step he be take to help reduce household energy bill we believe that the good way to protect household permanently be through our mission to deliver clean power by combine with our warm home plan to upgrade million of home across the country so that they be warm and cheap to run that will drive down energy bill and make cold home thing of the past we know that we need to support people while we make that transition which be why we be extend the warm home discount almost of people in my north east hampshire constituency live in fuel poverty agree with the minister that invest in renewable energy would help to tackle that so how be she work with the ministry of housing communities and local government to empower local authority to develop renewable energy generation locally by follow europe lead in put solar over car park for example in order to make energy cheap and more sustainable the hon member be right there be big push to work with local and regional authority to ensure not only that we generate renewable that can impact on bill but that we upgrade home through local energy action plan local authority be for the first time work with the national energy system operator and other system operator to drive that local and regional authority have crucial role to play in upgrade million of home across the country my heywood and middleton north constituent live in state of profound uncertainty as to how the unpredictability of global energy market will affect their family do the minister agree that if we want to protect those family from volatility we must end our reliance on global fossil fuel market and introduce target intervention to bring bill down particularly for those on the low income my hon friend be right it beggar belief that the conservative party be so stuck in its ideological opposition to move towards clean power we be clear that we must break our dependence on global fossil fuel market which lead to record energy bill during the energy crisis we be make that sprint but it be critical that we support the most vulnerable household while we make that transition which be why be so proud that this government extend the warm home discount so that an extra million household one in five will benefit this winter congratulate ministers again on embrace the principle of the sunshine bill campaign run by and many other to ensure that solar panel be include on the roof of all new house in the heat of recent week people in my constituency have be swelter in beautiful old regency building which pose particular challenge in this respect do ministers agree that if we line up heat pump technology and solar panel we can lower our energy bill and keep cool at the same time the hon member be right we believe in solar panel revolution that be one of the key thing that great british energy will bring about across the country on overheat it will be critical to ensure that as we upgrade home we make they fit for purpose in the context of climate change we be include air to air heat pump in the boiler upgrade scheme and we will consider other measure to keep home cool the government have take long overdue step to secure rooftop solar on new build but there be even great untapped potential on exist commercial and domestic rooftop will minister consider introduce scheme similar to those in other country offer free installation of rooftop solar for business and resident the cost could be pay back through long term power purchase agreement that would simultaneously increase the supply of clean energy and cut bill my hon friend be right to talk about the potential of solar on our commercial building we know that solar can reduce energy bill by about we be look at all the option because we be absolutely serious about solar rooftop revolution whether on our home or commercial building call the liberal democrat spokesperson we welcome the joint agreement sign in may between the uk and the eu in which small step be take to address the impact of the conservatives botch brexit deal on energy cost and bill what further step will the secretary of state take to forge energy co operation through recoupling of the uk and eu electricity market and the uk participation in the eu internal electricity market to boost trade bring down renewable energy cost and reduce energy bill we have be listen to industry voice and they be very clear about the opportunity for strong alignment we will continue to engage with they and with our partner in the eu on the opportunity as we make the sprint to clean power topical questions if he will make statement on his departmental responsibility since the last oral question time for the department the spending review announce the large investment in clean energy in our country history investment in new nuclear in carbon capture and storage and in hydrogen transport and storage we be invest billion through great british energy and billion in our warm home plan for energy security low bill and good job evidence from the national grid ofgem and imperial college london show that locational or zonal pricing would save billion of pound year low bill and reduce the need for expensive and often unpopular grid infrastructure why have the secretary of state rule it out make comprehensive statement to the house on this last thursday and the ground for the decision be these first there be the question of fairness and secondly there be the question of the cost of the transition and what would happen in the meantime we need investment in our clean energy infrastructure and we need investment in growth believe that our way reform national pricing be the right way forward in the fight for energy security every area of our country must play its part but that mean energy infrastructure project should be distribute evenly what be the department do to ensure that no community will be ask to do more than its fair share my hon friend make an important point that be why the strategic spatial energy plan will set out where we need our energy infrastructure so that we can have plan system that match power need and infrastructure at least cost to bill payer and taxpayer call the shadow secretary of state yesterday the secretary of state say be hide when be in fact with my six month old baby who know he be aware of on behalf of all young mum who face those kind of comment in their first few week back at work may gently suggest he reflect on those remark want to ask the secretary of state very simple question be high or low than on the first point completely respect the right hon lady decision to be with her young baby and there be no offence intend think it be very important that we understand the need of new parent and indeed parent across the country on the question she ask do not know what she be get at frankly do not know whether the secretary of state do not know or do not want to say but megawatt hour be what electricity cost last year and be the price he have pay for offshore wind and he be set to do the same this year and that be before the extra cost for the grid for wasted wind and back up which be go through the roof thank to his policy yesterday he commit to radical honesty in that spirit will he admit either that he can not add up or that his policy can not bring down bill be go to be radically honest and tell the right hon lady the truth she be gamble on fossil fuel the same thing she do that lead we to the bad cost of live crisis in our country history with family finance business finance and public finance wreck the only way to bring down bill for good be through cheap home grow power that we control we have an energy security plan the conservatives have an energy surrender plan what ambition do the department have for sector and technology that gb energy will prioritise since the chief operating officer have say that he want to evolve it into major energy company and what might that mean for job creation include in constituency like mine gb energy will prioritise whole range of project and that be matter for gb energy as publicly own energy company at arm length from government but there be huge opportunity right across our country whether in float wind tidal hydrogen or offshore wind and supply chain gb energy be own by the public and will benefit people right across britain call the liberal democrat spokesperson across europe we have already see heatwave relate death avoidable death and the met office report say that thing will just get bad the lib dems and have really cool idea will the secretary of state work with local authority to open up public space with air conditioning such as leisure centre and library so that they can provide relief from extreme heat for the elderly and vulnerable there be no monopoly on good idea and the hon lady raise the important issue of how we adapt as country to the climate crisis we know we have lot more to do and we will listen to all good idea in my constituency be proud that we have the first example in the country of high energy use craft that have transition fully to renewable have work with uk manufacturer to create super efficient electric furnace will the secretary of state come to stourbridge and visit allister malcolm glass at the stourbridge glass museum with to highlight it as an example for other to follow and protect high energy use heritage craft across the country my hon friend raise great example and will take risk and say yes will come to stourbridge love stourbridge and look forward to see that project the government new scope guidance for offshore project be hugely welcome we be already battle deadly heatwave and overshoot climate limit so it be critical that we stop extract new oil and gas give that there be no scenario in which rosebank or indeed any new oil and gas well be compatible with limit global temperature increase to why be the government try to delay recognition of that climate reality by say that application will be consider on case by case basis will the minister give we conclusive science back answer now and confirm that rosebank will not be go ahead of course the government follow the regulation that we have put in place quickly and application must be consider on case by case basis that be the way anyone would expect they to be deal with will not say on the floor of the house any more about those application as they be live decision that will be make in due course by the department what reassurance can the minister offer the nearly worker at prax that the government be focused on find new owner for the lindsey oil refinery will repeat what have say before we be obviously hugely disappoint by the way that the owner have deal with the company repeat the ask that have make in the house number of time and in write to the chief executive that he should put his hand in his pocket and do the right thing by the workforce we be do everything we can as part of the insolvency process safely to manage the refinery and to look at whether there be buyer interested in take it on the late central estimate from the office for budget responsibility put the cost of achieve net zero by at billion with half that cost attribute to lose fuel duty do the secretary of state accept that the government will need to increase duty elsewhere include on renewable which could push bill up far the most significant thing about the obr report be that it say there be an threat to our gdp by in world and rise in the debt to gdp ratio if we do not act on climate change that be the most important thing from that report which recommend all hon member read over the summer have receive numerous email from my constituent in broxtowe raise concern about the loss of or threat to meadow meadow be critical to our environment and have be part of our natural heritage for century they provide wealth of benefit such as unique wildlife habitat flood alleviation and the promotion of clean air without well protection remain historic meadow and their ecological value risk vanish beneath our foot will the minister commit to include the protection of meadow in the list of irreplaceable habitat appreciate my hon friend concern this be matter for the department for environment food and rural affairs but be happy to talk to colleague as they bring forward their land use framework nature base solution to climate change be important so we very much engage with our colleague in defra on these issue solar developer be not play by the rule when it come to access the land of people on ynys môn government guidance state that developer must act reasonably when try to obtain permission to access the land but my constituent have receive threatening email and there have even be case of developer trespass on land do the minister condone such behaviour and do he believe that current guidance be strong enough to protect constituent such as mine do not know the specific of the case that the hon lady raise if she want to send any detail to will certainly look at they we clearly want to see and expect in every single case partnership between developer deliver project that we think be important the planning system responsible for put the process in place and the community who should have their local area protect and be able to access it be happy to follow up with she if she want to raise specific with the vyrnwy frankton project which aim to connect onshore wind to the grid would cut across my constituency and affect local community and cherish countryside pose threat to business and tourism will the minister assure that the impact of the project and its associated lifetime cost will be minimise by undergrounde the cable along the route except where geology make that impossible that be not the position of the government because report after report and the evidence point to the fact that undergrounde cable be significantly more expensive than put they above ground individual application will clearly look at the individual circumstance and make decision on that we have say as government that communitie that host network infrastructure should benefit through community benefit and direct money off bill and that be what we will deliver it be recently announce that the surplus ministry of defence land at raf wyton in my constituency have be designate as an mod trailblazer site the housing minister confirm to last week that no assessment have yet be make of the energy infrastructure currently in place the prime minister recently confirm to here in the chamber that my proposal to develop defence technology cluster on the site would be support to that end be the minister prepare to look into the available energy infrastructure and substation connectivity at the site and write to with his assessment the hon gentleman be assiduous in raise these sort of question with be very happy to look at the possibility he be right to outline the potential of site such as that and we will look at it nova innovation in my constituency be pioneer float solar which be generate clean energy will my right hon friend outline what step the government be take to support the development of float solar that sound incredibly exciting and look forward to find out more we have be use float solar technology in this country since last month the french start the large plant in europe produce mw the chinese have single plant that produce mw give the scale of its use across the world bar britain why do the secretary of state refer to float solar as nascent technology what be nascent about it it sound like be be educate about float solar be happy to share the hon gentleman enthusiasm for it if he have proposal about how we can take it forward be all ear in france germany croatia and elsewhere on mainland europe geothermal energy be be take very seriously be disappoint that geothermal energy get little mention in the industrial strategy particularly as there be estimate to be gw of energy in the cornish granite batholith will the secretary of state meet to discuss how we clear the barrier to unleash the potential of the cornish granite batholith my hon friend always raise the huge potential of cornwall in this house and in the energy space he be right to talk about the potential for geothermal we be hugely excited about the opportunity that it present be very happy to meet he and other to discuss far how we can take it forward be already be contact by constituent who be worried about afford their energy bill this winter but do not feel that the service they get from the energy company be properly support they what step be the government take to ensure that energy company provide the support that they need we be very clear that energy company have strict obligation to follow we be work with ofgem to ensure that it adhere to those obligation and we be do the job of review ofgem to ensure that it be proper consumer champion with the mandate and power to work on behalf of consumer and reform this market so that it work in the interest of the hon lady constituent more than ineos chemical employee be to lose their job at grangemouth because the refinery have close the million commitment to project willow do not help they in the here and now and it be frankly an insult to the worker who be about to lose their livelihood to talk about training opportunity at forth valley college that be not be afford to they what have the government actually do and what will they do for those worker who do not have the same redundancy or training package as the refinery worker we be look in the round at how we can deliver job and opportunity on the grangemouth site the national wealth fund make an unprecedented commitment of million and have be meet company that be potentially interested in develop project to make sure we get they over the line we have deliver on the training guarantee and deliver support beyond that provide by the falkirk and grangemouth growth deal we be do everything we can to support the workforce there and we will continue to do so afghanistan with permission mr speaker wish to make statement on significant datum protection breach from february relate to the afghan relocation and assistance policy it lead to the high court grant an unprecedented super injunction and the previous government establish secret afghan resettlement route today be announce to the house change in government policy be close that resettlement route disclose the data loss and confirm that the court order be lift at noon today member of this house include you mr speaker and have be subject to the super injunction it be unprecedented to be clear the court have always recognise the parliamentary privilege of proceeding in this house and ministers decide not to tell parliamentarian about the data incident at an early stage as the widespread publicity would increase the risk of the taliban obtain the dataset however as parliamentarian and as ministers it have be deeply uncomfortable to be constrain from report to this house be grateful to be able to disclose the detail to parliament today trust that you mr speaker and member will bear with if take the time to ensure that the house now have the full information possible as discuss with you yesterday the fact be as follow in february month after the then defence secretary ben wallace introduce the afghan relocation and assistance policy and six month after the fall of kabul defence official email an arap case working file outside authorise government system as the house know arap be the resettlement scheme that this country establish for afghan citizen who work for or with our uk armed force over the combat year in afghanistan both in opposition and in government labour have back that scheme and arap have have full support from across this house the official mistakenly believe that they be send the name of applicant however the spreadsheet in fact contain personal information associate with afghans who have apply to either the ex gratia scheme or the arap scheme on or before january it contain name and contact detail of applicant and in some instance information relate to applicant family member in small number of case the name of member of parliament senior military officer and government official be note as support the application this be serious departmental error it be in clear breach of strict data protection protocol and be one of many datum loss relate to the arap scheme during this period minister in the previous government first become aware of the data loss in mid august month after the incident when personal detail of nine individual from the dataset appear online action be take to ensure they be swiftly remove an internal investigation be conduct and the incident be report to both the metropolitan police and the information commissioner the met deem that no criminal investigation be necessary and the information commissioner have continue to work with the department throughout however journalist be almost immediately aware of the breach and the previous administration apply to the high court for an injunction to prevent the data loss become public the judge deem that the risk warrant go far and on september grant super injunction which prevent disclosure of the very existence of the injunction that super injunction have be in place for nearly two year during which time eight medium organisation and their journalist be serve to prohibit any reporting no government wish to withhold information from the british public parliamentarian or the press in this manner in autumn previous ministers start work on establish new resettlement scheme specifically design for people in the compromise dataset who be not eligible for arap but who be nevertheless judge to be at the high risk of reprisal by the taliban it be know as the afghanistan response route or arr it be cover by the super injunction the then government initially establish the arr to resettle target cohort of around principal but in early combination of ministers decision on the scheme policy design and the court view have broaden that category to nearly principal want to provide assurance to the house and the british public that all individual relocate under the afghanistan response route arap or the home office afghan citizen resettlement scheme undergo strict national security check before be able to enter our country the full number of afghan arrival under all scheme have be report in the regular home office statistic mean that they be already count in exist migration figure as shadow defence secretary be initially brief on the arr by james heappey the former armed forces minister on december and issue with the super injunction at the start of that meeting other member of the present cabinet be only informed of the evidence of the data breach the operation of the arr and the existence of the super injunction on take office after the general election by that time the arr scheme be fully establish and in operation and it be nearly two and half year since the data loss have feel deeply concerned about the lack of transparency to parliament and to the public feel it only right to reassess the decision make criterion for the arr we begin straightaway to take hard look at the policy complexity cost risk court hearing and the range of afghan relocation scheme be run by the previous government cabinet colleague endorse the need for new insight in the autumn of last year while the scheme keep run in december announce the streamlining of the range of government scheme that we inherit into the afghan resettlement programme to establish well value for money single set of time limit entitlement and support to get afghan family resettle on behalf of the house sincerely thank our colleague in local government without whom this unified resettlement programme would simply not have be possible at the beginning of this year commission paul rimmer former senior civil servant and ex deputy chief of defence intelligence to conduct an independent review the review be conclude and report to ministers last month today be release public version of rimmer review and be place copy of it in the library of the house be very grateful to he for his work despite brutal human right abuse in afghanistan the rimmer review note the passage of time it be nearly four year since the fall of kabul and conclude there be little evidence of intent by the taleban to conduct campaign of retribution against former official it also conclude that those who pose challenge to the taliban rule now be at great risk of reaction from the regime and that the wealth of datum inherit from the former government by the taliban would already enable they to target individual if they wish to do so which mean that it be highly unlikely that merely be on the spreadsheet would be the piece of information enable or prompt the taleban to act rimmer be clear he stress the uncertainty in any judgment and do not rule out any risk yet he conclude that give this update context the current policy that we inherit appear an extremely significant intervention to address the potentially limited net additional risk the incident likely present the rimmer review be very significant element but not the sole element in the government decision to change policy to close the arr and to ensure that the court order be lift today policy concern about proportionality public accountability cost and fairness be also important factor for the government this be not decision take lightly it follow lengthy process include the rimmer review detailed ministerial discussion and repeat consultation with legal adviser just as have change government policy in the light of the review the high court today in the light of the review rule that there be no tenable basis for the continuation of the super injunction to date arr principal be in britain or in transit together with family member at cost of about million from today there will be no new arr offer of relocation to britain from today the route be closed however we will honour the invitation already make to any name person still in afghanistan and their immediate family when this nation make promise we should keep it today be also restore full accountability for the government afghan relocation scheme to parliament and would expect our select committees now to hold we to account through in depth inquiry let turn to the practical action that we have take as result of this policy change and in preparation for the lifting of the court super injunction my first concern have be to notify as many people as possible who be affect by the data incident and to provide they with further advice the ministry of defence have do that this morning although it have not be possible to contact every individual on the dataset owe to its incomplete and out of date information anyone who may be concern can head to our new dedicated website where they will find more information about the data loss further security advice self checker tool which will inform they whether their application have be affect and contact step for the detailed information service centre that the mod have establish this serious datum incident should never have happen it may have occur three year ago under the previous government but to all those whose information be compromise offer sincere apology today on behalf of the british government and trust that the shadow defence secretary as former defence minister will join in that to date afghans have be accept by britain through the range of relocation scheme britain have honour the duty we owe to those who work and fight alongside our troop in afghanistan the british people have welcome they to our country and in turn this be their chance to rebuild their life their chance to contribute to and share in the prosperity of our great country however none of these relocation scheme can carry on in perpetuity nor be they conceive to do so that be why we announce on july that we would no long accept new applicant to arap however reiterate the commitment that we make then to process every outstanding arap application and relocate those who might prove eligible and we will complete our commitment to continue the review of the triples recognise that my statement will prompt many question would have like to settle these matter soon because full accountability to parliament and freedom of the press matter deeply to they be fundamental to our british way of life however life may have be at stake and have spend many hour think about this decision think about the safety and the life of people will never meet in far off land in which of our servicemen and woman lose their life so this weigh heavily on and it be why no government could take such decision lightly without sound ground and hard deliberation during the last year we have conduct and now complete this work commend my statement to the house be grateful to the secretary of state for advance sight of his statement and for receipt early this morning of hard copy of the rimmer review also thank the secretary of state and the minister for the armed forces for brief yesterday and other parliamentary colleague today furthermore give the nature of the super injunction and the fact that the timing and nature of the statement relate entirely to the court lifting of that super injunction recognise that it be entirely right for the secretary of state to update the house at the early opportunity and welcome the opportunity that colleague now have to scrutinise these matter let begin by declare an interest be defence minister in august when the department first become aware of the breach my main role be to chair one meeting on the matter in august because be the duty minister thereafter however as minister for defence procurement and with this sit outside my portfolio have relatively minimal direct involvement that say the secretary of state have issue an apology on behalf of the government and join he in that and in recognise that this data leak should never have happen and be an unacceptable breach of all relevant data protocol also agree that it be right for an apology to be issue specifically to those whose datum be compromise it be nevertheless fact that can not be ignore that when this breach come to light the immediate priority of the then government be to avoid very specific and terrible scenario namely an error on the part of an official of the british state lead to the torture or even murder of person in the dataset at the hand of what remain brutal taliban regime as the rimmer review confirm that scenario thankfully appear to have be avoid of course we understand that the review be set up in january and report to the secretary of state in june want to be clear that it be entirely appropriate that the secretary of state have seek to update the department understanding of the threat on the ground in afghanistan that exist today particularly for those person in the dataset who have previously be consider to be at the great risk of reprisal however the house will appreciate that when ministers become aware of the data breach in august we do not have the luxury of six month in which to assess the situation as rimmer say in paragraph the review note that the passage of time be particularly relevant know that my former ministerial colleague the former minister for the armed forces james heappey who lead the response to the leak will have be focus entirely on what he see as his duty of care to those at risk of reprisal base on the threat assessment that pertain at the time however any threat picture be constantly evolve and as say support the secretary of state decision to review the mod understanding of the threat give the late situation as report by rimmer we support his conclusion that the afghanistan response route can now be close turn to the super injunction entirely understand why this would be subject of considerable interest particularly to the newspaper and medium outlet concern we have an independent judiciary and it be not for to comment either on the decision to grant the injunction in the first place or to lift it today but it be surely tell that paragraph of the rimmer review state that plan at the time that the government become aware of the breach in the summer of be base on risk judgement that be the taleban to secure access to the dataset the consequence for affected individual may be serious have that not be the case no doubt the court would have be less likely to grant the injunction and certainly not super injunction on the leak can the secretary of state confirm that it be by civil servant and that ministers at the time take step to change the casework procedure by not use spreadsheet send by email but move to more secure system fully within the entirely secure network can he confirm that although the dataset be of about only relatively small portion be identify as at high risk of reprisal and only small number have be settle here which be why as he state the cost be about million not the billion report elsewhere now that these matter be rightly in the public domain and give the reassessment of the threat in the rimmer review agree that it would be wholly appropriate for the defence committee and other to look far into these matter can the secretary of state comment on one specific item be report which be that someone refer not to the person who make the leak but another apparent third party who obtain some of the datum be engage in blackmail do the original metropolitan police investigation look at that and if not will he consider reopen it so that the police can look at that specific point which have serious implication although we must recognise the huge role play by afghan national in support of our armed force any policy in this area must always be balance against our own national interest we support the government in close the arr scheme as we do with their decision to close the full arap programme welcome the tone in which the shadow defence secretary have respond and welcome his join in the apology on behalf of the british government to those whose datum have be compromise also welcome his acceptance that as he put it it be entirely appropriate for the defence secretary as part of new government to look to update the department assessment of the threat be very pleased that as the house will have note he support rimmer conclusion and my policy judgment that the government have announce today the shadow defence secretary be right that in simple term rimmer give we revise up to date assessment of the risk in particular the risk to those individual whose datum may be on that spreadsheet he do confirm that it be highly unlikely that their name be on the dataset increase the risk of their be target the shadow defence secretary ask three or four specific question he ask about the official it be defence official can not account for the improvement in datum handle that previous ministers may have make but when do his job in opposition this data leak be just one of many from the afghan scheme can also say that in the past year since the election the government have appoint new chief information officer instal new software to securely share datum and complete comprehensive review of the legacy afghan datum on the casework system on the billion figure which think the shadow defence secretary may have pick up from court paper that be previous estimate it be relate not simply to the afghan response route but an estimate of the total cost of all government afghan scheme for the entire period in which they may operate on the significance of today announcement and the policy decision that we have take compare with simply continue the policy and scheme that we inherit the taxpayer will pay billion less over the period about few afghans will come to this country and above all proper accountability in this house and proper freedom of the medium be restore call the chair of the defence committee thank the secretary of state for advance sight of his statement although welcome it and his intent to inject parliamentary transparency and scrutiny this whole datum breach be mess and wholly unacceptable as mention to the minister for the armed forces during our recent secret briefing be minded to recommend to my defence committee colleague that we thoroughly investigate it to ascertain what have transpire give the serious ramification on so many level as thing stand notwithstanding the content of the rimmer review how confident be my right hon friend the defence secretary that the afghans affect many of whom bravely support our service personnel will not be at risk of recrimination and reprisal can only recommend that my hon friend read in full the public version of the rimmer report which have publish today rimmer set out conclusion and an update risk assessment take an up to date view recognise that the situation in afghanistan be nearly four year on from the point at which the taliban take control and that the present regime see those who may threaten the regime itself as great threat to their operation than any former government official or serve official recommend that my hon friend read that report and expect that he as the defence committee chair will want to take full advantage of this restore parliamentary accountability have always believe that our select committee system in this house be perfectly capable of and well suit to many of the in depth inquiry that often get punt into public inquiry or call for such inquiry hope he will have note the fact that the shadow defence secretary also endorse that view call the liberal democrat spokesperson thank the minister for the armed forces for his briefing on this issue this morning be pleased this house now have the opportunity to scrutinise this alarming datum breach it be right that the then government move to introduce new scheme to try to minimise the risk to the afghan soldier and their family catch up in this breach involve individual in total it be the very least we owe they give the sacrifice they make to support our campaign in afghanistan and welcome the apology from both side of the house as result of this data breach there be however serious question raise about how this data breach be allow to happen under the conservatives watch and the heighten level of risk it have create for the afghans involve what step have be take to address the root cause of the breach and ensure that it can not happen again report by the financial times this afternoon suggest that an original relocation scheme consider for all afghan personnel could cost up to billion will he confirm what assessment his department have make of that figure and why that be keep hide from the public the immediate priority must be to ensure the safety of all those individual catch up in this breach so what assurance can the secretary of state provide that lift the super injunction do not heighten danger for the individual concern what step be he take to ensure that the individual whose datum be leak be aware of the incident what additional support be be provide to they directly now that the case be in the public domain in the light of these development can he outline when the casework and final relocation under this and the arap scheme will be complete welcome the hon lady response provide the answer to two or three of her question directly to the shadow defence secretary on the step we have take to ensure the reduce risk of datum loss and data breach in future one can never say never but be more confident that be month ago have also give response on the billion figure the estimate full cost of all afghan scheme that will run to their completion from start to finish because of the saving that will derive from the policy decision we have take today will be between billion and billion the cost of the arr scheme to date the cost and the sum commit to bring the principal and their immediate family who be in britain or in transit be about million on those still to come expect the cost to be similar sum think say in my statement to the house that rimmer recognise the uncertainty and the brutal nature of the afghan taliban regime there can never be no risk in such judgment and decision and that be one reason that and the government have take this decision with hard deliberation and serious intent hope the house will back it this afternoon be grateful to the ministerial team for my early briefing which give an opportunity to read foreign affairs committee report that come out it be begin in september in under the chairmanship of the right hon member for tonbridge tom tugendhat it be call miss in action uk leadership and the withdrawal from afghanistan and it be excoriate the manner of the withdrawal of international force from afghanistan be disaster betrayal of our ally and weaken the trust that help to keep british people safe it say the government should keep well record securely hold on locally employ staff we have hear that this be one of the many datum loss from arap to ensure that any evacuation can be carry out more effectively it should devise policy base on clear and fair principle about the assistance that will be offer to local partner in the event of security deterioration and report to we when it have do so hope that such policy have be develop that more lesson have be learn and that ministers will report to my foreign affairs committee about where we be now be sure ministers will report to my right hon friend committee if she invite we to do so she be right to make the big argument that anyone provide datum to the british government have right to expect that personal datum to be store securely handle safely and not subject to the sort of loss or breach that we see too often in the early day of the afghan relocation scheme call the father of the house commend the secretary of state for his honesty and agree with everything he say in his statement what an appalling mess but part of the original sin be our intervene militarily and then scuttle out on wide point may take it that we have learn our lesson and have get over the liberal imperial itch of the cameron and blair era to intervene militarily in ungovernable country such as iraq afghanistan syria and libya let we now move on but support what the secretary of state say be grateful to the right hon gentleman for his remark be certainly grateful for his support for my statement this afternoon although he have not say it he be big champion of press freedom and expect that he also recognise that an important part of our decision have be the period in which we have see no public knowledge no media reporting and no parliamentary accountability we set that right today as veteran of the war in afghanistan be appal to watch the chaotic mismanagement follow the fall of kabul that leave afghans who serve alongside our troop and who work so hard for well afghanistan dangerously expose this be situation that fear would happen and could see come even when serve in afghanistan in the fact be that the previous government have plenty of warning that that situation could happen and fail to plan properly for it this data breach join litany of other data breach delay and failure of our ally do the secretary of state agree that we must give our full support to those afghans so they can rebuild new life in the uk do indeed know from afghan family who be relocate in the early day to my own constituency in south yorkshire that it be the voice of member on both side of the house speak up in exactly the same term as my hon friend just have and recognise the debt this country owe to many of those who work alongside or serve with our armed force and who make possible in the first place the very difficult job that our force undertake in afghanistan that provide warm welcome and they continue to do so to those afghans we be offer new home and chance to rebuild their life and contribute to our country welcome the secretary of state statement and the tone of voice with which he deliver it command the scots guards in in afghanistan at the high watermark of violence be very well serve by naz and mukhtar and will always be grateful both to the ministry of defence for get they to britain and to the community in this country who have welcome they to their new life here want to focus on particular phrase the secretary of state use the shadow secretary of state ask whether it be civil servant who carry out the leak the secretary of state say it be defence official and the times be report that it be soldier think it be worth clarify exactly whether it be civil servant spad or soldier because conflate the term defence official to cover member of the armed force be something that might come back to bite the secretary of state if he continue to do it this be data breach that take place three and half year ago under the decision and leadership of the previous government and previous defence ministers the challenge this government face be far big than the action of one official that long ago my full focus since the election in july last year have be to get to grip with the cost the proportionality or disproportionality of the scheme in place and the lack of accountability to parliament freedom of the press and public knowledge it be that set of factor that have take up my time and my attention note that the shadow secretary of state make great play of the change and the extra safeguard that ministers of the previous government put in place follow the breach also note that the secretary of state say he have have to make more change and introduce new software that suggest to that the change put in place by the previous government be not good enough can ask he this clearly who have knowledge of this incident in the month after the data breach have take place before it reach ministers how be there no check on anyone in the department who have access to that sort of datum to ensure they be use it properly my hon friend pose question to in the house this afternoon that simply can not answer the event date from period well before take office as he above all will appreciate new ministers have no access to the policy advice the legal assessment any of the paper or even the threat assessment that previous government ministers may have commission think that that subject be if may say so proper material for the defence committee on which he serve in such distinguished way to perhaps take deep look at and to call witness on who may be in well position to answer those question than be this afternoon finally my hon friend ask about software be afraid be one of the last people to be able to give an authoritative view on the question of cyber security and up to date software but the nature of this work mean that there be constant requirement for new software and for update the fact that we have take the step in the past month that our expert and have regard as necessary do not necessarily mean that the step take by previous ministers be inadequate what can say however be that when be the shadow defence secretary we be aware of and expose in opposition the building backlog in casework the regular data breach and the broken promise that sadly too often characterise the afghan relocation scheme particularly in the early year too welcome the statement give by the secretary of state today as member of the defence committee look forward to give this matter the scrutiny it deserve will not go into the detail of the report but think it be important to clarify if the secretary of state be able to do so whether the data breach in question have in the past put or be now put any serve member of the uk armed force at risk look forward to be call to give evidence to the hon gentleman committee if it do launch such an inquiry to the good of my knowledge and belief no serve member of our armed force be put at risk by the data loss it be staggering to hear of yet another serious datum breach under the previous conservative government do the secretary of conservative members can bicker from their benches but it be clearly mistake make when they be in power do the secretary of state agree that we have inherit chaotic and poorly manage system and can he tell we what system have be put in place to correct that we must not see more system with official email an excel spreadsheet it absolutely beggar belief can he confirm that this will never happen again my hon friend be absolutely right in the criticism she level would just say however that do not think any minister could stand here and guarantee that there will never be another data breach datum loss or data error in that way in the same way that no chief executive of any organisation could say so can say that we have take step to reduce the risk of that happen and that we no long do any casework on spreadsheet which be the technology that be available in the early day of this scheme that be part of the problem think in the inadvertent mistake make by the defence official what worry more than the lifting of this super injunction be the fact that we have close down all the afghan scheme at the very time that undocumente afghans who feel it necessary to flee to iran and pakistan be be round up for forcible repatriation to an afghanistan lead by the taliban understand that the investigation into our obligation to the triples the special force that our force train will continue and welcome that will the secretary of state confirm that despite the closure of the scheme anybody who be find to have work closely with our armed force and be in imminent danger can still be rescue and admit to this country it be more than four year since the previous defence secretary ben wallace launch on behalf of this country the afghan relocation and assistance policy with the full support of this house there have be ample time for anyone who could conceivably believe they might qualify to make their application none of those scheme include arap be ever conceive or design to last in perpetuity which be why we close they at the beginning of this month to any new applicant and why have take the decision base on rimmer and the other factor have identify to end the arr scheme today on the arap applicant the sort of afghans whom the right hon gentleman be concerned about we will complete any remain application that be in our system wait to be process on the triples we will complete the second phase of the review that we have give commitment to they and to this house to undertake welcome the secretary of state support for parliamentary transparency and for the work of the committee corridor in this house have no doubt that my excellent colleague who chair the various committees that be responsible will do thorough job of examine this matter and hope that the secretary of state will facilitate the sharing of any information that may need to be handle in sensitive manner when labour be last in government there be number of breach of this nature predecessor of his ask to be notify of every one and most be due to human error it be great that we be update the it system and deal with the security but could the secretary of state touch on the measure that will be put in place to guard against the human error that will inevitably creep in for function and role like this have sound secure caseworker software good training and proper protocol all of which be now in place greatly minimise the risk that anything like this data breach which we now find out take place in february be likely to happen again most importantly think it will help to provide the reassurance that anyone provide datum to the british government or state should have that that datum will be hold and handle securely if the defence secretary will forgive detect some wriggling the fact be that he be justify this super injunction and not tell parliament the press the public and unbelievably the afghans who be potentially in harm way be it not the case that his argument be actually very thin even the mod admit that taliban align individual already have access to the database so not tell those afghans that they be in harm way be quite frankly unbelievable the precedent of super injunction be very concern for this place how do we know that there be not another super junction about another leak of course the secretary of state could not tell we could he well can say to the right hon gentleman that if there be another super injunction have not be read in in his characteristic way he make an important point about how unprecedented uncomfortable and in many way unconscionable it be to have super injunction like this in place in the light of that hope he will accept that it be difficult decision to review the risk the cost and detail of the scheme and the legal hearing that have take place those have all be component of the important policy decision that have be able to announce to the house today and hope he will back it my husband serve in afghanistan and have always feel keenly the debt that our country owe to those who work alongside and support our force and know that many of my constituent who serve there feel the same if we fail to honour our debt why should people in future conflict trust we and support our troop do the defence secretary share that concern do he also agree that it be right that we offer warm welcome to the afghans who come to our country seek sanctuary agree mr speaker my hon friend speak so plainly so forcefully and so passionately when we first debate the obligation to put in place the arap scheme four or five year ago when be shadow secretary of state for defence one of the thing that strike most be that those who feel fierce be understandably those who have serve those in this house who have be part of the british man and woman who have serve in afghanistan over year because they recognise just what debt this country and they owe to people like those whom my hon friend husband speak about welcome the secretary of state pledge to restore full accountability to the government relocation scheme but be sadden that this be the first opportunity that we have have to talk about the closure of acrs and arap on the floor of the house give that they be announce by write statement at very short notice only two week ago may ask couple of specific question on the arr which we have only find out about today the secretary of state mention invitation that will be honour for those who be not accept and be part of the breach be they aware of that arap have be close to new application but again have ask the minister of state for the armed forces about this before what be the communication strategy for update they the acrs be never open to vulnerable woman and the civil right defender it aim to protect again what communication will the government have with those individual who be in hiding either in afghanistan or in third country we make statement about the closure of the home office run arap and acr on july and the hon lady will have have opportunity since then to raise those matter in the house on the information to those who may be affect we will honour the invitation that have be issue to arr individual to everyone else in the dataset we have communicate the late position this morning we be offer access to further advice through the designated area of the website and that include step that individual can take if they wish to get in touch with our information service centre which have be set up by the mod to deal with question and concern that people may have it be very shocking story that the secretary of state have tell we today and pay tribute to he for his commitment to be transparent about it sadly this come as no surprise to many of we here and to those in our office who over that period of time have to deal with hundred of desperately distraught people ring in to find out what might happen to their relative have to be honest with the secretary of state this matter be not closed join the right hon member for new forest east sir julian lewis in be desperately concerned that we still have people who would have qualify under these scheme but who because of failure like this flee afghanistan or try to go to other country we try to raise this issue with ministers but could not get meeting with they and now we discover that there be secret scheme the secretary of state will understand that right now mps office across this country will be hear this and be worried that again they will get those phone call and have those query he be right to say that there must be parliamentary scrutiny can he assure we that there will be additional resource to help we support our constituent who come forward and that he will keep an open mind that even four year later there will still be case that be relevant to this scheme that should be hear people who should be give sanctuary here if we be to honour our debt to those people who keep our force safe pay tribute to my hon friend who have be one of the most active and most assiduous member of this house in champion the cause of her constituent and other who may be try to get access to the scheme it have be over four year since the arap scheme be first establish and there be still arap applicant whose application will be process where eligibility be establish they will be offer the relocation that this country have undertake to give they those applicant need not have apply from afghanistan but many do so from the outset one of the most important feature of the arap scheme give that the taliban have take over in afghanistan be that it apply to female afghans who formerly work alongside our own force and even serve in the afghan force alongside our own who have potentially be at great risk for they the offer to relocate to this country and to rebuild and re establish life here have be very important commend the secretary of state for the calm and sensible way in which he have announce the change in government policy today can already announce to the house that since the briefing early today have make preliminary arrangement for mod official to address the public accounts committee to examine the cost implication some million have be spend so far and think the secretary of state say in parenthesis that another million will be spend on the people currently base in afghanistan who have receive invitation under the scheme can he give and the house an assurance that if those people who must be in some danger do need assistance it will be rapidly provide the hon gentleman be very fast off the mark and be glad that he have already issue his invitation to his committee he be ask for figure as chair of the pac the cost of what have be spend and commit in order to get in transit to britain the principal eligible under arr plus their immediate family member be around million for the remain member of the arr and their immediate family who have be issue invitation we expect something similar again but because of the policy decision that we have be able to announce and the change that we have be able to make to the programme we inherit he may want to probe this with his committee it mean that the taxpayer should be pay billion less over the next few year and that around few afghans will come to this country welcome the government decision to support the lifting of the super injunction today and bring this awful matter properly into the public domain do the secretary of state agree that it be right and proper that this issue be now fully scrutinise by parliament do indeed one important feature for in be able to make this statement and to set out the detail before the house this afternoon have be that we be now restore the proper parliamentary accountability of ministers to this house for the decision that we take the scheme that we run and the spending that we commit on behalf of the taxpayer look forward to member in this chamber and hope in the appropriate committees undertake their proper constitutional role in way they have not be able to do over the past two year without be constrain this have be difficult statement for the secretary of state make no mistake he say in his statement that this be breach of very strict data protection protocol well on the basis of this breach and the other breach around afghan resettlement those protocol be clearly not strict enough he have decline to say whether it be contractor civil servant or member of service personnel do not think that anyone in this house want to know who it be but would like to know how senior that person be if it be junior member of mod staff the delinquency be both systemic and personal but if it be senior member of mod staff the delinquency be purely personal on the basis of their knowledge and seniority this instance relate to brave afghans but what reassurance can the secretary of state give we that the brave personnel of the uk force would not be compromise by level of delinquency similar to this in the mod and why the synchronicity between the lifting of the super injunction and the ending of the scheme should we not walk mile in the shoe of the people who have flee the afghan regime and do should we maybe think whether we need an arr plus wash up to get these people out of danger if it become reality want this house to hear the policy decision that have make and want this house to hear they first the judge aware of the decision that the government have take and the announcement that be plan to make today take his decision to lift the super injunction and to deliver his court judgment at noon on the question of the individual responsible for the original data loss that be not something be prepared to pursue in this house clearly the overarching responsibility be with the ministers at the time my full focus have be to get to grip with what we inherit take fresh look at the policy that be in place and be in position with the proper degree of deliberation and with sound ground to come to the house and announce the change have this afternoon as be sure many member do feel sense of anger that once again the afghan people have be betray thank the secretary of state for his candour and his response and for lift the super injunction which will allow proper parliamentary scrutiny but will he assure that the follow three question will be answer first how be year allow to pass between the initial leak and it be uncover secondly how be an email with spreadsheet attach consider serious way to send around what effectively amount to kill list of afghans for the taliban thirdly the role of james heappey in oversee this have be mention what role if any be hold by the two secretaries of state for defence over that time one who serve until august and one who serve from august to my mind either side of the information come to light if we do not get to the bottom of those question we will do an immense disservice to the british people and bad to afghans who have be let down once again my hon friend signal some of the area that the necessary parliamentary scrutiny will consider have to say it be month not one year between the original data loss and when it be first discover and bring to ministers attention in august to his second question about the spreadsheet this be period in which official and the department be work at breakneck speed to put in place novel scheme that be urgently need clearly that sort of spreadsheet software be inappropriate for this casework system and it be no long use in that way finally on the role of my predecessor grant shapps be the defence secretary who oversee the design extension and establishment of the arr scheme as well as risk life this extraordinary error have cost taxpayer huge sum the secretary of state say that it will now cost billion less but what will be the total cost of all these scheme after that first give the extraordinary lack of transparency that this parliament have be subject to and voter too will the secretary of state agree to publish the legal advice that lead to the expansion of the arr and other scheme so that we can properly discuss it secondly the secretary of state do not mention any official resign or be sack over this extraordinary episode think my constituent will find that quite surprising will he name the number of people who have resign or be sack over this extraordinary error and if nobody have be do he agree that that be wrong be not in position to make decision about publish the legal advice that lead the previous government and defence secretary to extend the scheme it be not legal advice that have have access to or see on the question of cost the hon member for north cotswolds sir geoffrey clifton brown chair of the public accounts committee will do the job can confirm that the total cost of all afghan relocation scheme to date for those afghans who have be bring to this country be around billion the expect cost over the entire lifetime of those scheme to bring in anyone who may subsequently prove eligible be between billion and billion that be at least billion less because of the policy decision have take this afternoon thank the secretary of state for his openness and transparency and for his apology and thank portsmouth city council for its involvement in afghan resettlement scheme which have help many of those who serve alongside my portsmouth north constituent welcome today decision the government rightly take time to consider all the option and examine the complexity include through the rimmer review they consider the cost to taxpayer and the safety of those affect alongside the need for transparency and openness in this house and to the press and the public do the secretary of state agree that we must as government reaffirm our commitment to public transparency do agree and this house be do so this afternoon in response to my statement the role that my hon friend local council in portsmouth and council across the country be play in make sure that there be warm welcome and unified afghan resettlement programme in place for those afghans and their family who we be welcome into this country be remarkable we thank they for that central government and this house could not see these scheme operate effectively without our local council commend the secretary of state statement will not dwell on the past because be sure that the defence committee and other select committees will have look at that want to ask he about where this go in future all these scheme be close but there be still people out there who do not recognise the statement in the report that there be no long widespread campaign of target individual have one case in my mind the minister for the armed forces know exactly who be refer to sami atayee who have flee and be in hiding in pakistan and whose brother have be arrest during the pursuit he be not directly employ by the british government he could not have be for security reason but the testament of general olly brown and other all say that he save life for british serviceman and servicewoman we surely owe people like that debt of honour and gratitude for their work so simply ask the secretary of state to look at what might replace the scheme that he have get rid of which be inflexible very narrow and often leave out those who really do this government service would be grateful if he come up with some flexible idea that allow some of these people to seek succour here in the united kingdom hesitate to be too blunt with the right hon gentleman because have great deal of respect for he if any applicant be not eligible under the criterion of the scheme that this house have approve and the government have in place and operate that can really only lead to one decision he encourage to look in creative way at other option my hon friend the minister for the armed forces be very familiar with the case that the right hon gentleman raise we will look at it again but do not want to raise false hope for he or for the man whom he describe so vividly and with such concern be proud that bracknell forest be involve in the afghan resettlement programme and be offer transitional support to the brave afghans who risk their life to support our troop any such scheme depend on public trust so it be concern to hear that under the conservative government we instead have secrecy security breach and super injunction will the secretary of state take this opportunity to reaffirm two commitment first that this government will continue to honour the moral obligation we owe to the afghans who fight alongside our troop and secondly that we will do so in way that reaffirm this government commitment to public transparency will indeed reaffirm our continue commitment to honour the obligation and duty that we owe to those who serve or work alongside our force through the arap scheme we will complete the processing of any outstanding application and any who prove eligible will get full relocation and resettlement support be glad to be able to restore degree of that parliamentary scrutiny and transparency that our system in britain depend on thank the secretary of state for his statement he say when this nation make promise we should keep it agree in the chaos of withdrawal my constituent who leave under arap be make promise by british official that his pregnant wife could follow he two year later we have still not keep that promise my constituent wife and child continue to move around in afghanistan to evade the taliban and my constituent be so desperate that he be talk about return to afghanistan despite the risk to he to be reunite with they the minister for the armed forces who know the case have tell that the ministry of defence will not consider it and that this be now matter for the home office in the light of that will the secretary of state repeat his commitment that our nation should keep its promise to my constituent will he undertake to discuss with the home secretary how her department will ensure that such case be afford proper treatment in the light of our commitment to the afghan people will take look at the case and if require will speak to my right hon friend and colleague the home secretary pay tribute to all the diplomat and armed force involve in what be clearly an extraordinary operation it be stark reminder that our asylum system despite the demagoguery we sometimes hear in this place often represent sacred duty to those who put their life at risk for we and our ally will the secretary of state confirm that while the arr be now close we will continue to process case of those in the arap scheme since july include the one that have raise with official my hon friend speak powerfully where there be outstanding arap application they will be process where there be outstanding triples case that fall into the second phase of the review that review will be complete and where eligibility for arap entitlement be establish that will be honour thank the defence secretary for his statement but think it ask lot more question than it answer will he outline exactly how the dataset come to be accidentally email will he confirm that it be indeed an accident what be the security classification of that dataset who be the dataset email to give that it be now fear to be in the hand of the taliban appreciate that he might not be able to answer some of those question but give that this happen three year ago what level of investigation have take place can that be publish think that report early to the house that the incident under previous ministers be report to the metropolitan police it be also report to the information commissioner the met police deem no criminal investigation or further action to be require the information commissioner still have the case we be work closely with they and would expect some conclusion and judgment from the information commissioner office before too long but simply can not say when run an aid agency when the taliban come to power in and vividly recall try to get the then government to help with the evacuation of brave afghan colleague aid worker and human right defender people who have serve humanity under huge threat remember the confusion that reign in the uk government to hear that the life of ten of thousand of afghan civilian be far put at risk by this data breach be deeply shocking the defence secretary will know that under the taliban afghan woman and girl be endure the world most severe woman right crisis do he agree that the uk must do all it can to support the woman and girl of afghanistan in realise their right to equality do where female afghans be eligible for the scheme it have be important that they have be able to apply and we have be able to offer they the same relocation and resettlement as other my hon friend speak with great authority and passion about that period in afghanistan four year ago when the taliban be take over as kabul fall be sad to say that her characterisation of policy confusion and programme failure be exactly what be go on in the british government at that time the secretary of state will know that community in wales as across the uk have be proud to welcome those afghans and their family who serve alongside uk personnel many colleague have raise concern about the afghans who might remain in afghanistan or in adjacent country and may still be in danger for their service render how confident can we be that all those in severe and imminent danger of reprisal will receive invitation for resettlement those who have receive invitation will have those honour on the concern that the hon member may have about the assessment of risk in afghanistan recommend that he read paul rimmer report which be comprehensive and up to date it inevitably contain some uncertainty and it identify the risk that be inevitably there in any policy judgment that government ministers like must make will also reinforce the point that the hon member make about the welcome and the pride with which the welsh people embrace those afghans who come to rebuild their life in our country my constituent have an active application to bring member of his family who be currently in third country to safety in the uk the mod have advise he to assume that their datum have be compromise which be deeply concern give the nature of the work he use to undertake he have be tell that this third country can not be support even though his family might not be safe in afghanistan will the secretary of state help to ensure that his case be accelerate give the further danger that the data leak may have put his family in if my hon friend write to with the detail of that case will certainly take hard look at it thank the secretary of state very much for his well choose careful contrite word which be say in tone that the house appreciate as an mp who have often decry the abandonment of those afghans who help to secure safety for our troop and whose job put they in the firing line must agree with the principle of do the right thing and be nation that be see globally as support those who support we the issue of secrecy to the house be critical the secretary of state have outline that do he agree that government must always totally protect those who be put in harm way under the principle of do what it be always right to do think of my constituent who serve along with our force in afghanistan and whose afghan friend be in hiding in pakistan with his wife and three child think of he and the fear he be in if send the secretary of state the detail of that gentleman and his family will he ensure that he get the help we should give he that be what my constituent want what want as his mp and what that person want appreciate the way in which the hon gentleman raise his concern about that case if he write to with the detail will take hard look at it serve twice in afghanistan alongside some of the brave soldier judge and woman right defender have meet after the fall of kabul be base in pakistan with the foreign commonwealth and development office where be involve in the evacuation from afghanistan at that time despite the excellent work of people who serve in op pitting we see many mistake make by the last government include dog be prioritise ahead of people this data breach which be hold secret for year be just the late embarrassment from that evacuation will the secretary of state consider select committee inquiry into not just the breach in this case but the entire afghan relocation system which have fail so many time one of the great joy of this house be the depth and breadth of experience that member on all side bring to debate applaud my hon friend and the insight he bring from his experience in afghanistan and pakistan it be certainly not for ministers to define the term of any inquiry that select committee of this house may choose to undertake that will be matter quite properly for those committees if minister be summon and require to account and give evidence we certainly will point of order on point of order madam deputy speaker over the weekend member of staff in the commons muhbeen hussain mbe be publicly defame online by several conservative mp include member of the shadow front bench follow threat of legal action the defamatory post be delete by some but the damage be already do this behaviour not only do reputational damage but give the current discourse bring serious harm and potentially risk to life what advice do the speaker office have for member in this house and in the other place who abuse the power dynamic of their elect office to defame openly young staffer who also work in this house while quietly delete their tweet without an apology do that fall short of the standard expect of those who serve in this house and would it be proper for they to apologise be grateful to the hon member for give notice of her point of order the chair be not responsible for members comment on social medium but be sure the table office will be able to advise on how to pursue the matter far on point of order madam deputy speaker yesterday in westminster hall the debate on the northern ireland veteran petition take place give that this be an exceptionally sensitive and emotive issue westminster hall be at full capacity and many veteran be in attendance and many more be watch online do you feel that it be appropriate conduct for the shadow secretary of state for defence the hon member for south suffolk james cartlidge to shout across the floor that military veteran discuss emotive and exceptionally challenging veteran issue should show some courage in way that be clearly audible for all to hear give the nature and importance of the issue we be attempt to debate that the remark be shout from sedentary position that the hon member be the shadow secretary of state for defence and that and many colleague find it to be wholly inappropriate and insulting to infer that lack courage do you feel that that be acceptable parliamentary language be grateful to the hon member for give notice of his point of order and believe for confirm that he notify the hon member for south suffolk the remark he refer to be not record in hansard none the less remind all hon member that good temper and moderation be the characteristic of parliamentary language and that heckle from sedentary position from either side of the house do nothing to enhance the quality of debate bill present diego garcia military base and british indian ocean territory presentation and first reading standing order no secretary david lammy support by the prime minister the chancellor of the exchequer pat mcfadden secretary john healey stephen doughty

do in our life my two son sometimes drive round the bend but quite literally love they more than anything in the world for many people have child require form of fertility treatment in fact one in six couple in britain be affect by infertility problem more than people access fertility treatment in the most recent year for which statistic be available for perspective that be up from in in the past year the proportion of child be bear by in vitro fertilisation have double the regulator for the fertility industry the human fertilisation and embryology authority report that there be now enough child bear by ivf for there to be one in every classroom around the uk that be for number of reason it be worth celebrate that since social attitude towards woman get into and stay in work have progress even far there be now more woman in employment sometimes however build successful career can make it hard to build family one in fertility treatment be undertake by single woman and the average age of those woman be slightly old at although the proportion of young adult in the uk who identify as lesbian gay or bisexual have double in the last five year the government amend the law that regulate fertility access to remove the barrier for female same sex couple for the first and only time in and that be what we be here today to discuss apart from that one change regulation have remain static while industry attitude and lifestyle have race ahead the human fertility and embryology act regulate fertility clinic and despite the fertility landscape constantly modernise and move with the time that piece of legislation have remain largely unchanged since it be pass year ago the failure of the regulatory regime to oversee adequately the uniquely high stake world of modern fertility treatment be throw into sharp relief recently with the unexpected closure of apricity fertility act as hub that connect parent to the very complex web of fertility service it be effectively digital concierge service link woman with partner clinic and offer advice and support yet not provide any of the medical service itself just day before christmas on december apricity fertility notify customer that it would cease all operation from january while family across the country be open their christmas present hundred of apricity customer include woman who be just about to start their ivf injection be open email that would ruin their christmas and leave they in limbo at very crucial point in their fertility treatment patient scramble to seek confirmation from clinic that they could continue with their treatment because as we know even month delay can massively affect the chance of successful cycle in many case have already spend every single penny that they have in the world in the pursuit of have baby some be tell by their insurer that they would have to pay thousand more up front to continue their treatment we know that ivf be physically demanding and incredibly emotionally fraught process ivf cycle be more likely to be unsuccessful than successful but apricity boast an above average success rate of as state therefore for hundred of couple apricity closure be more than logistical hurdle it be devastating emotional blow even bad family who have sign up apricity be not offer the peace of mind that regulator provide because it be not regulate it be an unlicensed online clinic that mean that the health and advice on offer could have be complete rubbish and could have be back by no expert knowledge at all and such online service be expand in scope and number the hfea have warn for some time range of activity market as fertility treatment have take place outside of hfea license clinic in variety of setting include wellness clinic more recently the fertility market have start to move online in setting which be outside of the regulated scheme more people be access the fertility market and treatment than ever before and particularly in that way though the hfea can not put an exact number on that precisely because such service fall outside its regulatory scope give that of ivf cycle be fund privately it be likely to be very large proportion in recognition of the change landscape and with patient trust and safety in mind the hfea recommend in that the hfe act should be revise to accommodate development in the way fertility service be provide know that health ministers have meet the chair of the hfea to discuss update the regulatory regime around fertility treatment but such change will require primary legislation have have no firm commitment that the government be seek change in the law but the case of apricity have underscore the urgent need to safeguard patient right to their datum their egg and their sperm this be classic case of regulation just not keep pace with modern life it be criminal that organisation that be in the business of make dream come true can just disappear along with people money and their hope of start family the chancellor have make it clear that she be no fan of regulator but in the field of medical treatment and specifically the process of ivf strong regulatory regime be absolutely vital to ensure confidence and security so urge ministers and members across the house to support my bill to bring in the recommendation of the hfea and to support woman and family at one of the most important stage of their life question put and agree to order that dame caroline dinenage katie lam liz jarvis aphra brandreth sir ashley fox joe robertson christine jardine jim shannon sarah champion florence eshalomi samantha niblett and wendy morton present the bill dame caroline dinenage accordingly present the bill bill read the first time to be read second time on friday september and to be print bill business of the house today order that at today sitting business in the name of the leader of the opposition shall be treat as be take on an allotted day provide under paragraph of standing order no arrangement of public business such business may be enter upon at any hour and may be proceed with though oppose for up to six hour after the start of proceeding on the motion for this order proceeding shall then lapse if not previously dispose of and standing order no defer division shall not powell opposition day allotted day welfare spending inform the house that mr speaker have not select any amendment call the shadow secretary of state to move the motion beg to move that this house believe the two child benefit cap should remain in place and that household with third or subsequent child bear from april claim universal credit or child tax credit should not receive additional funding because those who receive benefit should make the same decision about have child as those who do not far believe that lift the cap would exacerbate benefit culture which be unfair on the taxpayer who pay for it and unfair on those who become trapped on benefit because those who can work should work and generally support further change to reduce welfare spending and ensure that benefit be there only for those who need they all of we have to make difficult choice in life about what we can afford many of we here be fortunate but one of those choice will have be the number of child we have we may wish that such an important decision be not taint by something as unromantic as money but that be the hard fact of the matter child be wonderful say that as the mum of three teenager but bring they up be an expensive business as conservative we believe in the importance of family in personal responsibility in fairness and as family and as society in live within our mean that be why today we be call on all member to affirm our commitment to policy that reflect those principle let take step back for moment and reflect on the situation we be in as country we have million people in britain who be now work to pay the wage benefit and pension of million other more than half of all household receive more in benefit and benefit in kind than they have pay in taxis to spell that out more people be net recipient than net contributor that be happen right now and with every day that pass spend on benefit be go up and up health and disability benefit alone be set to hit billion by the end of the decade that be more than we spend on defence on education and on police while it might seem kind to spend more on welfare it be not it be not kind to those trap in the welfare system and write off to lifetime on benefit as we embark on doom loop of uncontrolled spending high taxis struggle business entrepreneurial exodus rise unemployment and then more people out of work and on benefit it be not kind to those who lose their job and their income in that cycle of misery if the moment come when we can not afford to provide welfare even to those in desperate need it most definitely will not be kind to they the very people our welfare safety net be mean to be there for the shadow minister talk about kindness do she agree therefore with the children commissioner for england who have say that child in england be now live in dickensian level of poverty principal element of that be the two child cap what element of kindness do the shadow minister see present in that unfairness do not agree with the hon member be go to talk about poverty in moment so if he will just hold on he will hear my view on that point this be tick time bomb if we do not solve this problem our economy will collapse yet opposite sit member of this labour government who have just show we with the welfare chaos over the past couple of week that they will not and indeed can not fix this in fact they be just make it bad if hon member cast their mind back to early they will remember that labour be in the midst of leadership election the now prime minister make clear and unequivocal commitment to scrap punitive sanction two child limit and benefit cap then once he have secure the leadership of the labour party and the election near he change that tune he say labour be not go to abolish the two child limit he acknowledge the need to take tough decision and not to make unfunded spending promise and on this we can agree but say that he would take tough decision be not the same as actually take they take for example the universal credit and personal independence payment bill now just call the universal credit bill which labour vote through last week it be mean to save billion the first turn bring that down to billion and the next turn then bring it down to well the minister on the front bench at the time could not tell we but the consensus be that it will now cost the taxpayer around million my hon friend be make powerful speech do she agree that as result of that bill one of the thing that be most shocking be that in due course it will actually pay someone more to be on welfare than to work full time on the minimum wage my hon friend make an important point about the problem of welfare trap where people would well be well off on benefit than work full time on the minimum wage will the hon lady give way will first make little progress but then will be happy to give way to the hon lady last week welfare fiasco see bill that be mean to save money become bill that will cost money we have also see the fiasco of the winter fuel payment cut with the government have to row back on their tough talk because take money from low income pensioner be not in fact the way to make saving and now we be debate the future of the two child limit which cabinet ministers include the prime minister have indicate be the next tough choice that they be not go to make my hon friend talk about tough choice do she agree that family that be in work make tough choice every single day about what they can afford and how they spend their money and that those who receive benefit should really have to make the same tough choice my hon friend make an important and thoughtful point many family whether they be live off benefit or in work would like to have more child but have to make these difficult choice about what they can afford this be point about fairness know that many labour members passionately believe that the limit should go and they will make argument today about child poverty as if they be the only one who care about for the avoidance of doubt that be not true our difference of opinion be about what to do about it think all of we be at loss to know what the prime minister believe in by contrast we know what we believe in and we know why we be here that be why we have bring forward this debate on the two child limit because somebody have to make the case for fiscal responsibility for live within our mean for fairness for ensure that work pay and for keep the two child cap want to be clear that all of we include those of we on the opposition benches want child to have the good possible start in life let we also be clear about what the two child limit actually be because note that some member from other party be confused the two child limit restrict the amount of additional universal credit that family receive for have child to the first two child only with some sensible exception such as for twin or non consensual conception the cap do not apply to child benefit which be available to all family with income of up to for every child regardless of the number of child in family be proud to be member of the party of wilberforce shaftesbury and disraeli who all understand that it be essential to free people from need and that in that effort the state can be force for good but in free people from need we should not limit they to life of dependency it be entirely possible to believe that although welfare can be force for good so too can personal responsibility and responsibility mean make the kind of choice that my hon friend have set out could not put it well than my right hon friend we know that bring up child be expensive and important when working couple have to make tough decision about whether they can afford to start family in the first place they should not be make to pay more in taxis to fund their neighbour to have third fourth or fifth child someone in job do not get pay more just because they have another child if we be worried about people get catch in benefit trap where it pay more to be on welfare than in work how much bad would it be with neither the two child benefit nor the benefit cap it would mean benefit increase by thousand when say thousand the house of commons library have tell that family with five child would get more than extra year and family with eight child would get more than extra year that be more than the after tax income of someone work full time on the minimum wage do the hon member seriously believe that any family anywhere in the country will take seriously the conservative party lecture they on personal and fiscal responsibility when this be the party that not only bring the economy to its knee through the uncosted promise of liz truss government but partie in the back garden of no when the rest of we be under covid restriction if could take the hon lady back bit she might remember when we come into office in and we have to bring down the deficit year after year to get the country finance under control give child the good start in life be not as simple as hand out more money it be about give parent the community support they need as they encounter the challenge of bring up child which be why we launch the family hub it be about education but school teacher around the country be be let go it be about grow up in household with someone in work but across the country people be be make redundant because of the chancellor job tax know that will not win over everyone here with my argument for instance do not expect to convince the four remain reform mp because their leader have say that he would remove the two child limit the hon member for clacton nigel farage believe that be the right thing to do and say that he be not finish yet on benefit giveaway but ask the taxpayer for ever more in taxis to pay for their neighbour benefit be not the right thing to do the country taxpayer and future generation can not afford this the prime minister the chancellor and cabinet ministers have be unable to rule out more tax rise this autumn business work people pensioner saver homeowner whose pocket will be pick next last week the office for budget responsibility warn that the uk finance be in very vulnerable position now more than ever we need the government to take the tough decision but will they know labour back benchers be itch to vote to scrap the limit but where be the government on this will they take the position of the prime minister in in or now or will they have to abstain because the government just do not know soon we will see only the conservatives understand the importance of personal responsibility fairness and live within our mean labour the lib dems the snp the greens and reform all vote last week for more welfare spending will they do the same today or will they vote with we to back the people get up every morning go out to work do the hard yard make the hard choice and work hard to build our country well there we have it as ever all politic and no economic the conservatives come to this house to talk not about the people of this country but about themselves in march we find out the truth of the tory record on child poverty which be highly relevant to their motion today from to the number of poor child skyrocket by nearly million after year in office the conservatives leave we with million of our child grow up without the ability to make end meet that be what tory government do just as they do from to when child poverty more than double leave million child in relative poverty the conservatives can come to this house to defend the failure of the last government as many time as they like as their motion do today every single time we will remind they of their record will the minister give way will give way if the hon gentleman apologise to the million child in this country grow up in poverty the minister and labour members be in absolute denial about the state of the country the government come in with growth as their no mission and what have they do they have bring growth to an absolute shudder halt they have do what every labour government do which be to increase unemployment who do that hurt the most it be the poor from an age point of view who do that hurt the most it be the young an increase in youth unemployment of be scar on this country that the last labour government leave it be the conservative government that outgrow germany france japan and italy over the year we be in power she should be ashamed of her record even though it be only month old thank the right hon gentleman for that lengthy intervention deeply regret that he do not feel the need to look his own record in the face and more than anything that he have nothing to say to the million child in this country without the mean to make end meet emergency food parcel distribute by trussell trust food bank have increase by over the past year and million child be live in household that have go to food bank over the past month in this country we now have more food bank than police station be the conservatives proud of that record hope not nobody in this country should be beg no child should face that indignity the consequence be serious over of parent say they struggle to get basic support such as gp appointment or to see health visitor school be in an attendance crisis with one in five kid now miss day fortnight or more and it be bad for poor kid that be the conservatives record these failure for our child will echo down the year and will turn up in our nation life expectancy the benefit bill they say they care about and bad of all in the sense of hopelessness that far too many people in this country now have do the conservative opposition have response on their record as we have hear no they do not have they apologise to family in the uk as we have hear no they have not have they reflect on their record as we have hear no they have not they bring motion to this house to do none of the above but to agree with the tory party policy from year ago they be the same conservative party that create the mess we be in now and they have no regret their motion talk of benefit trap and the hon member for faversham and mid kent helen whately just repeat that they will be awfully cross when they find out who spend billion on the universal credit system that they now say trap people in poverty they promise that universal credit would get people into work instead it push people into incapacity benefit gently say to the minister that she and her back bench colleague do not have monopoly on talk about poverty if she really care about poverty she would not have allow policy to be bring before this house last week that before it be change would have put extra child into poverty if she genuinely believe in tackle poverty why be she still stand at the dispatch box as minister because she should have resign for put more child into poverty under her proposal do not believe for moment that it be just people in the labour party who care about poverty in this country former conservative members of this house who be discharge from their duty by previous prime ministers and many other member of different party over many year have care about poverty we should deal with fact in this place and be merely repeat for the benefit of the house the conservative government record on poverty will cover the detail of the child poverty taskforce in my speech if the hon gentleman wish at any point to make representation to the taskforce of ministers deal with child poverty in this country will happily receive they on the question of fact will the minister give way let make little progress if may the official opposition motion speak of benefit culture simply ask they this who make that culture happen who be in charge for the past decade and half either the last tory government be powerless to stop that culture be create or they be responsible for it which be it until they can see the consequence of their own time in office and accept the damage that they do which they clearly can not no one will hear single word that they say there be however people in this country who deserve hearing those who have experience childhood under the last tory government as the hon member for angus and perthshire glens dave doogan mention we hear last week from the children commissioner who point out be appoint under the conservatives on her work capture the opinion of child who have grow up in poverty because of the policy espouse by conservative members the minister be make an important speech with which many labour members will agree she will be aware that of family with more than two child and which be on universal credit be in work that be far from the feckless parent caricature that we have hear from the conservatives more importantly do she agree that the child should come first so we should urgently scrap the two child cap as quickly as possible as my hon friend rightly point out in the speech by the shadow minister the hon member for faversham and mid kent helen whately we hear yet again from tory party that want only to ignore the fact in favour of divide people in this country as it do for the many year it be in government that be not what people want people want this country to move forward together rise rise will mention few contribution by the children commissioner for england and then will give way far we hear from the commissioner that child think that free breakfast club and school meal be important that be why we have begin the roll out of free breakfast club in all primary school and last month announce the expansion of free school meal to all on universal credit lift child out of poverty by the end of this parliament young people tell the commissioner about how they absorb their parent money worry one year old girl say worry about money quite lot see myself as quite approachable to my mum so my mum will tell absolutely everything child need to grow up without that stress so we have introduce the fair repayment rate for universal credit household so that debt to the government do not keep family poor which will help household with child be mindful of two of her predecessor in birkenhead the first be smith the great tory who talk about all must have prize sometimes in our modern britain it feel that all must have state support the second be the late frank field who be much regard and revere in this house for his honesty about welfare reform the minister be right that successive government have fail to grasp this nettle the truth be that the relationship between the state and the individual have change over time we need welfare system that focus support on those in the great need she surely believe that and that require bold welfare reform be she up for that or not thank the right hon gentleman for his intervention and for remind of two of my predecessor can not claim to have know the former but do know frank field very well frank and talk many time particularly with regard to birkenhead about his belief in the value of work he want to see our shipyard thrive and young people in birkenhead grow up with the pride of employment like to think that when the prime minister come to cammell laird shipyard recently to talk about the value of good work in birkenhead frank would have feel very proud will the minister give way will continue for just moment all the young people who speak to the commissioner could not have be clear about the challenge of learn in overcrowded bedroom they be clear and direct about the shame of not always be able to keep clean because of lack of hot water be deeply proud that we have commit funding for social housing to get child out of temporary accommodation and expand the warm home discount for all those on universal credit who be eligible to ensure that the next generation of family experience friendly face and have place to play we have expand best start family hub to every local authority as say early those be just some of the change be bring about thank to the child poverty taskforce chair by my right hon friend the secretaries of state for work and pensions and for education the family hub be great thing the minister say that they have go to every local authority but if have read the datum correctly none have go to south shropshire will she look into that and see whether we can get they there will ask the minister with responsibility for family hub to write directly to the hon gentleman and work with he on that suggestion from the word go on take office the prime minister waste no time in set up the taskforce of ministers to analyse the situation for our child in poverty if recall correctly from the get go the labour party suspend seven member of its parliamentary party for vote to scrap the two child cap the minister colleague the hon member for rochdale paul waugh ask she very clearly whether she believe that the two child cap should be scrap but she do not answer perhaps now she will do she believe that the cap should be scrap yes or no will come to the two child limit in moment but let correct the right hon gentleman the issue then be member vote to amend the king speech from the word go on take office the prime minister waste no time in set up the taskforce of ministers to analyse the situation for our child in poverty and to identify the most cost effective way of help they to experience well childhood our child poverty strategy will be publish later this year but as have say we have already take step that we believe will help to mitigate the bad effect of tory year just yesterday the chancellor announce the well future fund the world large social outcome fund which will be back by million of government fund over year to support vulnerable child young people and their family rise have give way lot madam deputy speaker and be worried that you will be quite cross with if keep give way so will make progress rise do say that would give way to the hon gentleman so let do so before finish my speech the minister be extraordinarily gracious she have rightly talk about universal credit and what she say be very interesting indeed have constituent on legacy benefit who be think this be the right to universal credit the trouble be that they have to wait five week until they get their first cash how will they make end meet what about the direct debit worry about that perhaps the wonderful group of ministers consider these matter could look at that situation because people be really catch in trap the hon gentleman be not the only person who worry about it and will receive his intervention as submission to the child poverty taskforce the child poverty taskforce be look at all the lever we can pull across income cost debt and local support to prevent poverty include social security reform our universal credit review be consider way that the system can improve in order to stabilise family finance and provide root into good work on the two child limit specifically the consequence of the conservative choice make over the past decade and half be clear for all to see we have rightly say many time that we will not commit to any policy without know how we will pay for it taxpayer in this country who include many parent grandparent and those who care deeply about the fortune of the next generation have the right to know that they have government who will help grow our country and our economy poverty create stony ground for that growth it rob people of the dignity of be able to look after themselves and the choice about how to live their own life it rob child of what should be worry free time and make they less able to take risk and try new thing as they grow up this make bad beginning for country that need its next generation to be innovator to be inventor and to build our future say this as one of three in family with hard work parent where money be tight we know every day in those year when be grow up that the tory government at the helm do not give stuff about people like we we know that every single day family in this country who be struggle should know that this labour government think about they every day we have take action to improve life for our kid and we will keep fight for that every single day call the liberal democrat spokesperson child be of our population in the united kingdom but of our future and it be shocking that almost third of those child be grow up in poverty that be why the liberal democrats believe the two child limit should be lift as well as the benefit cap there be million child live in poverty in the united kingdom that be almost million and half more than the population of wales which be shocking in the century some of child live in family where someone have disability which relate back to the conversation we have have about universal credit and pip in recent week the figure have be slightly different from that of the hon member for rochdale paul waugh of child live in poverty live in family where an individual be in work people be in work and yet their child be in poverty reflect on visit make to primary school in paignton in the winter where the headteacher say we have child who be come into school cold hungry and tired the impact of this on child be shocking represent the most deprived constituency that have liberal democrat mp the fact of the matter be that child do not choose to be bear into large family so have benefit system that punish those child be perverse in the extreme this have be exacerbate by the cost of living crisis whether it be skyrocket rent or utility bill those be all significant challenge that have an impact on these youngster the shadow secretary of state the hon member for faversham and mid kent helen whately say that people have choice what about couple who choose to have three or four child and everything be go well but suddenly one of they be in an accident or contract significant disease that debilitate they and their partner have to give up work to look after they and the rest of the family that be not choice it be sad circumstance for that family we as society need to make sure that the safety net be there to support they the liberal democrats have make manifesto commitment to lift the two child limit and the benefit cap and it be not just we who believe this be the right way forward the big four child charity believe this be the good most cost effective way to tackle child poverty the joseph rowntree foundation much love organisation of mine also believe this be the good way to tackle child poverty childhood be very short period of our life it be sad that the child poverty strategy have be delay but hope it will emerge in the autumn when be the leader of torbay council we turn round child service from fail to good within two year part of that be ensure that we use the whole of our orchestra of torbay to support child the government big instrument be lift the two child limit and the benefit cap because we desperately need to lift these child out of poverty tackle the cause of child poverty be the reason come into this place as teacher and then cabinet member for education know only too well about the child poverty that have grow for over decade could see it happen before my eye in wales much have already be put in place to mitigate the impact include in my own work long establish free breakfast club work to lower the cost of the school day and universal free school meal in every primary school there be also the incredible work that my local school do with family support space bank of winter coat and food bank yes food bank in school to make sure that child go home to proper meal the necessity of these in century britain be stain on our country so when hear conservative member talk about benefit culture blame people for their financial struggle and tell they to live within their mean be frankly stagger because it be their inaction and shoulder shrugging that have lead we to where we be today do the hon lady recognise that there be few people include child in absolute poverty and million more people in work in the uk when the conservatives leave power in than there be in labour government take we in the opposite direction they put people in the dole queue and make the whole country poorer that be why the conservative party can be proud of its role in poverty reduction include for child thank the right hon member for his intervention but to be frank do not recognise any of it the tories sit on their hand and allow low pay work to grow access to work to dwindle welfare dependency to deepen and daily living cost to soar will the hon lady give way have just give way so will make some progress come to this place because do not want to mitigate the impact of child poverty any more want to do something about it that be exactly what this labour government be do by boost the minimum wage take other on the pay scale up with it by invest in get people trap outside the labour market into work the sure route out of poverty in the long term for they and the generation that follow by negotiate trade deal to bring food cost down by expand the warm home discount so that almost million more family can afford to pay their bill and invest in our own clean energy to bring those bill down for good by increase the standard rate of universal credit above inflation for the first time ever and by establish fair payment rate for those who find themselves immediately in arrear with universal credit which be recognise driver for food bank use an early action towards our manifesto promise to end mass food bank dependence for good that be what action look like not indifference not inertia and not blame those who be in need of support know only too well that the driver of child poverty be complex and multifaceted but we must not shy away from that complexity that be why be proud that one of this government first action be to begin work on child poverty strategy where importantly everything be on the table to drive down poverty and drive up opportunity will the hon lady give way on that point be just about to finish if the hon gentleman will forgive look forward to the finding of the child poverty taskforce in the autumn more than that look forward to get to work to make child poverty thing of the past so that we can continue to act rather than to blame as the motion do today we must put child poverty into the dustbin of history where it belong rise order we have two opposition day debate that be both heavily subscribe so we will start with speak limit of four minute be pleased to have the opportunity to speak in this debate which at its heart be about fairness and what work rather than what sound good believe that support family and help parent require balanced system that provide support for those who need it but that also ensure sense of fairness to the taxpayer and the many work family who do not see their income rise automatically when they have more child the previous benefit structure which adjust automatically for family size be unfair on taxpayer who pay for the extra benefit be receive indeed under the previous labour government million people spend year trap in out of work benefit with household allow to claim benefit worth over week or over year which be high than the average wage at that time taxpaye family who be not in receipt of benefit often have to make tough decision when choose how many child to have and many will have make the decision not to have more simply because they could not afford it as other have point out for demographic reason we may wish that that be not the case but it be and it simply be not fair to ask family who be make those difficult decision to pay for the benefit of other who be not make those choice my hon friend make an excellent point this be about fairness it be about hard work family who be try to take care of their two child while watch someone who be on benefit have multiple child it be about fairness equity and welfare state dependency agree find it hard to believe that labour members would allow and support system where someone could have five six seven eight or nine child all be pay for by somebody else and think that that be fair speak early about smith who speak about all have prize who have stout heart and sharp sword the stout heart drive we to do the good for those in the great need but our sharp sword should make we brave enough to recognise that there be those who be absorb welfare expenditure that should be spend on those needy people that be what the government ought to do but hear none of that from the minister it be the inability to have difficult conversation and make difficult point that put labour member on the wrong side of these issue and on the wrong side of british taxpayer who understand the complexity of these thing will the hon gentleman give way not right now recognise of course that some people be not able to make the same choice about the number of child in their family include for example child who be care for under kinship arrangement or adopt there be many exception to the policy to make it fair the welfare system be already grow unsustainably with spending on health and disability benefit alone set to hit billion by the end of the decade yet labour reform and the liberal democrats all back high welfare spending include scrap the two child limit which will keep taxis high the resolution foundation estimate that scrap the two child benefit limit will cost billion year by be this really an appropriate time to put more pressure on the public finance the focus of the motion today be the two child benefit limit yet we hear not single word from the minister about it that show just how listless and drift the government be when those on the front bench can not tell the truth to this house or to those on the back benches the truth be that the labour party be rive in two and those on the front bench no long have any power of propulsion as other have point out the government put forward welfare reform that be suppose to save money but end up cost money and this be yet another attempt to placate their back benchers in way that we can not afford we must be clear about our record we bring down absolute child poverty when we be in government labour member be happy to quote figure on relative poverty and take they at face value but when we quote figure on absolute poverty from the same dataset they do not want to hear it be clear that care more about absolute poverty and how much someone actually have to spend on thing that they need than do about relative poverty do the hon gentleman also care about deep poverty that increase to point where four in child who be in poverty under the conservatives be in deep poverty will he apologise for that think we need to look at the absolute poverty figure and at what difference we can make to they and what make long term difference to the number of people in poverty of any kind be employment we reverse the decline in employment but we be now see it get high every day under this government policy that be what be bring even more people into poverty their record on the economy and on employment will the hon gentleman give way want to finish my speech poverty be of course matter for government it be about policy and about income but there be another important side to child poverty in this country that people be too uncomfortable to talk about child maintenance and the absence of payment make in single parent family research by the single parent advocacy organisation gingerbread find that of child in single parent family in the uk be live in poverty compare with in couple family we know that poverty have many cause and there be no single solution but there be clear evidence that when child maintenance be pay in full it have significant impact in lift child out of poverty research show that where it be receive child maintenance cut the child poverty rate by gingerbread fix the cms report find that of parent who care for child and have child maintenance arrangement in place report that they do not receive the full amount the amount involve be significant at the end of september total cumulative arrear of payment that be formally expect stand at million and that figure be due to reach billion by the end of the decade that be just fraction of the story because those figure be base only on the sometimes quite pitiful amount that non custodial parent have to pay either because they earn little or because they hide what they earn those figure also do not include parent who be not pursue for money by the custodial parent absent parent be deny child much high amount of money than the official figure suggest and there be deep unfairness to that if custodial parent simply choose not to provide any more resource to the child they care for they would face criminal sanction for neglect non custodial parent who do not give money for the upkeep of their child face no similar ramification have no idea why we do not place an expectation on non custodial parent to make the same effort to find work and earn money as we do with out of work people on benefit as they be also create burden on the taxpayer as the minister may know there be legislation that allow step to be take to place non pay parent in home detention urge she and the government to look closely at that if people can not be bother to go out work and pay for their child when they do not live with they they should not be allow out on saturday night to drink beer with their mate that would help to drive down the huge amount of money that be owe to child by parent who be simply not pay for they order it be pleasure to speak in support of the policy outline by the minister wish to discuss the crisis in the system the situation in my constituency and some of the important initiative under way to get people back into work it be worth review the scale of the crisis that the current government inherit just year ago after year of the previous government million child be live in poverty million people be on long term sickness and disability benefit and the cost of those benefit be up by billion since the pandemic will the hon gentleman give way will not be afraid need to make some progress in addition one in eight young people be out of work due to long term sickness and be on sickness and disability benefit in short the system that the government inherit this time last year be in crisis and moreover trap people in poverty we be lucky to have grow local economy in my constituency we have town that attract many new business and we grow our own business however that wealth be not spread evenly despite the impressive array of new building in the town centre there be stark contrast between the wealth in those business and some of the wonderful science park on the edge of the town and the poverty in which some of our resident live want to see that issue address the government be take important step forward in tackle that issue certainly see the problem when be councillor in reading they can include family struggle to get by in an area where the cost of living be particularly high and the cost of housing be high that be crucial part of the issue create more good job be very important and that be not just my opinion those job need to be spread across the country and believe the government be make real progress on that and on grow the economy indeed will correct point that be make early the uk economy have grow more in the first quarter of this year than any other comparable economy and that be in difficult economic context around the world as well as need for economic growth there be need to improve access to good job that be one of the point want to cover do my hon friend agree that disabled people have be write off by the conservatives for too long they have not be give opportunity to access work and good job and they have be blame by the conservatives for the sake of cheap headline do he also agree that the labour government propose transformation of jobcentre which be already under way and will involve retrain dedicated work coach will help people to access the good job that he talk about my hon friend be absolutely right and make an excellent point will the hon gentleman take an intervention from member on the opposition benches will make little more progress have discuss some of the challenge in my constituency which be very pertinent to the wide debate even in area of the uk where economic growth be at quite reasonable level we face real challenge access some of that wealth the minister outline the initiative aim at encourage people to return to work build their confidence and grow their ability to access work that be so important would like to see more of that and hope that the minister will say more about that later many of my constituent who be not able to benefit from the great opportunity in our town be struggle with series of challenge in their life that be not through their own lack of initiative but often because of pressure on childcare and many other issue agree with the point that the hon gentleman make about child poverty in northern ireland child poverty have grow by between and in total so many people in northern ireland have experience child poverty in the last five year who would not have experience it for long time before that the government have indicate that have strategy may work do he feel as do that we need strategy not just for westminster but for the whole united kingdom so that we can collectively address this issue the hon gentleman make very important point this must be strategy for the whole united kingdom be obviously reflect on the issue in my community where we be lucky to have relatively high economic growth but that growth be not spread or share evenly want more detail from the minister about the very exciting pilot which have focus on offer help and support appreciate that time be press but let briefly focus on some of the very important first step that the government have take in this area some of these policy be not solely within the remit of the department for work and pensions but be cross government it be important to see the context we have have the big investment in employment support for many year with billion be invest in that important field there have also be an increase in the minimum wage to per hour and the initiative to build more home during this parliament that be vital as say one of the big challenge for family in my area be the very high cost of housing so it be very important that we build home to buy and to rent across the country and that family can access those great supply will obviously drive down the cost it be also important that family be support with childcare that be very important aspect of help parent return to work particularly when they have young child be delighted to hear the best start announcement and there will be best start project in reading other initiative have provide similar support the free breakfast club for example be also very important want quick roll out of those programme will the hon gentleman give way be afraid that really be press for time we need to see the wide context of the very difficult inheritance the government have hard work be under way but it will obviously take time to shift some of these very persistent problem the focus on help people to return to work be so important and hope that the minister will say more about these important trailblazer they seem extremely well design thank you for my time today madam deputy speaker the uk benefit system be design to act as financial safety net it exist so that people in hardship through no fault of their own can be support support family and help parent into work require balanced and fair system it must provide meaningful support for those who need it most while maintain sense of fairness for taxpayer that be why the conservatives introduce the two child limit and believe it should be retain so that people on benefit face the same choice as those in work the welfare system be grow unsustainably with spending on health and disability benefit alone set to hit billion by the end of the decade do my hon friend acknowledge the word of richard hughes of the obr who say in report last week the uk can not afford the array of promise that it have make to the public he also say that debt be on trajectory that the uk can sustain be grateful to my right hon friend for make that point it be essential that we put britain finance on sustainable path all benefit be fund by taxpayer or borrowing so every time the cost of benefit rise so do the burden on taxpayer or the debt we place on future generation my hon friend be right about the cost of benefit but he be also right to suggest that they need to be direct to those in the great need the most deserving that be what we all want across this house sadly because of family breakdown and the fragmentation of community the state have step in to do what be once do in my early life by family individual and community it be really important that this welfare reform be see in that broad context and that we direct the money to those with the great need be grateful to my right hon friend for make that point know that he like all conservative believe in personal responsibility live within our mean and fairness to the taxpayer will the hon gentleman give way will not take any more intervention many thousand of couple think every year about whether to have child they make that choice base on several factor but one of the most important be whether they can afford to bring up that child as they would like to under the previous system there be fundamental element of unfairness in the system family in receipt of benefit see those increase automatically every time they have another child that be not true for family not in receipt of benefit why be it that someone on benefit should not have to make the same choice and sacrifice as someone in work why should taxpayer who be unable to afford to have more child subsidise the third fourth or fifth child of someone not in work the welfare bill in this country be increase at an unsustainable rate unemployment be rise thank to the action of the government and more people than ever be receive disability benefit but this government seem completely powerless to do anything to reverse that trend the prime minister say that his welfare reform strike the right balance but the truth be that he be force into humiliating turn by his own back benchers and have have to totally gut his plan scrap the government pip reform mean that the welfare bill will make no saving at all indeed the total package will end up cost the taxpayer about an extra million year what fiasco the government set out to save billion and have end up spend more taxpayer money to buy off labour rebel no thought be give to the burden on the taxpayer or to the extra debt that the government would incur and the interest that will have to be pay on it by our child the fact that so many labour member want to remove the two child benefit cap be testament to the irresponsibility with which they treat the public finance their solution be always to spend more money preferably belong to someone else now we have the spectacle of the leader of reform uk the hon member for clacton nigel farage say that he also support scrap the two child cap despite have be an outspoken supporter of it when it be introduce reform supporter in my constituency be rather puzzle by his decision it suggest that the hon member be not guide by any political principle but be chase vote in the red wall where he hop to win seat from the labour party in my view that confirm that he be wholly unserious about govern this country there be only one party in this house that be serious about sound money and that be the conservative party we be the only party that be serious about stop the creep reliance on welfare and that care about taxpayer keep more of the money they earn today we have see lot of colleague take intervention from each other when stand up to speak particularly about poverty take intervention from another source my mum she will be sit at home watch the tv and she will text because she know that be go to talk about my upbringing about grow up in poverty care for she and my father who be disabled and be force out of work because the nhs and the social security system be nowhere to be see when my mum and dad need they she be go to text as she always do to say sorry do my good she do not always realise that poverty be systemic that it be about society and the structure we build she internalise the shame and the guilt and feel like she do not do enough give what have be say today also fear that my mum will ask further question why be some of those mps suggest or say that be scrounger as person dependent on the welfare system do not think that members of parliament intend to create that impression but they should know that what they say perpetuate the shame and stigma of poverty which be impossible to eradicate in one lifetime and be pass on from one generation to the next that be why stand for parliament be in this place to try to tackle child poverty so that the people of bournemouth east the constituency represent do not have the same kind of childhood have live without very much and rely on the love of mum and dad who will sacrifice everything to get you to where they think you need to be when they should be able to depend on wide social security system ask member speak in today debate to reflect on the language they use because the outside world be watch do my hon friend agree that his mum and dad do brilliant job bring he up that mum and dad in all sort of circumstance do their level well bring up their kid that they be proud as my hon friend parent no doubt be of he of the job they have do and the contribution that their child make and that person circumstance of birth do not define who they be go to become always agree with my hon friend especially when she say that should agree with my mum thank she for her intervention and agree that nobody background should shape their future we be in this place to create well social security system well nhs and well public service so that child today in all our constituency can access the support that they need in the form that they need enable they to truly thrive it deeply sadden that in my constituency of bournemouth east child be grow up in poverty some of child in my constituency be grow up in relative poverty in the ward of boscombe west that figure be and in the ward of springbourne it be that be unacceptable in in modern britain and we should not put up with it look beyond my constituency near record million people be out of work due to long term sickness throw on the scrapheap some people fall out of work every year because of their health and part of the reason for that be the underfunding of our public service that leave people on waiting list and waiting list kill we know that million child be in relative poverty after housing cost figure that have rise by since we also know that the tories preside over the bad parliament ever record for economic inactivity it rise by over to million people we hear from opposition members about the connection between work and welfare but when they preside over such economic inactivity such poor productivity and such sluggish growth be it any wonder will the hon member give way will not be take an intervention be it any wonder that as consequence we have people who be in significant difficulty particularly when the social security and public service that they rely on have be chop back as such welcome the launch of the child poverty taskforce as an early priority of this government be pleased to meet the minister just last week to talk about my priority which include try to make sure that play be not squeeze out of childhood and that we have social security system to meet the need of child particularly in the disadvantaged area of my constituency thank my hon friend and colleague from dorset for give way he have talk about the issue outside his constituency of bournemouth east and he do not have to look far to see some of the inequality that be in play only to west dorset he will know from our beautiful part of the countryside that deliver service include access to affordable healthcare be even more difficult in rural britain due to the sparsity of the population that make it even more important to support those most vulnerable member of our community thank the hon member for his intervention he invite to champion his work do not think will do that but will acknowledge his hard work and commitment and be pleased that he be colleague the child poverty taskforce be go to be critical the report that it will release base on feedback from all member of this house and all our civil society organisation will be so important so be glad that we be take the time to get this right it will be once in generation opportunity truly to tackle the root cause of child poverty be also pleased that although we have launch that taskforce this government be crack on with the hard work just this week we have see the announcement of the well future million from this government to be match by million from local government and the private sector in total that be billion fund that will make huge difference similarly be pleased that we be provide free school meal for all child in family that be on universal credit that will have significant impact for my constituent be also pleased about the revamp sure start which think we should talk about more revamp sure start in all of our local authority area with the money that be be give to it will be able to spot some of the hardship the physical and mental health issue that arise from poverty and to tackle its root cause as well as its symptom it will give child chance to grow play learn from each other and develop with peer support and it will enable their parent who have be starve of parent support under the conservatives to learn from each other and get what they need we have long way to go in order to reverse the decline cause by the conservatives and lift as many kid as possible out of poverty but together across this house believe that we all have the solution hope we can take this debate forward in the right way and lift those kid out of poverty we must have fair welfare system one that provide vital support to those who need it but do not create barrier to find work we need financially sustainable system that deliver fairness for the taxpayer and do not entrench dependency the government universal credit and personal independence payment bill which think have now be shorten to the universal credit bill barely save any money in fact think we hear from the shadow secretary of state my hon friend the member for faversham and mid kent helen whately that it will cost more money and it will make no impact on help people back to work that highlight the government complete failure to reform our welfare system the welfare bill continue to rise and economic growth be be strangle as result with thousand sign on to incapacity benefit every day it be clear that we must get serious and take control of welfare spending we can not become welfare state with an economy attach will always stand up for those in mid bedfordshire who need vital support the two child limit be an important safeguard in our welfare system strike balance between support family and help parent into work and ensure fairness for work family who do not see their income grow as their family grow work family across the country be have to make difficult decision about the size of their family will the hon member give way will happily give way the hon lady have be try for some time do the hon member accept that even with his emphasis on parental financial responsibility the two child benefit cap punish the entirely innocent party the child who have no choice in their existence be that not deeply unjust be sympathetic to the point but will get on to how unjust and unfair it be to expect other family to pay for those situation and the fiscal stability and security we need as country do my hon friend agree that this be actually about growth in the economy low tax the welfare state be there as safety net not as path to dependency in which our economy be stifle and lack any growth and child whose parent work hard be give the same privilege and fairness as anyone on welfare benefit absolutely agree it be important that we get people into work so that they can look after their family and make the right decision for they shift the financial responsibility of child on to the state risk not only entrench inequality but open the floodgate to unsustainable dependency encourage parent to have child beyond their mean under the assumption that the state will bear the cost it be neither equitable nor responsible for the state to incentivise large family through an open end benefit system that be especially true as the cost of our welfare bill and its burden on the taxpayer continue to rise the fiscal reality must not be ignore projection from the child poverty action group and the institute for fiscal studies estimate that remove the cap would create an additional billion annual cost to the public finance as we grapple with considerable economic pressure such policy shift be simply not affordable remove the cap would force the government to raise taxis far borrow even more money when borrowing be already out of control or divert public funding away from other stretch public service the government have lose control of the public finance and work family can not afford to take another hit the hon gentleman mention raise taxis but do he accept that there be many way to do that one way be to look at large corporation and people who have far more money than they will ever use certainly accept that there be many way to raise taxis but my constituent and business in my constituency be pay far too much tax as it be we can not continue to squeeze corporation business and hard work people far to achieve the hon gentleman aim the government have lose control of public finance work family can not afford to take another hit recognise the sensitivity of the debate it be crucial that we support those in genuine need and we must work towards end child poverty the state however simply can not afford to subsidise unlimited family expansion on the back of work people rise order the speak limit have now be reduce to three minute have visit st anselm food bank in southall on many occasion and speak to its brilliant volunteer but the people who find it hard to speak to be those collect the food be poor and unable to feed their family be not something they want to shout about can see the distress write on their face those mum and dad have not decide to live in poverty many of they have job but they just can not make end meet they be the casualty of year of conservative government of public service that be cut to the bone leave people without vital safety net when thing go wrong of job market that leave worker on bargain basement term and condition and low wage job with no protection and of welfare system with basic rate that just be not enough to live on instead push people into rely on sickness benefit do my hon friend agree that exactly because of those problem we should all welcome the uplift to the basic rate of uc which will lift the income of million family absolutely welcome that point the conservatives put million more child into poverty with child now rely on food bank such as st anselm to eat in the motion today the conservatives have the bare faced cheek to blame those family as if parent choose to let their kid go hungry the only people to blame for this be liz truss conservative party who gamble with the country finance bet it all on pie in the sky promise they know they could not pay for bring the economy crash down overnight family in ealing and southall be still suffer the consequence of they be have to go to the food bank this year under this labour government we want to make food bank the exception and not the norm that be why labour have open new breakfast club such as the one in wolf fields in southall expand nursery such as in allenby primary extend free school meal for all those on universal credit and reduce energy bill by for more than half million londoner we know however that we need to change the whole bust system that put people into poverty in the first place that be why labour be end the low pay bargain basement job of the tory era our employment rights bill will end zero hour contract with family no long wonder from week to week if they can get enough hour to afford food we be stop fire and rehire extend sick pay to low income worker and we have raise the minimum wage for million work family our next step be to address the injustice face by those work in the gig economy my hon friend be talk about other area of public policy that affect welfare be not the other side of the coin the million people out of work due to long term sickness and the state of our nhs the fact that waiting list be come down month after month under this labour government will help people who be currently on benefit to get back into work agree with my hon friend and we be make huge progress on reduce those waiting list we be also fix the broken welfare system that the conservatives leave behind we be increase the basic rate of universal credit to help those family who rely on it so that it start to become enough to live on and they do not have to use food bank we have change the rule so that people be no long well off on sickness benefit that be how the conservatives leave the welfare system but we be the labour party and we believe in good job as the good route out of poverty we have put more than billion into help people find those good job what do the conservatives have to say for themselves there be no apology to the almost million child that they put into poverty and leave reliant on food bank there be no apology to the almost million people on long term sick leave live on benefit when many of they want to work there be no apology to the ten of thousand of family struggle to get by on bargain basement job they create the problem and as their motion show today they have absolutely no plan to fix it all they can do be blame the very family their policy have force into poverty it be clear that only this labour government be serious about get britain work ensure that those who can not work have decent living income finally end reliance on food bank such as st anselm in southall for good two week ago the house come together to watch the labour party tear itself apart over to what extent it would remove welfare support from some of the most vulnerable in society include but not limit to those with parkinson and dementia it be not all bad news though jeff get marry in the same week so congratulation to jeff he get marry in venice by most account it be lovely and private affair although it cost he approximately million he probably would not have notice because he be worth billion like most very wealthy people his wealth have almost double in the past two year for context it would take an mp earn only their salary which be almost three time the average uk salary million year to accrue that kind of wealth clearly the government will not be tax jeff whose wealth lie offshore although he do own modest uk base delivery business with an annual turnover of billion it pay less than in cumulative tax on that figure last year labour do promise that those with the broad shoulder should carry the heavy burden be sure that enough wealth exist within our own border to keep our most vulnerable citizen support will the government therefore commit themselves to both keep and increase digital service tax so that big tech pay its fair share be grateful to the opposition for initiate debate that enable we to discuss one of the most critical issue face our nation child poverty every child grow up in poverty represent future diminish opportunity deny and potential unfulfilled every child deserve the good start in life so that they can learn achieve and go on to live the good life that they deserve that be why tackle child poverty be now firmly back at the top of the government agenda for year the previous government preside over shameful legacy that lead directly to this crisis as other have say they leave we with million child in relative poverty include in my constituency since child poverty increase by staggering child but instead of try to tackle the problem the conservatives decide in to abolish the target of eradicate child poverty their motion and indeed their rhetoric allude to the idea that government should make work pay but when they be in government they oversee the first parliament on record with living standard low at its end than at its start some within the conservative rank have today show shocking disregard for this issue they have talk of personal responsibility but their version of personal responsibility appear to be lecture other on it rather than take any themselves if they be take personal responsibility on child poverty they would come to the house and explain why it rise by child be it matter of policy design be it matter of policy failure or be it indeed the fault of the child themselves do my hon friend agree that people in disadvantaged and poor area typically live in overcrowded poor quality rent accommodation and that this labour government effort to improve the quality of rent accommodation should be commend as way of tackle child poverty absolutely as one who have fight outside the house for significant investment in affordable housing particularly social housing greatly welcome the government massive investment in the affordable housing programme it fall to this government to fix the mess that the conservatives leave behind we be commit to drive down poverty and drive up opportunity in every part of our country deliver the change that the country so desperately need we have already make considerable downpayment on the comprehensive strategy on child poverty that be due later this year provide free school meal for all child in household receive universal credit for which so many of my labour colleague campaign for many month and year deliver free breakfast club in school reform universal credit deduction with new fair repayment rate which the minister mention early and which put hundred of pound back into the pocket of of the poor family and increase the standard allowance of universal credit look ahead our plan to get britain work involve the big investment in employment support in generation include an additional billion year by the end of the parliament for work health and skill support through pathway to work offer the hon gentleman have rightly highlight the terrible record of the previous government and the number of child who go into poverty during that period which include an extra who go into poverty as result of the introduction of the two child benefit cap he have list some action that this government be plan to take will he add to that list his support for scrap the cap and will he join figure in his own party such as lord kinnock and mark drakeford in support the introduction of wealth tax for the super rich so that we can fund the tackling of inequality and support the most vulnerable will not get ahead of our chancellor when it come to the announcement about taxation that will be make later in the year but be confident that those on the front bench know that they have our full support in deliver the final recommendation of the child poverty taskforce also later in the year this government will never allow young people to be write off as the tories do for year as say at the beginning of my speech be pleased that the conservatives initiate the debate which have give we all chance to discuss child poverty and their record on welfare both of which be shocking lament the fact that they have fail to recognise the scale of their failure today but be pleased that this government be get on with the job of return people to work ensure that social security be there for those who need it and tackle the moral stain on our country that be child poverty find it deeply shameful that we must see our constituent suffer under the cruelty of the two child benefit cap it be policy that punish child for the circumstance of their birth and it have no place in civilised society outside the wall of the treasury building in birmingham perry barr receive testimony from the family who must live with the reality of the two child benefit cap and of child in my constituency live in poverty which be more than impact by this cap these be not just statistic they be life in birmingham perry barr constantly receive heartbreaking testimony from family live with the consequence of this callous measure let tell the house what that mean in real life it mean mother skip meal so that her child can eat it mean child share bed in cold damp flat because the heating bill must come second to food it mean school uniform be buy two size too big because they need to last for year at time when food price be soar with energy bill spiral out of control rent be unaffordable and council tax rise this government have actively choose to make life hard for struggle family no child future no child health and no child dignity should depend on how many sibling they have yet under this labour administration that be exactly the situation we have create this be not just an economic failure it be moral one work family and more than be work while rely on some benefit and those do everything ask of they be be abandon in their hour of need and it be happen under labour watch the institute for fiscal studies have state outright that scrap the cap would bring nearly half million child out of poverty end this policy would not just relieve family but ease the pressure on food bank school and charity the organisation that have be force to pick up the slack where the government have abdicate responsibility despite all this evidence and all the human suffering this labour government refuse to act time and again they have show where their priority lie protect billionaire and large corporation from pay their fair share while child go to bed cold and hungry the government say that they be commit to solve the issue but they continue to fail the british public at every turn at current projection they be on track to be the only labour administration in live memory to oversee an increase in child poverty rate it would be shameful legacy to leave behind and the deep betrayal of our future generation so urge the government and ministers to change their stance stand on the side of british family and end the two child limit we face child poverty emergency and it be up to we to respond with the urgency it demand in the black country we work hard we be proud and we do not lack for personal responsibility but force big than any individual deindustrialisation and the cruel year of austerity mean that good folk earn less be sicker and have few chance and few choice than people elsewhere as stand here every day in this place the kid live behind the door that knock on during the general election and every week since live in my heart because one in two of they one in two in my end grow up in poverty that mean every second family every second door every second kid and in the most deprived borough in the country that be our share of the million kid grow up in poverty in this national emergency want to thank the church mosque gurdwara and community organisation in my end that be serve dignity love and solidarity alongside food parcel warm clothe and hot food but will also say this when the state walk away from we take money from our council close our sure starts cut the social security that we have pay for and watch as good job in heavy industry flee and nothing replace they we pick ourselves up we help one another and we somehow keep the wolf from the door community self defence be now exhausted but say to those child that at long last the cavalry be come in this rich country no one will go without the basic and every child will matter again just look at the start we have make end no fault eviction build council home and ban zero hour contract this autumn people will see the scale of our ambition in the child poverty strategy the down payment we have already make include free school meal for every family on universal credit and free breakfast club include at st john bosco primary school in west bromwich in my constituency there will be family hub in every single town and we be fix local government finance so that it once again take account of deprivation and of place such as mine my hon friend be make an incredibly powerful speech about the resilience of her community and the action that this labour government be take her constituent like mine be be lecture on personal responsibility do she share my astonishment that despite the opportunity to take some responsibility themselves for mini budget that crash our economy and for million people out of work and welfare system out of control we be hear no apology or personal responsibility from the conservative party my hon friend will be unsurprise to hear that be await that apology both for that and for the more child in poverty under the previous government as be say that be down payment on the child poverty strategy to come know that do not need to urge ambition on my hon friend on the front bench they carry in their heart every day the child who do not eat last night they know that whether you have dinner this evening should not depend on how many sibling you have there be no need to listen to those on the opposition benches who push up child poverty by come and walk around friar park or princes end meet those kid and tell they why someone choice far away here in london mean they have no tea tonight it be time they apologise to the child of this country and there be no point listen to the absent bandwagon johnny of reform if they care about people on low wage they would not have vote against increase statutory sick pay ban zero hour contract or increase the national minimum wage as always it be labour that stand for working class family poverty rob child of their future it limit their life chance impact their long term health and reduce their ability to participate in the bit of childhood that widen their experience build resilience and teach new skill we may live in beautiful part of the world but the child in south devon who go to school hungry who live in overcrowded and unsuitable accommodation and whose parent be work two or three low pay job just to make end meet they be the child whose life have already be limit by the situation they be grow up in emma hopkins from the mother manifesto group in totnes tell that they have hear from mother who be regularly skip meal so that they could feed their child live on the brink and rack with anxiety the mental health impact of that be enormous one mum of two fill up on tea be worried that her eld child just do not believe she any more when she say she have already eat that be not something we should hear in it sound like something from dickens novel but over child in south devon be live poverty in face daily challenge that no child should have to endure if the government lift the two child limit today family across my constituency and everywhere else would feel the difference immediately surely if we want to reduce the welfare bill in the long term we must lift child out of poverty now to give they the good chance to grow up healthy with the good opportunity to go on to have meaningful work some million child across the uk be live in poverty and the two child limit be one of the big driver of rise deep poverty among child alongside that the benefit cap disproportionately harm some of the most vulnerable in our society single parent disabled household and family struggle with high housing cost be penalise regardless of their actual need and in an area where the ratio of income to housing cost be one of the high in the country family in south devon be particularly hard hit that be not just unfair it be fail policy that be cause real harm to child and their family the liberal democrats believe that these arbitrary limit must be remove we would replace they with an evidence lead approach to social security one that recognise the complexity of family life and the genuine need of child invest in child be not only right it make economic sense support family now reduce future strain on healthcare social service and the justice system it strengthen community and save public money the government must end the two child limit and the benefit cap that be the most effective way to lift hundred of thousand of child out of poverty and we owe it to our child to do well pessimism be understandable when brutality be overpower just over year ago the british public try to shake off that pessimism and emerge from the brutal reality of life in britain after year of relentless cut that have tear apart the social safety net of our country it be little wonder that people feel so pessimistic the motion on welfare before we be the continuation of the austerity that have contribute to britain become an incredibly unequal society in people need an emergency food parcel now that figure be over million and rise nearly of people who be reliant on food bank be in work while the very rich have receive tax break and enjoy see their wealth grow at eye watering rate we have see the creation of new stratum of society the in work poor it be tell of the politic of this country that despite be the sixth large economy in the world we have people in full time employment who be reliant on the generosity of other to survive that be pure political failure morally it be just not right have child be blessing and not blessing that everyone receive the two child cap be an inherently cruel policy that punish the least advantaged the idea that third fourth or fifth child be worth less than the first two be beyond wicked thank the hon member for give way the government have not yet set out their policy on the two child limit if they decide not to scrap it will he support that policy thank the hon gentleman for that point which will come on to he have clearly have advance sight of my speech the government should of course lift the two child cap immediately and it be wrong of they not to make that part of the king speech the wording in the motion refer to benefit culture be both lazy and classist not to mention demonstrate the ignorance wilful or otherwise of the conservatives about the struggle experience by million in this country however expect that from some in the conservative party agree that the welfare system be break and that it need change but the change it need be not to be find in this motion or in what the government put before the house last week like thousand of my fellow party member do not expect that from the labour party last week vote be stain on great party that should be defend and fight for the people that this motion seek to belittle improve living standard should be the priority of this government and every government and we be not do nearly enough not yet year into this government what people need be not mp create living standard coalition group they need they vote in this place to improve living standard not write letter about improve living standard after last week vote which come too late for disabled people urge mps to wake up before make the same mistake again urge the government to resist go down the road of pit old people against child or child against strike worker or any of that nonsense leave that division and nastiness to other party that seek to divide and conquer and create inequality call the shadow minister it have be very good debate and be very grateful to all hon member across the house who have contribute it be still no clear to we what the government think or intend to do about the two child cap but it have be very good to hear so many strong voice from the opposition benches for and against the two child limit of course we do not really know what the prime minister himself think he campaign for the labour leadership on promise to scrap the two child limit then in order to win the general election he campaign to keep it now under pressure from his back benchers once again pay tribute to the real power in the labour party he be hint that he will scrap it after all at cost of billion add to that the billion the government have to find because they abandon their welfare reform and the billion they lose when they turn on the winter fuel payment and the government will have to find billion this autumn would like to clear up what this prime minister and government have do they have expand eligibility for free school meal to include more than child in bracknell forest expand best start family hub which be something the previous government never fund in bracknell forest expand the warm home scheme roll out free breakfast club in primary school limited expensive school uniform to three brand item order the hon gentleman should know that intervention must not be his speech read out at speed be very grateful to the hon gentleman for his recitation much of which be conservative policy now rebrande by the labour government and the rest be further spending commitment the government be incapable of cut spending so we know where this be head tax rise in the autumn there will also be tax rise on wealth we know what wealth be it be the product of economic success it be what happen when people risk their capital and make thing that people want wealth mean more job high wage and more tax revenue it mean that we can reduce debt and invest in more business and wealth taxis which be come will mean less of all that that be the labour way circle the drain and then go down to national bankruptcy that be where wealth tax and welfare spending lead we to and the rest of the house seem to support that plan accord to the late dwp datum more than child in my constituency of dewsbury and batley be live in poverty this be not abstract and it be not inevitable it be direct result of policy choice by the previous government and the maintenance of that policy by the current government one parent share order may please urge people to make intervention short and pithy and not pre prepared and read out will come in moment to the matter of child poverty and recognise the point that the hon gentleman be make be just refer to the fact that all the party except our indeed it be unclear what those on the government front bench think seem to support lift the two child cap the liberal democrats can not seem to see spending opportunity without grab it with both hand their spokesman the hon member for torbay steve darling spend billion just in his speech early this afternoon then we have the snp government who have preside over high economic inactivity and low employment than in england have miss all their target for child poverty and still clamour for more money for welfare then there be the reform party which be sadly absent today do quite like the reform party and agree with its member on lot of thing but there be problem they would spend money like drunken sailor can see what be happen and be very worried about it they will end up in an electoral pact with the liberal democrats with joint ticket to protect welfare spending do not know how hon member feel about the anticipated alliance the hon member for dewsbury and batley iqbal mohamed and other particularly member on the government benches have cite widen poverty rate over the past decade or more and they repeatedly raise the issue of million child but they be talk about relative poverty the fact be that relative poverty increase under the previous government because overall the economy grow as more people become more prosperous as the median income rise more people come under it that be how it work if relative poverty go down under this government it will be because they shrink the economy that be highly likely but it be not an achievement to boast about relative poverty be not measure of anything except the operation of the law of average therefore what we need to look at be real poverty absolute poverty as we rescue the public finance and grow the economy absolute poverty go down under the conservatives on child the percentage of child in absolute poverty after housing cost fall between and we pull people out of absolute poverty and avert over million more people fall into absolute poverty we have more people in work high employment rate and few workless household than since record begin we should thank my right hon friend the member for chingford and woodford green sir iain duncan smith for that mention be make of wilberforce and disraeli one day they will add the name of duncan smith to that great record order that should have be the right hon member for chingford and woodford green it just do flow as well but yes apology madam deputy speaker in the shadow minister say the narrative that the public have now firmly adopt that over year thing have get bad be one we just have to acknowledge and admit do he still acknowledge and admit that thing get bad under his government be grateful to the hon member archaeology in find my previous quote many thing do get bad over the last decade and half of course recognise that but much of it be as consequence of the global financial meltdown that his party preside over we spend many painful year fix the deficit that labour leave we want to quickly cite the previous government record on young people labour members have boast of the new labour year but in youth unemployment stand at and by the time blair and brown have finish in it be up third to when we leave office year later we have almost halve it down to low even than in that be the conservative record will conclude shortly but first say to those across the house who want to lift the child benefit cap to consider what they be ask they be ask work people who pay more in tax than they receive in public service and who themselves have have to take agonising decision about whether or not they can afford to have another child give the taxis they pay to fund the benefit for other people who receive more from the system than they pay in the shadow minister make point about the state funding child do he accept that million family that have three or more child receive child benefit presently if he accept that point do he as father of three as be not accept the principle that those child come first under the child benefit what be the difference between child benefit and universal credit do he want to cap child benefit at two child the difference be that child benefit be pay to everybody child benefit be universal entitlement we need to ensure that we be not add to the incentive in the system to live life on benefit fully recognise the point that the hon gentleman make when say that some people receive more from the system than they pay in be not try to stigmatise those people that point have be throw at we but it be not the case be not stigmatise people who receive more in benefit than they pay in tax life be not all about whether someone be net fiscal contributor or not agree with point make by some member that we should think more about social structure than fiscal transfer but when it come to fiscal policy there be limit reciprocity matter and when we be talk about money it be right that people live on benefit face something of the same reality as people who pay for themselves we still have too many family trap in welfare what we need be more family and yes large family support themselves through well pay work we need tax system like that in europe america and across the world which recognise family the previous government make an important step with the change to the high income child benefit charge which be scrap by labour the good thing we can do for family be to get the tax system and crucially the wide economy right so that we have good growth good job high wage flexible childcare and strong community the shadow minister talk about trade off in public finance growth and child poverty in the period since there be zero progress on absolute poverty and zero progress on relative poverty public finance ruin and growth flat do he not think that the central trade off be between tory government and thriving country the story of the last year be quite easily tell in there be budget deficit of and we have almost fiscal bankruptcy we spend year very painfully restore the public finance at great cost and totally understand that then we be back down to balanced budget then covid hit and we spend the last five year try to recover from that on welfare we have very proud record of reduce unemployment and make work pay since covid we now have this great problem of disability and sickness benefit that be the challenge that we be undertake to fix as we leave office and that the government have now completely fail to conclude it be not too late be glad to see the minister for social security and disability in his place his review should not wait until next autumn we need it this autumn we need proper plan to fix the welfare system not just to increase spending as the government be now do urge hon member across the house to support our motion let be clear every member who do not be vote for welfare dependency and national bankruptcy only the conservatives have plan to fix this before turn to some of the rawer politic as the debate demand thank all hon member who have take part in this important debate like other hon member be appal by the level of child poverty in this country run through the debate be an underlying and understandable anger at the unacceptable increase in child poverty since with million child use food bank to eat be sure that the minister want to give fair and balanced overview and we all wish to see few people in relative poverty notwithstanding his support last week for measure that would have put it up by quarter of million just to have balance on the record do he recognise that in absolute term between and the number of child in poverty drop by and the number of people in poverty overall by absolutely accept that the conservative party because of its shameful record make fundamental change to the way in which poverty be assess we have return to the internationally recognise comparator that expose that shameful record we will not run away from that internationally recognise comparator it be on that on which we will be judge and the conservatives must also be judge on that thank labour members who speak in the debate so passionately about the work that the government have already do on child poverty and the conservative party shameful record thank my hon friend the members for clwyd north gill german for read central matt rodda for ealing southall deirdre costigan for basingstoke luke murphy and for tipton and wednesbury antonia yes my hon friend the member for alloa and grangemouth brian leishman he and may not agree on the process be follow by the government to tackle child poverty wherever we see it but do not doubt his commitment and support to tackle it thank in particular my hon friend the member for bournemouth east tom hayes for his powerful personal testimony about his upbringing and about the stigma of poverty and the shame that many parent feel when they require extra support like he grow up in modest circumstance as one of five child for period in single parent household we be dependent on tax credit child tax credit and the education maintenance allowance remember that will not allow privately educate conservative spokespeople to lecture we on the plight of struggle family up and down the country when they have show no care at all about the part they play in put many of those family into crisis that be so low what be low be scrap the child poverty act in the conservatives record on child poverty be cheap and low interruption the right hon member for beverley and holderness graham stuart can continue to chunter from sedentary position could reel off their record all day will the minister give way will not at the moment let come to the shadow secretary of state who like many conservative members be in total denial of the conservative record not only on child poverty but on the welfare bill which have spiral enormously since they put million child in poverty and they come here with this motion there be no recognition of the fact that almost of family affect by the two child limit be in work there be no understanding of the lack of clarity in their motion which do not specify whether it relate only to universal credit and child tax credit it say that child should not receive any additional funding what of child benefit what of disability living allowance for child the motion be not worth the paper it be write on unless that be now their policy the conservatives have talk about personal and fiscal responsibility quite unbelievable from the party that crash the economy and leave the welfare bill spiral they take no responsibility for their action at all but they seek to lecture other on how they should live their life the shadow secretary of state talk about give family broad support for instance through family hub how many sure start centre close under the previous government in their first year alone it be then we hear that only the conservatives understand the importance of live within their mean have two word for the hon member for faversham and mid kent helen whately liz truss in wales sadly we have some of the high rate of child poverty in the united kingdom and some of the high across europe why be that why be poverty so stubbornly high in wales and would lift the cap not improve thing for welsh child lift the cap be one of the many lever that the government be consider we will look at that in the round and when we come forward with our child poverty strategy we will look to lift child in wales scotland northern ireland and here in england child up and down this country out of poverty because that be moral mission for this government indeed we have already start that important work with free breakfast club free school meal for family on universal credit restriction on brand school uniform item and to the point make by the hon member for bexhill and battle dr mullan propose change to the child maintenance service we will also abolish direct pay which be create by the conservative party this will lift child out of poverty be deeply move by the minister commitment to reduce poverty will he explain why as minister he support the government proposal in the universal credit bill last week which their own impact assessment say would increase poverty the hon gentleman will be aware that there be billion worth of employment support alongside those measure the impact of which be yet to be score by the office for budget responsibility we be serious about get people back to work as route to tackle poverty as well as provide an important safety net for those who need it the hon member for bridgwater sir ashley fox ask why other should subsidise someone third fourth or fifth child say gently to the conservatives that it be never the child fault third child have the same right to thrive as the first two and if they do not all three child suffer hungry child be hungry child whatever their background on that point be afraid will not take any further intervention as only have couple of minute leave the hon member for tewkesbury cameron thomas tempt to speculate about decision around taxation he will appreciate that that be way above my pay grade and hope that he be patient enough to wait for the next fiscal event to get an answer to his question on point of order madam deputy speaker give collective responsibility be it in order for minister of the crown to argue against policy of his own government if have understand correctly it be the policy of the government and the labour party to maintain the two child benefit cap order the right hon gentleman will know that that be not matter for the chair and he be seek to drag into the debate it be also not what say madam deputy speaker say that we on our child poverty taskforce be consider all available lever in the lead up to the child poverty strategy which will come in the autumn the opposition spokesperson the hon member for east wiltshire danny kruger make point about control welfare spend yet again we hear that the four year post covid be not an appropriate time to tackle the spiral welfare bill that the conservatives create in those four long year the conservative party get through three prime ministers five ministers for health and work six secretary of state for education and seven sunak reset yet the welfare bill continue to spiral child poverty worsen and we have waste year so we will take no lecture from the conservatives on welfare spend and certainly not on the good way to tackle child poverty this party inherit the conservatives shameful legacy of disastrous level of child poverty and broken social security system that fail to command people trust across government we have start the urgent work to fix these problem and to drive down child poverty once again as the last labour government do in partnership with the devolved administrations charity local authority and other and to build fair more sustainable social security system that help people build well life by give they the right incentive and support we will do that important work because tackle child poverty be moral mission for this government and we will oppose this motion today because all lever be under active consideration as we seek to do so before put the question will just remind the minister that like the shadow minister he should not be refer to member by their name in the chamber but by their constituency question put stuart anderson stuart andrew edward argar victoria atkins gareth bacon kemi badenoch harriett

dearden the house divide ayes noes question accordingly negative taxis must inform the house that mr speaker have not select any amendment call the shadow chancellor of the exchequer beg to move that this house note that the government be elect on the basis of manifesto commitment not to increase taxis on work people and not to increase national insurance or the basic high or additional rate of income tax or vat accordingly regret the decision to raise employer national insurance contribution in the autumn budget far regret the propose change to agricultural property relief and the burden on taxpayer from increase in council tax which be forecast to increase at its high rate in year call on the government to reaffirm the statement make by the chancellor of the exchequer in the autumn budget that from personal tax threshold will be uprate in line with inflation once again regret that the government plan to bring those whose only income be the state pension into pay income tax this parliament and urge the government not to introduce new taxis on the value of asset own such as saving home and pension which would drive wealth creator away from the uk this be the government of broken promise the labour party say during the general election campaign that it would do nothing on taxation and yet it come straight into government and place billion worth of taxation on business up and down our country we know the consequence of that it kill growth nearly stone dead and it have cost around pound by way of low wage alone to the average work family it be clear breach of the labour party manifesto member need not take my word for it they can take paul johnson when he be the head of the institute for fiscal studies he have also be on the airwave recently describe the move as not just breach of the labour party manifesto but blatant breach we have the secretary of state for environment food and rural affairs then the shadow secretary of state out reassure farmer look tom bradshaw the president of the national farmers union in the eye and tell he that at least when it come to inheritance tax farmer have nothing to fear from future labour government how wrong they be then there be the winter fuel payment debacle labour reassure pensioner up and down the country that it would not be mean test the winter fuel payment before somebody jump up and say well it only exclude millionaire it do not some of pensioner live below the poverty line be deny those payment and have to go through long and cruel winter the turn when it finally come will come as little comfort to pensioner who be now about to be drag into income tax for the first time as result of the labour party policy in opposition the labour party say it would freeze council tax and yet we have see in the late spending review billion increase in council tax levy across this parliament accord to the ifs it be the large increase in council tax in generation and that from the party that say it would not be put up taxis on work people do it not think that work people pay council tax be grateful to the shadow chancellor for make that point do he believe that humble toolmaker who happen to own small business be work person indeed my hon friend be absolutely right we need to stand up for everybody even our toolmaker let we be frank we have have to table this motion today which seek to do nothing other than reaffirm the commitment that the labour party have already make because of the litany of broken promise that have just share with the house do the shadow chancellor agree that follow the welfare turn public finance today be in far bad state than they be year ago when the government come into office there be crucial difference year ago the conservative government be take difficult decision to bring taxis down in order to grow the economy because this labour government be fail to take those decision there be only one way taxis can go and that be up my right hon friend be absolutely right and under his stewardship thing be so much well as he point out the government have resile from any attempt to control the welfare bill an unfunded tax commitment of billion that plus the turn on the winter fuel payment be more than billion of unfunded commitment that the government be responsible for unfunded commitment that they say they would never see themselves make he be absolutely right the legacy that he leave when he be chancellor in the previous government be the high growth in the for our economy we have near record level of employment and near record low level of unemployment we have have consecutive month of real wage growth and inflation have be bring down from over due to the ukraine war to bang on on the day of the general election where be inflation now it be almost double what the government inherit give all the extraordinary and wonderful thing that the right hon gentleman be set out be it not equally extraordinary that the british people think you be shower and need to get rid of you and they do that be why you be on the opposition benches and we be over here order be not sure that the british people be seek to get rid of think what the hon gentleman say be gross impertinence madam deputy speaker he also refer to you as an absolute shower which be totally unreasonable have always be great admirer of yours as you know and always will be hon member name he name the hon gentleman quite we have government who be grossly incompetent as soon as they come into office what do they do they talk down the economy it be no surprise that the british chambers of commerce be now say that the concern of its member be high taxis or that the late survey by the institute of chartered accountants in england and wales once again show that business confidence be down and that be for the fourth survey in row amid the shadow chancellor quite correct exposition on the subject of where the government have go wrong do he not have little pity for the ministers on the government front bench after last week it be quite clear that they be no long responsible for the running of the government as that have be hand to the hard left who have no interest whatsoever in balance the book and do not care about rise debt rise gilt cost and the other irresponsible outcome of this government who be now absolutely out of control my right hon friend be absolutely right when it come to criticise this government it be always confuse whether to address those on the front bench or on the back benches because they be never quite in the same place the big mistake that the government make be to talk down the economy by go on about this confected black hole of billion something that the office for budget responsibility have already debunk the government should stop use that number they be the one who create black hole of some billion as have just set out and they should focus not on the black hole that they have invent but on the one they have create it be that black hole that be create speculation across the summer about what will happen in autumn damage confidence and damaging business up and down the country do the right hon gentleman accept that regardless of the actual size of the black hole leave by the previous government it be significantly large number than the one he be talk about with respect to the welfare bill be not sure that fully understand the point but the hon gentleman seem at least to accept that there be real black hole when it come to this government of at least billion do my right hon friend find it extraordinary that when the government come into office they make big play of put the obr on pedestal but because they do not like the news they now want to dismiss it and water it down well yes exactly the government will look to any float branch or whatever to cling on to to try to look little well than they truly be we have see government who have indulge in spending like it be the the result of that have be to push up inflation which have lead to interest rate be high for long than they otherwise would have be it be all very well for labour members to trumpet the fact that there have be four interest rate cut since they come into office the reality be that if they have not lose control of inflation there would have be more and they would have come more quickly the headroom that the chancellor have against her fiscal target be wafer thin this be the usual labour way spending and spending and spending until it run out of other people money the shadow chancellor talk about interest rate rise will he enlighten we as to why he think we should take lecture on economic competence from his party which have shadow cabinet with member who serve in the government of liz truss and kwasi kwarteng it would be sensible for the hon lady to look at those on her own front bench and ask why they take these appalling anti business decision the answer be that hardly any of they have any experience of private business or of set up company in fact not one senior front bencher from her party have that that be unlike the conservatives whether that be myself the shadow home secretary my right hon friend the member for croydon south chris philp the shadow business secretary my hon friend the member for arundel and south downs andrew griffith or other who actually understand the real world of business the shadow chancellor make very good point be he surprised by the federation of small businesses which have come out and say that for the first time ever in its index since record begin in more small business will contract than will grow be he as worried as be about what signal that send to those small business owner who be try to grow for our economy my hon friend be absolutely right the reality be that if we tax something we tend to get less of it this government have tax business so it be not surprising that the economy have be damage as consequence an often fair question ask of the conservatives be what would we do let answer that question directly first we would have take very different choice we would not have load up taxation on business and stifle growth in the way that labour have we would have focus on productivity we would not have come into office and give the train driver and the junior doctor with no string attach whatsoever we be tell by the now health secretary during the run up to the general election that all we need to do be get around the table with the union and settle and the problem would go away well the junior doctor be back for more will the right hon gentleman give way will momentarily we would of course have tackle the welfare bill as we do when we be in office we make billion worth of saving as score by the office for budget responsibility and we have few people go on to long term sickness benefit as direct consequence of our policy we have clear plan to go into government and save billion year in addition while the shadow chancellor be engage in such fascinating whataboutery at the dispatch box will he take the opportunity to say which of the tax increase in the last parliament he regret or would undo think this debate be actually about the tax policy of this government as have clearly set to be fair there be the small matter of covid which come along and shrink the uk economy by overnight people at the time speculate that we would see mass unemployment the like of which our country have never ever see yet through our intervention we ensure that that do not happen likewise when the ukraine russia war bring inflation to our shore through energy price spike peak at at the back end of we take the tough decision along with the bank of england to bring that inflation down in the meantime we protect million of low income family up and down the country from the consequence of that inflation that come with billion price tag so it be not surprising that some taxis have to rise in order to pay for that the shadow chancellor be make an excellent speech do he agree that the danger be that if government do not have prudent financial position they end up in the situation that we be now see with the interest on government debt go up and up we be now pay around billion year more than we be at the time of the general election my right hon friend be absolutely right with the increase government debt to which this government be constantly add and the high interest rate for long for which they be responsible because of their extravagant spending we be spend about billion year on simply service that debt which be twice what we spend on defence that be not sustainable and thing will get bad under this government might the chancellor elaborate on the national debt that the previous government inherit in compare with what we inherit last year would be delighted to talk the hon gentleman through that the precede labour government leave this country with deficit of or billion year so clearly we have to get on top of that deficit it be simple fact of economic life that if country be run large deficit its debt increase but by the time of covid we have largely settle that deficit for the reason that give moment ago of course we add to the debt and the deficit at that point because we have to intervene to stabilise the economy however the inheritance that we receive in be the start of that debt climbing the hon gentleman should acquaint himself with the economic history what approach can this government take in the autumn they be not go to be save by growth that be for the bird the obr the bank of england and the international monetary fund have all downgrade growth and the office for national statistics recently announce that for the second month in row we have have an economic contraction how else might the chancellor make the number add up well despite ministers insist that their commitment to the fiscal rule remain non negotiable there be report of potential change to the broad fiscal framework include the early use of the flexibility of of gdp range for the current budget target which would allow billion to billion of extra borrowing however that would be breach of faith there be similar report that ministers might move to just one obr forecast year to avoid an embarrassing emergency budget like the one we see in march however that would completely abandon the commitment not to sideline the obr so when the minister come to the dispatch box will he reconfirm that the government commitment to the fiscal rule also apply to the fiscal framework and that we will continue to have two obr forecast per year the government should be look not for yet more borrowing but to rein in spending however the welfare debacle show that they be utterly incapable of do that so that leave just taxis the motion before we today simply ask the minister to confirm the chancellor commitment not to extend the freeze on tax threshold she specifically say in her budget speech that such move would hurt work people it would take more money out of their payslip official report october vol when the minister come to the dispatch box will he confirm that he too hold that position will he also rule out wealth taxis we have already see ten of thousand of people high net worth individual leave our country know that socialist may say good riddance to they they be wealthy but the adam smith institute calculate that the tax forgone as consequence of their departure be equal to the tax pay by around half million people on average earning the labour party have no plan to stem that exodus of talent and wealth creation whatever decision be take in the autumn they will be bad one and as nervous market look on they may prove disastrous it may even be that this government take we to dark place it be hop not but if history be any guide to the future the light be surely flash red surely too the british people those hard work man and woman up and down our country the business the entrepreneur the farmer who toil all hour our charity our hospice our veteran our elderly and all those who embody the very good of all that our country can be deserve answer about the promise make to they and about whether their pay packet their pension and their saving be safe surely they deserve well than this wretched rotten and defunct labour government congratulate the shadow chancellor on another theatrical performance one that know we all enjoy across the house remember fondly his previous attempt to weave the story of alice in wonderland into his contribution the only conclusion can draw today be that he have not find his way out of the rabbit hole just yet the shadow chancellor make number of point where he seem to rewrite history it be all the fault of russia invade ukraine with not one mention of liz that we ve never hear of she when ask why if everything be so hunky dory under the conservatives they suffer such an historic loss the answer be oh do know there be no answer to the question we have hope when he say will tell the house what would do differently sit and listen carefully and the grand reveal would focus on productivity well think the conservatives say that before and how do that go not one policy suggestion or apology for their record not one thing in contrast this government be elect with an historic landslide and on mandate of change interruption conservative member question our historic landslide but they should look at the number of seat we have on our side of the house and how many they have on theirs encourage they to remember that the aim of the game be to get member in this house it be an historic landslide for the labour party at the last election elect on the promise of change to put pound in the pocket of work people and to deliver for the renewal of britain at the budget last year we fix the foundation stabilise the public finance and put britain back on the road to growth after year of conservative waste and decline interruption know that the conservatives do not want to hear it but every time one of they get up to speak we have hear it already it be as if they have forget about the billion black hole they leave in the public finance rather than act to fix it they call an election run away and leave it for we to clear up their mess this labour government will never repeat the mistake of the conservative party the chief secretary say the name of the game be to get the maximum number of seat gently suggest to he that that be not the name of the game the name of the game be to serve the british people and honour the promise we make to they interruption he think that be amusing if he want to know where his vast majority come from it come with series of promise that one by one he be break roll my eye because evidently all my hon friend put themselves forward and stand to serve the country as my right hon friend the prime minister have make very clear he change the labour party to make sure that we put the country first the right hon gentleman make the case that the name of the game be not to get member elect to this house if that be the case he obviously play the game very well because the conservatives fail to do that miserably at the budget we take the decision necessary to stabilise the public finance and give our public service vital injection of cash to start to turn around the year of decline that member of the public across the country know nhs waiting list grow school crumble the prison crisis and project after project be cancel or delay that investment be underpin by change to the tax system to make it fair and more sustainable while protect work people against high taxis in their payslip wonder whether the right hon gentleman could help out by explain what work person be work person be someone who go to work and in our manifesto we make very clear commitment to protect work people through the taxis they pay on their pay slip which be something that we experience when we go to work however we do more than that we end tax break for private school to help fund new teacher and raise education standard support more than of child in state school to achieve and thrive we remove the outdated concept of domicile status from the tax system so that all long term resident of the united kingdom pay their fair share of taxis here we ensure that the uk tax system remain internationally competitive reform the tax treatment of carry interest we take further action by raise the high rate for additional dwelling for stamp duty land tax to support first time buyer and main home mover give they competitive advantage we make change to the energy profit levy to ensure that oil and gas company contribute to the clean energy transition in the budget last autumn the government introduce the most ambitious package ever to close the tax gap ensure that more individual and business pay the taxis they owe the chief secretary talk about the budget have speak to small business across my constituency that be feel the impact of last year tax rise and they be concerned about uncertainty and lack of clarity do he really understand the impact that last year attack on small business be have and how devastating they be for our constituent of course we engage with business small and large week in week out as ministers in the treasury across government and in our constituency capacity as member know the introduction of the employer national insurance contribution be weight with change in the threshold for payment with the aim of reduce the burden on small business we recognise that we be honour our promise to work people not to increase the headline rate of employee income tax or national insurance in their pay slip like other benefit that replace income the state pension be taxable but the personal allowance will continue to exceed the basic and full new state pension which mean that pensioner whose sole income be the full new state pension or basic state pension without any increment will not pay any income tax the state pension continue to be the foundation of the support available to pensioner back by this government commitment to the triple lock this year more than million pensioner have benefit from increase in their basic or new state pension which mean that under this government those on full new state pension will receive an additional the full new state pension be currently project to go up by around over the course of this parliament on the basis of the late forecast from the office for budget responsibility note that member of opposition party have not oppose these spending plan they have not say that they think the nhs should get less money this year or that we have too many teacher nurse or police officer if they support our spending plan simply ask how would they pay for they like many of my constituent welcome the investment that be announce by the chancellor at the time of the spending review for the long await regeneration of kirkcaldy town centre town centre that go only one way under year of conservative rule and year of the snp they talk about support for small business but what really happen be clear do my right hon friend agree that it have only be possible to do this because of the decision that we have make to raise revenue wholeheartedly agree with my hon friend who be an excellent champion for her constituency she be right to point out that the investment announce for her constituency be consequence of the decision make by this chancellor and this labour government to invest in the renewal of britain be not sure what financial qualification the chief secretary have if any but last week report suggest that privately minister be brief their back benchers that they will introduce wealth tax without call it wealth tax can he confirm whether or not that be true that be slightly odd question but can definitely confirm that any tax change one way or the other will be announce by the chancellor at the dispatch box in the normal way in the autumn as say conservative members be welcome to come forward with suggestion about how they might pay for the decision that this government have take maybe they disagree with our fiscal rule which be our assurance to the financial market that we will live within our mean and reduce government debt the right hon gentleman be be generous in give way one area the opposition would be look at be coherent reform of the welfare system so that by change the pathway to entitlement to benefit we get that whole budget under control which would make meaningful difference to the fiscal position that the government be in as the right hon gentleman know my colleague in the department for work and pensions with the stephen timms review and other work be take those measure forward order the chief secretary be the third minister or shadow minister to refer to colleague by name it seem to be bad afternoon for it madam deputy speaker it be because the review be name after the member which lead to my name he but the timms review will be take forward that work and come forward with proposal in due course if conservative member wish to challenge the fiscal rule invite they to do so do they instead think it would be wise to let debt balloon year on year as they do to pay for the day to day cost of government ultimately spend more and more on debt interest and less on the priority of work people in contrast our fiscal rule be non negotiable and they be the foundation for stability and investment the first rule be for stability that day to day government spending should be pay for through tax receipt which be the sound economic choice and also the fair choice because it be not right to expect our child and future generation to pay for the service we rely on today this first rule allow my right hon friend the chancellor at the budget last year to allocate billion more to the day to day run of our public service over the course of this parliament the second fiscal rule have enable this government to invest in britain economic renewal while get public debt on downward path this rule have allow the chancellor to increase public investment by over billion in the autumn and furth billion this spring investment to rebuild our transport network our defence capability and our energy security in short it be investment to grow our economy improve living standard and put more money into the pocket of work people in every part of the country call the liberal democrat spokesperson let be clear the legacy leave behind by the last conservative government be one to be ashamed of their incompetence in govern leave school and hospital crumble social care cripplingly underfunde and record level of sewage in our lake and river their record be dispiriting picture of low growth high interest rate and record level of inequality we know that this government inherit mess and we know that the cause of that mess be year of reckless economic mismanagement but that can not be allow to serve as cover for measure that damage business or cause suffering for the vulnerable in our society the decision take by this government at the autumn budget have not work the national insurance job tax will damage small business low people living standard and undermine the government own ambition for growth people endure year of conservative mismanagement which be why this new government should be do far more to grow our economy create new job and improve living standard the liberal democrats acknowledge that the government have tough decision to make however instead of raise national insurance cut disability benefit and cut departmental budget even far they should be take bold and ambitious step to grow our economy which be the good way to raise tax revenue and boost living standard that be why we have be call on the government to ignore the scaremongering from those on the conservative benches and urgently negotiate new bespoke uk eu custom union on taxation as set out in amendment table by my hon friend the member for st albans daisy cooper we all know that the government be desperately look for way to raise revenue encourage treasury ministers to take look at the measure set out in last year liberal democrat manifesto which would ensure that revenue be raise in fair way take into account the huge amount of economic inequality that sadly we see across the united kingdom this huge inequality in our country threaten to rip our social fabric apart which be why the liberal democrats have propose well way raise revenue fairly do so practically and tackle inequality increase taxis on some of the big and wealthy corporation include the big bank by reverse the conservatives tax cut for bank ensure that the wealthy people in the world who be do business here be tax effectively by raise the digital service tax from to fairly reform capital gain tax in way that cut tax or keep it the same for the vast majority while ensure that the wealthy can not avoid pay their fair share and double remote gaming duty to ensure that gambling company pay their fair share those step could happen immediately so hope ministers who be keen to fill fiscal hole might follow our advice the previous government do so much damage to our high street business but the labour government national insurance job tax have only make thing even hard for they and their worker high street business be the beat heart of our economy at the centre of our local community and they create the job that our community rely on the change to employer national insurance contribution announce in the autumn budget be an unfair job tax which will have highly damaging impact across many sector on social care provider on gps and on the hospitality sector which have be hit by an extra billion in annual cost through the cumulative impact of the change announce in the autumn budget the liberal democrats vote against the change to employer nic at every opportunity once again urge the government to scrap those measure as the motion look to examine the cause of the economic challenge face by people and business across the country perhaps surprising omission be the ongoing disastrous damage cause by the conservatives pitiful brexit deal the appalling agreement negotiate by the last conservative government have be complete disaster for our country particularly for high street business who be hold back by ream of red tape and new barrier to trade cost our economy billion in lose export the dismal picture of the financial impact of their terrible brexit trade deal be become increasingly clear recent survey of uk business find that of currently trade enterprise experience extra cost directly relate to change in export regulation due to the end of the eu transition period small business have be particularly badly affect with small firm stop all export to the eu and recent study have find that good export have fall by since the trade deal come into force in the liberal democrats welcome the step this government be take to rebuild our relationship with the eu but urge they to recognise that this should only be first step towards negotiate bespoke uk eu custom union independent analysis have show that close trading relationship with the eu could boost gdp by that would bring in roughly billion of extra tax revenue every year which would be crucial for fix the public service which the conservative party leave break more broadly as we look at measure which would ease the pressure feel by so many business and boost the economy as whole we continue to call on the government to introduce vital reform to the business rate system in the previous conservative government promise fundamental review of the business rate system but they fail to deliver it meanwhile the current government pledge to replace the system in their manifesto but still no action have be take the current system penalise manufacturer when they invest to become more productive leave pub and restaurant with disproportionately high tax bill and put local business at disadvantage to online retail giant the liberal democrats have call for complete overhaul of the unfair business rate system and its replacement with commercial landowner levy that would shift the burden of taxation from tenant to landowner our proposal for fair reform would cut tax bill breathe new life into local economy and spur growth equally important it would provide long term certainty for business which be what everybody across the uk want on the liberal democrat benches we know the extent of the challenge the government face when they come into office we acknowledge that they inherit dire economic landscape challenge now exacerbate by an unreliable actor in the white house and an aggressive russia but that can not be an excuse for the mistake the government be make they must take bold action to boost our economy as such we support the call in today motion to scrap the national insurance job tax and reverse the change to agricultural property relief people across the country be still struggle with the cost of living crisis just as small business remain burdened with sky high energy price now compound with an unfair job tax and an unfair business rate system the liberal democrats will continue to urge ministers to go far and act with more urgency invest in skill by reform the apprenticeship levy properly fund social care and boost growth through negotiate bespoke uk eu custom union to give our economy the boost it so desperately need rise to speak against the opposition motion my right hon friend the chancellor of the exchequer have raise taxis she have do so to stabilise the public finance because the public finance that the labour government inherit be in shocking state she have do so to invest in public service in particular the nhs and school because public service be leave in shocking state by the previous government she have do so to invest in national security and she have do so to invest in scotland my right hon friend have raise taxis because public finance need to be manage carefully we can not keep pretend that we have money when we do not on pretend it seem to that labour like to pretend that the covid pandemic never happen and that the billion that the previous government spend to protect the country and protect job which labour support and ask we to go far on never happen will the hon gentleman reflect on that and at least acknowledge what happen in the recent past be very happy to reflect that the covid pandemic happen but also reflect that liz truss and kwasi kwarteng mismanagement happen the conservatives lose the last election because they make mess of the economy they have lose their reputation for economic competence which be why they have lose so many mp and suffer an extinction event read in today times that it be think that the common crane have be extinct for more than year in scotland but it be now report that there be six or seven nesting pair in scotland more than we have conservative mp and there may be reason for that the opposition motion imply reversal of more than billion in taxis the opposition need to explain how they would fund that what cut would they make and what effect would that have on the business they claim to support they need to explain whether they would reverse the investment in the nhs which be essential to business many business have say to that they want to see investment in the nhs in order to get the waiting list down and reform the service that be exactly what my right hon friend the secretary of state for health be do the disruption cause to business by nhs waiting list be significant but they be now come down if only the same could be say for scotland the opposition must explain whether they would reverse the investment in education because business say to every week that they want to see investment in skill they need skilled worker to grow their business it be essential for economic growth as scottish mp do the hon gentleman wish to differ slightly with those on his front bench who have say there should be no new licence for north sea oil and gas that policy do not mean that we will consume drop less oil and gas it simply mean that we will import it from abroad with high emission and with ten of billion of pound of tax and ten of thousand of job lose surely as scottish mp he should speak up for his constituent and say to those on the front bench come on let get those licence go again all will say madam deputy speaker be the plain fact be that north sea oil and gas will be produce for many year to come and the government support that the government be also support investment in the industry of the future such as offshore renewable under the conservative government there be contract for difference auction with no successful bid set back our access to fix price cheap electricity that be the tory economic policy on energy turn up their nose at cheap fix price energy it be little wonder we be in such mess will the hon gentleman give way would like to make some progress because there be many speaker but will give way would just like to follow up on the hon gentleman talk down of scottish skill and training classic labour how do he reconcile the disparage characteristic that he paint of scottish skill entrepreneurialism and training when scotland have for year run be the top destination for foreign direct investment outside london what be it that foreign enterprise can see in scotland that no labour mp ever will can not recall say anything disparage about scottish education do criticise the scottish well the reality be that business be absolutely petrified of the way the snp be deal with scottish education we have insolvent university and college in crisis and education standard be plummet those be the fact and they be why the scottish snp government will lose in and we will have new first minister the conservatives be mean to be patriotic and pro defence how be the investment in defence to be pay for would they reverse the record settlement for the scottish government give that we have scottish election next year think they should explain rise will make some progress if may our debt to gdp ratio be almost and we inherit that from the previous government conservative members object to tax rise while want tax cut and increase in public spending and object to spending cut that be not realistic we know from the disastrous budget of liz truss and kwasi kwarteng that we must manage finance carefully some opposition members suggest that we should get rid of the office for budget responsibility the conservatives shun the obr when liz truss and kwasi kwarteng put forward their budget and we know what happen then find it quite surprising therefore that we still have conservative members who want to get rid of it the conservative approach to the economy simply do not grapple with the serious state of the public finance it inhabit world of wishful thinking world of high inflation high government borrowing cost and high interest rate will the hon member give way no will make some progress the huge inflation unleash by the previous government cause immense misery to my constituent the interest rate rise make life misery for hard work family who have buy their home in glasgow east that be why my right hon friend the chancellor of the exchequer be right to focus on appropriate management of the economy and not wishful thinking the real question be this what have the conservative party come to will it ever return to see thing as they be rather than propose policy that bear no relationship to reality its proposal as understand they be form of magical realism which be why the electorate have cast they into year of solitude can make very short speech today madam deputy speaker because my right hon friend the shadow chancellor in his brilliant speech at the beginning of this debate set thing out so clearly there be common theme run through both opposition debate today the first be that the government have lose control of expenditure and the second one which want to develop very briefly be that the executive have fail to listen with appropriate care to what people in this house have say on the first of these point my right hon friend the member for salisbury john glen say in an eloquent intervention just few minute ago that the government need to work out how to fix last week fiasco with the welfare bill far from save money this be virtually now another spending measure it be important to remember that as the former chancellor my right hon friend the member for godalming and ash sir jeremy hunt set out clearly have we be successful in win the last election we would have reduce the number of working age welfare recipient to pre covid level thus save billion by the end of this parliament the reason focus on this welfare issue be that it be welfare expenditure with which this government must get to grip and they have fail to learn the lesson of the past be very junior welfare minister in what be then the department of social security between and learn two very important rule which this government would do well to consider on both it be clear that welfare reform be extremely difficult the first be that we can not take away from poor people benefit that they be already receive think be right in say that no conservative government have ever reduce disability benefit in payment but labour do not absorb that vital lesson which be why they get into so much trouble last week the second rule be that if government want to reduce the benefit bill there be only really two way of do it the first be to freeze the level of benefit that have be do in the past and it mean not fall into the trap that the government fall into last week the second be to narrow the gateway into those benefit for future recipient urge the government to absorb these important rule because they will have to return to the issue of welfare expenditure if they be to make any progress at all on the economy hugely praise the rebellion last week by labour back benchers they have hopefully teach the executive most useful lesson listen to back benchers with respect and close attention as former chief whip however deprecate rebellion unless be involve in they it usually take year for the executive to get into the habit of treat their back benchers with contempt and derision as unelected downing street special adviser strut up and down whitehall but this lot this government manage to accomplish it extraordinarily quickly they have learn the hard way not to treat their back benchers and elect member with so little respect since work at oxfam and campaign for tax justice have admire the right hon gentleman work be the conservative party to listen to he the right hon member for salisbury john glen and the right hon member for wetherby and easingwold sir alec shelbrooke it could find its way back to centrist position which would be of benefit to our country will he acknowledge that this government have difficult inheritance that since we come to power we have face changed world with tariff trade war sluggish global growth rise authoritarianism and democratic backsliding and that as result this government have hard job will he acknowledge that so we can start to think about how we take forward share improvement the hon gentleman bring elegantly to my final point have praise labour back benchers and encourage they to speak out my one ask be that they now stand up for the election pledge clearly set out in their manifesto to restore development spending to ask they to show the same zeal and enthusiasm as they do on welfare for bring back the inexplicably and astonishingly their prime minister have cut the figure from the they alas inherit from we down to and it be already cause massive difficulty of which the hon member with his background in oxfam will be fully aware when the house come back in september urge the hon member particularly give his experience to join other back benchers in say to the executive we will not put up with this we say in our election manifesto that we would restore development spending to and in the same way that we show the government front benchers that they could not proceed as they plan with welfare they can not proceed as they plan to with development spending urge labour back benchers to ensure that this rethink take place in the autumn when the folly of what have happen will be even clear rise order the right hon member have set the tone with his speech length if all member could stick to around six minute everyone will get in call joe powell congratulate the shadow chancellor on secure debate on this motion when this government come into office they find britain public finance vandalise the economy wreck debt soar sky high mortgage cost of living crisis that have touch every household in this country and mismanage pandemic rife with dodgy contract and corruption the conservatives today pretend that they have discover fiscal responsibility but we all remember that they increase taxis time in the last parliament and gift we the reckless liz truss mini budget which send mortgage spiral and tank the market no government in live memory have have bad economic inheritance than this one the conservatives have no credible economic plan for deal with the debt no credible plan for growth and no credibility whatsoever with the british public what they do to the public finance and the national debt even before the pandemic be unforgivable labour members pretend that be year zero in truth in there be an annual deficit of of gdp in government spending which mean that the government be borrow for every they be spend do the hon member not acknowledge or understand that that be far bad economic inheritance than any government have be offer since the second world war thank the right hon gentleman for that intervention because it be important to talk about debt be disappoint that the shadow chancellor fail to acknowledge that the inheritance in be total national debt of close to of gdp which be up from in the annual debt payment that the government be have to make as other have say they be close to billion thank to the government economic inheritance be of total public spending imagine what we could do if we spend that money on the nhs our school or fix the housing crisis this go much deep than debt the truth be that we inherit sick economy affect living standard wage and public service and there be no plan for growth the conservatives leave britain with rise debt and flatlining growth yet they oppose the very measure that the government have take to fix their mess just to correct the record on the economy we have the high and fast growth in the when we lose the election we hand the government that high growth know it be hard for back bench labour mp to grapple with that but it be fact none the less thank the hon member for that intervention of course the conservatives tank the economy and when there be such dramatic decline in growth increase it from very low level to slightly high one be relatively straightforward the economic growth figure for the first quarter of this year as we know be the high in the the government be try to fix the mess include through measure worth over billion year measure aim at repair our public finance by address the black hole and invest in public service that be wreck by austerity poor management and wishful thinking the conservatives have nerve to pretend that they would do thing differently now my constituent tell the same indeed local resident george have be vociferous about the lack of credible economic plan from the conservative party and will not stop share his view on the airwave yes even the former chancellor of the exchequer think that the conservatives have no answer to the fiscal challenge that the country face there be plenty that george osborne and disagree on but he be absolutely right on that at every turn the conservative party be back the blocker and prevent plan for economic growth whether it be the leader of the opposition block new energy infrastructure in her own backyard or the shadow business secretary the hon member for arundel and south downs andrew griffith sign letter to delay vital transport infrastructure it be no wonder that our economy have be hold back for so long the other party too have nothing to offer reform want liz truss reckless economic all over again the same fail experiment of unfunded tax cut that crash our economy and leave our constituent pay the price meanwhile the liberal democrats promise all the benefit of tough decision with no way to pay for they it be pure fantasy economic be glad that the government have commit to not repeat those mistake it will fall on the labour party to fix this mess rebuild our economy and deliver the secure growth that britain need nowhere be the cost of failure clear than in the broken housing system london borough now spend million every single day on temporary accommodation massive waste of taxpayer money the conservatives also lock we into pay billion for over inflate asylum hotel contract that be another egregious waste of taxpayer money that we inherit from they that be the direct result of not plan for investment or for the long term it be the price of short termism and failure to plan for the future let we look at housing one part of our plan we have ambitious planning reform to deliver the great impact on growth at no fiscal cost we have the big investment in social and genuinely affordable home in generation we have leasehold reform protection for renter and new decent home standard which be all oppose by the conservative party this government be make tough choice to raise revenue the conservatives talk about business meet business all the time and understand the pressure that they be under they tell that it be vital that nhs waiting list fall so that their employee can access the treatment that they need that we have modern infrastructure in britain include transport and energy that their staff can afford housing option and that we agree an eu youth mobility scheme to support our hospitality industry when business in the hon gentleman constituency make people redundant do those employer explain to his constituent that they have to do that for the good of the nhs be glad that business confidence be at nine year high that be from an independent assessment the decision that the hon gentleman refer to be already make difference do he oppose the million extra nhs appointment that this government have manage to secure so far the three trade deal with the us india and the eu deal that the conservative party fail to get over the line the four interest rate cut the effort to close the tax gap the fact that wage have grow more in our first month in office than under the last year of the conservative government the rise in the national minimum wage to support low pay worker and the expansion of free school meal to half million child which also lift out of poverty the motion before we offer no idea and no credible plan if the conservative party be serious about economic growth and tax it would do some reflect on its record apologise to the british people and get behind the labour plan to get britain economy boom again the motion be simply ask the government to commit to what they put in their manifesto it seem that we be hear every sort of speech other than speech that address that point let we first take the national insurance rise it be extraordinary to ask we to believe that business in labour members constituency be delighted that their taxis have go up because that will help public service be sure that they be all keen to see their taxis go up again to satisfy the new pay rise that resident doctor want we be tell that that would not happen and that that be why the government have to put up taxis the last time bit of reality have to come to this conversation give that local business be either cut people hour on recruitment freeze make redundancy or go into liquidation let we think about company that go into liquidation after year of trading company in my constituency go into liquidation last month simply because it could no long cope with the ni rise that be the straw that break the camel back twelve people be make redundant immediately mean there would be no more taxis no more income tax or purchase tax from that business and on top of that benefit would have to be pay we be on downward spiral of tax and spend in this country indeed it be quite incredible to listen to the speech from labour members it be as if nobody have leave the country no money have be withdraw from the city and no person have take their asset elsewhere those be literally the headline on the economy day after day in the financial times and other newspaper yet we get lot of hark back to the past rather than recognition that labour have be in power for more than year my right hon friend make an excellent point about growth and wealth creator be tax out of this country they be simply take their money and leave as the labour party continue to tax they my hon friend sum thing up perfectly what terrify be that the government do not seem to be take any notice of that when they talk about bring in more taxis such as wealth tax labour members all cheer when my right hon friend the shadow chancellor think it be he say that labour member do not care and would like to see more people who have wealth go someone on the government benches shout good it be absolutely incredible to say that the people who generate the wealth in this country be the enemy let we just think about my constituency of wetherby and easingwold which do exactly what it say on the tin wetherby and easingwold be the two main market town in the constituency market town be part of the big ecosystem of the economy that be link around farming and the farming tax have create huge problem in the farming community people be scared to invest in capital equipment that be the first thing how be we go to pay these bill be it even worth pass the farm on so let pause our investment that ecosystem in my constituency be not just about the farmer and what get sell at the farmer market it be about the business that service farm equipment it be about the business that supply mechanical support it be about the business that be involve in every aspect of the supply chain around farming in my constituency and the worry and concern that be be feel throughout the community mean that they do not spend any money that mean that the government be now lose out on vat and on other taxis so what be their answer let we bring in wealth tax let we tax more it be quite frankly frightening in term of taxation be terrify of where this country be head the right hon member be make an important speech some of millionaire in our country want to pay more tax they want to contribute to our society and to our public service so do he agree that when people want to pay more tax they should be give the opportunity to do so be sure it have just slip the hon gentleman mind that people have the ability to do that famously when stanley baldwin be the financial secretary to the treasury he give third of his wealth to the country to try to help with the national deficit he do it behind the scene and just sign it fst he do not actually declare that it be from he people can pay more tax if they wish what they can not do be sit in an unfair position where they can see that we do not have the most competitive taxis in the world otherwise they would stay here it be blatantly obvious what be happen if be to throw party at my house and lock everybody in and halfway through the party they be try to tunnel under the fence or get out in hot air balloon would not say well that go really well let lock some more door this be an overall assault on the lifeblood of the economy of this country all this motion do today be ask whether the government will be stick to their manifesto promise when the chancellor come to the dispatch box last july about year ago she keep talk about the obr she talk up the obr say we could never again have situation like under the tories where they ignore the obr she announce billion worth of taxis for the alleged black hole the obr immediately come out and say that not true it do exist at well it be billion and most of that have be cause by give pay rise to the public sector because allegedly that would solve the problem we on these benches warn that without reform the public sector would come back and boy have they come back if the government want to be believe that there be billion hole one why do they raise taxis by billion two why do they then do another billion worth of borrowing and three how come we now have billion hole that be billion hole in the economy that have be create since month ago how can anybody say that the government have take responsibility for the economy and be build it up somebody on the labour benches say that we be try to rewrite history but they be try to rewrite the last two week labour be the only party have know to come to the house try to cut welfare and increase the bill where be the money come from what do we hear we hear that we must get rid of the triple lock because it be now go to cost billion instead of billion how about we stop people self declare just to have time off work and get on universal credit which be cost billion and we do not hit people who be on fix income who do not have the ability to do other thing great number of the retired people in this country be carry the burden of support their family in work look after their grandchild and do those thing unpaid we should be grateful to pensioner in this country and not be say you the one whose income we ve get to cut because the government be let welfare run out of control this do not stop at what the government have do to business in my constituency or to the ecosystem that rely on rural economy and it do not stop at they want to put solar panel all over credible farming land push those business out even far because they have bring in vat on school and they have do it through pure ideology and envy my constituent be not rich people they have car that be or year old they do not go on holiday they have be put money in to give their child the good education and they be now have to withdraw their child from those school the labour party have decide to tax hard work family on their choice of education it mean that people can no long send their child to send special school it mean they no long have the choice to use their money because the labour party want to take little more tax from they do my right hon friend agree that it be not fair process and it be actually exclude people who want to protect their child for the future my hon friend make very powerful point be just wrap up but will tell you this mr deputy speaker be comprehensive schoolboy and be not go to take any lesson off the private schoolboy on the front bench who tell that it be unfair that we be not tax people who be try to do the good for their child talk about pull up the ladder all right jack overall the economy be be destroy under this government we will have political kickabout this afternoon but be terrify of where we be go the be back good and proper public sector strike ridiculous pay demand constantly bring the government down debt to gdp ratio predict on this path more and more taxis to come and more and more wealthy people leave we see what happen by when we go off to the imf the situation be so bad that the imf say no we be on that path and it terrify rise order it have become apparent already that if we be to get everybody in we will have to set formal time limit after the next speaker will put in place six minute time limit if there be lot of intervention which will of course add time it will be reduce smartly to five minute and possibly even to four minute it be pleasure to speak in the debate and do so on behalf of my constituent who dutifully pay their taxis in the expectation that they will receive fair deal in return today motion from the official opposition imply that the effort that this government have undertake to deliver that fair deal be not in the interest of those constituent reject that premise entirely instead labour in government have constantly and rightly stick to ensure that those with the broad shoulder carry the great burden that approach have secure over billion year of revenue to pay for school the nhs and our national security the chancellor have restore responsibility and credibility will the hon member give way will make some progress give the time limit that will be put in place on other member that finally put we on strong footing to move on from the irresponsible and reckless chaos of liz truss mini budget and the litany of unfunded spending commitment leave behind by the previous administration who have no intention of implement they must remind the house of what labour inherit from the last government when the chancellor walk through the door of no just over year ago national debt at nearly of gdp the high since the living standard fall for the first time since the anaemic growth that leave we second to last in the and the uk as the only country where the employment rate have still not recover to pre covid level by the first quarter of that be the conservative legacy legacy of economic mismanagement and tax system weigh down by loophole complexity and underenforcement so will take no lecture on fiscal responsibility from the architect of that wreckage we on the labour benches will not indulge the fantasy that the path to prosperity lie in slash public service make unfunded promise and claim that we can borrow endlessly without consequence our constituent deserve well this government lead by the prime minister and the chancellor be get on with what labour always provide government of service first let address the abolition of the outdated non dom regime for too long our tax code allow the very wealthy to live in this country and enjoy our service infrastructure and rule of law but contribute only token amount to the national purse that end quite rightly with this government the new residency base regime be matter of principle if you live here you pay here secondly we have increase the rate of capital gain tax on share sale not to punish wealth but to deliver fairness many of my constituent contact to say that they see no reason why wealth asset and stock and share should be tax less than work there be more to be do on that but welcome the measure that the government have take so far what the labour party be say very clearly it be useful to have it clarify be that those who scrimp and save who decide to give money or home to their child who save their farm for their child do not matter they will be the one who be punish under labour not those who scrounge on benefit but those who have save their money and make choice labour be say that those be the people it will punish thank the hon gentleman for clarify that the hon member would do well to listen to what have to say and will come to wealth taxation shortly but would appreciate it if she do not take that very condescend tone with spend more than decade work in the financial service industry myself these measure have be take because it be simply the right thing to do when nurse in bolton hospital be pay high effective tax rate than someone make million on property or share the system be not just break it be unfair thirdly the government have crack down on tax dodging with more funding for hmrc to go after tax evader and bring down the stubbornly high tax gap that gap the difference between what the government be owe and what they actually collect currently stand at almost billion that time million be almost the size of the entire defence budget in unlike the dearth of policy proposal from the conservative party constructively implore the government to continue tackle the enabler of dodgy tax scheme firm that promote aggressive tax avoidance scheme will now be hold to account with fine of up to million welcome that measure in particular on that point do my hon friend agree that it be important for hmrc to work with local authority to take action on tax evasion by high street store that do not act fairly like the awful harry potter store in my constituency be worried about the impact that they have on the high street and on our tax revenue my hon friend who have be fantastic champion on tackle that issue make valid point the opposition would have we believe that taxis writ large be drag on growth but the truth be more nuanced what stifle growth be instability what repel investment be unpredictability what corrode trust be tax system that reward avoidance while underfunde our school hospital and police labour be put more money in people pocket by boost the minimum wage for million worker wage be grow more in our first month than in an entire year under the tories would urge the chief secretary to the treasury not to rest on his laurel however because there be more to do propose three policy priority that hope the treasury will give serious consideration first we should review and reform current tax relief some billion quarter of all tax revenue be spend on tax relief in yet many of those relief be uncoste unscrutinised and susceptible to abuse the treasury committee be right to call for rationalisation of those relief we must audit they for efficacy eliminate those that serve no public interest and crack down on those that have become vehicle for avoidance secondly draw the minister attention to the issue of tax dodging in our own backyard at the end of last month number of british overseas territory include the tax haven of the british virgin islands miss yet another deadline to introduce public register of beneficial ownership the minister will know that this be long run issue the bvi in particular have miss deadline in and as the right hon member for sutton coldfield sir andrew mitchell know well he have campaign strongly on this issue over many year in january this year the bureau of investigative journalism work alongside the bbc and the guardian reveal that roman abramovich the former owner of chelsea football club may owe the treasury up to billion in unpaid corporation tax penalty and interest that be from corporate structure with value of billion set up through an offshore web of hedge fund vehicle primarily register in the british virgin islands and cyprus in what look like an ultimately botch attempt to reduce tax liability when russian oligarch allegedly manipulate british secrecy jurisdiction in order to obscure profit make from uk base centre of control it undermine the credibility and fairness of our tax system we need every british overseas territory to adopt full public beneficial ownership register so that sham structure such as abramovich can be trace challenge and tax dirty money the kind that flow beneath the wave of secrecy corrode the entire tax system so call on the minister never to shy away from the globe span challenge of tax abuse hide in the nook and cranny of our own backyard let turn to my third and final recommendation for the government which relate to the often overlook distortion in our system of pension tax relief this long stand relief disproportionately benefit high earner and it have be my settled view for number of year that we must look again at how it operate currently high rate taxpayer enjoy relief on pension contribution while the high earner enjoy relief basic rate taxpayer nevertheless enjoy rate of just total pension tax relief cost circa billion per year to the treasury accord to hmrc of that total two third be relief for those on income in the and income tax bracket which represent of the adult population in accord to the ifs that highlight the inequity here system of relief that be tilt to those who need it least not to incentivise moderate earner put into pension but to support those on the high income urge the minister to consider move to flat rate model of say independent of income bracket so that every saver get equal recognition for secure their own retirement finally with my industry expertise in address tax evasion before come to this place would like to address the siren call of broad wealth tax be make by number of colleague on the government benches and elsewhere in the house increase in capital gain tax to align they close to income tax be welcome wealth and work should be tax at similar rate it be as simple as that but have few word of caution for proponent of wealth taxis the wealth tax commission itself acknowledge that wealth taxis could incentivise the wealthy to hide asset behind legal vehicle use expensive lawyer and secrecy jurisdiction hmrc be already chronically short staff under resource and hamstring by complexity without dismantle the complex web of ultimate beneficial owner offshore trust nominee director and secrecy jurisdiction we be at grave risk of open up game of whack mole that we would likely see the government lose to deep pocketed and well lawyere high net worth individual who can run circle around hmrc and law enforcement and secrete their asset elsewhere my firm view be that the government should instead crack down on tax evasion simplify the tax code streamline exist relief and bring capital gain tax level close to income tax the centre for the analysis of taxation estimate that close alignment of capital gain and income taxis alone could raise some billion for the exchequer as country we face enormous challenge an age population creak infrastructure rise global instability and the urgency of the net zero transition we know that public service be under strain we need to raise fund in way that be both fair and that promote the growth we need to get our country back on its foot after year of tory decline let we be clear taxation be not merely tool for revenue but the lifeblood of our social contract which be why we desperately need responsible and workable tax system to ensure that education be right not privilege that healthcare be free at the point of use and that the most vulnerable in our society be protect the first line of the tories motion get to the word manifesto and accept their premise that that be what this be about it be about the commitment not to increase taxis on work people and not to increase national insurance or the basic high or additional rate of income tax do not think that be tall order the next item on the list however be vat never mind the headline rate the concern now from comment inside the government be about what will be drag into vat or have its reduce rate increase there be no clarity on that from the government much less any reference to it in their manifesto from which parliament and taxpayer across these island can take any comfort or otherwise the motion call on the government to reaffirm the statement make by the chancellor of the exchequer that personal tax threshold will be uprate in the manner that they say that be fair point fiscal drag be an iniquitous thing to inflict on people it eat into pay rise and erode people incentive to get on and progress and there be real concern give the fiscal misadventure it seem to be one farce after another with this government and one turn after another they talk about introduce stability into the fiscal dynamic well be hold my breath wait for that to happen but think be make mistake in that pursuit bad of all well it be not bad of all but it be really bad be the change to agricultural property relief which be also not in the government manifesto and sincerely urge the minister to pause and review those change as other have articulate that measure be clearly something that treasury official put in front of every new chancellor and every new chancellor to date have have the wit to say well not do for this chancellor who be lack in wit and much else to recommend she she say ooh just go ahead and do that completely fail to understand the agricultural economy as it exist in these island my constituency of angus and perthshire glens be the garden of scotland and the high productive agricultural land in scotland an ecosystem exist around that farm enterprise of recruitment training plant sale feed stock market fuel sale it all exist and it revolve like satellite around the farm business those farmer be now say why would invest what on earth would invest for why be invest my hard earn capital into increase technology and lower the cost of production so that can get more competitive food on to the shelf of supermarket and help with the cost of living which this government be incapable of do anything about mean that my asset value go up and so that when die and my asset transfer my tax bill go up the hon gentleman be give powerful speech on this subject be at the great yorkshire show last week and there we have not only livestock and farmer but the whole supply chain around that the only conversation there be exactly as the hon gentleman describe of whole industry bring low because of this misconceived measure he talk about chancellor be present with thing the caravan tax be present to the chancellor in and it take government back benchers to persuade those on the front bench to change path hope labour members might do the same with the farm tax that be welcome and comprehensive round up of some of the broad issue on this but it speak to the fiscal innumeracy that say there be no cost to any of this we can just help ourselves to that and it will have any impact as the right hon member for wetherby and easingwold sir alec shelbrooke point out if we speak to any rural plant sale or dealership and they will say that sale have go off cliff along with the vat employment income tax and national insurance that go with they that speak to treasury and chancellor who have pass understanding of the price of everything but could not identify value in line up the motion go on to talk about pension this be difficult because do not believe for one minute that we should pull pensioner whose income be only the state pension into tax neither do believe that by dint of be pensioner someone should get tax relief on the same income that somebody who earn that income will not get tax relief on the government be in difficult position on this and that be of their own making unless and until they guarantee to uprate the rate and protect pensioner from fiscal drag there be little point in make great big song and dance about the triple lock if what that do be pull pensioner into taxation where diverge from the mover of the motion shame it be go so well yes it have to come and be relieved that there be cleavage where diverge with they be on wealth tax see that we be in state the uk be not country where poverty level among our child be rise in every country in the uk except scotland in scotland it cost we million year it will be million by the end of the decade to mitigate westminster mismanagement of child poverty we can not say that it be somehow punitive for people with asset of more than million to attract an annual modest rate on those asset that be reflective of the high tax burden that ordinary people have pay since the second world war incidentally say to conservative colleague that that be the case before the election the labour party have just knock that into the stratosphere with its misadventure there have be no talk anywhere in this chamber today about brexit remember the prime minister what be she call theresa may she be ask repeatedly what do brexit mean she say brexit mean brexit which be as nebulous as it sound in we now know what brexit mean it mean endure child poverty and flatlining growth no matter who be in charge of the treasury in the united kingdom it mean common purpose between labour and the conservatives to have neurotic policy on immigration it mean pale imitation to substitute for eu programme such as substitute erasmus with the pointless ture scheme or eu structural funding and other funding with level up it mean permanent drag on business the far we get from covid the more we see that the fundamental that be wrong with this economy be due to brexit the minister in his sum up will doubtless say order call john slinger this be all rather desperate from the conservative party have think that pantomime season be in the winter but clearly it be not will defend the decision take by this government to help work people grow the economy and fix the mess we inherit from the previous government and we be do so with fair tax at the core use the term government regard the last administration loosely because they do not believe in government they run the tank dry they be run the factory without maintain the equipment they just make last minute repair know that thing would break down again and they do an astonishing school be find to contain raac reinforce autoclaved aerate concrete and be almost disintegrate before our eye our army reach its small size since the napoleonic war prison reach capacity and the government do very little or nothing the police see officer cut and that be reverse only at the last point that be what the last government be crumble and shambolic they preside over country whose public service be on their knee and whose people have not see their prospect get well for many year so woeful be their record that they vacate even the territory that they use to occupy they become the weak on defence tories the soft on crime tories and the high tax tories that bring to my second point the conservatives increase the tax burden to its high level since the second world war it be stable at from to the parliament see the big rise in the tax take in recent history reach by they then engage in reckless unfunded cut to ni at time when the economy be still stagnant they do that deliberately in my view it be poisoned chalice bequeath to this government the conservatives know that labour commitment not to raise tax on ordinary work people would mean that we could not and would not reverse that reckless tax cut they know full well that they be leave behind black hole conservative members may not like to hear it but they know that they know that the public service be on their knee but they do not care they only care about their electoral fortune which do not work out so well this labour government be not afraid of difficult challenge nor of address those challenge we actually believe in the concept of government and the responsibility of government the responsibility to take the difficult decision necessary to fill the unforeseen billion black hole that we inherit we therefore believe that we must raise revenue through taxation as the chancellor outline in her budget last autumn despite the accusation of the conservative party this have not be to the detriment of work people nor be it the case that we be not ask the wealthy in society to pay more the opposite be true we have raise taxis on wealth private jet passenger now face tax increase vat have be add to private school fee and we be raise billion more from inheritance tax by close relief use by the wealthy in his speech the chief secretary to the treasury say that work people be people who go out to work do farmer go out to work of course they go out to work believe that my right hon friend the chief secretary to the treasury answer that point early in the debate but thank the hon lady for her intervention to add to my list non dom status be be largely scrap capital gain taxis have increase and stamp duty on second home now start at these measure help raise the revenue that be require for massive public investment benefit work people not make they bad off the clue be in the name of our party labour we be the party of work we be also the party of get our country our economy and our public service work as such ask opposition members to look forward to the summer recess with optimism in their heart do not let the doom monger and gloom monger fill their heart for change have already begin that change be make possible by my right hon friend the chancellor budget and by the spending review we be fix the nhs we promise million additional nhs appointment in our first year and have deliver million waiting list be down by and more gps have be recruit we be put more money into people pocket we have boost the minimum wage for million worker and wage grow more in our first month than over whole year under the previous administration testify to the conservatives incompetence and weakness when they be in government we be fix the foundation of our economy with four interest rate cut three trade deal and business confidence at nine year high in the first quarter of this year uk growth be the high in the we be tackle childhood poverty open the first free breakfast club and expand free school meal in one day this government take action to take child out of poverty now turn to the motion in front of we which imply reversal of revenue raise policy worth over billion year if opposition members oppose the measure we have take which of the investment have just mention would they reverse be it the free breakfast club be it the investment in the nhs with short waiting list or be it the extra police perhaps more pertinently give the title of today debate how would they pay for it the chancellor be not duck difficult decision and be confident that if people observe her action they will see that she and this labour government be correct call it zoom out and dial down approach if people zoom out and look down they will see that the challenge we face as country on tax and on reform of many kind require we to take action if they dial down the endless noise of discontent whip up by social medium and sometimes in the medium and by our political opponent they will observe country whose people have order call bradley thomas early this month the house witness the government lose control of swathe of their own party they have have just more than year in office and yet the crack could not be clear in the last year the country have have to endure turn tax increase and stagnant economy and yet the chancellor and the prime minister have be push by their disapprove back benchers into the inevitable they will have to break their fiscal rule and manifesto commitment the obr have warn of an up to billion cost from the water down welfare reform labour promise to stop the chaos and support business through stable policy environment that be in its manifesto yet employer national insurance contribution increase in april another pledge disregard we have see the national insurance exemption for indian worker transfer to the uk which the indian government say be competitive advantage for they the leader of the opposition oppose such deal as business and trade secretary yet the government continue to sell out british worker whose side be this government on deal and decision like that explain why of voter believe that the government do not have thing under control this be the government who get trade deal that the conservative party fail to do and save hundred of thousand of job be you say that you would not have sign those deal be you say order be not say anything please address the chair the government have not see success where we have see tariff impose on the economy the government have not reduce they there be competitive disadvantage as result of what we be see in the global economic climate when labour govern britain suffer on the trade deal it turn out that the deal with the us entirely exclude the british bioethanol industry until the president of the united states phone up the prime minister and he unilaterally give away the entirety of the market put at risk hundred of job at vivergo and thousand of job in the supply chain and at ensus thank my right hon friend that be another failure by labour there be two fundamental macroeconomic problem face this country one be productivity and the second be mass immigration which have displace investment in domestic skill the budget do nothing about those and yet the tax system could be use to address both order the right hon gentleman be very experienced he should have be here at the start of the debate if he want to intervene my right hon friend the member for south holland and the deepings sir john hayes be absolutely spot on the message to the government be clear they can not tax their way to prosperity will the hon gentleman give way will not have be generous with intervention more than half of business owner nationally be plan to or have make further cut to staff number in response to increase employer national insurance contribution in may job be lose in single month when we tax job out of existence the fiscal rule be not merely stretch they be shatter the chancellor will have either to break her campaign promise and raise taxis or admit that her rule be break either way it mean that work family and work people across the country will pay the price fortnight ago the government reject call to protect those whose only income be the state pension from pay income tax this retirement tax will hit million of our low income pensioner this be not wealth they be modest often meagre income rely upon to heat home buy food and see doctor one in five single pensioner have no other income beyond the state pension and basic benefit yet to fill fiscal hole that they have create the government resist the plea of their most vulnerable citizen will the hon gentleman give way will not give way have be generous in take intervention as the chancellor grow increasingly desperate to save the sink ship of her fiscal rule there be now rumour of wealth tax to compound the government contempt for not only work people but industry leader and innovator that be not conjecture only last week lord kinnock say that labour should be willing to explore such disastrous measure let we be honest wealth tax really mean tax on hard work people it mean an attack on pension and on people who have do the right thing and want sense of fairness and anyone who have accrue anything will pay the price will the hon gentleman give way have explain that will not give way any far the nation deserve well it deserve government who trust enterprise rein in the bloated state and live within their mean urge the house to support the motion and send clear message scrap the job tax fix the welfare overburden protect pensioner and give work britain the honest sensible conservative growth plan it deserve we live in country where wealth be hoard by the few while poverty be the fate of the many yes the government have take some welcome step address non dom status and impose vat on private school fee and make no apology for be ideological about that those be step in the right direction but as have be show by reform to welfare they be far from enough to stop cut the truth be that these policy do not come close to tackle the grotesque level of inequality in our country nor will they generate the revenue that be need to repair the fail ideology of austerity privatisation and no small amount of political cowardice in the face of corporate greed the be the decade in which the super rich won they be hand tax break be shield by loophole and watch their wealth explode while wage stagnate and service crumble millionaire and billionaire flourish as say in the early debate this afternoon the fact that in one of the rich economy in the world million of people in full time work be rely on food bank to survive be national disgrace they go to work they do their shift and still they be leave to rely on the charity of stranger to get by this do not happen by accident it be the result of deliberate political choice austerity privatisation suppress wage and tax system rig in favour of the ultra wealthy even now with labour in power we be be tell to temper our ambition how can we do that when there be year difference in life expectancy between the rich and the poor in scotland and when thousand of child be grow up cold hungry and face an uncertain future however there be an alternative to relentless cut there be an alternative to balance the book on the back of the poor there be an alternative to manage decline as we watch the state become bankrupt both financially and morally that alternative be genuinely progressive taxation alongside investment in people and community find common ground with my hon friend the member for bolton west phil brickell in that also support equalise capital gain tax with income tax currently many who earn their living through work be tax more than those who profit by sit on their wealth equalise those rate could raise an additional billion year my hon friend and do however disagree about the introduction of an annual wealth tax since come to this place have campaign for the introduction of annual wealth tax on those with net asset over million this single policy could raise billion year and the notion that the wealthy will flee en masse if we ask they to contribute fairly be tired and dishonest argument even among the ultra wealthy there be recognition that inequality have spiral out of control many be willing to contribute more as be confirm by the work of tax justice uk and patriotic millionaires but the government must have the courage to do it when we invest in public service when we lift people up we build fair country and strong economy child do well at school when they be feed house and support worker be more productive when they be not spend every hour worried about how they will make end meet family be strong when the welfare state work for they not against they we have to find new and just way to fund welfare to fund the green transition to fund public service and to rebuild the country the labour movement be not build to tinker around the edge it be build to transform and if this government be serious about real change the change that we promise we must be bold than we have be so far redistribution of wealth and power for the benefit of worker and community and wide society should always be the drive mission of any real labour government the damage that this labour government have deal to our economy be real kick in the tooth for all those who vote for they last year and for those who do not vote for they but who wish they well and believe their word at the general election time and again my right hon friend the member for richmond and northallerton rishi sunak and many other on this side of the house warn that the new labour government priority and promise on tax be not to be trust and that member of the public should take their word with bucket of salt the labour party cry foul dive to the ground like premiership footballer scream blue murder but what have come to pass be far bad than many on this side of the house imagine it would be for all the government talk of fix the foundation have be pain to watch the suffering distress and anxiety that they have wilfully choose to inflict on the british people they have hammer the small business on which people rely for their job through change to business property relief agricultural property relief vat and dual cab taxis and through the business rate rise and the national insurance tax rise can not think of policy as woefully construct and as disastrously execute as the national insurance tax rise this government claim to have be elect on platform of promote growth but they be choose to boost growth by blow up business that be so inexplicable that it call into question the government ability to govern the people hit hard by the tax rise be those start out in their first job who will be hit by the threshold and part time worker often woman try to get back into the labour market it be among those group that we see the high rise in unemployment since the budget it be because of the government choice to raise taxis that business be cut back on hire staff they be also make staff redundant shelve expansion plan and close their door see that in my constituency where unemployment be up by about sixth in the month since the general election it be also because of that choice that inflation be up and growth be down and because of choice make by the labour party that this country will continue to miss out on investment opportunity and economic security that bring to the people who will feel the impact most acutely during the pandemic we celebrate key worker the care home worker teacher and hospice worker who go out every day in horrendous condition to do their job in spirit of service what kind of labour government would willingly choose to punish those who represent the heartbeat of the nation only recently hear from woman in my constituency who run small childcare business which she keep go during the pandemic she write to tell that because of the tax rise she have have to cut back her assistant hour and turn away parent on the one side the government pretend that wage be increase but on the other employer be be force to cut hour so people be no well off it be happen in every constituency up and down the country and that be the real cost of this government choice the national insurance tax rise mean less money for school and teacher for hospice and their staff and for the healthcare worker who be applaud during covid those operate in the most difficult circumstance it be fundamental disgrace that the labour government who be always so keen to paint themselves as the kinder more cuddly and more friendly party have make the catastrophic choice to balance the book and fix their failure on the back of essential worker and volunteer the government be raise taxis on hospice which they be suppose to stand up for will the right hon gentleman give way give way to the hon gentleman on raise taxis on hospice thank the right hon gentleman for his defence of teacher be sure that he welcome the pay rise for teacher of last year and this year fund by the budget as the hon gentleman will know that rise be not fully fund by the budget because the national insurance cost for school have not be fully cover by the budget indicate dissent the hon gentleman may shake his head but he should look at the statistic school in my constituency and his will cut support staff and teaching assistant as result of the black hole that his government have create for their worker it be particularly pernicious that the government be raise taxis on hospice visit st luke hospice in my constituency at the weekend it be have to raise hundred of thousand of pound year more money that would be go towards care for the most vulnerable at the end of their life to pay for tax rise that labour members will today vote to maintain while conservative member say that it should be remove my hon friend and will always raise these issue as we have the issue for farmer and our food security or the mind boggle plan to drive away wealth creator to fill up the treasury coffer and we will continue to do that in opposition we be ask the government to listen to we because we want the government to change course and do the right thing bizarrely we do not actually want the government to drive the country off the edge of cliff in the spirit of listening would be very grateful to know which of our investment in the public sector the right hon gentleman would cut the chagos deal come to mind which the government seem so keen on handing over british taxpayer money for something we already own we would not have make the same decision that this government have make we make it very clear in government that we would not have hand out pay rise to train driver without the need for reform or to the junior doctor who have come back yet again with another double digit pay demand the hon gentleman need to think about those thing he can say what would you have do but we actually say that we would not do those thing before they happen so actually we be the one who have be financially responsible he be the one hand money away to mauritius so that it can cut its income tax while the government front benchers seem bit wary of answer the question of whether they will have to raise taxis later this year we opposition members can guarantee that they will call on the government to do what be right and look again to their manifesto the government should choose to back enterprise reward work not punish those who help out in hospice create growth and opportunity in every corner of our country and back other who do so instead of tax everyone and everything they possibly can otherwise fear that this labour government will face the same fate as all other majority labour government that have ever exist and leave unemployment high than when they enter office that be not exactly the labour party that people vote for in my constituency or across the country the motion before we show the difference in value between the two side of this house the conservatives motion speak of wealth creator but specifically say that only few of we create wealth on the labour benches we believe that every single worker create wealth in this country we have see the consequence of year of their value in action fall living standard high waiting list high energy bill and weak nation our value as we see under the previous labour government leave we with strong wealthy and prosperous nation in which we tax the wealthy to invest in the service that we all rely on we leave more prosperous and strong nation last time and that be what we be build this time we have see the damage of the past year as express in the motion we have see what the conservatives value mean in practice they believe that if few do well and there be few tax cut for those at the top our country would be wealthy that start in and continue with truss in reality at the end of that year no one do well we have the long squeeze on wage since napoleon threaten our shore we be the only high income nation to see sickness rise after the pandemic have the high energy bill in europe and be the worst connect country in western europe that be the conservatives record believe the right hon gentleman want to make an intervention the hon gentleman say that the last labour government leave the country in fantastic state as have mention before they leave behind massive deficit and unemployment higher than when they take office do he not understand that deficit of over of gdp be an horrific legacy to leave in peacetime also unemployment be high be betrayal of the people the labour party be mean to stand up for the global financial crisis affect every single nation across the world do not deny by the way how difficult thing be in but we also leave the conservative an economy that be grow record low waiting list and investment in our nation and plan to insulate our home because they do not follow through on our plan we have the bad insulated home in western europe and some of the high energy bill to go with that yes we leave in difficult moment but we leave the conservatives with strong foundation for go forward the conservatives leave we poor sicker and slow thank to their their record on tax in the bad cost of live crisis in century they attempt to cut taxis for the wealthy everybody on the labour benches think truss be mad really do not know what opposition member believe anymore be sure the hon gentleman would not want to mislead the house so he will recognise that in few than of home in this country be properly insulate with an energy performance certificate rat or above when we hand over power last year that figure be over he can look up those number and ask he to never misrepresent that record in this house because that be the reality we see it in the insulation build out david cameron as he put it cut the green crap insulation rate be rise when we leave office but they be cut throughout the as nation we have not have that insulation that be why we bring in the warm home plan and be fund it with billion million more home will be insulate under this government bring down energy bill by hundred of pound those plan for insulation be fund by the tax rise that the conservatives oppose time and again we ask they what they would like less investment in and time and again no answer be give we on the government benches be try to build country accord to our value country where each of we be do well be do well be well educate be healthy and find it easy to get around those be the building block of our nation wealth to build that wealth take investment which must be fund and those who benefit most from our nation productivity should be ask to contribute more that be exactly what this government be ensure do the hon gentleman recognise that if people be to contribute the fundamental bedrock be have job and that the job tax be cause mass unemployment and business closure employment be rise and have rise since the general election interruption the reason why unemployment be rise be that more people be seek to enter the labour force people be less inactive than before because we be get waiting list down would rather people be look for job than stay out of the labour force entirely as the opposition would have it we want to build the kind of country where people be able to work we increase employer national insurance contribution in the budget while protect the small business we end the non dom tax break to make sure that the ultra rich could not escape taxis by use loophole and increase taxis on private jet we be get more of the energy giant unearned profit into the public purse to invest in the thing that we all need we know the conservatives will complain constantly about the thing we be raise money for but they will never say what they would cut we see what happen over the past year we see the weak nation they leave in their wake the government be invest to change that for good after the past year we be leave weak and more divided nation nation in which each of we produce less and look inward as we have find it hard to pay the bill that be exactly what the government be fix and what we be invest in be proud of this government be proud of this country most of all be proud of the country we will build in which each of we do well and we recognise that our common strength be find in our common prosperity few month ago meet former civil servant he tell that when he be work in government in the run up to the election ed balls would come into the department and say look this be what our manifesto say but here be the three page memo on what we be actually go to do in government in fairness to that government they achieve quite lot in their first two year of course they stick rigidly to the conservative spending plan and tony blair economic adviser derek scott say that they have golden economic legacy have listen very carefully this afternoon to the speech make by government members of course can acknowledge where we be in term of the economy and the fact that the country want change recognise that government members however have fail completely to acknowledge the scale of the once year covid experience what that do to our public finance and the challenge it give we in the treasury the tough decision we have to make and the inevitable scarring to the economy will the hon member give way shall just finish my point and then will give way to the hon gentleman the typical refrain be then to say what about liz truss be not member of liz truss government but be sure that my colleague who be do the very good that they could she be in office for seven week acknowledge that politically it be catastrophic for my party and there be lot of lesson on which we will have time to reflect but the failure to acknowledge properly the dominant reason for lose that last election which be relate to the scarring of what happen with covid and the fundamental challenge do not do credit to this house shall give way to the hon gentleman if he still want to intervene presumably on liz truss thank the right hon member for give way we sit on the treasury committee together and find he to be an incredibly kind and brilliant member of parliament he have be very kind to personally as well on the experience of come out of covid our contention be not just about liz truss but about the fact that we have the high inflation and the high energy bill natural gas which we depend on set the price of the time it be also to more expensive than wind and solar so the lack of investment in clean energy leave we with high inflation and make we poor will come on to address the fundamental dynamic of spending and that area in particular but first want to draw the hon gentleman attention back to the subject will the right hon member give way no will bit of progress now will give way to the hon gentleman later even though he do not give way to early the chancellor come to the treasury committee in november she say we have now set the envelope for spend for this parliament and we will not be come back for more tax increase or indeed more borrowing we now need to live within the mean that we have set ourselves in the budget and in the allocation of those spending total what have happen in year of course recognise that event occur and have refer to those under the previous government they do present challenge but the labour party fundamental problem be understand the effect of high burden of tax on wealth creator and their motivation to employ people and to invest in the productive capacity of the economy more job and more tax revenue from low rate this government be say that we can do little bit more on national insurance that we can just put few more burden of regulation that the long term capital investment of billion will transform our economy however what hear from business in salisbury small or large be that the motivation to grow business to employ more people and to say that they be determined to do so because there be some reward from that be rapidly diminish what we hear be speculation about which additional taxis will be impose after the next three month today government members have suggest equalisation of capital gain tax flat rate of pension relief wealth tax or high band of council tax although they may have be rule out the overall effect on top of what we have already have be for business to say not go to do this anymore we have now have two consecutive month of negative growth that may well continue which be bad for everyone it be bad for the capacity that we have as country to invest in the transformation that we all seek to deliver on some thing we will agree on and it be not sustainable if the government do not recognise that business will not grow and expand if that tax level rise beyond certain amount thank the right hon member for give way particularly as apparently do not give way to he do not realise that it be he who be try to intervene on otherwise would have give way recognise what the right hon member be say about covid think that as country we have not yet come to the term with the true impact of covid and we will not do so for long time because it still feel very near to we as new member of this house take the point that we ought to understand the true impact the concern for and perhaps for other colleague be that by try to focus only on covid and not on the economic and fiscal impact of liz truss know that he be talk about the political impact we will never learn the lesson of the liz truss moment and we just do not want to lose sight of the lesson that can be learn absolutely interruption be tell that ought not to take any more intervention but will say that liz truss insight about the imperative for growth be right we do need to look for growth what she do not do be examine the condition to do that in way that the market could understand and it have catastrophic effect we now have labour government and we now have work people be massively affect by tax change we have andrew bailey governor of the bank of england say that as reaction to the national insurance change business have make change to employment that mean fire people and we have paul johnson downgrade growth prospect alongside virtually every other independent analyst the winter fuel payment be an absolute disgrace the change to agricultural property relief and business property relief be put on my desk at every fiscal event but one just have to say no because they be the wrong thing to do the political capital that have be lose by the government and the damage to their reputation for their stewardship of the economy be catastrophic say to those on the labour benches that we be face some really tough challenge as we approach the next budget the choice that this government need to make on taxis will define their future what happen last week be the bad possible situation several time today we have be ask what would you do what we would have do and what we would do now be take root and branch look at the welfare system to see what the government should do we would focus on the most vulnerable and look after they well we would recognise that one of the legacy of covid be that the pathway into benefit have go fundamentally wrong and the country can not afford it unless we grip that major driver of cost for this country we shall see taxis rise and rise to meet those iron clothe fiscal rule and we will be in spiral of decline on december the chancellor make commitment she tell conference of business leader that she would not need to raise taxis it be foolish claim from chancellor out of her depth she then tax the engine of growth in her budget the business and entrepreneur who create job she send high earn taxpayer flee from our country in record number she tax job with her betrayal after say she would not raise national insurance contribution and that rise have bring charity small business and entrepreneur to their knee she have destroy the family farm with her family farm tax she have tax hard work family with the vat attack on independent school have break her promise and make false claim to business the chancellor be now come for pensioner she be come for the people who have work and save pay their tax and contribute to this country she be the only chancellor who claim to be an economist but do not understand the laffer curve it be time for the prime minister to realise what he have and to act he have weak out of her depth chancellor who be send our country down one way street to level economic failure substantial level of political knockabout be inevitable in debate such as this but when it degenerate to the punch and judy of it your fault yes it be and no it not it be not really do anything for my constituent who live in the moment of this government therefore the debate should properly have focus on what the government be do in respect of our economy in northern ireland we have feel and continue to feel the brunt of many of those measure some of which such as the inheritance tax on family farm be cite in the motion agree entirely with the analysis of the right hon member for wetherby and easingwold sir alec shelbrooke as to the depth and long term consequence that that be have on family farm however want to focus for moment on the other side of the inheritance tax imposition namely business property relief because that have not have the same attention but be have an equally detrimental effect on many business that be particularly so in northern ireland where we have the staggering statistic that of our business be micro business in the uk the figure be translate into the reality that most of those business be small family business those small family business by virtue of what be happen to they with business property relief instead of plan for growth be now have to plan for death for inheritance which be have suppressive effect on our economy we must add to that the fact that we in northern ireland live subject to the pernicious irish sea border with all the cost that that bring hear some hon member lament that we get brexit well lament the fact that in northern ireland we do not get brexit we be leave under the eu clutch and control let illustrate that with practical example that have just come to light as result in northern ireland of our live under eu rule we live under the general safety regulation and that mean that purchaser in northern ireland who want to buy new car from car salesroom in northern ireland will be charge more than his counterpart in great britain why it be because the gsr have to be meet that be but another illustration of how individual and business in northern ireland be be oppress by the lack of brexit and the continuance of eu rule have hear talk today about wonderful trade deal those wonderful trade deal mean that good come from those country into northern ireland be treat as come into the eu therefore if there be differential in tariff they pay the eu tariff those tariff would not be pay in gb if those good have tariff or they might have tariff but if they be be bring from the us or india into northern ireland the eu tariff will be pay some say you can claim it back well if someone be willing to go through the hideous paperwork of reclaim and they can prove that the good they bring in will never end up across the border in the eu they can eventually maybe after year get refund what do that do for cash flow in any business those be the reality from northern ireland that the government be refuse to face up to they be cause trade diversion yet the government lamentably refuse to deal with that this motion carry considerable merit for in that it draw this government attention to what they promise and the contrast with what they be deliver be very substantial indeed the government might have huge majority but it be about govern well and not govern in whatever way take their fancy or the fancy of their back benchers they should do the job do it right and do it right as far as northern ireland be concern it be pleasure to take part in this debate it be worth remind the house of the situation in july last year we have the fast growth in the employment be million high than in with up to million people in employment inflation be on target at around and the uk between and have grow fast than germany france japan and italy that be the legacy of conservative stewardship have ask labour members to give more rounded picture but sadly they almost always refuse to do so debt to gdp have go up significantly partly because of the massive deficit that we inherit in at more than of gdp that be phenomenal and have to be bring down over time and partly because of covid and ukraine when we intervene to pay half of everyone energy bill that be more rounded picture overall we manage to come out with people help through covid and through the energy crisis and with remarkably high level of employment yet just year later under this chancellor watch that strong foundation have crumble the labour party need to recognise that the economy be recover and to let it grow instead by come in and be hold by the manifesto commitment not to put up the main taxis on the one hand and on the other think that they be be clever and somehow keep to their pledge by impose national insurance rise on business but not individual that have the most bizarre and perverse effect the billion hit on the economy create by the job tax come down to about billion after behaviour change accord to the obr then after compensation for the public sector it come down to about million then people have have to scrabble around for hospice gps and so on which mean the net be probably about million and that be before the depressing impact on the overall economy mean it almost certainly come to single figure billion but guess what the obr also say from next year of the impact of the billion hit come out of ordinary people wage that be the situation the government have impose tax of billion on ordinary people earning in order to generate less than billion of tax revenue that be utterly insane and ask members on the government back benches to have look at that follow it and come back would love to hear that those number be wrong because would love to hear that we be not do something as suicidal crazy and damaging as it appear to be wish could drink the kool aid like the hon member for rugby john slinger the funniest thing about he man for whom have great deal of respect and affection be that unlike some of his colleague who spout this stuff he give every impression which believe that he believe it himself that be what be truly extraordinary thank the right hon gentleman for allow to intervene be certainly not drink kool aid do believe what say and believe it firmly respect the right hon gentleman as colleague even though he be from different party but there be no kool aid for thank the hon gentleman for that the economy have contract for two consecutive month shrink by in april and in may in textbook sign that we be in or could be head into recession employment be down too with office for national statistics datum show that payroll job have fall by more than in single month with around few job compare with last year and unemployment climb to follow the excellent speech from my right hon friend the member for salisbury john glen would just say that we should look at the big picture again appeal to colleague on the labour benches there be magnificent victory for labour last year in the election with plus mp elect and it really be up to labour member to recognise just how scary position we be in we have debt to gdp at about and we have world in which the fast growth be to be find in develop state some of which be quite hostile to we and to our value the truth be that no rich powerful country have divine right to stay that way wealth do not just come down from the heaven even in the year when we be in government too often in this place we seem to obsess only on how we would spend money from the moment we get up in the morning to the time we go to bed at night we would talk about how we would spend the money but we have to generate it first it do not matter whether our no concern be the alleviation of poverty the defence of the nation education or the health service we have to have strong economy that be why the government be right one of the reason they get that majority may be because they say that their no mission be economic growth remember that it do not come through in the speech from labour members now their no mission be economic growth we should be sweat in select committees in all party group on the floor of this house and in westminster hall over how we deliver that economic growth so that we be not go backwards but be actually grow the economy we also have to accept something that be go to be tough for labour members most of whom have not have any private sector experience and who tend to believe that the rich be just there to take money off and wealth creator can be endlessly offer haircut and will just put up with it and if they do not it show some moral flaw on their part we have to accept that the art of government be to recognise the reality to align the incentive of actor in this case in the economy with the public good we want to see after year there be so many flash red light and warning sign that the government be not get that right so they need to be prepared to think again be involve after that omnishamble budget of when be part of help the then chancellor see his route to well path forward and my experience tell that labour members must recognise that the country be potentially in really serious parlous position we have no divine right to be wealthy powerful nation the next four year be important hope and expect that there will be conservative government after that but whatever happen the next four year be important and hope that labour members will start to give rather more nuanced and thoughtful speech in order to influence the front bench despite promise of economic competence and bright future at the election the tax choice that this government have make have undermine economic growth in wales over of all business in wales be small and medium sized and the increase in employer national insurance contribution have hit they incredibly hard it have raise operating cost mean that business be less able to weather time of hardship and it limit their ability to invest and expand the impact have also be feel in our hospice yesterday we receive the devastating news of the temporary closure of the hospice on ynys môn due to financial pressure this one decision be have direct impact on our community one policy that the government could stop before it be implement be the propose change to agricultural and business property relief which be set to take effect in april have listen to the voice of family farmer and local business it be clear to that this policy will cause huge damage as the farmers union of wales say if the reform to agricultural property relief remain unchanged the consequence for farmer rural community and food production in wales could be devastating and irreversible plaid cymru have be clear that there should be wales specific impact assessment before this policy be pursue far give the importance of agricultural and small business to our economy and community instead of damage policy such as raise national insurance and cut agricultural and business property relief we should be make the tax system fairer we must follow the principle that those with the broad shoulder should carry the large burden instead of tax small business and try to plunder benefit the government should look at wealth tax on asset over million to raise the billion in revenue that be need to support the public finance taxis be political choice plaid cymru would make choice that be on the side of community in wales this labour government have begin full scale assault on the british economy in just one year they have preside over shamble that have punish worker hammer business and betray every promise they make on tax to my constituent in farnham bordon haslemere liphook and the surround village let we look at the fact national insurance be up with rise that the ifs confirm will fall largely on work people agricultural property relief have be slash which the national farmers union warn threaten family farm and food security in my constituency farming be not just way of life it underpin our local economy and community when visit bob milton of kilnside farm he tell that his business now face lay off staff and sell land just to meet labour new tax burden that be not policy it be economic sabotage on the change to business property relief small business owner now face tax penalty simply for own their own premise and hop to pass their business on these change punish success and threaten continuity for family firm across the country and what be the result of all this inflation be stick at well above the bank of england target of unemployment be up to the high in four year borrowing be at billion in may and public debt be forecast to hit of gdp with annual debt interest soar to billion by the tax burden be head to an historic high the high on record in fact yet labour still refuse to rule out new taxis on home pension or saving their chancellor will not even say whether small business owner be work people and the prime minister dodge the question altogether in farnham shop vacancy have rise from to in just one quarter that is more shuttered high street shop in haslemere and bordon employer tell they be freeze and cut hour the shooting star child hospice that serve my constituency will have to spend in new nic cost enough to hire three nurse that be now go straight to the treasury will the hon member give way will not give way that be not just wrong it be unconscionable meanwhile labour vat raid on education have push more than pupil out of the independent more than the government predict that mean more pressure on already overstretch state school more crowded classroom more exhausted teacher and more child fall behind labour promise competence instead they have deliver confusion contradiction and chaos they have break their promise on national insurance council tax farm and education and now they be break britain economic future this be not stewardship it be self harm this be not change it be collapse this be not what the british people vote for and they deserve well in my constituency there be dozen of hard work family business which be the backbone of our local economy and key to our local identity these business owner get up early go to bed late work weekend employ hundred of local people and contribute hugely to our local high street local community and local economy but this government seem desperate to squeeze every single penny out of those family business and into the hand of the chancellor the rise in employer national insurance put huge strain on the wage bill especially when couple with the rise in the minimum wage that be squeeze every single family business as well as school and hospice indeed last weekend take part in local fundraising event the oxenhope straw race which raise money for our local hospice the sue ryder manorlands hospice in the worth valley every year they do fundraise but they tell that instead of the money go to provide end of life care it now go straight to the treasury through employer national insurance the sad fact be that the large sum of money go to charity be not provide the support that be need because it be go directly to the treasury the business rate relief reduction be impact many hard work business across keighley and ilkley the inheritance tax challenge be impact many of our farming business and family farming business through slash the relief on agricultural property relief and business property relief to the million threshold that be where the naivety kick in when we consider the size of the average farm in england about acre and value the farmland the house the cottage the grow crop the machinery and the livestock we reach well above the million threshold therefore expose nearly every farming business to an inheritance tax liability those hard work business make return of less than if any at all yet labour members say that they must have the weight of responsibility on their shoulder that be disgrace rise will take quick intervention from the hon member but hope that he will justify why those hard work family farm and business in keighley and ilkley who get up day in day out have to shoulder the burden for the mistake that this labour government be make will he answer that point thank the hon member for give way he be the third consecutive conservative member to stand up and speak but have yet to hear what proposal his party want to bring in to raise revenue or what service it want to cut in my contribution make conscious effort to set out three constructive proposal for the treasury to consider and challenge conservative member because there be dearth of order be sure that the government whips be watch the hon gentleman and make note that he will be in line for job and see the minister quake in his boot at the thought of those bizarre recommendation the point be that the labour government do not realise that all these tax increase be hit the many hard work business across every constituency represent in this house shame on the government for bring they forward no matter how elaborate the rain dance or how impressive the government press release growth will not come precisely because of the decision that the chancellor have take we need reset we need new direction we need to limit spending so that we can cut tax not consistently raise it until the government realise that be afraid for all the family businesse up and down the country which be be penalise time and again by this labour government member across the house will be familiar with the winter of discontent in the year our chancellor be bear the labour government be at the behest of their union paymaster and refuse pile up across the country fast forward year we be year into the chancellor term of office and we have before we summer of anxiety we have long and seemingly hot summer ahead of we with the spectre of impend taxis loom in desperate and flawed attempt to paper over the financial chasm of labour own making the government be target the hard work people they vow to stand for what have happen in labour first year in office well my farmer be reel from the raid on their cash poor industry through change to apr and bpr national insurance and the withdrawal of the sfi to name but few the government ask they to diversify and invest in grow their business while simultaneously tax they for the privilege the carrdus school in south northamptonshire be close as direct result of the vat raid and the national insurance rise family who work hard and invest in their child education have be punish student have be displace teacher have lose their job and standard have be hit hospitality owner have say they can not risk expansion they be just about survive as it stand this year alone over pub across the uk have since april beauty salon and hair industry business in my constituency have be call in because they can not take on any more apprenticeship if thing continue as they be there will the british hair consortium say be no apprentice start in what legacy for this labour government pensioner in my constituency be hit first by the removal of the winter fuel allowance and they now face the prospect of be tax on their pension for the first time which be also terrible disgrace we have learn crucial lesson after year of this government they be the embodiment of the phrase fail to prepare prepare to fail they have have year in opposition to come up with plan and they have fail miserably they keep ask we what we might do be that because they be seek advice from the more fiscally prudent and wise side of the house more can certainly give you more the minister and government members rarely want to listen but raise these point on behalf of my constituent who have ask to do this implore the government if they want growth they must take this summer to think again about how to achieve it or it will be an autumn of anguish hard work family and business owner in bognor regis littlehampton and our village be feel the squeeze as never before labour stand on manifesto promise not to raise taxis for hard work people yet at the very first opportunity in the autumn budget they raise employer national insurance this be tax on job security and job creation it be tax on growth and tax on ambition the job tax one of the chancellor flagship failure have wreck business confidence it have make it more expensive to hire worker stagnate the job market and threaten countless job loss and business closure it fall on top of the employment rights bill which signal the return of style employment law that will far stifle growth as well as the family business tax high business rate and high wage bill in small coastal town like bognor regis and littlehampton where over of local business have few than employee every cost increase and every job loss be keenly feel across our constituency family small business hospice such as st wilfrid and charity at the heart of our community face an impossible position in their short time in government labour have become the party of taxation the chancellor have back herself into corner and more tax hike be undoubtedly on the horizon that be why thank the leader of the opposition for table this important motion work people in bognor regis and littlehampton and the business charity and hospice that employ they need to be defend from this government tax raid and that be what intend to do to stand up for the people of bognor regis and littlehampton today tomorrow and throughout this parliament call the shadow minister we have have an exciting and heartfelt debate commend for their speech my right hon friend the members for sutton coldfield sir andrew mitchell for wetherby and easingwold sir alec shelbrooke for basildon and billericay mr holden for salisbury john glen and for beverley and holderness graham stuart my hon friend the members for bromsgrove bradley thomas for beaconsfield joy morrissey for farnham and bordon gregory stafford for keighley and ilkley robbie moore for south northamptonshire sarah bool and for bognor regis and littlehampton alison griffiths the hon member for angus and perthshire glens dave doogan and for ynys môn llinos medi and the hon and learn member for north antrim jim allister we have hear some excellent speech from member speak with passion on behalf of the small business farmer worker and pensioner who have be hit by labour change its mind on taxis and do thing differently from what it say it would do at the election we have also hear two new phrase today thank to my hon friend the member for bognor regis and littlehampton we now realise we have to challenge the chancellor base on her flagship failure not her flagship policy with great passion the hon and learn member for north antrim tell we how labour tax on family business mean that small business be no long plan for growth they be plan for death the public feel they be mislead by labour at the general election they think those on the labour front bench be incompetent they think the prime minister be woefully out of touch and the chancellor be out of her depth and why should they prime minister who need multiple attempt to define woman and multiple attempt to define work person do not exactly inspire confidence chancellor who say that she will not raise taxis on work people and then hike national insurance cost work people their job and earning do not inspire trust our motion provide the government with an opportunity to draw line recognise the overreach and error in their taxation policy and give some hope to the maker in our society and those who work hard in our warehouse office factory shop restaurant and public service they could recognise the error in the treasury assessment of the impact of the family farm tax on those who grow our food and the trauma cause by the job tax for those who build our business those be the people who know how to grow our economy not the numptie on the front bench so why be the government intent on hold they back alas the chancellor think that she know good and despite taxis be at their high rate on record she be on the hunt for new taxis wealth tax capital gain tax pension tax council tax saving tax tax tax tax tax it be always the same with labour government the government strategy be to tax their way to growth but have to tell the chancellor that that strategy will not work no economy can tax its business out of existence and create growth tonight the chancellor start her new tax campaign with visit to the city for the first time it will not be so much mansion house speech as mansion tax assessment the chancellor will claim that the government action have bring about financial stability well perhaps but not in this country the government chagos deal have eliminate income tax in mauritius but give british taxpayer new billion tax bill and the government abolition of non dom status be boost the tax revenue of portugal and italy but will mean taxpayer here have to cough up billion year more to plug the gap as people leave the uk take their tax payment with they the truth be that the chancellor have do the complete opposite of her claim of stability she be the eye of an instability storm of her own making where nobody know when her next tax raid will come and who will get hit the hard second summer of doubt and uncertainty cause by this chancellor and tolerate by this prime minister labour back benchers know it they know all the time that the chancellor have lead they up the hill only to lead they down again the once in parliament tax hike the removal of winter fuel payment the blunder attempt at welfare cut and it have only be one year labour members be limp towards recess look at they mr deputy speaker napoleon troop be in well humour on their march back from moscow than some labour mp be as they make their way back to their constituency and back to the people to whom they promise so much just one year ago only to deliver oh so little no wonder people feel so let down but let we be fair some labour back benchers be go back with warm feeling reshuffle be come soon to clear away all the dead wood on the front bench oh so much dead wood and some labour back benchers have already have the tap on the shoulder they already know who they be and they be go home with great expectation of high office hon member ah no no spare thought please for the many other labour mp who have miss out they feel that they be give promise that if they do the right thing they would be look after now they know that the government have renege on their promise and that the change they hop for will not come for they be truly sorry but there be one consolation at least now they know how the rest of the country feel listen very carefully to the shadow minister he have clearly be take theatrical lesson from his colleague the shadow chancellor the right hon member for central devon sir mel stride indeed have listen to all his colleague during this debate and frankly they have quite some cheek they speak from the opposition benches yet they fail to reflect honestly even once on why they be on that side of the house the reason why the conservatives be in opposition be that they not only run our public service into the ground but have give up on fiscal responsibility which be critical for stability investment and growth when we win the election last year it be our task to restore that responsibility and fix the billion black hole in the public finance which be legacy of the previous government waste and delay interruption know they hate to be remind of it but that be the truth that be what we inherit as my right hon friend the chief secretary to the treasury say in open the debate we act on that without delay on take office at last year budget the chancellor act decisively to stabilise the public finance and lie the foundation for investment in growth after year of tory decline rather than shirk responsibility we take the necessary decision to raise taxis and make the necessary choice to ensure that our nhs school and other vital public service receive the funding they need to get back on their foot thank all the hon member whom the shadow minister mention in his sum up speech as well as my hon friend the members for glasgow east john grady for kensington and bayswater joe powell for bolton west phil brickell for rugby john slinger for alloa and grangemouth brian leishman and for loughborough dr sandher many hon member speak about the choice that we have have to make as government let be clear that while many of the decision on tax have be difficult we recognise that they have have consequence we take every opportunity to make they as fair as possible that be why at last year budget we decide to end non dom tax status and tax break for private school fee it be also why we increase air passenger duty on private jet raise stamp duty for those buy second home extend the oil and gas levy and choose to raise capital gain and inheritance tax it be why his majesty revenue and customs implement the big package of measure to close the tax gap that this country have ever see those measure will ensure that everyone include the wealthy pay the tax that they owe those choice have be the right one to restore the public finance and get public service back on their foot yet the conservatives the lib dems and reform who surprisingly be not here all vote against our finance act which start to put our choice into action they have refuse time and again to support the decision we have take on tax while refuse to say what funding for public service they would oppose as result the choice have mention and other difficult choice we have make such as the decision around employer national insurance have be necessary to meet our fiscal rule let be clear why those fiscal rule be so important and why under this government they will always be non negotiable the fiscal rule introduce by the chancellor last year be this government assurance to the market that we will live within our mean and pay our government debt they be not only crucial to keep debt payment under control but enable we to invest in the future of our country thank to the chancellor fiscal rule the stability rule and the investment rule we have be able to boost capital investment by billion compare with the previous government plan that investment will improve transport infrastructure deliver more social and affordable housing bring down bill through energy security unlock further private sector investment and most importantly improve the life of work people across britain by make people well off without our plan to balance the book and get debt fall our billion of extra investment would not be possible and taxpayer would see ever more of their money be spend on debt interest payment we have take the tough but fair and necessary choice to repair our public finance so that we can rebuild our school our hospital and our frontline service across the country as many right hon and hon member have say today if conservative member disagree with our approach maybe they can tell we whether they would cut spending on school hospital or defence or perhaps they can tell we which taxis they would raise instead rather than do that the conservatives and reform be compete with each other to inherit the mantle of liz truss they both blindly make unfunded promise on tax promise that we all know would force up interest payment for family across britain and cause economic chaos which would hit work people hard the british people want security stability public service that work again and more money in their pocket and only labour members and this labour government be prepared to take the decision that be necessary to make that happen question put jim allister gideon amos stuart anderson steffan aquarone edward argar victoria atkins josh babarinde

this house do now owatemi from march to june this year the ministry of justice hold public consultation on propose reform of local justice area the consultation seek response on range of propose structural change set to affect magistrate across england and wales among those propose change be the merging of three magistrate bench into single north wales bench to serve six local authority cover an area total square mile as the member of parliament for significant portion of the north west wales magistrate bench area this plan be of particular concern to and be grateful for the opportunity to debate it today the local justice system in the north of wales currently comprise three magistrate bench north east wales which serve wrexham and sir fflint north central wales represent conwy and sir ddinbych and north west wales cover gwynedd and ynys môn the north west wales bench be base at the caernarfon justice centre in the large town in my constituency magistrate be familiar with this court and with make the journey to that location to undertake their duty under ministry of justice plan however magistrate will be expect to sit at other court outside their so call home court between and of their time in some area and in more urban constituency that may not result in significantly increase journey time and distance but that will indubitably not be the case for individual in the north west of wales for example if magistrate live in pen llŷn journey to the caernarfon magistrate court would incur drive of about minute if the same magistrate be call to the next near court in llandudno as part of the to requirement their journey time would nearly double to an hour and minute and if they be call to the north eastern court in mold or wrexham the journey time would be one hour and minute or two hour respectively and must say that that be on good day commend the right hon member for dwyfor meirionnydd hope that be somewhere near the welsh but with an ulster scots accent for bring forward this debate and congratulate she on it speak to she beforehand just to ascertain the direction of travel do she agree that magistrate must know their community and the characteristic of where they come from so that they can well serve justice for the victim in other word the well they know where they come from the well they know the people they serve and then they can do their job be very grateful to the hon gentleman for his intervention of course this be what we talk about the nature of justice serve those community it need to know the people within those community and to reflect their characteristic to well serve the victim defendant advocate and witness in the process by which justice be see to be do the long journey mention will inevitably create difficulty we must remember that magistrate in this instance be volunteer many have other responsibility such as childcare and the care of elderly relative some will also be in work in other employment it be foresee that the change be very likely to result in resignation so my first question be this have an impact assessment be make of the potential loss of experienced magistrate the need to recruit and train new magistrate and whether certain group of people will be worse affect by change in travel time cost be another factor if an individual magistrate currently sit only in caernarfon court but be now direct to spend minimum requirement of at llandudno the annual travel expense claim be likely to double if they be allocate as be theoretically possible of their time in the mold yr wyddgrug court their annual travel claim would be likely to increase by will the minister confirm whether an assessment have be carry out into those substantially increase cost and the effect on value for public money want to turn now to the impact on welsh language service while the present three local justice area be easily group under the title of north wales it must be recognise that the community they serve be not uniform indeed the difference be most apparent in their use of welsh the act of union decreed that only english could be use in court in wales that be repeal by the welsh courts act the first piece of legislation to recognise the right to use the language of course legislation have move on considerably since then the north west wales bench serve the two local authority area with the highest estimate percentage of welsh speaker gwynedd and ynys môn where the welsh language be in daily use as community family and administrative language the magistrate court will routinely hear defendant victim witness and advocate draw from those community and from the town of caernarfon itself where of the population speak welsh that be just not true for the other two area in the propose grouping that be make clear in the percentage of welsh speak magistrate across the current local justice area at present speak welsh in the north west wales area in the central north area and only in the north east we must remember that the purpose of local justice be exactly that for member of particular community to administer justice in and on behalf of that community that mean of course reflect that local community for the north west wales bench this have result in the caernarfon magistrate court routinely operate in welsh indeed the caernarfon justice centre be the home of his majesty courts and tribunals service welsh language unit there be considerable concern that the hard fight for offer of bilingual service in english and welsh for all court user will be ill serve by the uk government proposal and that prospective welsh speak magistrate will think twice before apply for role thus far reduce the number of welsh speak magistrate serve community across the whole of north wales that issue be immediately raise by senior magistrate on the north west wales bench they ask why full assessment have not be make of the impact of the recommendation on the use of the language and the availability of welsh language service an addition be then make understand to the equality statement outline potential impact on magistrate use of the welsh language phrase as protect characteristic but frame an assessment in that way fail to consider the potential impact on the right of victim witness defendant and service user and fail to engage with the duty enshrine in the welsh language act be grateful to understand from the minister in her response to my letter on this subject that she be mindful of commitment under the moj welsh language scheme note that this include responsibility to assess the linguistic consequence of policy affect service provide to the people in wales and to undertake welsh language impact test during consultation while we wait to see how those responsibility play out it be clear that magistrate in the north west of wales do not agree that an adequate assessment of the cultural and linguistic impact of these change have yet be undertake in fact magistrate have go so far as to tell that they believe the moj have treat wales and the people of wales with contempt they be not alone in their concern as the welsh language commissioner have make clear after receive initial correspondence from the moj the welsh language commissioner office tell magistrate that the information and response provide raise more question about how the welsh language be consider within the consultation especially the allege failure to consider the implication of move welsh magistrates from caernarfon to other court across wales that be translation the commissioner correspondence add that they doubt whether the impact of the proposal on court user have be identify particularly for those currently serve by the north west wales bench be aware that the welsh language commissioner have contact the minister in relation to their concern and call on the minister today to respond in full to the commissioner as soon as be practicable in her response to my letter the minister note that the moj produce full translation of the consultation document consider its relevance to welsh magistrate court staff and court user the translation of such document by public body be in all honesty the bare minimum it be actually requirement under welsh language standard and in all honesty that be not the point here it be concern that so little attention have be give to the effect of uk government reform on the welsh language especially give the labour welsh government goal of million welsh speaker by of course this be not new as result of the closure of rural court by the previous conservative government since the proportion of bilingual magistrate who of course be able to work in welsh and english it be always worth spell that out serve gwynedd and môn have fall from around to just over as mention early it be at there be serious concern that this reform in the north of wales will far diminish the percentage and number of magistrate who will routinely be able to offer service in both welsh and english restrict what be the right in law as regard language for court user it beg the question of how effective justice can be if person be deny the right to justice in the language in which they express themselves well the way they express their emotion and feeling of course it be not only that this language be one of the two official language of the country in the case of caernarfon and very much in the case of the great part of gwynedd and môn this be the first language of the majority of people my third question to the minister be when will there be proper assessment into the impact of the use of welsh in court under the propose change after all let we remember that when dic penderyn be sentence to death in for his part in the merthyr rise he be try in english but he say from the scaffold arglwydd dyma gamwedd or oh lord this be injustice the proposal follow what have already be considerable reform in the field of local justice local justice area be last reorganise as recently as as have mention numerous court across wales have be close since include those in pwllheli llangefni dolgellau and holyhead with the operation centralise in caernarfon magistrate have endure more than decade of continuous change let we remember who they be volunteer who dedicate their time to help provide justice in their local community that be why they have come forward north west wales magistrate tell that they be regularly praise for their performance they say they have not be provide with any evidence as to why the propose change to merge bench in the north of wales be necessary suspect the moj may be consider follow the model of north wales police which be regional police force however hasten to point out that the force area operate community police across three sub region western central and eastern which reflect exactly the three bench as thing stand in north wales the betsi cadwaladr university health board also serve the north wales region in its entirety but the pressure place on it in endeavour to meet the need of its widely vary community be recognise as contribute in part to its being in and out of special measure in seven of the past year have couple more question will the minister therefore commit to ensure that the local justice reform proposal will recognise that justice be well serve by magistrate root in their community and uniquely to wales able to work in both national language will she also commit to redouble effort to recruit bilingual magistrate across wales so that bench can be fully representative of the community they serve to conclude the minister tell last week that one of the genius of the magistrate court be the local link and the fact that it deliver local justice agree with she entirely which be why secure this debate close by urge the minister and her department to consider the point that have raise on behalf of magistrate in north west wales and ask she please to respond to the question that have pose during this speech diolch yn fawr iawn let begin by congratulate the right hon member for dwyfor meirionnydd liz saville roberts that be my good attempt at welsh pronunciation hope do not vandalise it on secure this important debate on the reform of local justice area agree with she that the contribution of magistrate right across the country but in particular in north wales deserve great recognition in particular the north welsh magistracy be perform well and pay tribute to all those who make that possible this debate be timely opportunity to clarify the government intention to reflect on our recent consultation and to address the concern raise particularly those from wales shall begin by set out some context surround the local justice area and the case for reform local justice area be first introduce by the previous labour government as part of the courts act they replace petty sessional division and be design to define the geographical boundary for magistrate court administration however the landscape of justice delivery have change significantly over the past year or so the hard legal boundary of local justice area create inflexibility in the magistrate court system lead to delay and inefficiency by abolish local justice area and implement non legislative replacement structure we aim to improve flexibility in the system reduce bureaucracy and allow for more freedom in the deployment of magistrate as the house will be aware the government and the judiciary launch joint consultation early this year on what the replacement system for local justice area should look like want to be absolutely clear that that consultation be inform by two key principle first commitment to local justice of which the right hon member speak and secondly commitment to enhance flexibility for modern magistracy be pleased to announce that we have receive more than response from magistrate and range of stakeholder include legal professional local authority and member of the public be encourage to see the strong level of engagement with the proposal and the feedback that we have receive will shape the final outcome of the consultation want to stress that we be carefully consider all the response before move forward we do not approach this with closed mind this be genuine consultation and the feedback that we have receive through it will be vital in shape the reform although local justice area as they be now legal administrative boundary set out in legislation will be abolish this do not mean an end to local justice localism be at the heart of the magistracy we want to ensure that magistrate continue to feel connected to their local community and that local citizen continue to feel that their local magistrate serve they at the core of our principle be new system of so call bench structure of court group that will be use for the purpose of magistrate recruitment deployment leadership and training follow the abolition of local justice area unlike local justice area bench would not be define in legislation and would have soft boundary to allow magistrate great flexibility to sit in other court such court might actually be close to where they currently live but not accessible due to the current hard legal boundary and they might offer magistrate broad range of case and work than they currently engage in our consultation propose to align bench broadly with the boundary of criminal justice area which themselves be base on the boundary of police force area as the core business of the criminal magistrate court involve prosecution initiate by police force we believe that in most case this be natural fit where give criminal justice area will be too large to create workable bench be very interested to hear the minister mention police force because suspect that that be partly the driver on community policing will she recognise that north wales police have feel the need to separate the area into three highly populous area in the east middle area and one in the west which have much more scattered population because that well reflect what the community need that be precisely why we have consultation to reflect the variation in different part of the country in most case the criminal justice area and the area in which police force operate will be natural fit for bench but that will not necessarily work for everyone we be take sounding and engage with local stakeholder to make sure that these soft boundary as it be reflect local circumstance as say this be such vital debate and we hope to reflect local contribution in the final set of proposal where give criminal justice area would be too large to create workable bench we have suggest different model that retain current local justice area boundary for example create bench base on the very large geographical area of the dyfed powys criminal justice area in wales would be impractical analysis suggest that it would result in excessively long journey time for certain magistrate point that the right hon member make we therefore propose retain the current local justice area boundary in that case on the other hand where analysis suggest that criminal justice area could reasonably be use to structure the boundary of bench we have propose it be only proposal on which we be consult merge certain local justice area that be the provenance of the bench for north wales and south wales to reiterate the point of the consultation be to seek feedback on the propose model and gather feedback from magistrate and other stakeholder such as local leader about what will or will not work the propose bench configuration be intend as starting point for this exercise we be if can put it this way very much in listen mode be aware that magistrate in some bench include those within the constituency of the right hon member have raise concern about the proposal and as ever she be articulate in set out the concern of her constituent and the local consideration very much appreciate that she write to in advance of today adjournment debate outline those concern so that we could take they on board in the ministry of justice would like to reassure the right hon member that her concern and the concern of welsh magistrate have be and will be hear while can not at this juncture confirm the outcome of the consultation and some of the matter it cover be for the judiciary to determine not politician these concern and other express in the response to our consultation will inform our decision on the structure for welsh magistrate court turn to the question of welsh language impact which be incredibly important in this context as the right hon member have say key concern for welsh speak magistrate be the impact of the proposal on the welsh language this concern have also be articulate by other member of the welsh judiciary at the heart of it be the potential risk that difference in the percentage of welsh speak magistrate in the propose bench could limit opportunity for welsh speak magistrate or court user to speak welsh let take this opportunity to assure the house that this government remain firmly committed to the principle of bilingual provision of court service in wales and to the equal treatment of welsh and english in the delivery of justice in these court under the proposal all magistrate would have the chance to discuss their sit arrangement with their bench chair magistrate sit pattern would be decide on case by case basis take account of personal circumstance as well as business need welsh speak magistrate preference would naturally form part of these discussion it be certainly not our intention to force welsh speak magistrate to sit in other location to the extent that it would limit their ability to use welsh in court more broadly the proposal be intend as codification of current practice magistrate be expect to undertake most of their sitting at the court close to their home or work location the overall intention be to minimise as far as possible the extent of practical change to the day to day business of magistrate in their local area give the continuity in sit pattern and the continued provision of interpreter in welsh magistrate court we do not expect the proposal to impact the availability of welsh language service for court user in wales to answer the right hon member question directly and to reassure she full welsh language impact assessment will accompany any final proposal we will carefully consider the response we have receive from welsh magistrate and other stakeholder to see what the impact will be on welsh be speak in court and will put in place any mitigation should they be necessary we have commit to publish
