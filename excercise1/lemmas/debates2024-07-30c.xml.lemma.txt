irreversible pathway towards two state solution safe secure israel alongside viable sovereign palestinian state we be committed to recognise palestinian state as contribution to peace process at time that be most conducive to that process may associate myself with your remark mr speaker about john the doorkeeper who know that we have the same love of disco thank my right hon friend for his reply must press he far on government recognition of palestinian state that should have be starting point year ago believe that recognition would level the play field and kick start the peace process as have be recognise by so many of our european counterpart recognition should not come at the conclusion what will the government do if israel refuse to entertain any move towards two state solution which it have persistently and vocally reject know that my hon friend have press these issue which be of huge importance to her constituent for many year no one have veto on recognition as say we want it to be part of process it do not deliver two state solution in and of itself but it be absolutely right that the palestinians be enable to have sovereign state it be just cause and we will work with other partner to bring that about order can just say to everybody that member be mean to speak through the chair please look towards or the mic might not pick you up hear what the secretary of state say but do he agree that the immediate recognition of the state of palestine be vital to the uk commitment to uphold international law and norm vital to the process require to bring about an immediate and just peace and vital to the notion that diplomatic mean and not violence be the way to resolve the conflict do he agree that failure to recognise the state of palestine have have and continue to have catastrophic implication for the people of palestine as they face what the international criminal court have describe as plausible genocide the hon gentleman be right that peace will be achieve through political solution not through military mean but disagree that recognition itself will bring about peace the biden plan be on the table at the moment and we would like hamas and the israeli leadership to accept it that be what will give we ceasefire and get we to place where we can achieve that two state solution call the shadow foreign secretary may welcome the foreign secretary to his

intend to do call the liberal democrat spokesperson the secretary of state will get bored of continue to press he on the recognition of the state of palestine hope not to test his patience but know in my heart that it be what palestinians need to ignite hope two state can not happen without that hope to unite palestinians behind final cause that will stop the killing for good war have to stop but that be not peace peace be two state he know that netanyahu reject it so when he speak to netanyahu do he talk about the two state solution and in particular the recognition of palestine do he accept that if the uk follow the other country that have do this that would send powerful message to both the palestinian people and netanyahu let reassure the hon lady that raise this issue do not test my patience she be absolutely right reject and disagree with those in israel who say that there can be no two state solution if there be no two state solution there be either one state or no state at all

register for the horizon conviction redress scheme we have put guidance on to help people know where they stand whether their conviction have be overturn and if eligible how to apply for redress through the registration and application process victim will be able to choose from two option first they can either accept fix settlement of or secondly they can choose full claim assessment if they

preliminary payment of we be make sure that they can access historical datum from both the post office and his majesty revenue and customs to support their decision and the application we also recognise that with the good will and support in the world in few case some information may not be retrievable but assure hon member that even in those case we will do all we can to ensure that fair offer be make to sub postmaster who have suffer this terrible injustice this house be unite in the last parliament in its wish to see justice for sub postmaster in this parliament we intend to deliver on that call the shadow minister it be disappointing that have again have to ask an urgent question to get the government to come to the dispatch box it be also disappointing that neither the secretary of state nor the postal affair minister the minister of state department for business and trade the hon member for harrow west gareth thomas have respond to either of the urgent question this be clearly an important matter that deserve full scrutiny by this house despite early promise only day ago to give the house significant update only write statement be available one of the final act of the last government be to pass legislation that for the first time in history overturn hundred of conviction and set in train process to provide redress to the victim we make clear commitment that the victim would be able to apply for redress before the summer recess that commitment have not be honour although claimant can now register for redress to do so they need reference number that be available only to individual write to by the ministry of justice which have today confirm that only of the postmaster have receive such letter ask the minister when will the other postmaster be write to assume claimant apply for the most rapid form of redress fix sum award when will the first payment be make the secretary of state will acknowledge that we have conversation regard court of appeal conviction and those refuse leave to appeal that be not quash by the legislation what step be the minister take to ensure that those case be give assistance to overturn their conviction the last government also announce that we would top up claimant in the horizon shortfall scheme to minimum payment of how many of the thousand of claimant in this scheme have be write to to that effect finally where be the secretary of state or where be the hon member for harrow west who have be appoint post office minister we promise to update parliament before the summer recess and we have do that by way of write ministerial statement note that when the shadow minister be the minister he come and answer on most occasion for the government we certainly do not take that as an indication that the government be take this matter any less seriously than they should and that be not the case now either understand the frustration that the shadow secretary of state have about the number of letter that have go out but there have be difficulty in corroborate some of that datum understand that when he make that promise as minister he do so in good faith but it have turn out that additional physical check have be require we have have to access court document sometimes stretch back decade which have mean that there have be delay the ministry of justice have put more resource into that to ensure that work carry on at pace as the shadow secretary of state have note the website be now up and run and applicant can register on it be pleased to report that as of this morning people have already do so we hope that once verification check have be complete payment can be process within working day we understand that the question on the court of appeal be discuss at length during the passage of the post office horizon system compensation act the matter deserve further consideration and understand that the minister for postal service have have conversation on what we can do in that respect welcome the answer provide by my hon friend he will remember that when the select committee report just four or five month ago we note that of the budget for redress have not be pay out we suggest to the now shadow secretary of state number of measure to put into the bill to speed up the process those amendment be reject can the minister now assure we that he have grip on this and that we will now begin to see cheque in the post much fast order may just say that members should speak through the chair not to the minister as an established member of this house be sure that the right hon gentleman would not want to start on the wrong foot with my right hon friend make an important point we want payment to be process as quickly as possible data be update monthly on the government website we can see that in term of the group litigation order offer have now be make under the horizon shortfall scheme of claimant altogether offer have be accept of the conviction on the overturn conviction scheme initial payment have now be make to of those people we come to the liberal democrat spokesperson it have be say many time across this house but it bear repeat this be an appalling miscarriage of justice the shocking dishonesty of post office official find its match only in the bravery of the sub postmaster who stand up to they the liberal democrats welcome the legislation in the previous parliament to finally deliver justice by quash their conviction and we likewise welcome measure to ensure that those affect get the compensation they deserve however what we have see with previous compensation and redress scheme for the victim of this scandal be pattern of delay complication and inefficiency neither the post office nor the department for business and trade have earn the necessary trust from the sub postmaster to administer the scheme with that in mind the business and trade committee recommend in that an independent intermediary body be set up do the minister agree that it be now time to appoint that independent body to ensure that these scheme get deliver fairly effectively and without delay thank the liberal democrat spokesperson for their contribution we be concerned that matter be take too long we have be work with lawyer who have sign up to framework for represent claimant and we be look at way we can speed the process up there be issue in term of collate enough expert evidence to support the claim but we be look at how that can be accelerate on the independent process we be look at an independent mediation step after the initial decision and offer be make and ultimately an independent appeal decision will be consider as well whole number of individual out there have be convict and have pay huge amount of or back to the post office but because they be directly employ not by the post office but perhaps by their sub postmaster they can not get any redress they be victim of the horizon scandal equally as much as anyone else what advice can the minister give to people in my constituency of blyth and ashington who find themselves in those circumstance my hon friend refer to some specific circumstance that would welcome further information on if he can contact the department the relevant minister will look through those circumstance to see whether there be anything we can do because we do not want anyone to be out of pocket as result of this scandal community across the country be impact by the horizon scandal and one of those be wheaton aston not only do wheaton aston lose much love postmaster but it lose its post office will the minister look at the specific case of wheaton aston not just in term of that postmaster get compensation but to take up the issue with the post office to ensure that post office be return to the village will certainly relay that back to the department and we will look in some detail at that it be important that community have post office that they can access they be vital part of our infrastructure in this country and vital lifeline for many individual and we want to make sure that every community be serve as much as possible take moment to pay tribute to my predecessor marion fellows for the work she do on this issue throughout her time in this house be delighted to hear from the minister that there have be conversation with the scottish government regard this issue and look for justice and redress for sub postmaster how confident be he that no further obstacle will be put in the way of justice and redress in scotland by the scottish government follow those conversation join my hon friend in pay tribute to her predecessor who be tenacious in her pursuit of this matter we have have number of conversation with the scottish government and we do not want to see any difference between how this scheme be administer in any part of the country we be confident that will be the case this be national scandal and it be almost impossible to quantify the loss of trust in the government and the post office that have result can the minister set out little more on what the government intend to do to ensure that the information and support to make the application to the redress scheme will be there for every single postmaster who have be affect and every single one who have conviction quash the hon member ask an important question disclosure pack be be prepare for every claimant which will contain what we believe be all the information they need to assess whether they wish to accept the fix sum or to proceed to more detailed assessment of the claim the pack will include detail of their contract and remuneration with the post office detail of whether they be eligible for the royal mail share plan and any other information that the department can obtain that be request we want to work at pace with individual to ensure they have all the information they need to make an informed decision the minister will be aware that have long campaign on this issue he might not yet be aware of letter send to his department highlight issue with the current compensation scheme as well as call attention to issue with the original sub postmaster one of whom be my constituent chris head chris be one of the thousand of people impact by the horizon scandal and he have still only be offer of his verified claim will the minister agree to meet and chris to discuss these issue be indeed aware of my hon friend letter and all the work she have do over number of year in support of her constituent and the wide sub postmaster community be sure that the relevant minister will agree to meet she and her constituent and will make sure that request be pass on to he as the member for ynys môn represent lorraine williams and the formidable noel thomas who spend his birthday in jail for crime that never take place it be clear that sub postmaster continue to be treat appallingly by the uk government in the wake of the horizon scandal and make to feel guilty for the cost of compensation to the public purse can the minister give confidence to noel that the new government will compensate for the real human cost of the suffering cause by this awful scandal we do not want sub postmaster to feel guilty for claim what be rightfully theirs what this place have decide be their entitlement we have take measure to ensure that they will not have to foot any legal bill for take advice in respect of their application and we want to ensure that every potential head of loss be cover and adequately compensate for we want to make the process as easy and swift as possible for those affect be pleased to hear from the minister that the government will expedite payment to those people who have be extremely badly treat by state own entity in this national scandal will he do anything about those people who arguably know that the fujitsu software call horizon be deficient and yet still bring legal case against sub postmaster many of whom go to prison there must be some redress and go right the way back those who be responsible for bring case against innocent people in the knowledge that the software be deficient must suffer some form of penalty the hon member make an important point which have be raise on number of previous occasion we believe that the correct approach be for the inquiry to assess those individual particular culpability and then we will take forward its recommendation it be important that we see individual take some responsibility and accountability for their action the horizon it scandal be without doubt one of the great miscarriage of justice in our history while we can not change what have happen we must establish what go wrong will the minister assure the house that he will carefully consider the finding of the post office horizon it inquiry do he agree with the shadow secretary of state that there should be prosecution of those deem responsible we be take close interest as the hon member would expect in the evidence come forward in the inquiry much of it be shocking the amount of obfuscation and shall we say misinformation put out by number of individual be concern we think it be right to wait and see what the chair of the inquiry recommend in term of future action but we be committed to look at that closely and ensure that individual take responsibility for their action one of my constituent be about to end more than year of service with the post office with comfortable package but she be persuade to take on post office for two month she do so and then get catch up in the horizon scandal she have month of trauma try to prove her innocence and argue with the post office and then she be sack she lose the package and incur lot of expense speak to the previous minister about that my constituent have apply for compensation but she have be tell that she be not entitle because she do not have contract which she say she do will the minister meet to discuss how we can protect such people and ensure that they get the compensation they be entitle to and that we do not have this continual excuse finding for not pay people who deserve compensation be grateful to the hon member for that question where there be evidential difficulty we be look at other way of ensure that those who should be eligible be entitle to claim be happy to have further conversation with she in that respect thank the minister very much for his answer to the question pose make representation for the postmaster from northern ireland who have be fight for year to clear their name while it be fantastic that movement have be make to undo the wrong of this scandal thank the minister and the government very much for that what step have be take to ensure that compensation be issue to all postmaster across the uk in timely manner to avoid more delay and miscarriage of justice include for those from northern ireland we be work closely with the northern ireland executive to ensure that all the information require be verify and corroborate so that those individual in northern ireland who have be catch up in this scandal receive that letter as soon as possible build home before begin my statement know that the whole house will join in send our deep condolence and strength in the hour ahead to those affect by yesterday shocking incident in southport as mother and grandmother can not even begin to imagine the depth of pain and suffering of those involve would like to echo the word of my hon friend the member for southport patrick hurley in thank the police and the emergency service for their swift response our thought and prayer be with those who have already sadly lose love one and those who be now fight for their life with your permission mr speaker have come to the house to make statement about the government plan to get britain building deliver economic growth be our no mission it be how we will raise living standard for everyone everywhere and the only way we can fix our public service so today be set out radical plan not only to get the home that we desperately need but to drive growth create job and breathe life back into town and city we be ambitious and what say will not be without controversy but this be urgent this labour government be not afraid to take the tough choice need to deliver for our country we be face the most acute housing crisis in live memory with child in temporary accommodation nearly million household on social housing waiting list and less than half as likely to own their own home compare with the rent be up in the last year total homelessness be at record level there be simply not enough home those on the conservative benches know that but what do they do for year as my right hon friend the chancellor say yesterday they duck the difficult decision they put party before country they pull the wool over people eye by crow about get million new home build in the last parliament but they fail to get anywhere near their target of home year in bid to appease their anti housing back benchers they make housing target only advisory they know that would tank housing supply but they still do it as stand here today can reveal the result the number of new home be now likely to drop below this year unforgivable that legacy make our job all the hard but it also make it so much more urgent so today will explain how labour will deliver the change need to turbocharge growth and build more home will start with housing target decision about what to build should reflect local view but that should be about how not whether to deliver new home while the previous government water down housing target cave in to their anti growth back benchers this labour government be take the tough choice put people and country first for the first time we will make local housing target mandatory require local authority to use the same method to work out how many home to build but that alone be insufficient to meet our ambition so we be also change the standard method use to calculate housing need so that it well reflect the urgency of supply for local area rather than rely on outdated datum this new method will require local authority to plan for home proportionate to the size of exist community and it will incorporate an uplift where house price be most out of step with local income the collective total of these local target will therefore rise from some year to just over year some will find that uncomfortable and other will try to poke hole so will tackle four argument head on the first be that we be demand too much from some place to that say we have housing crisis and mandate for real change and we must all play our part the second be that some area may appear to get surprising target no method be perfect and the old one produce all sort of odd outcome crucially our offer extra stability for local authority the third argument be that we be lower our ambition for london be clear that we be do no such thing london have nominal target of almost home year base on an arbitrary uplift which be absolute nonsense the london plan have target of around and around be deliver in london last year the target we be now set for london of roughly be still huge ask but know it be one that the mayor be determined to rise to and meet he about this last week fourthly some will say that total of be not enough to that say ambition be critical but we also need to be realistic let move on to the green belt once we have target for what we need to build next we need to ensure that we build in the right place the first port of call must be brownfield land we be make some change today to support that but they be only part of the answer which be why we must create more strategic system for green belt release to make it work for the century local authority will have to review their green belt if need to meet housing target but they will also need to prioritise low quality grey belt land for which we be set out definition today where land in the green belt be develop new golden rule will require the provision of affordable housing with focus on social rent as well as school gp surgery and transport link that the community need and improvement to accessible green space let we not forget that the previous government haphazard approach to building on the green belt see so many of the wrong home build in the wrong place without the local service that people need under labour that will change increase supply be essential to improve affordability but we must also go far to build genuinely affordable home part of that must come from developer the housing minister will meet major developer later to ensure that they commit to match our pace of reform an active mission lead government must also play their role which be why be call on local authority housing association and industry to work with to deliver council house revolution this be not just nice add on but vital to get the million home build because we know that scheme with large amount of affordable housing be likely to be complete fast and inject confidence and certainty into social housing be how we will get britain back to building the previous government have to downgrade the number of new home that their affordable housing programme would deliver today can reveal that only to affordable home be due to be build under that programme down from their original target of in our bad case scenario some family in need of secure home will lose out how have they let that happen once again this government will have to pick up the piece that be why today be announce immediate step for the big boost to social and affordable housing in generation we will introduce more flexibility in the current affordable home programme work with homes england and will bring forward detail of future government investment at the spending review recognise that council and housing association need support too so my right hon friend the chancellor will set out plan at the next fiscal event to give they the rent stability that they need to borrow and invest we must also maintain exist stock which be why be announce important change to the right to buy we have already start review the increase right to buy discount introduce in and will consult in the autumn on wide reform we be immediately increase flexibility for council when use right to buy receipt in addition to help council provide home for some of the most vulnerable in society can confirm today that the million of the local authority housing fund will flow to they to provide new home this be what labour do these reform be key to realise our wide growth ambition part of that come from new home themselves release the untapped potential of our town and city which for too long have be throttle by insufficient and unaffordable housing it also flow from make it easy to build the infrastructure on which we rely so we will make it easy to build laboratory gigafactorie data centre and electricity grid connection we must make it simple and fast to build the clean energy source need to achieve zero carbon energy generation by we have already end the de facto ban on onshore wind but we be also propose that large onshore wind project be bring back to the nationally significant infrastructure project nsip regime we will change the threshold for solar development to reflect the development in solar technology and set strong expectation that authority identify renewable energy site to deliver all that we need every local authority to have development plan in place up to date local plan be essential to ensure that community have say in how development happen area with local plan be less vulnerable to speculative development through appeal yet just third of place have one that be under five year old this must change we will fix this by end the constant change and disruption to plan policy set clear expectation of universal local plan coverage and step in directly when local authority let resident down local plan ensure local engagement and be critical to make development that meet local people need while demand more of other we be also go to demand more of ourselves two week ago say that will not hesitate to review an application where the potential economic gain warrant it so today can confirm that ministers and will mark our homework in public report against the week target for turn around ministerial decision know that what have say seem lot but this be only the first step we plan to do so much more we will introduce planning and infrastructure bill that will reform planning committee so that they focus on the right application with the necessary expertise we will far reform compulsory purchase compensation rule so that what be pay to landowner be fair but not excessive we will enable local authority to put their planning department on sustainable footing streamline the delivery process for critical infrastructure and provide any legal underpinning that may be need to ensure that nature recovery and building work hand in hand we will also take the step need for universal coverage of strategic planning within this parliament which we will work with local leader to develop and formalise in legislation shortly we will say more about our plan for the next generation of new town because we know that this crisis can not be fix overnight in the come month the government will publish long term housing strategy to transform the housing market so that it deliver for work people these be the right reform for the decade of renewal that the country so desperately need we will not be deter by those who seek to stand in the way of our country future opposition members may say that it can not be do but once again will prove they wrong this government will build million high quality well design and sustainable home we will achieve the big boost to affordable housing for generation and we will get britain build to spur the growth that we need commend this statement to the house rise call kemi badenoch if you can shadow secretary of state aim for between seven and eight minute thank you mr speaker echo the comment by the secretary of state for housing communities and local government the right hon member for ashton under lyne angela rayner regard the appalling

be able to answer all of they certainly not in the time we have today so hope that for the question she do not have the answer to now she will be able to provide write answer within month and before the end of the summer recess so we can pick up quickly when we return for her department oral question the labour party have mandate to deliver what it promise in its manifesto as party which have govern for most of the past year the conservatives respect that mandate it be our job as his majesty loyal opposition to scrutinise its plan and ensure that labour be say what it mean and more importantly do what it say with that right to deliver its manifesto come many responsibility labour now have the responsibility unlike in its manifesto to be crystal clear about what it actually want to do to avoid prolonged uncertainty it now have responsibility to understand and address the concern of councillor and local resident it now have responsibility to explain the economic and allocate the funding that we all know will be need for this plan it now have responsibility not to be contradictory in what it be set out it must not make promise that any impartial observer know can not be deliver crucially it must not break its commitment early yet we be already see change to what it commit itself to on june the chancellor state that the government would update the national planning policy framework within day so why be labour now brief that it will be before the end of the year that be lot more than day they have just start and they be already change their target will the right hon lady confirm that the nppf will be update and in effect by mid october the deadline they set for themselves they be propose an eight week consultation over the summer holiday for their update to the nppf this be the third set of update we will have in year in the previous consultation on the nppf in we have response how will they have meaningful consultation which be what the legislation require that respect the input of local planning authority and other there will be legal challenge be they ready for they the government be propose multiple change to planning the nppf update the new primary legislation that the right hon lady just describe the change to nutrient neutrality which they have recently convert to and the nsip just to name few the right hon lady say she want to end constant change and disruption to plan policy that be great but how will she avoid create year of uncertainty and make it hard for local authority and developer to build new housing as all those change be work through as say to she the last time we sit opposite each other these thing take time and they be not as straightforward as she be make out the government will not be able to deliver their ambition unless they recognise that what be most interesting in the statement be that the right hon lady confirm she be reduce the housing need calculation for london can she confirm whether that reduction will apply to other urban area can she explain why she be reduce the need for city like london to build more housing when they have the infrastructure to support it why be she force suburban and rural area to take more housing when there be school in hackney such as de beauvoir primary school and randal cremer primary school that be shut down because they do not have enough pupil why be she do that the government talk about the grey belt in the planning framework it be very interesting have have quick look through it they define it but what do the limit contribution to the five green belt purpose actually mean in plan term if they be not clear planning inspector will determine that and we will yet again have more and more local opposition it be also interesting that the government be consider change to restrict the right to buy the right hon lady have tell we very proudly how she be able to buy her own council at least one certainly can she confirm that follow these change young people across england will still be able to exercise the same right to buy that she have in there be also responsibility to address the concern of councillor and local resident from my own constituency know that the reference to traveller site will cause some concern the fact that the right hon lady have stand up and say that many of the housing allocation will be surprising will make it very difficult for local council and local community to deal with where be the respect for local decision making we be not say that they should not be ambitious but they will have to take local government in hand when they do that they say they want to impose exact mandatory housing target on local authority we have the advisory target so that council could make sure they could do well not bad so it be wrong for she to claim that that be we remove mandatory housing target councillor have repeatedly tell they be afraid they will be force under duty to co operate to sacrifice their own green space to take the housing need that urban leader who be her friend fail to meet what will she say to reassure leader in place like bromsgrove wychavon and south staffordshire what penalty will she apply to local leader like sadiq khan who fail to meet local housing need requirement what happen when the mayor fail to meet even these reduce target that she have set for he the right hon lady have already let slip that she be ditch the requirement to ensure that beauty be key part of housing something be very proud that the previous conservative government put at the heart of our planning reform local people want beautiful housing now she be tell we that she will be replace what they want with requirement to meet million ugly house instead why on earth would they take out something that mean so much to local community people deserve to live in beautiful home the fact that the labour party do not care about that show exactly how it will develop its policy the government responsibility to explain the economic and set out how they will fund their proposal be also key they say they need to ensure that the nppf have new growth base approach but that be already in the nppf the right hon lady would know that if she have read it bet she have the chancellor effectively kill off some major nsip scheme on monday such as the arundel bypass be all the talk of prioritise energy infrastructure project just way of dress up these cut to other kind of infrastructure where be the economic analysis that her department have undertake on the housing market yesterday we all see the chancellor come to the dispatch box claim not to have understand the pressure on public finance and how it be all so difficult we warn repeatedly during the election that labour say one thing and do another it say that it be not go to raise taxis now we can see what it be plan the chancellor say nothing about the impact on housing so now be ask the right hon lady on behalf of the british people and local authority what it mean for they be she go to follow the same playbook pretend she do not know what it cost to build affordable housing or to change the planning system and impose more cost for builder homebuyer and renter those be just few of the question the government will need to answer be sure colleague across the house will have many more the government be in danger of choose the bad of all world not address the basic economic of housebuilde and centralise decision making when we look at all that it look like the million home will be distant aspiration rather than meaningful target let start by welcome the right hon lady to her place wish her luck for her leadership campaign now that she have confirm that she be run it be her ambition all along to be leader of the opposition not mine must say that she seem to be take to opposition very naturally think she will find herself comfortable for long long time on the opposition benches she have lot to say in her response and will come to the substance of it in moment she have already put in quite few write question look forward to many more from she once she have have chance to read and digest her brief after the election there be couple of thing that be not quite sure the right hon lady understand first this be critical the british people kick the conservatives out of office in landslide secondly why be that let remind she the government in which she serve leave we to clear up the mess they crash the economy and trash our public service they bankrupt britain and they cover it up they throw the book at the doctor and then they doctor the book she keep speak about the tories record on housing but remind she again that year after year the tories fail to meet their housing target she speak about the mayor of london and the bizarre figure they set for he but the conservative government talk of promise they can keep fail to meet their own target in every single year on the right hon lady question about the nppf consultation it start today for eight week we be ask people to engage it be an incredibly detailed consultation because we mean business it will come as no surprise that the work need to be do after the disaster of the last tory government which rip up the nppf and make right mess of it the right hon lady talk about the affordable home grant the former tory secretary of state hand billion of vital fund back to the treasury this government will work with homes england make it more flexible to get the home we need member of the party opposite you be just read you be suppose to be answer the question not just read out what have be write for you to read these be the answer to the question interruption no they be the bit that have write actually in regard to her question member of the party opposite be now talk to themselves and not the country the right hon lady mention chaos and uncertainty really do not know how opposition member can say that with straight face after the chaos and uncertainty that we have see with countless housing secretaries not know what be go on in every inner city area this be in answer to the question there be increase in the target remind member that we inherit the most acute housing crisis in live memory say to the right hon lady that the green belt definition be in the consultation document and suggest that she read it it also tackle the issue of beautiful home we will build home at scale and they will be beautiful we will protect the natural environment and we will make sure that people have the home that they deserve and need be astonish by what the right hon lady say about council and council leader the council leader have speak to be overjoy by the fact that the tories be kick out they say to that they have be leave in dire situation know that opposition member like to think that that be just labour council but council across the political spectrum have be leave in disastrous situation because the party opposite do not build the home that people need we have homelessness crisis in this country people under the age of can not get home now it be impossible for people to get on to the housing ladder that be the failure of the last conservative government and that be what we be go to fix that be what we be go to get on and do welcome you to your place madam deputy speaker also welcome both the ambition and the detail in my right hon friend statement and the commitment make in it have two question first if the target be not mandatory although in the last parliament the levelling up housing and communities committee say that they have to be many council will simply choose to ignore they but if they be to be mandatory will my right hon friend assure that they will be base on proper need assessment of each local authority and will do away with the nonsensical and arbitrary urban uplift to which she refer in the context of london secondly may ask question about social housing be proud to be bring up in council house as my right hon friend be will she work closely with local authority and look particularly at land value capture will she ensure that when the planning permission for site uplift the value of that site the total increase in value do not go to the landowner alone but be use to benefit the public purse and reduce the cost of build those home can confirm that we be get rid of the urban uplift the new method of establish housing target be well than the previous one which we believe be outdate the urban uplift figure be pluck from thin air but we believe that our new method will give council the stability and certainty that will enable they to plan for the home and local service that they need as for land value capture there be little bit about it in the consultation document but there will be more in the forthcoming planning and infrastructure bill welcome you to your place madam deputy speaker also thank the deputy prime minister for give advance sight of her statement and associate myself and my party with her remark about the devastating and senseless attack in southport our thought and prayer be with all those affect for too long under the conservatives we have planning system that put developer greed above community need system that do not deliver the home that we need to tackle the crisis but do destroy swathe of our green belt however the statement raise great many question so here we go will local authority that be at an advanced stage of their draft local plan need to start again with the new standard method or will they be able to continue will authority that have recently conduct green belt assessment need to do it again under the new system or will the current assessment stand there seem to be conspicuous absence of specific target for social home not affordable home but social home will the deputy prime minister take up the liberal democrat target of build social home every single year we welcome the government proposal to review the compulsory purchase compensation but will she take up the liberal democrat plan to put an end to land banking by reform the land compensation act so that local authority can acquire land at fair value we welcome the review of the right to buy but will the government allow local authority to use that money to replace lose stock the government indicate that they would be review borrowing rule so that local authority could borrow to invest will they allow authority to borrow to invest on scale that will allow they to put an end to homelessness overcrowding and housing register waiting list what power and resource will they give to planning authority so that they can enforce the requirement to put infrastructure first will they scrap the cap on developer planning fee finally some local authority in the london metropolitan green belt area even when they have account for all their brownfield site and all their grey belt site still have to build thousand of home on the green belt land which be suppose to have be design specifically to stop urban sprawl will the government put anything in the national planning policy framework that will give any protection at all to the concept of the green belt the answer to the hon lady direct question about local plan be that it depend on how far they have get there will be transition as we explain in the consultation document because we recognise that some area be quite far on as for where that be up to it depend very much on what the difference be between what the local plan say and what we have ask we have explain that in the consultation document as well we have to be fair to those that have already do the work when the work have be do it be just question of update it and not disregard those that already have local plan third of area have up to date local plan so urge all member to speak to their local authority to ensure that they have their local plan because that be how we ensure that people feel engaged and part of the process which be critical and how we protect green belt and other area by end the speculative development that we have be see the hon lady ask about the number of social home talk about the flexibility in the affordable home grant there be some stuff in the consultation document about the right to buy which recognise and about how council and housing association can borrow to bring up their stock also recognise the problem we have face as result of the homelessness crisis and be particularly keen to tackle it we have talk about compulsory purchase order as well and we be consult on that because we think that it need to be deal with we will deal with some of the other issue in the planning infrastructure bill planning will be strengthen we have already announce extra local planner and we will strengthen section there will be an accelerator taskforce to deal with stall site when grey belt land be release the golden rule that outline will apply and we will expect great deal from developer when they be use that land we be consult on fee as well there be lot in this consultation which believe will make significant difference to engagement with local area and ensure that we meet the housing target that we need and the country desperately deserve too many family be house in substandard overcrowded flat create through permit development right such as former office block conversion will the deputy prime minister give family in my constituency some hope for the future by confirm labour commitment to good quality affordable family house include council house under her proposal my hon friend be right year of the tories have leave social and affordable housing in crisis to fix our overall problem with the housing crisis we must have more social housing for rent the shadow secretary of state talk about speak to council but member here include new member will know how desperate the situation be from their casework from what be already arrive in their inboxe and their post and from what their local leader be say this be because of the supply problem and because we need to fix the problem around social and affordable housing that be why we have our golden rule and why we be go to strengthen section we expect developer to do what they say they be go to do and all our departments will work to make sure that the infrastructure be there so that people get the home they need locally and see the infrastructure that improve nature and their local area new forest district council have recently have its local plan agree on the basis of local housing need when will it be require to reopen that assessment on the basis of the right hon lady new algorithm and when will the target become mandatory the short answer be when it next update as say in my answer to the shadow secretary of state council that have an up to date local plan will not be make to start again commend the right hon gentleman local authority for have an up to date plan because that be the good way to have consultation with local area and provide the housing that local people need this government will work with local leader and mayor to make sure that we deliver the house that local people want and deal with the crisis they face congratulate my right hon friend on make superb statement she know that she will have strong support on the labour benches for build the home that we need in liverpool to tackle homelessness rise cost and the huge waiting list for social housing but council will be reluctant to build if they know that house will simply end up in the hand of private landlord who exploit the right to buy welcome her review into the high discount impose by the last government can she assure that it will be rapid review give the mess that she have inherit there be no time to waste in clear this up thank my hon friend for her question again the short answer be yes it will be rapid review we be already speak about this issue before the election we want to make sure that people take part in the review but we be also very clear that the discount that the last government apply to the right to buy formula in mean that council can not replace the house that be buy under the right to buy scheme we believe that people should have the right to buy but it have to be balance against the discount give to the public on our social housing stock so that we can make sure that we replace that stock for those who desperately need it quite frankly this announcement will be disaster for my hamble valley constituency over the last few year liberal democrat run eastleigh borough council have build double the number of house require by target and assessment can the secretary of state confirm that she will take into account retrospective building number for area that have already build more than their fair share why be she place even more pressure on local service in the south east where house price be the most expensive but leave city alone and not increase house number there too say to the hon gentleman that the number of house in city will increase the new method that we will be use be base on the stock and its affordability so ask he to look at the consultation we will be honest if there be particular shortage many area have particular shortage we have to build home we stand on an election manifesto to do that do not know whether the hon gentleman local authority have local plan but we will engage with it we do not have the home that we desperately need say to the hon gentleman that he should engage with his local authority get the local plan in place and work with we to build the house that his constituent desperately need thank the secretary of state for her statement particularly welcome the acknowledgment that where there be new development on green belt land it be necessary to have the facility that go with they what step will she take to ensure that local community can hold developer to account for the protection of our habitat and open space when they come forward with plan thank my hon friend for her question labour have brownfield first policy and there be very strict golden rule on the release of grey belt land we will support local authority to make sure that they get the good from section notice and that the golden rule apply the proposal that we have put in the nppf will strengthen the release of land which have be do in haphazard way in the past we will also see the affordable home that people desperately need in their area include home for social rent could the secretary of state confirm two thing first could she confirm that where local resident have comply with her mandatory target through neighbourhood plan rather than local plan the neighbourhood plan will reign supreme and will not be trample over by planning inspector subsequently secondly could she confirm that protect landscape what use to be call an area of outstanding natural beauty which comprise of my constituency but be now call national landscape will still have significant protection within the planning system yes can confirm that neighbourhood plan and the protection will remain which be really important again we be say that the release of grey belt land have to be for the benefit of local natural space we want to see area where people be within walking distance of such space many people do not have access to green belt area but we will protect they as we have always do there be no change to area of natural beauty park and so on as the new mp and former cabinet member for housing for what be arguably britain most successful new town milton keynes welcome today statement which be exactly what we have need to hear the struggle and conflict that we have have in try to deliver the housing that people in milton keynes need have be enormous and real waste of resource to be quite frank we need to build not only new house but new community will the secretary of state meet and milton keynes city council to discuss how we can help to deliver this essential mission so that everyone have place to call home welcome my hon friend to her place have visit milton keynes number of time and it be fantastic example of labour new town she have be quick to get meeting arrange with the housing minister and look forward to hear more about how we can learn from milton keynes and have the next generation of new town come forward welcome the consultation on the national planning policy framework one of the document that have be circulate to colleague today be the nppf with track change bury on page be footnote that say the follow sentence be propose for deletion the availability of agricultural land use for food production should be consider when decide what site be most appropriate for development that be in the exist nppf but the government be propose to take it out the uk be only self sufficient in food down from the when we be self sufficient be the government take enough account of self sufficiency in food yes and we believe that it be already consider in the nppf there be already guidance on agricultural land particularly high grade agricultural land so we believe that the protection on food be already there congratulate the deputy prime minister on her statement be slightly disappointed with some of the comment from those on the conservative benches but hope my right hon friend will reject they just as the british people reject they on july like the deputy prime minister and most people in england who have mayor be fortunate enough to live under labour mayor will the deputy prime minister work with labour mayor include her and mine councillor and member of this place to ensure that we get the right kind of development in the right place my hon friend be absolutely right what we be try to achieve today and with the legislation that be announce in the king speech be about how we strengthen local consultation have already say that only third of local authority have up to date local plan so this be wake up call for they as part of local planning and have local plan in place there be an obligation to consult and to consult again on the final plan many people be frustrate by housing that go up but that be because of speculative development and because there have be no engagement we have already meet mayor and council leader and what we be propose today be push that have come not just from local leader and mayor but from voter believe that that be why we win as large majority as we do at the general election people want to see that change we know that that engagement have to continue and that we have to work with local leader and mayor to make this plan reality and we be go to work with they to make sure that we get those home that infrastructure and the next generation of social and affordable housing that the people of this country need call mark francois thank you madam deputy speaker and good luck in your new role it be possible to have successful development but from experience it have to be something do with people and not to people this policy be the latter these pernicious top down target have the practical effect at ground level of set one town against another one village against another and one local community against another and give the chancellor statement on public spending yesterday who will pay for the ten of billion of pound worth of infrastructure that would be require to make all this work all experience show that on development and house building the man or woman in whitehall really do not know well why then be the secretary of state go back to the old fail way of do it which will not work be shocked to have to tell the right hon member that the nppf be an nppf before we come into government national target have always be there this be not something that have dream up the important thing be that our new method be clearly base upon the housing stock the affordability and the need in an area that need have create housing crisis in this country and that be why the electorate give the labour government such mandate because we say that we be go to fix the housing crisis that we have inherit again this be about local plan implore the right hon member to get with his local authority to get local plan to engage with local people and to listen to those who be wait desperately probably thousand in his constituency for home that they know will never come my local authority agree its local plan during the general election campaign and it be the first authority in the country to commit section fund to our local hospital as its deputy leader be very proud to lead on that see section funding as the most effective method of mitigate the impact of development and bring in much need funding for infrastructure how do the deputy prime minister envision section funding being reform to make it far more effective method of bring in infrastructure spending congratulate my hon friend not just on get to this place but on the work she do previously also congratulate her local authority on the work it have do on have local plan and on make sure that it get what it need out of the section provision she be absolutely right to say that that be important because section play very important role in meet health need whether it be gp service hospital school or whatever the infrastructure and it need to be strengthen we talk about that in this house and we talk about the golden rule that we will apply if grey belt be release but our department will be work to ensure that local authority be give the resource they need and the expertise from here so that they can get the good out of section notice thousand of new home be plan in king lynn in my constituency but that development require transport and other infrastructure so will the secretary of state work with the transport secretary and the chancellor to unlock the funding for the west winch housing access road so that that development can proceed again there be challenge that we have inherit hope that the hon member area have local plan for what be require and can therefore push for that infrastructure as part of its section will happily engage through the minister on that particular issue but be wonder whether the hon member be in the chamber yesterday and realise what mess his government leave we in call sarah owen thank you madam deputy speaker and welcome you to your new place thank the deputy prime minister for the speed with which she and her fantastic team be tackle the housing crisis it be welcome news in luton north where my surgery have be consistently full of people struggle in overcrowded housing and face skyrocket rent for substandard condition we also have daily case of people be subject to eviction notice through no fault of their own do she agree that the government new plan to build genuinely affordable housing and for this council house revolution to start can not come soon enough for town such as mine my hon friend articulate what many member across the house even opposition members will recognise as challenge that we face this issue have be duck for year by the conservatives and in fact it go backwards because of the change they make to the nppf last year that be why we make absolutely no bone about the fact that we mean to deliver that be why this consultation be so important and why we have put it out there now say to hon member that we intend to move at pace there be people in temporary accommodation and child who have nowhere to call their home think about that every single night and there be not day that we can afford to waste in deal with that situation for they promise those people in my hon friend constituency and in everybody else that will do everything can to make sure that they have home welcome the news of council house revolution and we all know that the deputy prime minister be little bit of an expert when it come to council housing but can she confirm that priority will be give to british family veteran and pensioner we have confirm that people with local connection will get priority over those home the hon gentleman try to make quip about the fact that grow up in council house but although people use to talk about my childhood as if grow up in poverty there be many kid today who would think they have win the lottery if they get council house those child today can not have that so we will build the home we will prioritise so that people locally can get they and we will make sure that first time buyer get first dibs we be put in place number of measure to make sure that the home that be build be there for the people who need they resident in hethersett mulbarton and loddon have sadly have their finger burn by the old planning policy that be in place under the previous government can my right hon friend give assurance that section will be strengthen to ensure that public infrastructure will be in place so that our new housing be accessible for everyone and give they the resource they need to live very happy life part of this consultation look at how we can strengthen section and we want to do that in conjunction with local authority as mention in my statement we be also bring forward at later date through this parliament measure on strategic planning and the planning and infrastructure bill this be the start of the process but we know there be lot more to do look forward to my hon friend engagement with that be no nimby but what we be see today be lurch back to top down mandatory target that will ride roughshod through local community such as those that represent across aldridge brownhills and through local decision making do agree with the deputy prime minister though when she say that the first port of call must be brownfield land so will she confirm that she will give full financing to brownfield land remediation and reclamation we think we can use brownfield funding well but this be not about rid roughshod over local decision and what local people want have mandatory housing target and plan mean that people will be able to decide what we be say and what we say at the general election be that we will build million home we say that clearly and we have mandate to do it we think that the new method for calculate housing target work well we think it will deliver for people and that include the affordability test therefore we will deliver the house that the right hon lady constituency need and would encourage she to engage in the process with her local authority rise order be plan to end the statement at around minute past so could you please help each other by keep question short this have to be the most important statement have hear since be in the house york have really suffer from the proliferation of luxury accommodation second home and short term holiday let so very much welcome this statement where developer have plan in the system what step can be take to ensure that we pivot to hit the target for the affordable and social housing that we desperately need right now absolutely agree that we desperately need affordable home it depend on where my hon friend local authority be in the process but we will be set out the target which be likely to be increase for her area so that the local authority can engage in the process the golden rule will allow more affordability where there be restrictive release of grey belt we will ensure that we provide support on affordability and that there be no gaming of the system so that we get the good we can out of section strongly endorse the sentiment and purpose of the secretary of state policy statement she will be aware that as other have say the planning system be fuel by greed rather than need cornwall be not nimby it be one of the fast grow place in the united kingdom and have almost treble its housing stock in the last year yet local people housing problem have get bad so my question to the secretary of state be this house building target be means to an end so would it not be far well in place such as cornwall if those target be set to address the need rather than simply allow developer to fill their boot that be what the new formula do we be try to assess the need in area take particular account of their current stock but also of affordability suspect that cornwall have particular challenge with that as well as part of that process we hope to strengthen the plan on section and the new home accelerator task force will help to get site move forward where they already have planning permission by work across whitehall we will also deliver the infrastructure that people want because that be the other big issue that keep come back where we have speculative site or the release of green belt or where there be large amount of housing in an area the infrastructure be critical that be the issue we need to overcome and we be clear on that as government in my constituency we be at the sharp end of the housing crisis and we desperately need more affordable home and more council home so really welcome today statement the conservative party may behave like this be zero sum game between build more desperately need home and protect the environment but labour members know that that be not the case what approach will the new government take to ensure that we have sustainable development so that we protect our environment ensure that we have the necessary infrastructure include sewage pipe and prevent flooding while build the home that my constituent so desperately need welcome my hon friend to her place she be absolutely right and her question build on one that answer previously we have to protect our green belt and the proposal we be put forward do that they also mean that we will have the right type of home and the infrastructure as part of this process there will be nature consideration and rule around that there will also be the infrastructure that people need as well as access to the countryside and healthy living my hon friend can look at number of part of the consultation that refer to how we be deliver well green area for people hopefully her constituent will be able to get behind that it be good to see you in that chair madam deputy speaker be not sure whether the secretary of state have discuss her proposal with the secretary of state for environment food and rural affairs or the national farmers union but the answer she give on food production be risible what she have announce today be effectively recipe for dispose of the land that will be need to feed our child and grandchild just before she go ahead with that will she tell the house how many planning consent that have be grant be sit there unbuilt out should we not use those first say to the right hon gentleman with absolute respect that he should please read the consultation we think that we do support our agriculture which account for just over of land the good and most versatile land talk before about protect the good value land and we will do that the land we be talk about grey belt which we define in the nppf consultation be not agricultural land it be disuse garage and thing of that nature and not as the right hon gentleman want people to believe the land we need for food welcome the twin ambition the secretary of state have set out today to get britain build in order to provide the home we need and to make sure that we have the infrastructure require to support they such as school and gp surgery those ambition be of equal importance and we can not have one without the other on social and affordable housing will she confirm that the aim of her package be to go net positive so that the number of social rent home rise rather than fall and to achieve that in the first year of this parliament welcome my hon friend to her place it will be challenge but we be desperate to try to meet that challenge as quickly as we can that be why we be move at pace with the consultation exercise we have put forward today which we will do as quickly as we can so that we can have the affordable and social housing the green space and the infrastructure that people desperately need welcome you to the chair madam deputy speaker and welcome the secretary of state to her new role appreciate that she will not have time today to wax lyrical about her vision of aesthetic or to expand at length on the relationship between truth and beauty nevertheless give the welcome reference in her announcement to proportionality and to the link between the exist build environment and the scale of development will she also take into account the character and style of development she may know that have serve on the building better build beautiful commission and in the office for place will she agree to meet the office for place to discuss beauty she will know that the wealthy can always live in beautiful place and in beautiful home but people from council house from where she and originate deserve their chance to know to sense and to see beauty absolutely agree with everything the right hon gentleman say the minister of state ministry of housing communities and local government my hon friend the member for greenwich and woolwich matthew pennycook will shortly meet all the stakeholder and think he have meeting in the come day with those the right hon gentleman just mention would love to work with he to make sure that we build the house that people deserve whether it be social affordable or any other housing it should be beautiful and should have character and style and we be determined to make that happen thank the secretary of state for her statement and for the focus she have rightly put on deliver genuinely affordable home which will provide much need housing security to many of my constituent recognise some of the immediate homelessness challenge feel by local authority will she detail how the plan she have announce today will relieve pressure that lead to homelessness and on temporary accommodation my hon friend be absolutely right to talk about homelessness and the pressure that local authority face this issue feel particularly personal because the number of story that have hear not just when be the shadow minister but in the role that be fortunate enough and humble to have now show that we can not continue with the homelessness crisis behind every single one of the figure be human being like poverty housing have significant impact on people life and opportunity that be why in my role as deputy prime minister will bring leader together at local regional and parliamentary level to ensure that we tackle homelessness we need to do something about the figure we have inherit really poor state of affair but be determined to ensure that we do something about that many resident in my constituency of waveney valley find themselves price out of live in their community as be the case in so much of the country because the home that be be build be not affordable for local people welcome the deputy prime minister statement on affordable housing but how many of the million home that she have pledge to build do she expect to be affordable in particular how many do she expect to be council home what action will be take to address the fact that we have million empty home in this country it be difficult to set out the detail at local level because those type of development be subject to section agreement that be why local plan be really important and we support that process refer the hon gentleman to the consultation document on the release of grey belt which talk about minimum of of housing be affordable again that figure will depend on local need we have to try to get the balance right if local area say we need but say well you be go to have then that be challenge we have say that of housing build on the grey belt must be affordable local area can then use that figure and say that they want particular amount of home for social rent the methodology and the affordability test we be use make thing much well because they give figure that reflect the reality for people in an area call alistair strathern welcome you to your place madam deputy speaker the deputy prime minister will be all too aware of the extent to which the planning system be fail community like mine it be not build the affordable home that people be cry out for not deliver the infrastructure my grow community need and not even protect some of the nature rich part of our countryside opposition members might not like to hear this but under the last government green belt approval often haphazard increase tenfold while brownfield approval halve will the deputy prime minister reassure my constituent that her golden rule will ensure that brownfield and greyfield site be truly prioritise and that infrastructure and affordability will be prioritise too so that we finally deliver growth that work for community like mine my hon friend be right to mention the haphazard way in which the green belt have be build upon under the last government although some of the response that have have from opposition members give the impression that that never happen be clear that brownfield should always be the first port of call which be why we have be make brownfield development easy under the nppf we will also take firm action to limit the scope to game the system and consult on how to stop developer who have pay over the odd for land use that as an excuse for negotiate down their section contribution number of measure include our golden rule will ensure that we push towards brownfield the release of grey belt have to be within our golden rule yesterday the secretary of state make the decision to approve the appeal by envar composting in relation to propose medical waste incinerator on the edge of st ives despite the initial application be reject by conservative and labour member of cambridgeshire county council resident in st ives as well as the impact rural village of somersham bluntisham colne pidley woodhurst old hurst and needingworth be hugely concerned that their opposition and concern have not be hear by the secretary of state give that nhs england clinical waste strategy state that there be need to reduce the use of incineration and detail strategic priority that require in house waste processing capability to be develop why have the secretary of state approve medical waste incinerator against local wish will she meet local resident to hear their concern thank the hon member for his contribution have not personally deal with that specific case but when we make such decision we weigh up the advice and planning expertise that we have and decision will be make base on the evidence we have it be an objective way of make decision welcome the deputy prime minister plan to put building home at the heart of our mission to raise living standard and to ensure that what we build reflect local view will she give an update on plan to give council great power to tackle the scourge of second home which put drag on our community and economy particularly in cornwall so that we can unlock supply through that channel say in my statement this be the first step but we know there be so much more that we need to do we have significant amount of legislation come forward about which the housing minister will be able to update the house the nppf be about make sure that we get the housing target in place but understand the point my hon friend make we need to address many more issue that we face in housing which be why significant number of measure be announce in the king speech an additional home be currently be build in maldon and heybridge in my constituency and liberal democrat control chelmsford city council want to build another at hammonds farm in my constituency yet the local road and health and education service be all under intolerable pressure so what will the secretary of state do to ensure that the necessary infrastructure be put in place before the development take place the right hon gentleman government be in power for year and could have resolve this issue one reason why we be consult on the revised nppf be because we recognise that infrastructure be critical as have say to many hon member today people often reject housing proposal because they do not see infrastructure that be why we have the golden rule why have ask all the departments to look at what we can do to ensure that infrastructure be there and why we will support the strengthening of section to ensure that developer do not try to squeeze out of what they promise as part of the development as my right hon friend have say this have get to be about build community not just about build home on too many occasion resident in my constituency have be leave for too long on incomplete and unadopted estate do the deputy prime minister agree that both the social and physical infrastructure must be deliver at the early opportunity in development and that developer must be hold to account for their delivery absolutely agree that go back to the point that far too often people object to development because they do not see the infrastructure and people see that in some case developer try to wriggle out of their obligation as set out in the consultation document we be put forward today we believe this will strengthen the hand of local authority and we will be able to ensure that we get the infrastructure we desperately need alongside the house the deputy prime minister have outline the dire need for house building across this great united kingdom and set out system to try to achieve that however there be the important issue of people try to get mortgage in the mainland those who earn year be have difficulty get mortgage but back home in northern ireland those who be earn much less say to have no chance of get mortgage what can be do to help people to get mortgage and thereby enable they to buy home and move forward the hon gentleman be absolutely right that we have to fix the situation not just on the affordability of house and in the general election campaign we talk about our proposal for mortgage guarantee scheme the new deal for work people which be come forward with legislation in october time will ensure that we make work pay the chancellor announce pay rise for public sector worker and we recently write to the low pay commission to expand its remit so that we will make sure that over million people get pay rise because job that pay will also mean people can then afford to have their own home lebanon with permission madam deputy speaker shall make statement on the situation in lebanon on july hezbollah launch series of rocket into northern israel and the occupy golan heights tragically in majdal shams one strike kill at least civilian young people one just year old who be play football extend my deep sympathy to their family and to the jewish community as they grieve for their love one the government be unequivocal in condemn this horrific attack and call on hezbollah to cease its rocket strike this atrocity be consequence of indiscriminate firing and pay no heed at all to civilian life this attack be part of an intensifying pattern of fight around the israeli lebanese border for month now we have be teeter on the brink the risk of further escalation and regional destabilisation be now more acute than ever at the end of my first week in office speak to lebanese prime minister mikati and yesterday call he again to express my concern at this late incident have also visit israel and discuss the situation with prime minister netanyahu and foreign minister katz shall visit lebanon as soon as the security circumstance allow we support israel right to defend itself in line with international humanitarian law as have say before it be in tough neighbourhood threaten by those who want to see its annihilation more than people include civilian have now be kill by hezbollah strike in northern israel and the golan heights and ten of thousand of israelis have be displace from the area while in lebanon more than civilian have die and almost be displace widening of the conflict be in nobody interest indeed the consequence could be catastrophic that be why we continue to press for diplomatic solution base on un security council resolution which call for long term solution base on the disarmament of all armed group in lebanon no foreign force in lebanon without its government consent and no armed force other than the un and the lebanese government troop deploy south of the litani river near the border with israel it be why even in the face of serious provocation our counsel be restraint we welcome the lebanese government statement condemn violence against civilian and urge the cessation of all violence we continue to support the lebanese armed force and the uk have provide more training and equipment to four of lebanon land border regiment we be work intensively with the united nations and our partner include the united states and france to encourage de escalation with our partner we will do all we can to prevent the outbreak of full scale conflict but the risk be rise therefore want to underline the government advice to british national we advise against all travel to the north of israel and the north of the golan heights and against all travel to lebanon there be frequent artillery exchange and airstrike tension be high and the situation could deteriorate rapidly my right hon friend the prime minister chair cobra meeting this morning and be work with foreign office consular team to make sure that we be prepared for all scenario however if the conflict escalate the government can not guarantee that we will be able to evacuate everybody immediately people may be force to shelter in place history teach we that in crisis such as this one it be far safe to leave while commercial flight be still run rather than run the risk of become trap in war zone my message to british national in lebanon be quite simple leave the tension on the israeli lebanese border be one aspect of wide crisis in the middle east across the region we see evidence of malign iranian activity in their support for hezbollah hamas houthis and other group whose action destabilise the region and who show scant regard for the death and destruction that this cause this government be commit to work alongside our partner to counter iranian threat meanwhile in gaza fighting continue the scene at the khadija school civilian kill and shocking image of injured child underline the desperate condition endure by civilian the report of the humanitarian situation remain sobering with the threat of disease and famine loom ever large this government continue to do all they can to provide relief to palestinian civilian recently announce new funding for field hospital run by uk med which have treat more than gazans since the conflict begin we have restore funding for the united nations relief and works agency provide million in new fund to the agency that be able to deliver aid at the scale need what be urgently need be an immediate ceasefire all the hostage must be free the fighting must end and much much more aid must get into gaza ceasefire would not only alleviate the suffering in gaza and secure the hostage release but reduce tension across the region help to prevent an escalatory cycle in lebanon and it would offer hope of renew peace process between israel and palestinians as say in my first appearance at this dispatch box as foreign secretary we be committed to play full diplomatic role in effort to secure just and last peace our overarching goal be clear viable sovereign palestinian state alongside safe and secure israel we do not want to see more civilian kill or more innocent life cut short but the risk be clear we be urge the de escalation of the current crisis while ensure that we be prepared if diplomatic effort do not succeed with clear call today for all british national in lebanon to leave immediately commend this statement to the house call the shadow foreign secretary thank the foreign secretary for advance sight of his statement this be indeed matter of profound concern and gravity for we all the tragic and senseless attack in the golan heights over the weekend must be meet with full unequivocal condemnation child and young people innocently play football with bright future and the rich tapestry of life ahead of they have their life cruelly snatch away my thought and be sure the thought of the whole house be with their parent sibling and friend and all those affect by this monstrous act the risk of further escalation across the blue line be real and the government be right to take it seriously we do not want to see widening of this painful conflict and the opening of new front would be in nobody interest if we be to avoid it all involve need to show restraint we should be crystal clear that that include hezbollah let nobody forget that this be proscribe terrorist organisation that have no regard for human life human dignity or human right nobody should be in any doubt about hezbollah intention towards the world only jewish state and hezbollah support hamas another proscribe terrorist organisation which have also inflict appalling suffering with the bad atrocity commit against jewish people since the holocaust and the second world war hezbollah must cease its attack right now that message must be aim at tehran too the government must use the communication channel that we have with iran to be extremely firm with the regime iran must use its influence to rein in its proxy and stop destabilise the middle east beyond stern word we must use all the tool at our disposal include tough sanction to disrupt malign behaviour by iran and its proxy such as hezbollah and to crack down on finance source and flow of weapon sanction must also demonstrate that terror group leader can not escape the consequence of their action the government must rally the international community to collectively reaffirm its commitment to the implementation of un security council resolution which be critical for long term peace if may press the foreign secretary on three specific point what step be he take to amplify the advice that he have already and rightly give so clearly that british national in lebanon should leave now what be he do in country to get the message across and to make information on how to leave quickly easily accessible what step be he take to look after the interest of the foreign office staff and other dependant in lebanon secondly do he have an estimate of how many brit be actually in lebanon thirdly what discussion have he have with key partner in the region who like we wish to see destabilising escalation avert conclude with broad point we be clearly at critical point in this conflict we could see hamas accept the deal on the table which would see pause in the fighting the return of the hostage flood of aid and the space create to bring about the condition for sustainable peace or we could see the suffering in gaza grind on and dangerous escalation along the blue line this be the time to be put maximum pressure on hamas as we have be discuss today and on hezbollah this be also the time to remain in close dialogue with israel and maintain our position as trusted partner that be critical whether for get more aid into gaza or for urge restraint by israel the foreign secretary will have hear concern in recent day about what many of we perceive as shift in the government approach to our close ally israel include in relation to the international criminal court he give an answer on that point at oral question early today we should make it clear that while recognition of palestine be important and do not need to come at the end of the process it equally can not come at the start of the process where it could be see as reward for violence and for terror hope that the government will not only continue to work to avoid an escalation along the blue line but maintain that close relationship with israel the trust and friendship that exist between the uk and israel matter because they allow we candidly to discuss all aspect of the current conflict with israeli counterpart at the very high level in addition to use

close relationship between our government and armed force and the lebanese army will he agree to meet small group of people associate with the all party parliamentary group for lebanon which have chair the all party group be re form as we speak but group of parliamentarian have be part of that one and it would be very useful for we to meet the right hon gentleman to discuss what more can be do

and the group because this be very serious cross party issue and know that all member of this house want to see de escalation welcome my right hon friend statement we must deplore the loss of civilian life particularly of child on either side of the divide so welcome his call for de escalation in lebanon and repeat call for an immediate ceasefire in gaza look ahead to long term peace and to two state solution how do my right hon friend deal with the comment of the israeli prime minister who say the other day that samaria and judea be an integral part of israel and that they be not occupy the west bank in that situation have the government not get to get on with recognise palestinian state rather than wait for the israelis to come round to the view that it be acceptable to they be grateful to my very good friend who have be champion these issue for many many year this last period have of course be of huge concern to he and his constituent be horrify by the degree of expansion that see in the west bank few week ago there have be more in the past year than we have see in year the violence be unacceptable and the tone rhetoric and statement from some member of the government be very alarming indeed as my hon friend would expect press these issue with both the israeli prime minister and the israeli president and we keep the situation in the west bank under close review thank the secretary of state for prior sight of his statement and share his deep concern about where the region currently find itself he will not need remind that in the immediate aftermath of the hamas atrocity on october the international community allow israel to blur the vital line between legitimate self defence and lust for revenge as result israel have act with impunity civilian be dead and gaza have be reduce to rubble what discussion have he have with israel and our international partner to ensure that heaven forbid should this conflict escalate far all those involve know understand and accept that revenge and legitimate self defence be not the same thing under international law so that we avoid have another civilian casualty in nine month time it be very important for to visit the occupy territory and israel within the first week in office we say this in opposition and we say it again in government of course give the hostage who be still in gaza israel have right to defend itself but it be qualified right it have always be within international humanitarian law the scale of civilian loss of life the child and the woman who have lose their life the aid worker who have lose their life against backdrop in which journalist be not allow into the country have be matter of deep concern and worry across the international community so of course have raise these issue it be also important to meet hostage family and to be absolutely clear that we want to see those hostage return call kim johnson thank you madam deputy speaker and congratulation on your appointment be sure my right hon friend agree that the escalation of violence can be reduce if we look at end the suffering in gaza at briefing that attend today with oxfam and medical aid for palestinians they talk about how israel be use water as weapon of war people have litre of water per day to wash clean and cook that be less than toilet flush welcome the position that we have take we have move greatly but do my right hon friend agree that we need to go much far and much fast my hon friend be right to raise the issue of water we have waterborne disease we now have polio setting in and of course we have have the famine the lack of desalination be very serious issue that be why it be important to take the decision in our first day in office to restore aid to unrwa to increase the fund available to uk med and to do more to open up field medical site across gaza we will continue to press the aid issue in gaza think it be also important that the rafah crossing be open which would alleviate lot of suffering thank the foreign secretary for his call for de escalation and ceasefire which of course should include the release of all hostage to ensure that we get more humanitarian aid in and two state solution but we also need to look at the flow of arm training and finance from the iranian regime to the terror proxy of hezbollah hamas and the houthis who be work tirelessly to ensure that there be not peace in the region do he agree that we should be help israel as much as we can to defend itself from these group and their attack my hon friend be right when we look at the scale of rocket fire and missile and the damage that they be do and when we think about these poor people away from their home in northern israel who have be board up in hotel for month and month it be important to have in clear view who be support these proxy and the arm and weaponry that be drive lot of conflict in the region include by hamas by the way for all those reason we keep sanction under review thank the foreign secretary for his statement obviously yet more death be tragedy every mother and every father grieve for lost child as do all relative but there be an issue here unless the government and israel and other accept the international court of justice opinion and judgment about the illegal nature of the occupation of the west bank and gaza and of course the illegal nature of the occupation of the golan height we be in danger of the conflict get much bad the un secretary general have call for restraint will the british government join he in do so will they also join he in try to convene some sort of regional peace initiative in order to prevent this whole thing from escalate completely out of control finally do the government reject the israeli occupation of the golan height be grateful to the right hon gentleman who know have take up these issue over many year in this parliament let be clear what see and what continue to see in the occupy territory be unacceptable he will know that the community who experience this violence in the golan height be druze in background and that this be occupation of the golan height do recognise that want to see de escalation across the board and solution along the line of oslo and two state solution be what we all want to get to and we will achieve that if we have an immediate ceasefire and get back to political dialogue and conversation call james asser be not down to ask question madam deputy speaker thank you call jim shannon thank you madam deputy speaker always have question laughter sorry humour be not what this be about apologise for that should not have say that thank the secretary of state very much for his calm and measured statement which encapsulate the temperament and concern of all of we in this chamber on both side the attack at the football pitch in majdal shams be deadly and full of complete evil child and young adult be slaughter will he outline what step be be take to find the perpetrator and hold they accountable and to ensure the message be send that these attack will not bring peace but instead further division what step will be take to assist israel whose very existence be under threat from hezbollah hezbollah be terrorist murderer of innocent and must be neutralise the hon gentleman know lot about the issue of terrorism and for that reason he have always use his position on the back benches to raise these issue he be absolutely right there will be many people in our jewish diaspora in this country look with real fear at the prospect of escalation and worry about their love one we have update the travel advice in relation to israel particularly northern israel and of course we continue to work in partnership with our close ally at what be very challenging moment illegal israeli settlement be imperille the future viability of palestinian state they undermine the two state solution will the secretary of state consider issue statement say that if israel continue to expand illegal settlement the uk will immediately recognise the palestinian state recognise the huge concern in this house and across the world about the nature of both the expansion and the violence have also say that recognition be important as pathway to peace and no country have veto on when and how we do that work with partner however do not think that bring those two thing into proximity be the right way to go about thing diplomatically and suspect that if we do we would struggle to find partner that would support we point of order on point of order madam deputy speaker may seek your guidance wish to place on record my severe concern about the government failure to come formally before the house on their decision to impose vat on independent school not only have they impose this policy through write ministerial statement but they have now say that they will charge vat on any fee that be pay in advance wms be insufficient and purposely prevent the house from debate policy that affect rural economy have independent school in my constituency but also military and special educational need family and both comprehensive and independent school madam deputy speaker how can you help we to resolve this issue which be incredibly important for so many in the house the hon lady have place her concern on the record and be sure member on the treasury bench will have hear they budget responsibility bill second read beg to move that the bill be now read second time congratulate you and welcome you to your place in the chair madam deputy speaker it be privilege to open this debate in my first appearance at the dispatch box as minister in this new labour government at the general election the british people vote for change and this new labour government begin work immediately to deliver on that mandate sustained growth be the only route to the improved prosperity that this country need and to improve the living standard of the british people after year of conservative failure this work be urgent it be now our national mission to deliver on that mission as my right hon friend the chancellor set out day after take office we must fix the foundation of the economy and restore economic stability she emphasise that commitment to deliver economic stability by meet with the office for budget responsibility soon after become chancellor under the legal framework we inherit from the conservative party there be no requirement on the treasury to subject fiscally significant announcement to independent obr scrutiny we all experience what happen when huge unfunded fiscal commitment be make without proper scrutiny and key economic institution such as the obr be sideline the country can not afford repeat of the calamitous mini budget of september when liz truss and kwasi kwarteng reckless plan unleash economic turmoil that have load hundred of pound on to people mortgage and rent conservative ministers put ideology before sound public money and party before country this labour government be turn the page we will always put the country first and party second our commitment to fiscal discipline and sound money will never waver that be why we be firmly committed to the independence of the obr and to the important principle that in normal time the announcement of fiscally significant measure should always be accompany by an independent assessment of its economic and fiscal implication in order to support transparency and accountability that be why we make commitment in our manifesto to strengthen the role of the obr and it be why we have act quickly to deliver on that commitment today this action will reinforce credibility and trust by prevent large scale unfunded commitment that be not subject to an independent fiscal assessment as richard hughes the chair of the obr reiterate in his recent letter to the chancellor it be good principle of fiscal policymaking that major fiscal decision should be base upon and present alongside an up to date view of the economic and fiscal outlook in line with this the chancellor yesterday commission full forecast to accompany our budget on october follow the important principle that significant fiscal policy decision should be make at fiscal event and accompany by an independent obr assessment that fiscal lock be an essential part of our mission to deliver economic stability it be one of our first step towards fix the foundation of the economy and it be our guarantee to the british people that this labour government be responsible government who will never play fast and loose with public and family finance as the conservative party have do before the bill set the legal framework for the operation of the fiscal lock it build on the budget responsibility and national audit act which establish the obr in line with that the technical detail underpin the fiscal lock will be set out via an upcoming update to the charter for budget responsibility the charter set out the government fiscal framework include guidance on how the obr perform its duty within that framework to support scrutiny of the bill during its passage through parliament the treasury have publish draft of the relevant charter text which will make clear exactly how the government plan to implement the fiscal lock full update to the charter will be publish in due course and member will vote on it in the usual way the bill itself do five thing to ensure that proper scrutiny of fiscal plan will take place first it require the treasury before the government make any fiscally significant announcement in parliament to request that the obr present an assessment take the announcement into account this build on the usual process whereby the chancellor commission the obr for an economic and fiscal forecast to accompany fiscal event it guarantee in law that from now on every fiscally significant change to tax and spending will be subject to scrutiny by the independent obr secondly the bill give the obr new power to independently decide to produce an assessment if they judge that the fiscal lock have be trigger if fiscally significant announcement be make without the treasury have previously request forecast from the obr the obr be require to inform the treasury committee of its opinion and then prepare an assessment as soon as be practicable that mean that come what may the obr through parliament will be able to hold the government to account thirdly the bill define measure or combination of measure as fiscally significant if they exceed specified percentage of gdp with the charter then set the precise threshold itself set the threshold in this way provide clarity for both the obr and external stakeholder about what constitute fiscally significant be when the fiscal lock have be trigger and it ensure that the government can set it at the right level go forward recognise economic condition the threshold level will be set at announcement of at least of nominal gdp in the late obr forecast as an example this year the threshold would be billion this will ensure that we properly capture any announcement that resemble the growth plan of former member liz truss and kwasi kwarteng in with the broad risk to macroeconomic stability that this entail fourthly the bill ensure that the fiscal lock do not apply to government respond to emergency such as the pandemic the bill do so by not apply in respect of measure that be intend to have temporary effect and which be in response to an emergency the charter will define temporary as any measure that be intend to end within two year this recognise that it be sometimes reasonable for example during pandemic for the government to act quickly and decisively without an obr assessment if that be need in response to shock of course in emergency it may be appropriate for the chancellor to commission forecast from the obr to follow measure that need to be announce or implement rapidly and that would happen in the usual way alongside any such announcement the treasury will be require to make it clear why it consider the situation to be an emergency as set out in the update charter the obr will have the discretion to trigger the fiscal lock and prepare report if it reasonably disagree fifthly and finally the bill require the government to publish any update to the detail of the fiscal lock such as the threshold level at which it be trigger in draft form at least day before the update charter be lay before parliament this be an essential safeguard in the bill prevent any future government from choose to ignore the fiscal lock by update the charter without the consent of parliament the minister be set out the stark reality of where we be financially which it be important that we all understand give that the financial position of all of we within the united kingdom could be fairly dramatically change regionally it will be important that discussion with the northern ireland assembly the welsh assembly and the scottish parliament take place early enough for the impact of what might happen to be well understand thank the hon gentleman for his contribution as be sure he know the chief secretary to the treasury be traditionally the lead minister in government for relationship with the finance ministers in the devolved government have already meet number of time with counterpart in the northern ireland executive as well as those in scotland and wales look forward to meet they in person in northern ireland hope in september for further such discussion to conclude people across the country be still suffer the consequence of the conservative party economic experiment in conservative ministers take the most reckless decision without any thought for their real life impact on the british economy and on family finance astonishingly they have still make no apology with this labour government our commitment to fiscal discipline and sound money be the bedrock of our plan the budget responsibility bill guarantee in law that from now on every fiscally significant change to tax and spending will be subject to scrutiny by the independent obr the bill will reinforce credibility and trust by prevent large scale unfunded commitment that be not subject to the scrutiny of an obr fiscal assessment this deliver on key manifesto commitment to provide economic stability and sound public finance by strengthen the role of the independent obr this be crucial first step to fix the foundation in our economy so that we can achieve sustained economic growth and make every part of the country well off for those reason commend the bill to the house madam deputy speaker congratulation on your election let take my first opportunity to congratulate the right hon and hon member in the new treasury ministerial team who have take up some of the good job in government love every minute of my time in the treasury even when have to come to this place to face my shadow will always be grateful to the official who so ably support and the team as the member of parliament for grantham the home of our country first female prime minister congratulate our country first female chancellor it be right that we highlight that while the two be not politically align we can all recognise when ceiling have be shatter and no matter who be break it we certainly recognise that on this side of the house the bill before we seek to amend the budget responsibility and national audit act bill introduce by conservative chancellor that create the office for budget responsibility the bill should be understand in that context build on previous bill that replace the system where his majesty treasury would produce its own forecast and the chancellor of the exchequer would essentially mark their own homework back then that be an essential piece of legislation give what have go on before between and the then labour government so call forecast for growth in the economy be out by an average of billion and their forecast for the budget deficit three year ahead be out by an average of billion their forecast therefore lack any credibility at all it be not just their forecast that lead to the creation of the obr it be their management of the economy much have already be say by the shadow chancellor about the high inflation high deficit and high unemployment that the conservatives inherit from labour in what be however sometimes forget be that total public spending account for almost half the national income when labour last leave office welfare spending balloon by staggering and that runaway spending mean that we inherit the large budget deficit of any economy in europe with the sole exception of ireland the idea that labour have an unblemished record when it come to the public finance be therefore plain wrong we conservative create the obr in parliament to guard against labour fiscal unaccountability and recklessness with the public finance we continue to support the role of the obr in provide open fully transparent independent forecast for all to see no matter who be in government it be genuinely good to hear that the chancellor recognise the importance of the obr when she say that because of the obr in her word you do need to win an election to find out the state of public finance she be absolutely right about that that be why yesterday suppose revelation simply will wash in fact if she be so supportive of the obr ask simple question why be yesterday statement base on internal treasury analysis not obr analysis surely if they be very supportive of the obr they would have ask the obr to conduct the analysis the obr have always say that it would be ready to produce analysis at any time on short notice that be yesterday and today we be here to talk about the bill before we while we be supportive of the obr we think it be right that the house should consider number of concern that we have on which we will seek clarification first the bill will require the treasury to request and the obr to produce report on fiscally significant measure announce by the government with the exception of temporary emergency measure the definition of these significant temporary and be set out in charter for budget responsibility as the chief secretary outline the draft charter text publish alongside the bill deem measure to be fiscally significant if they cost the equivalent of of gdp in any financial year it define as temporary any measure intend to end within two year and the draft charter text give the obr discretion to reasonably disagree with the treasury interpretation of what constitute emergency despite some of the rhetoric we note that nowhere in the bill or the surround document be the obr empower to prevent government from take fiscally significant action of any kind the effect of this bill be to ensure that an obr costing accompany any fiscally significant action the government take nothing more nothing less the way in which the chancellor describe this bill as so call lock to prevent certain activity be to be generous on my first outing overly ambitious the bill be describe as introduce fiscal lock which the chancellor promise will prevent large scale unfunded commitment but that be not what it do there be no fiscal lock and if anything it be forecast lock the potential impact of the bill be so limited and specific as to lead some to wonder whether for all the animate hyperbole of the chancellor yesterday this be the prioritisation of gimmick over govern despite what the prime minister say on the king speech secondly and say this genuinely constructively the government need to be well prepared to clarify what be mean by emergency the draft charter give the obr the power to reasonably disagree with the government interpretation of what be an emergency but this raise question about whether the obr be equip to make such decision in the first place what count as an emergency should mostly be clear cut but what about instance that be less obvious or when unforeseen circumstance come down the track the obr would then be stray into political decision making which would rightly raise constitutional issue even if it be ultimately for minister to decide on such matter any result disagreement between the government and the obr about whether the circumstance amount to an emergency could undermine the credibility of the government the obr or both be genuinely perplex whether the hon gentleman be with the former member for south west norfolk who want to see the obr abolish and not part of any decision making or feel that the bill do not go far enough either way do he recognise and accept as thousand of mortgage payer in this country now do the disaster of the previous conservative prime minister budget the impact it have have and the need never to go back to those day we support the obr have be clear on that we create the obr so to suggest that we do not support it be incorrect would just pull the hon member up on some economic fact the reason interest rate be so high and mortgage go up be that we face global challenge which this government will now experience in office the government have to deal with event and what cause inflation around the world be two thing the war in ukraine which push up wholesale gas price to record high and the fallout from once in century pandemic that the labour party seem to have forget about those two factor result in inflation which result in the chancellor and prime minister at the time prioritise bring down inflation which we do to we have now hand this government inflation half the deficit we inherit in half the unemployment and the fast growth in the so it be little bit rich to suggest that we take lesson from the labour party on economic performance our third and final concern we have other but be in keep this short on second reading be that in the event that the lock be trigger the obr do not need to produce one of its standard report even though the treasury under the bill be require to request such report to avoid break the lock the bill create therefore the possibility of an entirely new obr report which be not envisage by the original act would be grateful if the exchequer secretary explain that and what it mean in practice when he sum up although standard obr report must be publish it be not clear whether that apply to other report that the obr may prepare if this requirement do not apply be the government happy to give the obr the power to decide whether its costing be publish that be potentially very concern for transparency the official opposition look forward to more detailed scrutiny of the bill and its practical implication be in no doubt we support the obr which we create to bring in much need transparency to our fiscal framework after year of fiscal folly and false promise by the labour party at the same time let we not pretend that the obr should be the ultimate judge of good policy that nothing bad can happen under its watchful eye and that nothing good can happen beyond its gaze labour member know this it be precisely what they argue year ago when we first debate the bill that lead to the obr creation the obr should not become too political it should be referee not player in the fight for fiscal accountability in the end we stand by the principle that the british people through their elect representative should always have the decide say on public policy we look forward to debate this far in the month ahead we will not be vote against this bill on second reading look forward to the debate feel as though be almost in alice in wonderland world when listen to the opposition response to this legislation certainly feel concerned that they with the cheshire cat and possibly follow the queen of hearts might have be try to pretend that their previous conservative prime minister do not exist or indeed that the former member for spelthorne be never ever the chancellor those of we pay for mortgage and declare direct interest know all too well that they be in charge and about the damage that they do with their disastrous mini budget which be why this legislation be so important would wager that that what their constituent would tell they if they suggest that the economic harm the previous government do to this country for which we will all be pay for generation to come be solely to do with ukraine or the pandemic that mini budget be political choice but bad than that it be politically uninformed choice the government at the time consciously and purposefully make the decision on ideological ground to press ahead with budget that cost of our gdp and to hell with the consequence as we have all see that be why this legislation be so important will always welcome sinner who repenteth so be pleased that the shadow minister recognise the value of independent scrutiny and indeed urge we all to go far we will always welcome such an approach because it be right and because our constituent deserve well because we can see how bad thing be and how break this country be what this bill have at its heart be the fund to repair the damage do by the previous administration that be why the chief secretary to the treasury be here today with this bill to be clear with we about why it matter why we put thing on the book and why sound money be at the heart of it the market do not react by accident and put up all our mortgage they see with terror the damage that bad leadership in the treasury can do and have accordingly ask we to meet that challenge frankly there be nothing progressive about crash the economy and that be exactly what the previous government do by put on the record the need to report independently on fiscally significant measure we be start with clean sheet and say that we will not take such reckless approach with other people money at the end of the day that be what this be the tax revenue that be generate be the money of our constituent and it be therefore right that we be careful about how we administer they however recognise that there be challenge in this legislation be speak today because hope to hear from the ministers on the front bench further clarity about the concept of fiscally significant as somebody who have always like to be hawkish about public money think it be important that we be clear where we be invest and very much urge the treasury to think about invest to save see in our break society the damage that be do by poverty poor public service and the high cost that come with that so want we to be clear about the funding we have where it be come from and why every penny matter as the hon lady know the new government have intimate that they may decide to mirror much new eu legislation which could well have budgetary consequence she and have not quite always see eye to eye on europe but do she agree in that context that it be actually bad mistake to do what the government want to do tonight and abolish the european scrutiny committee the right hon member pre empt many of my concern there be very strong story to tell about good fiscal discipline but it be not possible to do that independently in modern global economy so the scrutiny that we can provide in this place of whole range of regulation do matter those include financial regulation think particularly about the city and issue around financial transaction tax for example have not yet convince he of the merit of work more closely with europe but be confident that one day we can do so agree with he however that this house should be fully part of that just as believe in the principle behind the bill that disinfectant come from transparency and our ability to see what be go on that be why the government be so right to bring this legislation forward let move on to some area where it be right to ask what we mean by fiscally significant the right hon member and might disagree about the deal we do in reset our relationship with europe but there can be no doubt that that will have clear economic impact on this country think of the haulier who be consider whether they will give up bring good to the uk because of the brexit border tax the previous government admit that that measure be inflationary and could have significant impact not just on our food security but on our economy push up the cost of living many of our constituent know that there be still too much month at the end of their money and we should challenge any measure that make that hard that will also inflect our tax take the point be get to be that if we be talk about measure that be so fiscally significant that they count for of gdp trade deal would easily meet that criterion we need to be clear in the bill what we ask of the office for budget responsibility which after all have provide evidence on the impact for example of leave the european union and whether we consider its role in such matter if we be go to put everything on the book let we make sure that the public understand fully the decision that we make and where the information come from another area in which we as house need to act be our outgoing especially when we be be ask to make very difficult choice about some of the most vulnerable in our community such as people who rely on welfare or pensioner who rely on the winter fuel payment we have to be honest this country be pretty much bankrupt as result of the previous administration if somebody in that dire financial position come into one of our surgery we would sit with they and talk about debt relief order we would look at their cost and particularly at consolidate the debt that they may have many colleague here will know that for many year have be concern about legal loan sharking that be not just in people private life but in the public sector and consider the private finance initiative to be the legal loan sharking of the public sector if we be talk about fiscally significant measure measure that meet the test of billion we should consider that we have billion of outgoing commit to private finance company in this country against billion worth of asset most people can see that those figure do not add up local authority spend around billion every two to five year on pfi repayment of which about billion be interest cost that would suggest an average interest rate of around if somebody come into surgery with loan at interest rate we would encourage they to go to debt relief order our country be no different and this matter because individually local authority might not meet that fiscally significant threshold but collectively they will for we we be not go to let hospital and school go bust and go out of business parkland high school in liverpool be build under pfi it be close because there be not demand for the place but liverpool city council be still play day for that closed school it have repayment of million leave and the company that own it be make profit of around year from the scheme private finance company be on our book and they should be on our book nationally they should be consider fiscally significant we can do thing to consolidate those loan and to reduce the outgoing that will come my contribution to the bill and the amendment that might table depend on what minister say will relate to the fact that think we need to be clear that everything that be fiscally significant decision that we might not proceed with and one that we do should be subject to that level of scrutiny the national audit office have give we plenty of information about the poor value for money of private finance initiative many member who have these school and hospital in their constituency will have see this at first hand there be evidence from the department of health and social care about what could be do to consolidate loan that probably would generate saving that would be fiscally significant when we talk about the sum involve it would be fantastic to see the office for budget responsibility pick this matter up as part of our know how much we have to pay out as country how much of contribution we need to make this money be go to private company that on the whole be not pay tax in this country so it be not generate revenue that can go back into pay for the repair that need to come the previous government start to look at these issue and then walk away know that this government with their commitment to fiscal discipline and fiscal transparency will want to be open about the benefit cost and fiscal significance both of the trade deal that we might make and of private finance initiative look forward to hear from ministers about that this be very different the shadow minister be smile be sure that he miss his colleague from spelthorne but know he will not miss the opportunity to say sorry to all our constituent for the mess we have be leave in and the reason why we need this legislation on the discipline of the obr and for the failure to tackle the long term problem that have leave legal loan shark and poor trading opportunity for our constituent because they be go to pick up the piece for generation to come call the liberal democrat spokesperson it be pleasure to see you in the chair madam deputy speaker congratulation on your election the liberal democrats understand the importance of stable economy to the wellbeing of our nation and we will support the bill as it make its way through parliament we have see the effect of the chaos and uncertainty work by the previous conservative government in their horrendous mismanagement of the economy and we know that future prosperity can be build only on firm foundation the former member for south west norfolk may have intervene to prevent official from use the phrase disastrous mini budget in the king speech document but this be disaster for which many million across the country continue to pay the price liberal democrat mps have be return to this house in great number than ever before because we understand how much our constituent have suffer from the increase in mortgage payment high fuel bill and escalate food price that result from the disastrous mini budget we will do all we can to tackle the cost of live crisis be feel by so many and we welcome the new government commitment to build strong platform for economic growth we welcome the bill as symbol of strengthen fiscal responsibility and transparency which we hope will prevent repeat of the conservatives disastrous mini budget under liz truss from ever happen again after the turmoil of the outgoing conservative government we welcome the seriousness of intent from this government as they rebuild trust with the financial market and the business and financial sector as whole the financial irresponsibility and unfunded tax cut in the mini budget send mortgage rate soar and continue pattern of low growth fall living standard and business uncertainty under the conservatives million of people across the country continue to see the devastating impact of their disastrous governance in their food and energy bill and to feel its heavy burden in their personal finance recent report from the institute for fiscal studies show that people have be push into poverty because of mortgage interest rate rise cause by the incompetence of the previous conservative government it have be devastating to hear the story of so many household drag into poverty and to know that so many family be struggle under the bad cost of live crisis in generation it be painful to reflect on the thousand of people who be hop to make progress in their life and improve the circumstance of their family but find themselves pull backwards by the weight of the cost now pile upon they the ifs report tell we that the number of adult unable to keep their home warm enough increase from million in to million in the ifs attribute that increase to the rise in mortgage interest rate during that period the statistic lay bare in sham detail the enormous and ongoing impact that the conservatives disastrous mini budget have on all our life the positive response that this bill have evoke from the broad business and finance sector be indicative of the desire for industry stability we welcome the engagement from economist and industry expert who advise of the bill beneficial impact on confidence in public finance even the former chancellor the right hon member for godalming and ash jeremy hunt have acknowledge that he be minded to support the bill we will carefully scrutinise its detail to ensure that it will achieve its intend aim in particular we will look closely at the threshold for fiscally significant measure set out in the legislation as measure worth at least of gdp or approximately billion and will consider whether that provision could be circumvent by government announce major change just below that threshold the propose term set substantial threshold that would have to be reach before the obr could insist on intervene that raise question about how easy it would be for government to skirt the rule and avoid scrutiny from the watchdog we understand that the bar have be set relatively high to prevent large scale irresponsible fiscal event such as the disastrous mini budget but we be aware of the limitation that place on the bill in particular an announcement could have largely indirect fiscal effect it could have an impact on the economy but come at small up front cost to the government and therefore not trigger the fiscal lock we therefore ask the chancellor can gdp measure alone adequately capture the impact of spending or taxation measure on the economy should the government examine the possibility of use additional criterion in establish the threshold we must consider the wide context in which the conservatives damage mini budget come about to determine whether the measure that we be debate would be sufficient to prevent such disaster ever happen again the conservatives period in government and the last two parliaments in particular be characterise by distaste for the institution that provide check and balance on power and effort to actively undermine they throughout the past few year we have see attack on the judiciary the civil service the bbc the bank of england the eu and any british citizen who dare express the view that the government botch brexit deal be do enormous damage to our economy we have see the provision of international treaty airily discard conservative ministers even illegally prorogue parliament even now in the conservative party leadership contest it seem that the one thing all candidate agree on be promise that the uk will leave the european court of human rights the disastrous mini budget emerge from the philosophy that the power of central government exercise by successive conservative prime ministers can trump that of other vital independent institution and it be precisely that philosophy that we must never again see from government the ongoing failure of the former member of parliament for south west norfolk to apologise for the disastrous mini budget underline the fact that she think she be both entitle and correct to unleash it on an unsuspecting country that vote for neither it nor she truly address the cause of the systemic failure that lead to the disastrous mini budget will take great deal more than this bill it require the government to work alongside institution that exist to support and challenge their decision making it require the government to submit their propose measure to parliamentary scrutiny the liberal democrats think that reform devolve power to local body to decentralise decision making would also strengthen our ability to take long term decision in the national interest this bill and other measure be encourage sign of this new government intention to ensure that those in power act with more integrity and transparency but ultimately unless all government be commit to uphold the principle of fiscal responsibility transparency and sound governance the risk of future disaster such as the mini budget will remain in our general election manifesto we set out the need for every fiscal event to be accompany by an independent forecast from the obr more broadly we wish to see the government foster stability certainty and confidence by manage the public finance responsibly get national debt fall as share of the economy and ensure that day to day spending do not exceed the amount raise in taxis we must make the tax system fair by ask some of the wealthy company in the world to pay their fair share the big bank the oil and gas producer and the tech giant instead of add even more to the burden on hard work family to improve stability and growth we need to fix our break trading relationship with europe and set up an industrial strategy help to make britain one of the most attractive place in the world for business to invest we must work in partnership with responsible sustainable business to tackle the climate emergency and spur the growth that be need for investment in health social care education and other essential public service responsibly manage public finance be essential if we be to have the stability certainty and confidence that drive economic growth and they be vital in get mortgage rate under control too under the outgoing conservative government we find out just how much pain and damage can come from fiscal irresponsibility the liberal democrats want thriving british economy that provide job and opportunity and be attractive to business and investor we welcome this bill as useful step in that direction that will help to improve long term stability and responsible economic management on point of order madam deputy speaker do the point of order relate to the business be discuss right now it relate to the business of the day just for reference know that this can be tricky for new mp point of order must be relevant to the business under way or be make during the transition between item of business however know that that be not easy for new mp and be grateful to the member for give notice of the point of order so he may proceed thank you madam deputy speaker we be hear lot about transparency accountability and scrutiny but the business of the day propose by the leader of the house include plan to abolish the european scrutiny committee when this country vote to leave the european union we vote to take back control how can we scrutinise the government activity and negotiation with the european union if the government abolish the european scrutiny committee surely that be completely in contrast to what the government propose in their manifesto and to these discussion about scrutiny once again be grateful to the member for give we notice of his point of order it be for the government to decide what motion should be table and whether there should be consultation any select committee can scrutinise matter within its remit which may include matter relate to the european union the remit of the european scrutiny committee as define in standing order no be to examine european union document broadly speak proposal for european union legislation or policy it be for the house not for the speaker to decide whether the committee still fulfil useful function now that the uk be no long member of the eu call martin rhodes thank you madam deputy speaker for call to make my maiden speech during this debate move to glasgow in expect to stay for three year now over three decade later be pleased to say that make it my home for more than year have live in the north of the city so it be great privilege and great responsibility to have be elect to serve the constituency of glasgow north it be constituency of huge variety and diversity at its northern boundary there be farmland north of summerston and at its southern boundary at the river clyde there be the scottish event campus the hydro venue and the city centre there be the west of scotland science park at its western boundary and the glasgow tigers speedway track towards the eastern boundary of course there be lot more in between include firhill the home of partick thistle the kelvingrove art gallery possil marsh site of special scientific interest glasgow caledonian university the university of glasgow the glasgow school of art the royal conservatoire the queen cross church of charles rennie mackintosh the forth and clyde canal the river kelvin ruchill maryhill and dawsholm park kelvingrove park and the botanic garden most of all and far more important than those key landmark there be the community that make up glasgow north many of which have face and still face significant challenge and have seek to do what they can to support each other in the face of those challenge resilience be thread that run through the diverse community of glasgow north it be an area that be pleased to call home and be now privileged to represent in this place wish to recognise the work of my predecessor patrick grady in his time here he be chair of the all party parliamentary group on malawi he have long interest in development issue which be sure he will continue to pursue outside this place the boundary of the constituency be different from what they be in previous parliaments the constituency now include part of the city that be previously in glasgow north east and glasgow central know that my hon friend the member for glasgow north east maureen burke will want to recognise the former member for glasgow north east anne mclaughlin in her first speech so with no disrespect to she will keep my comment to the former member for glasgow central alison thewliss as glasgow central no long exist want to ensure that we as house do not miss the opportunity to recognise her commitment and work in her time in this place and before that when she be city councillor in glasgow she show her commitment to serve those she represent there be one other former member for glasgow north to whom would like to pay tribute today ann mckechin serve in this place from to she have be friend and giver of wise advice for many year in and outside this place she have show her continue commitment to public service all of we here want to ensure that we represent the people we be elect to represent we recognise across the chamber all members aspiration to serve but we need to ensure that this mutual recognition do not blind we to the challenge of politic and public service number of event not too long ago have add to and encourage distrust not just of politician but of politic itself the turnout at the general election in my constituency be just over and across the country it be only around there be many reason for that certainly in constituency such as mine the large amount of student accommodation lie empty because of the summer break count towards low turnout the fact that the election be hold at the start of the scottish school holiday may have reduce turnout across scotland too however we should not let those contributory factor hide the clear opinion of many that politic be self serve occupation and people demonstrate their indifference distrust or disdain for it by not use their vote for too long government and politic have often allow themselves to be characterise by posturing and positioning rather than the serious work of analyse problem assess solution and deliver change the empty charade of superficial posturing can initially seem to excite and engage but the lack of substance delivery and integrity can so easily tip the balance from excitement to disillusionment and sense of betrayal thorough analysis serious discussion and honest decision making must be the basis of politic if we be to rebuild trust financial responsibility and transparency be key part of that it be our challenge across this chamber over the course of this parliament to rebuild trust in political institution and process we need to show to people out there that politics be act in their service and that it can make real and positive change to their life and community that be the challenge for all of we and one that hope that can meet during my time in this place be very pleased to follow the hon member for glasgow north martin rhodes who just deliver textbook maiden speech and negotiate his way around the fairly awkward change to the glasgow constituency judge by the unanimous reaction in the chamber the two former servant of his constituency that he salute be hard work representative in this chamber would like to reciprocate he mention the former labour minister in the scotland office ann mckechin who invite to her constituency office in glasgow when be mature student around she give good hour of her time which then think be fairly generous as an mp now realise just how generous that be to someone who be not her constituent and who within two or three minute clearly demonstrate sign of particularly different political outlook congratulate the hon member welcome the bill and commend the government on introduce it be not certain that it be what they say will develop that point in wee moment who among we could forget the aftermath of the truss kwarteng debacle which plunge business and household across these island into chaos the pair of they then disappear off into the sunset leave we here to pick up the piece of their arrogant and economically illiterate fiscal experiment while in government if anyone have forget it be not mortgage payer up and down these island who be still pay the price of that tory government misadventure mortgage rate spike at after the mini budget figure out last week from moneyfact show that the average rate for two year fix deal be still we in the snp warn at the time that the mini budget would lead to economic chaos so we can only support the measure in the bill to help ensure that there be never repeat of that ridiculous performance an independent assessment by the obr for major and permanent fiscal intervention be welcome it be responsible and the snp support it but to be clear it be no silver bullet it will not fix the economy and nor will it prevent fiscal incompetence from the current or future chancellors their official or junior ministers it will not fix the credibility of chancellors who for example on take office say they do not know about the billion black hole in the previous government fiscal plan that they be adopt even though they be warn about it repeatedly and in public by the snp the institute for fiscal studies and other the snp welcome effort at increase economic transparency but the truth be that labour have also be substantially short of honest with the public in this area the new government be seek to create counter narrative or counter reality to uphold the belief that the cut and tax hike that labour will soon visit upon business and community across these island have be do to labour by the tories rather than do to the people by labour that be the truth of the matter if labour be serious about restore faith in and the growth of the economy much more action be need from the government no economy ever cut its way to growth rather growth be function of investment in closing greatly fear that the new labour government be get bit carry away with their own success and be sail off from reality at some knot cite the nauseating government of service hyperbole the potemkin energy company that be gb energy which be abject nonsense and now the fiscal lock set out in the bill an assessment by the obr be not lock on anything it do not enable or prevent anything it do not confine nor do it decide anything parliament will never allow it to be use as shield for the chancellor from its beginning to its end it be simply an impartial assessment leave the hand of the chancellor of the day free to prosecute whatever plan they wish consistent with the obr assessment or not and so it should be because parliament be here to hold the government to account as be the people across these island which we have see recently to be clear this provision be certainly no replacement for the rigorous parliamentary scrutiny of fiscal policy that be core function of this house which be sure that you madam deputy speaker agree with in the interest of consensus will the minister concede this minor point of detail that fiscal report be far more realistic in term of what it actually mean than fiscal lock for this nevertheless welcome measure call blair mcdougall to make his maiden speech thank you madam deputy speaker as be be welcome to my place welcome you to your place and congratulate you also congratulate my hon friend the member for glasgow north martin rhodes he speak about the lack of trust in politic his eloquent speech and the service he will give to his community will go long way to help to repair that can say how wonderful it be to see he as one of many labour mp from that great city do not wish to nauseate the hon member for angus and perthshire glens dave doogan but my speech be go to be about public duty apology for that yesterday evening after the chancellor statement and the discussion afterwards about responsibility duty and the legacy that people leave in this chamber be stand on the bank of the river watch the river go by as it have do for countless generation think of everyone who have stand on those bank before about the choice and decision they have make and how those choice have impact on the life of everyone who follow they the first and most important duty and the duty the bill seek to enshrine be to take responsible decision that will ensure rich life for those who follow we for our child and our grandchild the failure of our age be that we depart from that purpose in do so we have leave people trap in short term life life without the opportunity to learn for the future life without permanent home life of short term precarious work fall life expectancy poison environment and legacy of debt have be hand down to generation time and generation flow and can change for the well or for the bad that change happen as result of political decision and also as result of personal decision will talk about that aspect little later in my speech but the hard decision that we make today be what create well tomorrow for the bill be about we as political leader make the kind of decision that my constituent make every single day pass this bill will be promissory note say that this new parliament will do well and that this new labour government will reclaim the legacy and the future of an abandon generation the story of intergenerational opportunity be the story of my constituency of east renfrewshire be go to be very brave and not claim that mine be the most beautiful constituency partly because have listen to the speech of other hon member over the last couple of week be quite happy for that title to rest until the next maiden speaker stand up you certainly can find natural beauty in east renfrewshire if you walk through greenbank garden stroll through rouken glen or take hike to the top of neilston pad but the extraordinary thing about my constituency be not the place but the people generation after generation have move to east renfrewshire because it offer hope for the next generation and well life for

my maiden speech will harlequin youth theatre give kid the thrill of performance and our flourish girl guide scout and boy and girl brigade and our maccabi offer young people adventure and taste of leadership east renfrewshire be to borrow phrase from someone else constituency of joiner that be wonderful thing unless you happen to be their member of parliament know from speak to my predecessor that east renfrewshire be not always the easy place in the world to represent three different hon member from three different party have win and lose my constituency in the last decade my immediate predecessor kirsten oswald deserve enormous praise for the service she give to the constituency which be typify by the fact that when she lose at one general election she come back fight again and win hope that be not something that be repeat but it be typical of how much she love the constituency both she and paul masterton my conservative predecessor have be source of constant support and advice and thank they for that pay special tribute to my former hon friend he be now just my friend jim murphy who serve the constituency for year know from my time knock door in the election how fondly he be remember in the constituency and it have be wonderful to talk to more long stand hon member and find out that he be still as fondly remember in this place prior to the election spend most of the last decade work with democrats and against dictator around the world but not all of my predecessor have such frosty relationship with authoritarian in rudolph hess bail out of his messerschmitt over the field outside eaglesham in my constituency and parachute to the ground the deputy führer of the nazi party be seek to negotiate with douglas douglas hamilton former member of parliament for east renfrewshire who hess believe perhaps unfairly to be nazi sympathiser hess be swiftly capture by local farmer at pitchfork and then take to busby scout hall apparently by an inebriated member of the national guard at pistol point he be then take to the tower of london which sit alongside the river that flow outside here time may have pass but can tell you that my constituent inform by event in ukraine and elsewhere still have as little tolerance for dictator as they do back in the my argument today be that we should think more long term in this house but make it in the knowledge that my own place here will only ever be temporary will close by say why feel that so acutely my root be in east renfrewshire where be bear and bring up but my ancestor hail from much close to this chamber my grandfather be bear across the river in lambeth he be one of seven child scatter to different orphanage and foster home when his parent die he go to his grave believe that his mother have be take by consumption and then his father have succumb to old wound from the great war but that story be lie it be lie tell to boy to protect he from horrible truth that be discover when we research our family tree the truth be that my great grandfather overwhelm by grief and overcome by poverty decide that his child would have well future without he that their life would be well if he end his so he walk to lambeth pier and throw himself into the freezing water that run past this parliament as the once famous newton mearns poet robert pollock write sorrows remember sweeten present joy today if you stand at the place where my great grandfather story end you can look across the river to where his great grandson just give his maiden speech as member of parliament watch from the gallery by his own child however long serve on the bank of this river will always have an eye on the water fly by and my mind on the responsibility we have to our child and grandchild have no doubt that the hon gentleman will do his family very proud but for comfort break will never be the same call bobby dean to make his maiden speech congratulate the hon member for east renfrewshire blair mcdougall on that heartfelt speech it be gracious of he to say that his be not the most beautiful of constituency but think he be at least in the top and possibly even high after one or two whisky also congratulate the hon member for glasgow north martin rhodes on his maiden speech the point he make about engage with the public and make sure that we restore trust in this place be really important be not go to speak about scotland in my maiden speech be go to start by talk about where come from my parent be in the gallery and promise to stay ground so this be the place want to start grow up on council estate as the eld of three boy my dad work long hour as scaffolder and my mum work two job one in burton by day and one as cleaner at night thing be not always easy and time get so tough at one point that as young teenager move into the care of my grandparent have find out in recent year that this be call kinship care it be pretty formal sound name but it be basically where family agree to take on family be very grateful to my nan and pops for help back on to the right path and know that they would have be very proud of if they have get to see this day of course it be not just family that get here have have encouraging teacher supportive friend guide therapist campaign wife and totally unreasonable bunch of people call activist who volunteer silly amount of time to the cause to all those that have be involve in my messy pathway to now and especially to the people of carshalton and wallington who have put their faith in thank you be utterly humble to be here and do not take this responsibility lightly have plan on describe my constituency of carshalton and wallington as hidden gem but since start in this place few week ago have keep bump into staff that live there so it be clearly popular place for those that do not know carshalton and wallington be on the south london border with surrey or in surrey depend on who you speak to describe it as hide because despite be london borough you will not find we on the tube map there be no london underground or london overground service in our borough and this be an issue that will return to at later date but my constituency be gem be not go to say it be the most beautiful but it be pretty beautiful it have beautiful pond and many award win park and we have the historic river wandle and so many good pub that it be really difficult to avoid they at the weekend would like to take this moment to recognise my predecessor elliot colburn this house will remember when he bravely speak out about his own struggle with mental health have great respect for his willingness and openness to share his story and be certain that his bravery will give courage to other to speak up and seek help too would also like to put on record my recognition of another predecessor tom brake who serve my community of carshalton and wallington for over year he be true local champion and he be still speak about fondly on the doorstep the house will probably be aware of his tireless campaign for st helier hospital and plan to take up that issue at later date too there be much more would like to share about my constituency over time but unlike the hon member for east renfrewshire will not take up that time now because be keen to get involve in today debate as well want to start by join my hon friend the member for richmond park sarah olney in welcome the thrust of the government proposal to give more power to the office for budget responsibility to scrutinise major fiscal announcement the inappropriately name mini budget send shockwave across the country with mortgage soar pension on the brink of collapse and market confidence damage so badly that feel we will be deal with the trust issue cause by that disruption for quite some time yet the state of our country finance be not just down to one fiscal event the populism that infect everything that the last government do be lay bare by the chancellor yesterday and be so angry about the mess that have be leave behind it be always the most vulnerable that suffer the most when the government get thing so drastically wrong and we must never let such reckless gamble be take with our country finance ever again while be optimistic that the fiscal lock will provide the public and market with some reassurance on this do hope that the government do not feel lock into one particular model of fiscal management the key lesson to take from the disastrous mini budget should be not that there be only one way to run the economy but that whatever choice the government make they should be inform by good information and stand up to rigorous analysis it will be my intention from these benches to encourage the government to take seriously the call from many respected economist to ensure that fiscal responsibility go hand in hand with maximise the growth potential of the country over the long term this be particularly relevant to major capital investment such as the rebuilding of st helier hospital in my constituency our local nhs trust face huge cost every year try to maintain an unfit building we must not forget that there be cost to not invest too when talk about growth let we remember that it have not only rate but direction and that necessarily involve political choice and can not be leave to expert analysis alone while the obr can rightly describe what action will increase growth and by how much we in this house still have crucial role to play in select what action will meet all of society goal purpose drive industrial strategy as propose by the liberal democrats will ensure that we deliver the right sort of growth not least in relation to green industry the chancellor be right to reiterate that the government should not commit to any unfunded spending pledge but there be many way to fund the investment we so desperately need in our public service and we do not have to increase tax on ordinary worker to do so if the chancellor be stick for idea would invite she to have read of the liberal democrat manifesto which include idea such as raise capital gain tax and reverse the tories cut for bank there be fair way of raise the revenue we need and we should look at they seriously it be at this point that look back up to the gallery and have some regret that my maiden speech be on the intricacy of fiscal responsibility if member would indulge for moment before close would like to make brief translation by put my point into footballe term dad this be mainly for you the former manager play six up front and get hammer but that do not mean that the new manager have to revert to defensive five at the back there be many different style of play out there and think some will have big reward so let we get the balance right and get our country win again no doubt your mum and dad enjoy that up in the gallery we now have another maiden speech call david burton sampson thank you very much madam deputy speaker for grant the opportunity to give my maiden speech today and especially during the first few week of this new labour government welcome you to your new place and thank the hon member for

to the previous government disastrous mini budget which include the large package of tax cut in year without any effort to make the public finance number add up such situation must never be allow to

experience the dark place that it can be especially during the campaign fear of climate crisis in our lifetime rent in insecure housing with the idea of home ownership only distant dream and try to build career in the midst of cost of living crisis it be this that have lead to my generation trust in politician be so low be here today have campaign and join the labour party because believe in the upcoming change not just for my generation but for all generation in my constituency the need for change could not be more apparent the maternity ward of kettering general hospital where be bear eight

will bring their expertise and their point of view which will enrich this house and encourage we so be pleased to have hear those speech it be real pleasure and privilege for to sit and hear they commend the hon member for ynys môn llinos medi love the wee thing she say at the end about her can do attitude every one of we can do in this house the hon lady have tell we we can do so think we can do from now on look forward to work with everyone on the thing we can agree on the issue for many of we in this house be not our difference suppose maybe look at thing in slightly different way but do not often see the politic see the person if we do that we can see the goodness that we can all bring to the debate here be very pleased that you have allow the opportunity to speak briefly about the bill madam deputy speaker will not take too long be pleased to see the additional brake or fiscal lock as it be clear that government should take cognisance of high level support and opinion believe the bill will secure just that the minister and the labour government be bring the bill forward for the good reason which be welcome and be very pleased to see it however do believe that advice should be consider here it be the role of government to do what be right with total vision for the country and we must always ensure that the decision be make in this house by elect representative and not by unelected members behind closed door know that our government and our minister will be aware of the need to strike balance between take reason opinion and take instruction and know the minister will take that on board he have always speak in reason way in the house and know that he will not be find want today when he give his reasoned opinion at the end of the debate firmly believe in the need for the obr opinion the reason for that will be clear when we consider the political motivation that seek to force the government to spend more than million on casement park in northern ireland which could plainly necessitate tax increase because no part of the budget will allow the money to be allocate hope the government will not pursue the project and want to put that on the record as say yesterday follow the chancellor statement welcome the news that junior doctor will receive their much need pay rise do not think anyone in this nation will not be encourage to know that they will receive the increase that we all think they should have the government have make that money available and hopefully it will go in the right direction the junior doctor pay rise be necessity and the change that will be necessary to generate it can be easily understand not one of we do not owe our nhs vast thank you for all it have do when we be live through covid many of we lose family member and love one and we will be eternally grateful for the role that the nhs play what be not so easily understand be why the tax pay by the average person in warrington or wrexham may be increase to fund gaelic athletic association project be refer again to casement park which will generate income for private sporting body to the exclusion of other sport leave that comment on the record the drive for this be political not practical and hope that the obr would express the reasoned view that raise taxis for such purpose do not instil confidence in the financial future of the nation hope the bill will remind member that every project we undertake must be pay for from the public purse in these time when the average person be struggle to lead his or her life in contrast to the position five year ago the hon member for richmond park sarah olney speak early about poverty across this great united kingdom in my constituency poverty level have rise dramatically especially among child can honestly say for the record that confidently believe that the labour government and the minister will address these issue throughout this great united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland for the child in my constituency who be experience level of poverty that they have never experience before and the adult who struggle to pay their bill every member have bring an illustration of that to the debate so be encourage to see the labour party in the role it now have we have hole in the economy in northern ireland as result of under investment our pay structure need to be revamp and our education sector need improvement to deal with the change need of our child be think in particular of those with special educational need and disability remember have meeting about that with minister back home in northern ireland and be hopeful that some of the change that we talk about have be implement but be see demand on send education that have never see before in all my year as an elect representative as councillor and as member of the northern ireland assembly our health sector need an overhaul as well and all this will take central funding but we also need change in the way that happen we do not need massively high level of middle management and we do not need agency staff when we could give our nurse pay increase that would be cheap than employ those staff these be thing that we need to change early in an intervention ask the minister about the northern ireland assembly the welsh assembly and the scottish parliament the minister kindly confirm that he would have role involve integration and interaction with the regional administrations be particularly encouraged that he will be visit northern ireland and the assembly in september this year that show that the minister my minister here through the labour government say what he mean and will carry it out which be good news welcome that culture and heritage be also important but they can never take precedence over heart operation or chemotherapy no debate on budget responsibility can overlook this foundational aspect hope that this will serve as timely reminder to we all that we have responsibility in this house that outweigh party politic that must always be the first decision that we make in this house call matthew patrick to make his maiden speech thank you for the opportunity to deliver my maiden speech in this important debate madam deputy speaker the matter of budget responsibility be important to my constituent in wirral west because they know the cost of get it wrong the cost to public finance public service and public trust know they will support the measure we be introduce may congratulate my hon friend the member for kettering rosie wrighting my many hon friend and hon member on make their maiden speech today they have be beautiful tell story of constituency and personal journey think there be theme to many of they theme about civility in public life about ambition for everybody and about the number of hour of sunshine that each of the various constituency receive will no doubt look that one up will focus my remark today on the place and the people who have bring here in so do hope to explain why believe in the power of argument disagreement and nuance hon member will know that my constituency be in the wirral peninsula what the house might not have realise be that we be quite particular about how you refer to the wirral it be never wirral but the wirral and you be rarely in it but rather on it the rich history of wirral west one of vikings james bond and prime minister would not be out of place in hollywood blockbuster the vikings come to the wirral in ad and they bring with they their own parliament which they call thing that be how one of the most beautiful village we enjoy thingwall be name hon member will probably be grateful that be go to skip forward few century of history to bring we close to the present day daniel craig the most recent james bond and in my view the good be bring up play rugby and go to school in west kirby and hoylake and former prime minister harold wilson who do so much for lifelong learning with the open university and introduce important social reform live in spital our past may be worthy of hollywood but our present and beautiful natural environment would not be out of place in david attenborough documentary its physical beauty have be capture by many of the fine photographer but even they will tell you that there be no substitute for see it for yourself from walk to hilbre island and watch as the seal swim through the river dee to admire our golf course which be famous for host the open those people lucky enough to call wirral west their home be part of what make it so special they bring passion to everything they do and they carry that passion with warm welcome and great dignity that passion run through each of the town and village it be passion for one another and for our area help to expand opportunity to everyone can not imagine another place with as many community group church and business that work so hard to do such good include scout and guide group the royal national lifeboat institution our school and hospital and community hub such as the hoole road hub so many group that support all people whatever the difficulty they face it be community spirit that have power we through some difficult time and hope that this new government can help to bring back some hope so that we can look forward to well day wirral west with its expand boundary have be most recently serve by two people margaret greenwood and my hon friend the member for birkenhead alison mcgovern margaret greenwood be deeply passionate about our nhs and our environment and those be two passion that share as an mp margaret know that get our nhs back on its foot be vital so that it can deliver world lead care we be fortunate in wirral west to have two hospital arrowe park and clatterbridge know the secretary of state for health and social care be particularly fond of the latter give the support it give to his family think back to the conversation have in the election campaign to the people wait sometimes year for crucial operation and the stress that that waiting add to their daily life will be think of those people as we do the work to turn the nhs around as margaret often remind we there be no escape the threat that be climate change it come up often on the doorstep people on the wirral from teacher to scientist and from environmentalist to parent be worried like so many about the threat of climate change they know that it do not respond to strong rhetoric border or weapon it be only action join up with our partner around the world that will help we to tackle climate change and save the environment when see the wind farm off our wirral shore be proud that we can be home of green energy and green job deliver the bold action that be desperately need my other predecessor who now serve birkenhead have deep impact on my own journey ambitious for personally and many people like from working class community ambitious for all of we encourage we believe that we too can stand tall in place even one as grand as this grow up in birkenhead it be wonderful place but it be not without its struggle stand here now be testament to my hon friend and to her encouragement and ambition for people like she will know that as proud as we rightly be some people from ordinary background can fulfil their ambition but it be still only some people and there be much more that we must do will not rest until some people have opportunity become everybody have opportunity the enormity of that task be match only by its importance it would be daunt but for the fact that know be not alone in that mission be proud to stand alongside my hon friend the member for birkenhead and all of my hon friend in this great task the wirral have have many politician who have make an important contribution to public life they include my hon friend the member for wallasey dame angela eagle and her championing of woman and the lgbt community and baron hunt of wirral although member will realise that think it should be baron hunt of the wirral but will come back to that he come from different tradition from but he have serve people in this country with bravery and distinction and of course there be frank field who we sadly lose early this year frank be dear friend of mine and miss he terribly he be the first mp meet he be interested in what everyone have to say and as hon member across the house may know from personal experience he be quite interested in disagreement too he be fascinate when what you have to say differ from his own view and it be frank who teach that disagreement do not need to be tolerate in politic but rather to be seek out and embrace he teach that if you believe in something you should feel free to say it and that as long as you do so with reason respect and humility you should enjoy the consideration of other because we can not reward the absolutist those who know everything with total certainty be think the people we should most fear be conscious stand here of the responsibility place on to represent the interest and people of wirral west and will do that fiercely be deeply aware that representation be as much about listen as it be about speak the most interesting and informative conversation that have on the election campaign be with people who disagree with learn much from they in this house while bring from my career expertise in local government and economic policy which hope will benefit other intend to tap into the accumulate knowledge of hon member from all side of the house there have not be enough listen in our politic of late and believe that if we be to restore faith in this house which believe we must listen to our constituent and to one another be vital step frank and speak often about whole range of issue and even towards the end of his extraordinary life he maintain fascination with politic with what it could do for people and with the disagreement that lie at its heart small part of his enormous legacy will be these three commitment that make to this house my commitment be to listen in good faith to argument make in good faith my commitment be to change my mind when it be right to do so and my commitment be to stand up for the thing that believe in so that other might do the same that be what frank would have expect it be what the people of wirral west rightly expect and it be what this house and our politic deserve so it be the wirral or on the be definitely note we now have luke charters thank you madam deputy speaker and congratulation on your elevation to the chair be proud to stand here as part of change labour party that win the public trust on the economy be so glad that we do because we would otherwise still be at the behest of those on the opposition benches who do so much to damage the public finance my constituent pay the economic price for their economic incompetence the billion black hole uncover yesterday be just one example ultimately that be why the opposition pay the price at the ballot box the people of york outer and this country resoundingly send message at the general election never again if anyone need remind why they should take

community and unwavere commitment to improve the life of other volunteer tell first hand how crumble public service lack of affordable housing and long mental health list have create an unimaginable crisis the project have go from provide to meal week during to provide week in that be why it be critical that we implement our national mission to rebuild public service build more home and offer more nhs appointment but it be also why be speak in this debate this bill be so important because it be the only way we can grow those public service with stable economy we see yesterday just how difficult that challenge will be which be why we must protect our economy now the bill respect our institution rather than undermine they and prime example be how it give real oversight to the office for budget responsibility it also include provision for the treasury committee to have great say in key fiscal moment however with the heighten responsibility that the bill give the obr we need to think about the most effective way in which the obr could be properly scrutinise by parliament and the bill could make more specific provision on the treasury committee scrutiny role of the obr this week meet the team from the institute for government that author report early this year on how select committees can well hold regulator to account commend that report and would welcome debate on how this place good scrutinise the obr what the bill really protect against however be knee jerk reaction and fantasy budgets if we be to get the growth we so badly need we must behave like an establish economy not an emerge one that come out of the mini budget that be why the chancellor presence at the over the weekend and her warm word about britain be open for business be so important if we can fix the lamentable legacy that the conservative party leave we will have real cause for optimism be pleased that the right hon member for godalming and ash jeremy hunt commend the work of the obr in his first speech as shadow chancellor but it feel somewhat jarring for he to flippantly suggest we all understand the politic of bill that allow the government to make endless reference to the mini report july vol george orwell once say the secret of rulership be to combine belief in one own infallibility with power to learn from past mistake the conservative party clearly have some way to go in that regard but under this government the green shoot of economic recovery be already start to show we may have inherit particularly difficult situation but the evidence of stable market and an increase in the pound show the confidence in the security that this government bring after all make it clear in my maiden speech how welcome it be that the country have some good yorkshire

worker and now especially college lecturer and staff such as those at forth valley college in my constituency welcome the significant pay offer that this labour government announce yesterday encourage the scottish government to use any consequential funding that will flow from it to settle the disruptive and long stand dispute and give scottish public sector worker the pay rise that they deserve for far too long age discriminatory band have indicate to young worker that their time be worth less than anybody else we have have relatively stagnant minimum wage that do not reflect the spiral cost of living zero hour contract which have work on and fire and rehire practice that prevent worker from have control over their life those be all thing that this labour government will change emphatically for the well as one of the first members to be bear in this millennium share and echo the concern set out in other member maiden speech about the low turnout across the country but especially the consistently low turnout among young people many young people have speak to on the doorstep about how they feel alienated from politic and be lose trust in politic as route to positive outcome this disconnect should not exist as councillor speak to so many passionate young people with bold and exciting idea about how to change their community for the well want especially to mention

climate crisis the moral stain of child poverty and the nhs while many young people understand that we must efficiently progress our progressive economic agenda they deserve to see substantial

budget in the autumn when will work tirelessly on behalf of the people of falkirk advocate to see we permanently and sustainably end the cruell policy enact during the past year as the people of

front bench contribution begin madam deputy speaker by congratulate you on your election and wish you well in the chair as well as congratulate the new ministerial team who hope will enjoy their time at the treasury as much as do also congratulate all hon member across the house who make their maiden speech in today debate the hon member for glasgow north martin rhodes for east renfrewshire blair mcdougall for southend west and leigh david burton sampson for carshalton and wallington bobby dean for chichester jess brown fuller for falkirk euan stainbank for peterborough andrew pakes for maidenhead mr reynolds for west ham and beckton james asser for ynys môn llinos medi for kettering rosie wrighting for wirral west matthew patrick and for earley and woodley yuan yang all speak very well with eloquence and passion and we on the conservative benches wish they well for the rest of their time in this house in contrast to those positive uplift maiden speech we have also hear labour ministers talk the country down claim to have inherit the bad set of circumstance since the second world war frankly labour approach be more ott than obr to prove labour wrong we do not have to go as far back as we only have to revisit when we take over from labour unemployment be at the conservatives nearly halve it to in the deficit be of gdp thank to labour reckless borrowing it be now and be forecast to fall to in the come year in inflation be today it be back at the bank of england target let we not forget that the final year of the last labour government see britain experience the deep recession since quarterly datum start be publish in fact labour britain be in recession for long than any other country at the time and we be the last to exit that be why in labour leave we with that infamous note say there no money leave in contrast this month we leave labour with the fast grow economy in the low inflation low unemployment and month of consecutive wage growth we conservative believe in sound public finance fiscal responsibility and independent forecast as the foundation of economic stability that be why it be conservative government who create the obr in the first place and it be why we be keen to safeguard its reputation for independence and focus in that context this labour bill feel more like gimmickry than government it be clear that the bill be really design for one purpose and one purpose alone to distract everyone ahead of labour tax rise in the autumn budget be it any wonder that the ifs say that labour fiscal lock proposal be largely performative or that even the resolution foundation describe the policy impact as relatively small when the conservatives create the obr our legislation recognise that for it to be effective and respected it have to maintain delicate balance between independence and accountability independent forecast free from treasury interference would give the public more confidence in they avoid the scenario that happen under the last labour government where their growth forecast be out by as much as billion on average at the same time elect politician accountable to this house would retain control over fiscal decision because those be ultimately political judgment that should not be delegate to unelecte body however today bill challenge the delicate balance that we leave in place in fact the most recent independent review of the obr carry out by the oecd specifically warn against what it describe as mission creep presciently the oecd say that attempt to expand the obr current remit risk draw the organisation into area where it do not currently have sufficient capacity or expertise create confusion about its role and dilute its effectiveness we on the conservative benches agree the obr should not be drag into make actual or perceive political judgment give unelected official the ability to essentially veto or shape decision that be in substance political quite frankly the bill and labour proposal be full of unanswered question which need answer today and throughout the bill passage for example be the obr really equip to decide what count as spending emergency should the obr really be empower to reasonably disagree with ministers who be elect ignore their opinion and strike out on its own the bill give the obr more power but what measure will the government introduce to make the obr more accountable to the house and its member can the government explain why their fiscal lock completely ignore policy with large indirect fiscal impact but whose up front cost do not reach the gdp threshold such as labour new open door immigration policy or their watering down of law that protect we from french style strike why have the chancellor announce over billon of spending in day without an obr forecast despite claim black hole in the public finance labour have already spend billion of taxpayer money on public energy company billion on national wealth fund and around billion on inflation bust public sector pay deal without ask for any improvement in productivity in return do they have forecast for any of that spending or have the fag packet be throw away when the minister get to his foot can he confirm that there will be no more tax rise beyond those already include in labour manifesto have already take away the winter fuel allowance from million of pensioner will he rule out tax rise on people pension capital gain and council tax it be conservative government who create the obr to end labour culture of inaccurate politicise forecast the obr have establish itself as fixture of the economic and political landscape and we support it but we have significant concern about the bill and believe it will benefit from further scrutiny and improvement by the whole house at its next stage so we do not oppose that additional scrutiny the bill reveal the true fear and underlying motif of this labour government it be an admission and confirmation that one of the first law they bring forward after year in opposition be design to save ministers from their own back benchers spend demand and stop themselves from crash the economy as they have do on so many occasion before the bill show that they have finally realise what everyone else already know this country can never trust labour with our economy welcome your election to the chair madam deputy speaker it be privilege to close this debate on the budget responsibility bill on behalf of the government thank all hon member for their contribution in moment will address many of the point that they have raise let start by remind the house why the bill be so important and what it be design to achieve at the general election early this month the british people vote for change they vote to turn the page on year of economic failure people across britain vote to remove the conservatives from power they vote to remove the party that crash the economy and whose ministers we now know be reckless with the public finance right till the very end people vote to give labour the chance to serve with that honour afford to we we have get to work straightaway in fix the mess the previous government leave and get our economy grow that economic growth be at the heart of our national mission as government that growth underpin our plan in government to make people in every part of the uk well off and to get public service back on their foot in sustainable way we know that crucial foundation for sustained growth be economic stability and fiscal responsibility we have bring that stability and fiscal responsibility back into the heart of government our fiscal rule be non negotiable as the chancellor set out yesterday meet they be principle on which this new labour government be elect and that will guide she at october budget but we want to go far in restore the trust that be so badly damage by the conservatives during their time in office by embed fiscal responsibility not just into our country government but also into its law that be why one of the first bills to be present to the house of commons by our new government be the budget responsibility bill whose second read we be debate today the bill will hardwire fiscal responsibility into significant financial decision of any future government and it will prevent any party ever again be able to play fast and loose with the public finance we see under the previous government what happen when politician fail to show respect for taxpayer money people across britain be still feel the impact of liz truss and kwasi kwarteng recklessness nearly two year on from the economic disaster they create the conservatives recklessness in show just how much damage unfunded spending commitment can cause minister at the time unleash economic turbulence that push up people mortgage and rent and make people across britain bad off though it hit the least well off the hard we must never let that happen again budget responsibility must never be optional that be why labour will hardwire this responsibility into government through our fiscal lock which will mean that all significant fiscal announcement in future will be guarantee independent scrutiny from the office for budget responsibility this bill empower the obr to independently produce an assessment of government fiscal plan if it judge that the fiscal lock have be trigger that will make sure that there be always proper scrutiny of government fiscal plan and guard against large scale unfunded commitment and disaster such as the conservatives so call mini budget ever happen again this bill be crucial step in fix the foundation of what we have inherit will take pause from focus on the substance of the bill to thank so many hon member for their truly excellent maiden speech we have real tour around britain and feel have get to know place in all corner of our country through their passionate speech about the place and people they be all so proud to represent

wallington bobby dean speak movingly about his upbringing and how it have influence his politic he also speak about his anger at the previous government recklessness have to say that while enjoy go to the pub when there be big game on do not know that much about football so actually understand the fiscal bit of his speech more than the football analogy shame be just be honest honesty in politic my hon friend the member for southend west and leigh david burton sampson make very important point that we should all heed about civility in politic he speak about the diverse community spirit in his area but be not go to even begin to compete with he on how impressive the coastline be in my landlocked suburban constituency the hon member for chichester jess brown fuller speak about how special and sunny her constituency be she begin new competition now it be not only who have the most beautiful constituency but the sunny be very touch by her recognition of the importance of family for both inspiration and practical support in politic my hon friend the member for peterborough andrew pakes speak about his co operative and trade union value which think many of we labour members share do not know until he speak about the connection between peterborough and mustard so that be something have learn today think that his focus on the promise of new town really sum up our sense of optimism for the future there be the idea of be proud of one heritage and honest about the challenge that we face but he be also ready to achieve more in the future with government who support he wish he great stability in his seat the hon member for maidenhead mr reynolds give particularly rich history of his constituency which go from bridge to carry on movie and he also mention the spice girls think spice girls cd be the first ever buy but he may not know what cd be that sum up the different perspective we come from my hon friend the member for west ham and beckton james asser speak about the royal docks where spend much time in previous role work at city hall see the great potential that that area of the capital city have he eloquently set out the combination of heritage and diversity past and present that make his constituency such lively and wonderful place to represent make he an offer when he be jump on the elizabeth line to visit the hon member for maidenhead he can stop off at west ealing to say hello to the hon member for ynys môn llinos medi speak honestly about the importance of keep people in this place on their toe that be right the electorate do keep we on our toe and one of the great benefit of our system be the way in which we be bring down to earth every time we go back to our constituency on thursdays or fridays however great and important the debate in this place be when we knock on that door or sit down in our surgery we be bring right back down to earth it be great feature of our political system and she be right to draw attention to it my hon friend the member for kettering rosie wrighting speak about how proud she be of the history of the place that she now represent and where she grow up be very move to hear she speak about her mum role as local youth worker and how that inspire she to do what she be do in life wish she well as one of the young mps in this place my hon friend the member for wirral west matthew patrick speak about the natural beauty of his constituency he be not the first member to do so today and the passion of the people there his comment about politic be as much about listen as speak be particularly thoughtful

have conversation my hon friend the member for york outer mr charters speak about business and voluntary project in his constituency he underscore how important it be that taxpayer money be treat with respect know that the resident of york outer will be very well serve by the excellent new mp we hear from today my hon friend the member for earley and woodley yuan yang whom enjoy campaign with during the general election manage to inject some humour into economic which be quite an achievement for maiden speech be not even go to begin to try to replicate that in my comment just now but she speak passionately about the importance to those in her constituency of have access to nature and affordable housing know from what she say particularly about her personal experience that she will be true champion for break down barrier to opportunity finally we hear from my hon friend the member for falkirk euan stainbank and it be worth the wait to hear his wonderful speech he give fantastic whistle stop tour of his constituency and make many excellent recommendation of where to eat and drink next time we be in the area what really come across be how connected he be to the community he represent through his neighbour his friend and his family he use phrase that sum up well what and other government members want to do unite and serve those be all the maiden speech we have today it be truly excellent tour of not just the country but the talent we have in this place follow the general election wish all hon member very well for however many year they spend in this place we hear from other member about the substance of the bill include the shadow ministers they both seem bit confused about whether they support the obr and the bill be glad that they confirm that they support the bill and will not vote against it but at one point the hon member for grantham and bourne gareth davies seem to defend liz truss over her handling of the economy he must be pretty much the last person in the country willing to do so it be certainly brave of he we government member be clear on why the obr be so important and what its role should be the bill set out to strengthen that the hon gentleman ask what the purpose of the fiscal lock might be the fiscal lock will prevent the sidelining of the obr by give it the power to start an assessment if the government announce fiscally significant policy without one remind he that the current shadow chancellor say at the time of the disastrous mini budget that some of the difficulty be cause by the lack of forecast so this be something that the opposition agree with the shadow minister also ask about the definition of an emergency we be very clear that in emergency for instance during the pandemic it may be necessary for the government to take rapid action in those case it would not be appropriate to hold back the response to the emergency until forecast could be produce finally he ask whether the obr report trigger by the fiscal lock will be publish can answer he simply they will that be set out in section of the original budget responsibility and national audit act welcome the support from the lib dem spokesperson the hon member for richmond park sarah olney for the bill she ask about the definition of significant point also raise by my hon friend the member for walthamstow ms creasy the threshold set out in the draft charter for budget responsibility which we have on the website be of gdp in any single financial year the purpose of the legislation be to prevent large irresponsible fiscal announcement that could undermine economic stability and that require threshold target at fiscally significant announcement that be why we have choose that figure in the draft legislation and the draft text publish on let mention two other member who speak in the debate welcome the support of the hon member for angus and perthshire glens dave doogan for the bill think that his only criticism be one word in the terminology and we can probably live with that he say that he be nauseous from hear we talk about be government of service but he may have to get use to feel nauseous because we will proudly be government of service every day that we have the honour to serve finally be glad that this be not an exceptional debate in which the hon member for strangford jim shannon do not make

and question propose that standing order no european scrutiny committee be powell it be important to have debate on this motion we have hear all afternoon splendid speech and maiden speech have we not but the thrust of this afternoon have be scrutiny accountability and responsibility it seem extraordinary to that while the other house have committee to scrutinise our relation with the european union indeed today it have proudly announce that it have be reform and the government want to reform the house of lords we could have situation in which there be only committee to scrutinise relation with the european union in the other place we have talk about scrutiny all afternoon of the committees refer to on the order paper the european scrutiny committee be the only one that include the word scrutiny yet it be the one committee that the leader of the house want to do away with find that extraordinary we have hear from the government before the election during the election and since the election about the importance of our relation with our friend in the european union and how negotiation may take place on whole raft of important issue do hon member remember the slogan take back control of our border our money and our law surely the whole point of our debate about our relationship with the european union be that this be the place where we debate and legislate for law on behalf of the people so if we be to take back control of our law surely those law and the negotiation propose by the government on behalf of the people should be scrutinise in detail and earnest as have be propose all afternoon with regard to other matter suggest to the leader of the house the government and the whip that we need to reflect on that urge the leader of the house to withdraw the motion reflect on it from the sedentary position of our sunbed over the next month and bring it back to the house in september those of we who will be not on sunbed but in our constituency do recognise that point the hon gentleman and will take different view on the benefit of what the government be do to reset our relationship with europe now that we have leave the european union so that we can finally get the trading benefit sort and sort out the border tax mess leave by the last government do he recognise that there be now lacuna where people may question where such debate will happen and what role parliamentarian may play in it and that perhaps one fruitful thing would be to clarify what will happen to the european statutory instruments committee which seem to have be dissolve yet be look at the european law that we be transpose into uk law there be number of question that may not be for this evening but be for the future of this parliament give what the hon gentleman be express he and might disagree on the outcome but we agree that they be important question and we would like to understand what will happen next thank the hon lady for her constructive and positive contribution the reality be that it be incumbent on we on behalf of million of people who believe in democracy in this country and want to take back control to scrutinise the negotiation that the newly elect government will have in multiple area with the european union in brussels and the european nation it seem extraordinary to take away the ability to look at that in detail be not sure how million of people will understand it have listen to the hon member and the hon member for walthamstow ms creasy and guess be the third way because do not agree with either of they the hon gentleman have significant point as the relationship with the european union evolve over the next five or year it be important that the government maintain the trust of the british people if this mechanism do not exist would like the leader of the house to say what mechanism will replace it will there be duty on different select committees to report on their part of it or will there be some other mechanism to keep everyone on board with the journey that the government be take we on thank the right hon member for his most helpful contribution he reinforce the point where be the scrutiny that our citizen rely on we all to exercise on the government however well intentione the government negotiation be we have role to play to avoid unintended consequence it be splendid that the other place have its own scrutiny have not be invite over there reinforce the point that this be the democratically elect house we be charge with scrutinise the government negotiation with partner all around the world it be incumbent on the leader of the house and the government to continue the european scrutiny committee which have do good work and be surely well place to continue that focus serve on the european scrutiny committee for the entirety of the last parliament its work evolve from simply scrutinise the document that come from the european union and have direct effect on our law to take over much of the function of the exiting the european union committee after it be disband the committee be do critical cross government scrutiny on thing such as retain eu law the negotiation on the gibraltar border and the continue operation of the trade and co operation agreement as select committee it be not departmental in its outlook but entirely cross cutting across all of government thank the hon member for that most helpful contribution which reinforce the value of the committee its focus and its determination to get the law right for our million of citizen therefore urge the leader of the house again to withdraw the motion and to reflect on these contribution let we come back in september have debate on it and find the right way to proceed the motion should be withdraw thank the hon member for boston and skegness richard tice for his contribution look forward to watch he race with his towel to the sun lounger be sure he will be beat by many other europeans be little confused by the hon member plea to keep select committee that be function of our membership of the european union since he have spend his life and all his effort get we to leave it which we have now do therefore the principal job of the committee to examine the document produce by the eu institution that the government would automatically take on board be no long require in fact understand that he and his party wish this parliament other departments and therefore other select committees to take on that job of consider all such issue in detail because we be no long member of the european union and be therefore no long require to automatically take on those document listen to what he say but be confuse by it rise be not go to give way because we be all at the end of long day and many of we be look forward to our european holiday know that that be where the hon gentleman will be go straight away from here to spend his euro on tapas and european beer will not take up his offer of withdraw the motion have hear what he say but perhaps he can reflect little over that tapas and beer on his sun lounger on the confusion he have display tonight question put and agree to southport

human circumstance and human frailty make our country more resilient in those circumstance have become national imperative be delighted to say that in what hope we can all agree be post liberal age the issue of food security far from be marginal have become mainstream the minister be an old parliamentary friend have shadow with great style if may say so when be transport minister happen to know that he share my view about salience therefore anticipate his response with enthusiasm border on glee will my right hon friend undertake to continue to share his insight into food security with the labour party which have no particular history in that respect indeed its front bench team consist of secretary of state from croydon minister of state from cambridge and couple of other from hull and coventry they know little of country way they know little of the importance of food security hope that my right hon friend in his charming and constructive way will ensure that the labour party and particularly its ministers learn from his great knowledge will hear nothing negative say about cambridge give my connection with king college have never knowingly be to croydon so can not comment on it what be certainly true be that this go beyond party politic my right hon friend be right to emphasise that any responsible government would recognise that the salience of the matter have change as have set out we have be through some difficult time in recent year and they have concentrate mind in way that might not otherwise have happen rise will happily give way so that the hon gentleman can make one of his rare intervention in the house congratulate the right hon gentleman on secure the debate the issue that he have outline also apply in my constituency where agriculture be really important it create some job in the factory live on farm declare an interest as member of the ulster farmers union and well understand farming issue do the right hon gentleman agree that the strategy that he hop to see here at westminster must encompass all the region of the united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland if we work together with scotland wales and northern ireland we can make food strategy that work for we all do he agree that that be the good way forward this be kingdom wide priority as have make clear so the hon gentleman be right to highlight the issue in his part of our united kingdom however will return to lincolnshire if may over of fen farmland be grade or quality that be interesting in itself give that grade and cover about of all farmland nationally while grade cover further disturbingly since my region have lose hectare of good and most versatile farmland the great absolute loss within single region worse still the county that represent be be target for large scale development which be invidious in the light of my point that the common good and the national interest be serve by protect our food security in lincolnshire alone there be currently application for large scale solar development equivalent to the size of hyde parks total hectare or of the total land across the county rise know that some of those propose development be in the constituency of my hon friend to whom be happy to give way in set out our concern my right hon friend speak not just for south holland and the deepings but for the whole of lincolnshire just before the general election write ministerial statement set out several provision and thought about the problem that he describe it specifically mention lincolnshire and the issue of geographical clustering do he share my disappointment that the new labour government have not commit to those provision and those statement anticipate disappointment but would not go so far as to say share it my hon friend have be resolute champion for his constituent in respect of both food security and resisting development that they simply do not want if we believe in the devolution of power and in empower community to have great say in their future we can not simultaneously snuff they out when they disagree with government priority ignore they and disregard their perfectly proper concern that be something that my hon friend would never do where disagree with he be that have hope there be those who will say that the new minister be not up to the job but do not agree have work with he previously and know that he be diligent and decent man who will take these matter very seriously would not want to entirely write off the prospect that we will make an argument that be sufficiently persuasive to affect government policy even if we can not change it entirely do my right hon friend agree that in situation where there be compete priority between environmental stewardship food production and house building there need to be clarity from the government about how they evaluate and prioritise the relative distribution of the high quality land that my right hon friend have speak about without some real tooth around what food security mean through national security legislation there be wide range of interpretation that leave the cause he be speak to in vulnerable position this be why the point make by my hon friend the member for grantham and bourne gareth davies be so powerful because as my right hon friend have just say there be compete imperative energy security and food security must not be allow to contradict one another both can be pursue with the right approach and with sensitive treatment of where different application be locate my argument tonight be that that sensitivity that precision be not currently prevail indeed the scale of the application we be talk about in lincolnshire alone be over acre in some case eat up vast swathe of highly productive agricultural land once that land be eat up one suspect it will never return to agricultural production there be myth about wind turbine those who have be in this house for long time and those who follow my career even before they become member of this house as know many do will remember that have be campaign against onshore wind since the time get to this place that be not only because of the aesthetic of onshore wind as all man and woman of taste would acknowledge they be grim but because the concrete use to anchor the wind turbine will never leave the ground even when they have cease to serve their purpose nobody seriously believe that there will be commercial interest in remove that concrete which will fill valuable grow land spoil the soil if can turn phrase that might last and make an impression on you madam deputy speaker and on other too the issue be the government take forward their priority in way that be consistent but as say before also sensitive to the imperative of food security alongside that of energy security there be solar application in lincolnshire constituency that be nationally significant infrastructure project by definition those be large project in other word more than of nationally propose solar plant be in lincolnshire leicestershire or rutland which can not be sensible of course we should be pursue renewable technology but surely solar belong on building every large commercial building every warehouse they be spring up everywhere every office block and many more house could accommodate solar panel and deliver solar power yet we be allow developer to make application on the well grow land in our country often for no well reason than their own self interest can not accept that this minister believe in that or that he be go to allow it when he respond hope he will say that he will not there be another threat face my constituency and it have an effect on food security too that be the immense number of pylon that be mile worth of huge pylon along the whole of the east coast neither want nor need by local people say not want for self evident reason but they be not need either because there be well way of transmit power as lincolnshire county council have argue the offshore grid be much more suitable way of transmit power pylon be yesterday technology yet we face the prospect of they fill the big sky of lincolnshire we either care about the glory of our landscape or we be careless of it rise know that my hon friend care about it deeply on pylon my right hon friend will perhaps recall that on the final day before the election hold an adjournment debate on national grid grimsby to walpole proposal and the then minister for energy security and net zero justin tomlinson say he would like to see review do my right hon friend share my hope that the new government will follow that decision and instigate review be in the chamber when my hon friend hold that debate rush there when see his name on the screen as so often do he be right to highlight the national grid decision make process and to play his part in that discussion as have and other member include my hon friend the member for grantham and bourne be more hopeful than many that we can persuade national grid and ministers to look at other option undergrounding be possibility in the fen for example where tall structure have disproportionate impact on the landscape but as say think the offshore grid propose by the county council be perhaps the good way forward the last government publish for the first time in uk food security report hope that this government will take forward that type of work on non partisan basis they commit to assess our food security at least every three year and host the farm to fork summit in hope that this government will continue in that vein the public procurement of uk food be also press priority have never really think that any government of any colour and have be in quite number of they really get the issue of public procurement right be always tell not to say this with civil servant in earshot because it be like speak in front of the child in way and it be rather rude and have some very good civil servant but always feel that civil servant be put impediment in the way of our use procurement as tool to deliver national priority procurement could be use more intelligently to bring about well end food procurement be really good example of that why on earth be public body not prioritise british food why be it that any number of public sector organisation from the health service to the prison from school to this place and local authority be not buy british surely we should be buy british to support our country and the job that go with food production do hope that my backing britain buy british campaign will gain support across the chamber and when produce the badge which will be come out shortly will ask the minister to wear one with pride rise see that the hon gentleman be gag for bite already give way to he last week be privileged to attend the royal welsh show in my constituency of brecon radnor and cwm tawe one of the big constituency in england and wales speak to many farmer and top of their list of concern be the power imbalance between producer and retailer will the right hon gentleman agree with the lib dem manifesto which call for strengthening of the groceries code adjudicator to ensure fairness in the supply chain thereby protect producer and guarantee food security do not make habit of say kind thing about liberal of any description but be go to say something quite kind to the hon gentleman because he be right to draw attention to that code when be minister in the department for business energy and industrial strategy as it be be instrumental in argue the case for the groceries code adjudicator meet the first adjudicator and bring the second the current incumbent to my constituency to meet group of farmer and grower during the last parliament the hon gentleman be right about the strength of that role which just prove something that not everyone here will know even liberal democrats sometimes get it right in summary believe that now be the time for food security now be the time build on the last government begin it be belate beginning to make food security central tenet of the new government priority know the minister enjoy good relation with farmer and grower during his period as shadow minister that have be report to by my constituent and other and he will have hear this argument make by they and not only by we representative in this place it be really of vital importance in the national interest and for the common good that we no long allow our valuable agricultural land to be use for all kind of other purpose and so compromise this country food security make we more dependent on import more vulnerable increase emission increase food mile and damage local economy that be not the way forward let we make food security matter call the minister thank you madam deputy speaker and it be very good to see you in your place thank the right hon member for south holland and the deepings sir john hayes not only for his very kind word and warm welcome but for his customarily thoughtful speech and not least his very comprehensive account of his wonderful county of lincolnshire and the huge contribution that it make to our food production also thank the other hon member who make very thoughtful contribution to the debate can not tell the house how delighted be to stand at the dispatch box on the government side of the chamber for the first time as minister for food security and rural affair the very title be clear statement of this government commitment to rural area and as have be say this government absolutely recognise that food security be national security that be why we need resilient secure and healthy food system that work with nature but also support british farmer this government be offer new deal for farmer to boost rural economic growth and strengthen britain food security and we will set out more detail in due course frankly climate change be one of the most significant threat to our food security we have see it this year in the extreme weather event that farmer be have to deal with it be absolutely the case that take the difficult decision now to address climate change will enhance rather than threaten our food security we have to face up to the challenge of an energy transition to achieve that and in do so must plan how we will use land in this country to ensure proper balance between food security restore and preserving nature and clean energy be interested to hear the observation from opposition members after their year of opportunity to do the thing that they be now keen to do but we will pick up on many of their suggestion certainly one of the key one will be to publish land use framework that be promise by the previous government but there be many delay and we be now pick that up it will work in tandem with our spatial energy plan can assure the house that community will quite rightly continue to have say on proposal for their area it be important for this government that where community host clean energy infrastructure they should directly benefit from it however we will not get into position where the clean energy that we need do not get build and the british people end up pay the price credible external estimate suggest that ground mount solar use just of our land in the big threat to nature food security and our rural community be not solar panel or onshore wind it be the major climate crisis which itself threaten our good farmland food production and indeed the livelihood of farmer the government will absolutely proceed on the basis not of hearsay and conjecture but of evidence one of the government five mission which be sure people have hear much about be our commitment to make britain clean energy superpower that be part of wide ambition to deliver on exist net zero emission target farming have big role to play in contribute to net zero or so of uk land be use for agriculture and farmer be custodian of the natural environment they absolutely work hard to manage their land responsibly while provide the food we all need be glad that there be now consensus around the need for farmer to produce food there be curious period few year ago when it seem as though food production have somehow be forget can see the right hon member for south holland and the deeping nod wisely because he know to what refer and be pleased that we have all move on and can agree on the notion that food production be so important the previous government albeit belatedly change plan guidance to give additional protection to grade and land of the kind that describe furthermore they say that when an energy developer express an interest in develop site of solar panel for example any assessment of the soil should be entirely independent those seem to be perfectly reasonable policy reasonable enough for reasonable man to accept the right hon member tempt into level of detail that be afraid be not prepared to go into this evening we be examine all these issue and will come to consider position we want to get the balance right and that be what we will do because the transition to more climate friendly practice do not need to come at the expense of food production or farm profitability in our view net zero can absolutely support economic growth include by accelerate the uptake of innovative technology to increase productivity and efficiency in the agriculture sector that in turn will support net zero food production the efficient use of land and nature recovery our intention be to work closely on that necessary transition with not just the farming industry but all stakeholder involve we will work with farmer to ensure that we avoid impose unnecessary cost and this hope will be welcome to many in the sector we absolutely guarantee that we will protect farmer from be undercut in trade deal the right hon member as rather anticipate mention solar in particular as with all major infrastructure project there be rigorous application process and food production be rightly consider in it point hon member to the decision letter on these solar project which be available on the planning inspectorate website that be the normal procedure in planning decision all the documentation will be find there not just the final decision letter hope that make it clear that all objection relevant evidence and point raise throughout the planning inquiry be address and give weight in come to planning decision appreciate that the decision letter be long complex document as indeed it should be give the important issue raise there be limit to what can say as be bind by the planning propriety guidance which be clear that during the legal challenge period plan ministers and official can not comment on the decision summarise it or interpret it do the minister see any merit in legislate for food security target that be under consideration and we will come back to that in due course note that where appropriate solar project can be design to enable continue livestock grazing there be also science of agrivoltaic develop in which solar be integrate with arable farming in innovative way solar energy can be an important way for farmer to increase their revenue from land less suited to high value crop production there be also evidence that solar can improve biodiversity we recognise that sadly confidence among farmer be at record low but this government want to change that we look forward to work closely with farmer to strengthen food security progress the energy transition and boost rural economic growth thank everyone who have contribute to an interesting and informed debate as ever most importantly thank the right hon member for south holland and the deepings and not just for secure the debate today be sure the debate will continue and look forward to conduct it in the same constructive manner in which we have start it tonight question put and agree to house adjourn
