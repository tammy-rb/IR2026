nothing of the incident those on the front bench will have hear the point would not want to interrupt today proceeding if the incident be that serious and somebody be so minded we could always put something on at the end of proceeding but that would be for other not for at this stage third read huge number of member have indicate that they wish to speak in the debate hope that member will restrict themselves to reasonable amount of time after the two opening speech will advise on five minute to enable other colleague to participate we need short speech to enable all member or as many as possible to contribute shall make it clear that the chair retain the right to impose formal time limit but would rather colleague help each other after all it be an important day and we do want to hear as many view as possible beg to move that the bill be now read the third time it be an honour and privilege to open the debate on third reading of the terminally ill adult end of life bill it have be long journey to get here and do not underestimate the significance of this day it be not often that we be ask to wrestle with issue of morality ethic and humanity but with great privilege in this job come great responsibility and never more so than at time like this benjamin franklin tell we that in this world nothing can be say to be certain except death and taxis in this house we debate the latter incessantly but here and in the country as whole discuss death be something that we tend to shy away from yet it will come to we all and to all those we love we all have our own experience of death loss and grief there be good death and bad death like many have experience both appreciate that for some colleague the journey to this point have be difficult one want to pay tribute to the way in which the overwhelming majority of members have approach the subject second read back in november be quite rightly see as an example of parliament at its good contribution from across the chamber be incredibly powerful the atmosphere be respectful and people listen with care hope that we will see the same today want to thank you mr speaker and your team along with the fantastic clerks and procedural expert who have ensure that parliamentary protocol have be follow and have guide we through the intricacy of what can be complex parliamentary process one that be steep in tradition but not always easy to follow of course process be important but it be also important to remember that we be not vote on the merit of parliamentary procedure we be vote on an issue that matter deeply to our constituent indeed the issue before we be very personal for many people so many of our constituent but many of we as well it be an issue that transcend party politic thank colleague from across the house who have share their very personal story with be grateful to all colleague who have study the detail of the bill it be essential that we come to decision base on the content of what it actually say have be pleased to work with member on all side of the debate to ensure that the legislation be something that parliament can be proud of cogent workable bill that have one simple thread run through it the need to correct the profound injustice of the status quo and to offer compassionate and safe choice to terminally ill people who want to make it will not go into the amendment in detail as know that be not the purpose of this debate but whether by add further safeguard and protection for patient through additional training around coercive control the addition of specialist expertise through the inclusion of multidisciplinary panel widen the provision for professional to opt out of the assist dying process provide additional employment protection or prohibit the advertising of assist dying cross party working have strengthen the bill be grateful to the hon lady for give way what level of concern do it give she that between second reading and today grow canon of professional and their independent professional body have urge great caution about this bill not on the principle but because they be oppose to the detail of this bill and believe it should be defeat thank the hon gentleman for his intervention think what he be say be that people have get different view and they do have different view we have different view in this house and different people in different profession have different view every royal college have neutral position on assist dying because of that have be pleased to work with member on all side of the debate to ensure that this legislation be something that parliament can be proud of and the many safeguard in this bill ensure that only terminally ill patient who be eligible under the strict criterion and want to access assist dying can do so feel disturb by quite lot of the email that receive from constituent some of they who be my friend and people like imply that we here be either too stupid or careless to care for the most vulnerable be it not true that we all do care whatever decision we make today and that we have to continue to educate people and tell they what this bill be about thank the hon member for that intervention and she be absolutely right the detail do matter that be why be so grateful to colleague who have engage in the detail we know that there be different view within the public and we have to take on board the concern of vulnerable group that be why the safeguard be so important but would also say that there be no one more vulnerable than someone who be die will my hon friend give way be just go to make some progress patient must have an inevitably progressive illness or disease which can not be reverse by treatment and person be not consider to be terminally ill only because they have disability or mental disorder these clear strict criterion plus the multiple capacity assessment exclude possible serious mental health disorder such as anorexia be also very pleased to support the change advocate for by marie curie and hospice uk which would ensure an assessment of palliative and end of life care as part of the first report on the act we know from other country in no small part due to the month inquiry by the health and social care committee that palliative care and assist dying can and do work side by side to give terminally ill patient the care and choice they deserve in their final day it should not be an either or for die people and we need to channel our energy into support all option for terminally ill people be very grateful to the hon lady for give way as she know the lead expert in palliative care have come out to oppose the bill and they point to the fact that hospice be underfunde and do not have the same ability to serve patient therefore gently question whether we be in position today to make judgment that patient truly would have choice at the end of life thank he for his intervention but would say as have say previously that people work in palliative care have mixed range of view on this subject have meet with palliative care doctor and some be very supportive of change in the law because of the suffering they have see will my hon friend give way on that particular point be just go to make some progress if may but as be say it be an either or decision for we today either we vote for the safe effective workable reform contain in this bill or we say that the status quo be acceptable over recent month have hear hundred of story from people who have lose love one in deeply difficult and traumatic circumstance along with many terminally ill people themselves spend some time with some of these family yesterday they be real people with real story and they deserve to be hear adil terminally ill father take his own life by buy drug on the dark web it be his third attempt and adil find he in truly desperate state he and his sister will never get over that night nor the police investigation that follow katie wave her mum off as she make the lonely and costly journey to switzerland where she have peaceful and dignified death but the family have no chance to say proper goodbye and her dad make the journey home grieve and alone other have have to watch their love one die harrowing death despite receive excellent end of life care warwick wife ann suffer from peritoneal cancer have the maximum dose of sedative but it be not enough to stop the choking and suffocation and she beg he to help she put an end to her suffering but he do not want her last memory to be of he stand over she with pillow there be many many more such story perhaps most importantly have speak to terminally ill people themselves we have spend lot of time talk about they but not always with they pamela and sophie both have terminal breast cancer and they share their story yesterday pamela be proud christian who just want to have choice when her time come sophie who be allergic to opioid want to ensure that her beautiful daughter have nothing but happy memory of their time together not support the bill today be not neutral act it be vote for the status quo it fill with despair to think that mps could be here in another year time hear the same story thank my hon friend for give way she be be very kind come into this house support the principle of assist dying and think very carefully before vote against the bill on second reading there be differ view but want to ask my hon friend before mp put their name not to the principle of assist dying but to this bill specifically why the vast majority of primary care doctor geriatrician and group represent people with disability eat disorder and domestic violence be all opposed not to the principle but to this bill specifically some people who be supportive of the principle of assist dying do not support this specific bill can my hon friend explain their opposition think we have cover that point already these be not homogeneous group of people they have different view and opinion if we look at the inconsistency in the current law it just do not make sense if someone with terminal illness voluntarily stop eat and drink it be legal for they to starve themselves to death competent patient have the right to refuse food and fluid even if they will die the exercising of that right be sometimes propose as an alternative to assist dying suppose it could be argue that starve oneself to death be one way of take control at the end of life but it be deeply traumatic experience for the person and their loved one and there be people here today who have direct experience of that will my hon friend give way will make some progress we have system in which it legal for someone to starve themselves to death which can take day or week but where it be not legal for someone to seek assistance from doctor to take an approve substance themselves to end their pain or suffering and take back control in their die day it be also legal in this country for someone to discharge themselves from medical care or refuse life sustain treatment such as ventilation cpr or antibiotic as long as they have the mental capacity to do so and be make the decision of their own accord without harassment from anyone else colleague might think that be fine and agree but there be no requirement for two doctor psychiatrist and social worker and there be no lawyer or judge it be legal yet what be be propose in this bill with so many more safeguard and protection be not it simply do not make sense rise be not go to take any more intervention because lot of people want to speak then there be the criminal offence that the bill introduce none of which exist now include life imprisonment for anyone who induce another person to take the approve substance and year in prison for coercion dishonesty or pressure it be robust process that go far than any other piece of legislation in the world and it be far safe and significantly more compassionate than what we have now if we look internationally there be clear well establish safe and compassionate assisted die law in existence on tuesday join doctor from australia who use three key word repeatedly choice control and relief dr greg mewett have year of experience as gp and year as palliative care physician and he speak about the thorough approach that he have take to ensure safety and efficacy of the assist dying process perhaps the most stand out quote from that session come from dr jacky davis chair of healthcare professionals for assisted dying who say that by introduce assist die no more people will die but far few people will suffer this be not choice between live and die it be choice for terminally ill people about how they die fully appreciate that some colleague would never vote for any version of this bill and be respectful of that despite disagree with they however say to colleague who be supportive of change in the law but be hesitant about whether now be the time that if we do not vote for change in the law today we will have many more year of heartbreaking story from terminally ill people and their family of pain and trauma will my hon friend give way be go to finish there will be story of suicide attempt post traumatic stress disorder lonely trip to switzerland police investigation and everything else we have all hear of in recent month as the commission on assisted dying say in year ago the current legal status of assist dying in the uk be inadequate and incoherent it outsource healthcare issue abroad especially to dignita instead of the government and parliament assume responsibility that be year ago and we be in exactly the same position today thing have get to change as the government impact assessment state the bill will improve equity of choice ensure that terminally ill adult from all socioeconomic background can access end of life option within regulated and safe framework will draw my comment to close there be essentially two way in which we can look at the situation we be in we can look at it through legal lens as legislator we have duty to change the law where it be fail and when the last four director of public prosecutions tell we that the law need to change surely we have duty to listen we need scrutiny before people die not after most importantly there be the human lens which be how approach most thing give die people choice about how they die be about compassion control dignity and bodily autonomy surely we should all have the right will my hon friend give way be go to finish shortly surely we should all have the right to decide what happen to our body and decide when enough be enough of course give people the right to choose do not take away the right not to choose today we can vote with either our heart or with our head but either way we should end up in the same lobby on compassionate human level and as responsible lawmaker we should support this desperately need reform which be rigorous practical and safe and which be root in the principle that should underpin any legislation compassion justice and human dignity have no doubt that the vast majority in this house probably every single hon and right hon member be sympathetic to the underlying motivation of the bill which be to ease suffering in other and try to avoid suffer where possible for the most part the debate both in this chamber and in committee have be good natured and conduct in way that we can be proud of there have be wide question about the motivation of both the proponent and the opponent of the bill although this be not about any individual one of we think it be only fair that because some question have be ask put few thing on the record about my own position do not come at this from religious point of view be an atheist be humanist my position be drive by my concern about the practicality of the bill rather than any religious viewpoint it have be suggest particularly when people talk about their experience of talk to people who have lose love one or who be themselves terminally ill this have be say to on number of occasion that if we have see someone suffer we would agree with the bill have see someone suffer early this year my close friend die painfully of oesophageal cancer and be with he in the final week of his life come at this from position neither of faith nor of ignorance and hope that the house will take those factor into consideration when say what be about to say on the tv last night they do survey of gps the relationship between gp and patient be incredibly close when our child and grandchild come into the world our gp be involve when gp have to deliver diagnosis of terminal illness there be fear not just in the eye of the patient but in the eye of the gp the doctor the friend we all have do the right hon gentleman recognise the importance of today debate and vote it will change forever that relationship of trust between the gp and the patient it will do so in negative way and it will never change ever again will refer to the hon gentleman point later in my speech will try not to take too many intervention because many people have not have the chance to speak in the debate and want to give they the chance to do so on second reading make the point that we need to think about the detail of the bill and not just vote in accordance with the broad principle make the point that because it be private member bill the opportunity to change it fundamentally be limited and so we have an enhance duty to get it right first time we be tell on second reading that lot of the concern worry and detailed question would be resolve in committee we be promise the gold standard judicially underpin set of protection and safeguard those protection do not make it through committee have also hear people say where there be still problem issue and concern that the lords will do that work but none of we should think that it be right to subcontract our job to the other place we be make an incredibly important and fundamental change as the hon member for strangford jim shannon highlight in the relationship between medical professional and those they serve if we make that change we will introduce small but permanent question mark in the mind of every patient particularly patient who be discuss serious illness or terminal diagnosis what be this medical professional expecting of what be they think where be their head whereas with the situation we have at the moment the patient know that the medical professional be dutybound to do no harm and to preserve life and dignity wherever possible next tuesday will be the second anniversary of my sister death three week prior to her death we take she to hospital because she have blood infection despite agree to allow she into intensive care to sort out that blood infection the consultant then decide that she should not go because she have brain tumour and be go to die she be go to die but not at that moment be sure mr speaker that you can understand that very big row ensue win that row she be make well she come home and she die peacefully what do the right hon gentleman think would happen in identical circumstance if this bill pass the hon lady ask to speculate about set of circumstance that be personal and painful suspect that she and both know that the outcome could have be very different and that the moment she have with her sister just like those have with my dear friend might have be lose we have to recognise that this be an important moment while respect the hon member for spen valley kim leadbeater disagree with her assessment that it be now or never that it be this bill or no bill and that vote against it on third reading be vote to maintain the status quo none of those thing be true there will be plenty of opportunity indeed we be dutybound stimulate by this debate which be why do not criticise the hon lady for bring forward the bill to have serious conversation about palliative care many people will say that these be not conflict or contradictory position but and will crack on because otherwise you will tell off mr speaker we know that there could be circumstance where assist dying would be on statutory basis and the provision of palliative care would not we also have to address the point that we can all pray in aid individual and institution to reinforce our position on this but we can not subcontract our decision yes we can fish around for people to come up with the perfect quote to reinforce our argument but another five minute on wikipedia google or with friend of our in the medical profession will find another voice that oppose that yes it be mixed picture in the medical profession but be strike by the number of professional body that be neutral on the topic of assist dying in general but oppose to the provision within this bill in particular we can not just say they be neutral on assist dying and therefore this particular vehicle have to progress we carry responsibility it be what we be send here to do and we need to take it very seriously we must be rigorous on the specific detail in the bill just like the hon member for spen valley do not have time to go through every single argument that be have on second reading in committee and beyond but in order to ensure that we be rigorous there be three fundamental question that we should ask ourselves not lean on our friend and colleague but ask ourselves and ensure that we answer fully and honestly the right hon gentleman will remember that in he and work cross party on identify inequality within certain community and on get they to come forward for the covid vaccination do he agree that one question we parliamentarian need to ask ourselves be this how be it right that some community be deny basic healthcare within the current system how be it right that some community do not have access to good palliative care how be it right that some community still mistrust the medical profession and how be it right that we be not listen to their voice the hon lady make an incredibly important point and will touch on that briefly in my remark be minded to take no more intervention because otherwise will be steal time from other there be three question we need to ask first be we happy for this bill not for the principle but for this bill as draft to become law many of the element that have already discuss be concern in the criterion set out medical professional do not need to seek deep motivation we have say there be not real choice between palliative care and assist dying because one will have statutory underpinning and the other will not as say the gold standard protection be lose in committee because number of professional body and will the right hon member give way need to make progress number of professional body have say they do not have the capacity they do not have enough people to fill the slot that this bill demand of they secondly in term of fundamental change be hon and right hon member genuinely happy to write the blank cheque that this bill demand it be normal for the secretary of state of government department to decide when piece of legislation come into force and they make their decision base on the state ability to deliver that legislation commencement date matter they be not just some arbitrary date on piece of paper understand people desire to ensure that this can not be lose down the back of the sofa when it come to government work but when the people on whom we would rely to deliver this bill say that they be not ready and that they do not feel that they will be ready they do not have enough people and they do not have enough capacity so they will have to take resource from current provision to move across to this provision which will be drive by statutory requirement and lock in commencement date we should listen if the people who be go to make this work and work as well as we hope it will if it become legislation say that they be not confident that they can make it happen we should be very careful about demand that they prioritise this that be what this legislation say they will prioritise this above any other work that they might otherwise do thirdly the hon member for spen valley hint at this and mention it in an intervention in an early stage of the bill on coercion on the pressure that individual put on themselves and on medical professional raise the issue we know that there be inequality in health provision already none of which will be address by the bill there be certain community and certain people in those community particularly woman who be overly deferential to man and to man in authority can we genuinely say that we have no fear whatsoever about potentially vulnerable woman sit in front of medical professional who raise assist dying even if they do not imply that it be the right thing for she to do the very fact that they bring it up will have significant influence on that woman thinking we can not believe that the effect will be completely neutral across all community with the safeguard that have be put in the bill there will be panel that look at those issue and ask question like have your doctor persuade you to do this do we honestly think that social worker psychiatrist or lawyer be totally incapable of find coercion that be exactly what the panel be there to do and that be exactly what those safeguard will provide the hon lady make an important point but refer she to my second question those body say that they do not have the people to populate those panel yet that be what the commencement date demand the principle of have person or group of people to protect against coercion be important be talk not just about coercion but about how people perceive people in authority but royal college and social worker have tell we that they do not believe they will be ready to put those guardrail in place by the commencement date we should listen to they this be an important debate that have stimulate an important conversation which demand our full attention but do not believe that the bill be ready to go to the other place it be interesting that there be both proponent and opponent of the bill who hope that the lords will make significant change to the bill that should surely set off alarm bell ultimately because the bill be such fundamental change we need to ensure that there be an enhanced level of scrutiny of its detail we all want to avoid and alleviate suffer wherever possible but do not believe that we have have the opportunity to get the bill into the right shape that be why will oppose third reading and encourage other to do likewise order after the two opening speech we will now have five minute limit and hope that member will restrict themselves to up to five minute the mother of the house will now give we very good example this may be the most fateful bill that we discuss this parliament it be literally matter of life and death have hear talk today of the injustice of the current situation what could be more unjust than someone lose their life because of poorly draft legislation we hear about panel the people talk about panel presumably have not have much to do with they would not put my life or the life of anyone dear to in the hand of panel of official stress right from the beginning that it be perfectly possible to support assist dying as do but not be prepared to vote for this bill there be so much that be problematic about it first as believe be widely understand there have not be enough time to debate the bill secondly bill of this seriousness should be give more time do the right hon lady find it rather peculiar that the previous parliament spend hour discuss the death of fox and about hour discuss the death of fellow human there have be lot of talk about there be no evidence of coercion but within the family the most powerful coercion be silence it be the failure to answer when question be put if police can not spot coercion in domestic violence how can they be expect to spot coercion in assisted dying the royal college of pathologists and the former chief coroner have point out that without role for coroner the bill raise the possibility of foul play when an amendment be table in committee to deal with that however it be oppose the bill would allow private for profit contractor to run an assist die service with no profit cap and no transparency but when an amendment be table in committee to deal with that point it be oppose we have hear and we will hear over and over again in this debate about choice this bill may produce choice for those of we like almost everybody in this house who have for the entirety of their adult life be confident in deal with authority and institution but even then the bill would need amendment but what choice do the bill hold for someone who all their life have lack agency particularly in family context which may be particularly the case in certain culture and community and what choice do the bill offer to those who lack access to good palliative care as the former prime minister gordon brown have put it our law should not focus on the few who wish for assist dying and do too little to support the majority of those face their final day who want and deserve access to the good of palliative care what choice be it for those who think that because their doctor raise it with they at all they be be guide in that direction an amendment that might have address that issue be reject in committee it be possibility that proponent of the bill do not take seriously at all but anyone who know how institution work should be watchful of it come to this house to be voice for the voiceless that have not always be favour by my own leadership but that be why come to the house who could be more voiceless than somebody who be in their sick bed and believe that they be die ask members in this debate to speak up for the voiceless one more time there be no doubt that if the bill be pass in its current form there will be people among the most vulnerable and marginalise in our society who lose their life unnecessarily therefore implore the house to reject this bill not because be oppose to assist dying in principle but because my concern be for vulnerable and marginalised person and community rise order reiterate the admonition that mr speaker have offer this be one of the most far reach consideration that the house even those of we who have be here for very long time can remember it be understandable that lot of member will wish to take part from across the house and on both side of the argument but look around it be quite clear that we can not accommodate everybody this mean there will inevitably be considerable number of intervention all would say gently be that intervention will be take into account when consider the order of priority in which member be call start off by say huge thank you to the hon member for spen valley kim leadbeater for the extraordinary amount of work she have do across this whole debate this be the first time have speak in this debate and like many member whose speech have hear come to it through personal experience have hear many story of people whose relation have die in my case it be my mother who die in she be diagnose with pancreatic cancer my father in law be consultant so phone he up and ask what that mean and he say that she have chance of die be prepare for it but eventually the time come when get the call say that her health have start to deteriorate so go down to see she speak to the whips and take time off work here and watch the start of the decline from something as painful and difficult as pancreatic cancer which as those who have witness it will know be not nice moment my mother be not frightened of die at all she would talk about it she know that she be go to die however she be terrify of the pain and on many occasion she ask and caroline my wife if we could make it end we could not of course she have very very good care from the nhs the nurse come twice day she be on morphine driver and the gp come to see she so she be look after well however as she deteriorate we could see that she be in indignity and huge amount of pain until eventually she die it be of course not one of the happy moment of my life contrary to that experience two or three year ago find myself go to the memorial service of one of my constituent who be truly wonderful person she too have die of pancreatic cancer but because she have be in spain at the time she spend quite lot of time in spain with her husband she have the opportunity to go through the state provide assisted die programme that be provide there speak to her widower very briefly and it be fascinating to talk to he about it he say it be an extraordinary incredibly sad thing to have go through but that it be something that make she suffer much less it be almost sort of quiet sunday afternoon when it happen see those two people my mother who have the indignity and the pain and the suffering that she be terrify of and my constituent who have the opportunity to end it in dignified way and when come to this debate be absolutely convinced that this be the right thing to do have spend the past six or seven month engage as hard as could with those who hop would be able to persuade of different decision to try to persuade that be wrong in my assumption have speak to huge number of people have join in meeting with campaigner have read every email that have come in and have speak to doctor and religious leader and have yet to be persuade that this be bad thing to do there have be huge amount of debate here over hour of debate when we add it all together there have be load of amendment and people on both side of the debate have be incredibly thoughtful but be we possibly get rid of the good in try to find the perfect do not know be not the world great legislator but have listen to these debate and give what have see at first hand at the end of the day can only go through the aye lobby to support the hon member for spen valley in all this extraordinary hard work the time have come when we need to end suffering where suffering can be put aside rather than try to do something super perfect and allow too many more people to suffer in the future start by thank my hon friend the member for spen valley kim leadbeater all the member who serve on the committee and indeed the whole house for the approach that everyone have take to this bill want to make it clear that come to this bill with an open mind like many support it in principle at first glance but this debate be no long about the principle of assist death that be not the decision before we today it be not the issue on which we will walk through the lobby when we decide to vote for or against this bill our responsibility in this place be to make sure that the bill be safe workable and effective that be the test that will lead we to vote for or against the bill today as the bill stand it present public safety issue speak to the hon lady beforehand and understand her concern they be the same concern have on behalf of those who have anorexia those with mental health condition troubled people those who would be vulnerable when this idea be present to they do she think like do that this bill do not in any way address the issue of those who be vulnerable when it come to assist dying thank the hon member for his intervention think he might have read some of my speech which will carry on with will set out why the bill be not safe and speak about the two amendment that table amendment which we have nod through today and amendment which we will not get the chance to vote on amendment deal with the issue of voluntarily stop eating and drinking or vsed which have be use as bridge to assist death in other jurisdiction be pleased that my hon friend the member for spen valley accept that amendment but let be very clear this do not close the anorexia loophole that be the subject of another amendment voluntarily stop eating and drinking be not what happen to people with anorexia people with anorexia stop eat and drink because they have psychiatric illness those be two categorically different issue must make it absolutely clear that even though amendment have pass today it do not address concern about anorexia or close that loophole member in the other place be already raise the concern that because this be private member bill they do not believe that they can provide all the necessary safeguard if we give third reading today to bill that be not safe to be deliver to the public at least woman with anorexia in multiple country have die by assist death when they need treatment not help to die every one of they be assess to have capacity by two doctor will my hon friend give way will make some progress hundred of eat disorder expert doctor lawyer charity family member and people with live experience urge parliament to close this loophole and support amendment as committee we fail to heed their warning we have now learn that the one remain amendment that could protect people with eat disorder will not even be vote on our responsibility be to make the bill safe we know what happen when politician think they know well than the expert let we make it clear the royal college of psychiatrists the royal college of physicians the royal college of pathologists palliative care doctor the british geriatrics society almost every eat disorder charity and almost every disabled people group do not support this bill that be not because they do not believe in the principle they be warn we about the danger of this bill and of get this wrong our job be not to be activist to fight until our last breath for the principle whatever shape or form it be deliver in of course we believe in cause that be why each and every one of we be in parliament but we legislator must listen to the expert heed the evidence scrutinise and debate the idea that be before we and deliver for our constituent law that be safe workable and effective we have proud history the like of florence nightingale the lady with the lamp break every barrier possible to heal the wounded provide care for the vulnerable and reduce the chance of death those be the principle that our great nhs be found on we must ask ourselves whether those fundamental principle will still be intact if the bill pass will they be there to protect those who face postcode lottery in healthcare and palliative care the most vulnerable and those who have face the great hardship in life and feel like burden will those principle be there to protect those who feel like give up but whom we could help back up and push towards well life instead we will be give they way to give up even if they could have survive this be the question for all member what be the margin of error that we be willing to risk today when it come to something as serious as death urge member to vote against this bill the mother of the house the right hon member for hackney north and stoke newington ms abbott be absolutely right to stress the importance of give voice to the voiceless that be role that many member in this house take deeply seriously include proponent of this bill no one be more voiceless in this debate than those terminally ill adult who suffer painful traumatic and undignified death under the current system as well as their family nothing that could say make the case for this bill not just the principle but this bill more powerfully than this letter from my constituent which be adapt to protect her anonymity follow diagnosis of an aggressive tumour my partner final day be agony he struggle to breathe and swallow and lose his ability to speak he be incontinent develop painful bedsore he repeatedly ask for help to end his life enter his room to see that he have stuff yard of his top sheet into his mouth in an attempt to suffocate it be the most distressing sight and one will never forget live with this image and can not share it with our child this could have be avoid with an assist die law agree with the hon member that people in those circumstance should be able to seek an assisted death however the bill allow someone to say to doctor on panel want to go because do not want to be burden even if they be not suffer at that point in time it also allow they to say want to go now so that my family have large inheritance why should we support bill this afternoon that allow those thing the hon member will be aware that the bill create criminal offence that would punish those who would coerce relative in such way hon member self coerce there be folk who talk about the concept of self coercion but other would frame such decision as choice self coercion be choice my constituent say this could have be avoid with an assist die law my partner be from jurisdiction where such law exist relative use that law they be able to gather their family say proper goodbye and die in peace and with dignity before lose all physical and mental capacity will the hon member give way on that point will not to give other the chance to speak after my constituent go on to say the procedure to enable this be protract and have several safeguard which would prevent much of the concern we hear about by those oppose urge you to support this bill the bill and not just the principle will do so because the status quo be completely unacceptable and must be reform as young doctor would have find the measure that we be debate completely unconscionable but now that be an old doctor feel sure that this be an essential change that be because of what have see over year in hospital our patient be at the centre of my thought as we consider this profound change we must of course invest in palliative care and we have some of the good palliative care in the world in this country some will say that there be no limit to the comfort that expert palliative care can deliver but that have not be my observation particularly as think about some of my patient with advanced disfigure head and neck cancer and about the terrible loss of dignity and autonomy that have see that be what people fear and that be why believe that we be right to give people choice final autonomous choice applaud the bill committee and thank the many witness who contribute for this be not easy work the house have spend hour debate the amendment the panel of the legal expert the social worker and the psychiatrist will ensure oversight and scrutiny and have no doubt that this be well than single judge no matter how distinguished or wise family circumstance free will and mental state will all be consider do not think we will see coercion to undergo assist dying family be more likely to talk patient out of it call this bill to assist people who be die the measure be not for people who be not die people who be terminally ill may live for long time they be not yet die and the measure be for they until they be all of we must make the very good of every day whether our life be long or short of course that be especially true for those with terminal diagnosis the vulnerable must be protect and believe that the bill will indeed protect they people who be disabled and who have mental health disorder profound sadness as our life be end be quite normal and clinical depression should be treat but my observation be that the patient we be talk about be clear headed and very rational the idea that we risk open floodgate or some sort of mission creep be quite wrong people will have choice and will make arrangement to be use only if need that will give final peace of mind it be final insurance policy let come back to the patient have treat over my long career and to the wise word of the nurse who have be my compassionate colleague for many year she say this be an essential change there be the matron who recall the carotid blow out of her patient as student many year ago an image that never leave she there be the absolute sanctity of human life but we be not deal with choice between life and death we be deal with death or death there be also the sanctity of human dignity and fundamental to that be surely choice who be we to deny that to the dying many member present will look forward to the day when it be possible for people in this country to die in peace with dignity and at time of their choosing the opportunity to bring that about be close than ever before but it can happen only if member vote against the bill today the express will of the house as reflect in the second reading vote the momentum generate by the bill and the support of the prime minister as we understand it to change the law have create moment when it be possible to grasp the chance to bring in assist die legislation but warn member that if this bill pass the case for assist dying will be fatally undermine and it will put back their cause for generation have sit through committee and report listen to the oral evidence and participate in the debate this bill if it pass will be challenge in the court it will be subject to endless attempt to amend it in parliament it will be difficult to implement effectively and ultimately it will lose the confidence of the public it be immensely challenging to properly debate the bill in committee because we frequently find ourselves need an understanding of medical practice or point of law that mp be not typically expert in we spend many hour for example debate whether or not the provision of the mental capacity act be sufficient for someone who be make the decision to die of course we consult expert and some say the provision be sufficient some say they be not do not believe that this particular decision be one that politician be well place to make will the hon lady give way be sorry but will make progress we would all have be well serve by ask team of expert to evaluate the evidence draw on their professional experience and come to settle consensus among themselves on this point about mental capacity and likewise the question we have about how good to approach anorexia within the context of assist dying and whether the bill provide suitable framework for the provision and control of drug design for the ending of life these be not political decision they have however be decide by politician and we have approach they in our usual adversarial way where the right answer be not the one arrive at after careful thought consideration and consultation but the one that can muster the most vote we have therefore reach most unsatisfactory conclusion this legislation impose duty and responsibility on professional who do not think they compatible with their expert practice it be amend in committee to require that panel approve an application for assist dying and that the panel include psychiatrist the royal college of psychiatrists have state that it oppose this legislation will the hon lady give way will not give way sorry assisted die under this legislation can not be implement without psychiatrist but they would be act outside the advice and guidance of their professional body will my hon friend give way be not give way will there be sufficient psychiatrist prepare to implement the provision of this legislation against the advice of their professional body to ensure that enough panel can be convene for the purpose of facilitate assist die it be hard to see how there could be will my hon friend give way be not give way by contrast many decision be expressly reserve for politician should the limited resource of the nhs be use to deliver an assist die service or should it be possible to offer the service as profit make enterprise what information should be collect and report about assist die who should oversee and regulate its practitioner member of parliament be to have no say over any of those matter at all those be all power to be reserve to the secretary of state to be decide behind close door once again this legislation grant these responsibility to people who do not want they neither the current health secretary nor the current justice secretary be supporter of this bill after today the house of commons will be shut out of further decision making on this bill even though many of the decision still to be make be rightfully ours to make the lack of professional consensus or acceptance of the requirement of this legislation couple with lack of political scrutiny of many of its more important provision create an unstable foundation upon which to build an assisted die service for such service to succeed it need professional willing to deliver it who can have confidence that they be act within the law and will be support by their professional peer and by society at large do not see how this legislation can deliver that it be instructive to compare this piece of legislation with the abortion act that too be private member bill bring to this house by the liberal mp david steel but it be precede by medical advisory committee chair by the president of the royal college of obstetricians and gynaecologists which approve the bill the professional who would be need to enact the legislation have indicate their support for the bill before it reach the commons the bill only delegate one power to the secretary of state the legislation be hotly debate then as now but once it be pass it come into force within six month remarkably with the exception of amendment require to bring it into line with successive human fertilisation and embryology acts and to extend its provision to northern ireland the provision that the abortion act bring into law have remain almost entirely unchanged in year until just this week in fact the careful consideration of the issue that take place before the legislation come to the commons combine with the fact that all its provision be include within the primary legislation to be debate and vote on in one go have enable settle consensus to develop around abortion provision in this country in contrast to other jurisdiction it have enable vulnerable woman to seek the help they need and give healthcare worker the confidence and support they require to meet those need that be what we need if we want to deliver successful assisted die service and this legislation can not deliver that if member want assist die vote against this bill and make the most of the moment to press for well approach that can deliver sustainable framework accept and support by the medical profession and in which the public can have confidence if people life be go to be end prematurely as result of this legislation that we pass we can not take risk we can not afford to pass this bill this be my first speech in this chamber since the general election and if be honest wish be not speak in this debate as wish this legislation be not be put forward have not always be oppose to assist dying indeed in vote in favour of the bill put forward by rob marris mp but that be before serve four year as shadow minister for disabled people during that time speak to hundred of disabled people and the organisation that support they they be and remain extremely fearful of assist dying take on that role at the start of the covid pandemic disabled people be disproportionately affect by the pandemic nearly six in every people who die be disabled many have do not resuscitate notice unilaterally paste on their medical record without they be inform it make they fear for their life it make they fear that the authority think that their life be worth less it also make they fearful of what would happen if assist die be bring forward that be why disability rights uk and other disabled people organisation have move from the neutral position they have in to position of opposition now do not claim that every disabled person oppose assist dying but do claim that the vast majority of disabled people and their organisation oppose it they need the health and social care system fix first they want we as parliamentarian to assist they to live not to die disabled people voice matter in this debate and yet as have watch the bill progress the absence of disabled people voice have be astonishing they have want to engage indeed they have be cry out to be include yet the engagement have be negligible believe that only one disabled people organisation be give the opportunity to provide evidence to the committee furthermore throughout committee and at the initial publication stage of the bill accessible format be not available large print version of the bill be publish several week after the original but no other format such as easy read and british sign language have be make available these be basic thing that we should be do when consult on such important piece of legislation make it accessible so that everyone voice and view can be hear many of those expect to deliver this legislation also do not want it they believe that it could destroy the doctor patient relationship the expert have all be clear the royal college of psychiatrists the royal college of physicians gps disability charity mental health charity and domestic abuse charity have all warn that the safeguard in the bill be insufficient and will put vulnerable people in harm way will finish by say that be not oppose to the principle of assist dying but until we have system that support the right to life can not support it until we ensure that all safeguard be in place can not support it and until the vast majority of disabled people and their organisation support the legislation that be be bring forward can not support it we be not vote on principle today this be real and we have to protect those people who be susceptible to coercion who already feel like society do not value they who often feel like burden to the state society and their family urge anyone in this chamber who have any doubt that this bill do not protect they who have any worry and concern please do not vote for it today let we fix our nhs social care and wide society first and then consider this topic again in the future when the time be right have not speak so far in these debate but have listen and attend on pretty much all occasion be move to speak today because be concerned this be the point that the hon member for lewisham north vicky foxcroft make but what be this debate today about this debate be not about the principle of what we believe in when it come to assist dying whether we be oppose to it or in favour of it we have that debate on second reading as the mother of the house the right hon member for hackney north and stoke newington ms abbott make very clear in what must say be an excellent speech and as other have too today third reading debate be about what we be about to pass on to the house of lords which will become law and the single question we have to ask ourselves be be this genuinely workable now the hon member for spen valley kim leadbeater who move the motion know that have high regard for she have work with she on other thing but honestly have to say that simply can not see how we in this house can pass this piece of legislation through to the other house in the vague hope that somehow it will do well than we and make change such that it will become workable piece of legislation and that be because this be private member bill if government be to introduce bill like this we would see great deal more input and huge amount more checking with all those body for example we be tell on second reading that the safeguard and protection we be send to committee would somehow become the most robust and strong in the world in fact in committee they get weaken not strengthen and that be the problem in all this will the right hon gentleman give way on that point if the hon lady will forgive understand that many other want to speak so be go make bit of progress if she do not mind the other important point when we think about what our vote today be all about be the behaviour of the professional body that have be consult on this which have come out for the most part very strongly opposed to this legislation every medical college have retain neutral position by my will go on by my count two or three medical college have say expressly that they welcome specific amendment to the bill and all mp will have receive the letter from senior psychiatrist who include former president of the college who say we believe the draft legislation be workable safe and compassionate number of safeguard have be include in the bill do the right hon gentleman recognise that additional safeguard have be include and have be welcome by various royal college simply do not agree with the hon lady on that reading the professional body be completely divided and most have come out in opposition to the nature of this legislation it be all very well for she to say that and appreciate she right to say it and hope she get to speak later but just do not agree with it as be say early in the debate the whole issue of mental capacity be not deal with properly in the structure of this bill the hon member for spen valley talk about this early and she be absolutely right even the amendment that be propose be not always accept and we be leave now with some area that will be deeply troubling we simply can not accept that the lords must make these change for we for we have to make they first that be the key the one big important area here absolutely agree with my constituency neighbour the health secretary on this be that we talk lot about choice in die but how be that choice inform if palliative care in the uk be simply not good enough again the mother of the house speak about this and there be so many people affect the most vulnerable the people furthest away from institution and the one who understand least how to work the health service or their local authority and who rely mostly on we to try and break through they will be face with this problem more than almost anybody else because they look in fear on these institution help to set up child hospice which think be the first in london there have be many more since but child hospice as we know be really badly treat by government spending pretty much no matter who be in power they have less than anybody else haven house which help to set up and raise money for have give very strong quote which think represent much of what most of those hospice have say we would fully agree that change in the law would have very significant consequence for the delivery of palliative care service and would be challenge give the exist resource pressure that we face the hospice sector be experience significant financial pressure and the exceptional palliative care service we provide be not financially sustainable the introduction of assist dying would create new and demanding requirement for palliative care service and hospice in particular it be therefore vital whether or not the current legislation be pass that the government take urgent action to resolve this matter that be the case today we can not just say well that not our problem palliative care can be change the trouble be that we have be unable to make the necessary change to palliative care because we take such parti pris position that be the problem we face will end with this will vote against the bill mostly because believe it be fundamentally unworkable and will lead to huge problem we have see what have happen elsewhere internationally canada oregon and various other place where legislation slide and slide again as more and more amendment have to be make because these thing be not workable to those who have any doubt simply say this this be third reading it be not second reading it be not an in principle debate we have that debate and now we have to decide whether we should send this unworkable piece of legislation to another place which be unelecte to make the decision for we because we can not come to conclusion we can not let this go through rise to speak in support of the bill on third reading because at its very heart be terminally ill adult people who be die people who have less than six month to live people who have try to stay alive to beat terrible disease with expert medical treatment but to no avail now they face the inevitable that they will die in fact that be the only thing any of we know we will ever do really be sure that most of we think about and desire peaceful pain free death where we slip off in our sleep at ripe old age have live good life but the reality be that all of we and all our citizen those for whom we legislate in this place could face painful and undignified death that be why believe that in the century like grow number of other country we should change the law to permit choice at the end of life or rather choice towards the end of death so that die people can opt to have death in the manner of their choosing and have an element of control over those last day yougov polling publish yesterday again show that the public the citizen we serve back it too with support assist dying in principle and support the bill as it stand as co sponsor of the bill and have serve on the bill committee be pleased that it be have more scrutiny challenge and debate than almost any other piece of legislation over hour in fact will the hon member give way be sorry but we be short of time the change that have be make include many propose by member who do not support change in the law but which have be adopt by the promoter of the bill my hon friend the member for spen valley kim leadbeater as well as those propose during the process she have lead in response to evidence submit during the scrutiny process have lead to well bill the bill have great safeguard for more vulnerable people with mandatory training requirement include in relation to coercion and capacity the bill ensure judicial oversight of decision making by range of expert include psychiatrist social worker and senior legal professional the bill will set out statutory protection for those worker who do not wish to take part in the assisted dying process on the basis of conscience and quite right too the bill will provide for one of the tight safest assist die law in the world importantly the bill have compassion at its core by afford die people choice at the end of life thank every one of my constituent who share their view with whether for or against change in the law particularly thank all those who have disagree with because good democracy and the right to disagree respectfully be hugely important perhaps it be debate for another time also thank all those who have share their personal story of love one death some brutal painful and traumatic stark reminder that the status quo be simply unacceptable other have share experience with love one who in other jurisdiction such as australia be able to have peaceful death surround by love one and at time of their choosing as come to close although not everyone would want to choose an assisted death believe that everyone should have the opportunity to choose one if they so wish it really be time that this house take the important compassionate and humane step towards make that reality by vote for the terminally ill adult end of life bill that be four minute speech thank you very much now call the father of the house have serve for many year with the right hon member for hackney north and stoke newington ms abbott and dare say it we have not agree on everything over the year but we have publish few article on this topic those article have always start with the fundamental principle of the nhs some of we maybe myself include have be rather critical of the nhs over the year but at least when we go into the nhs we know that everybody be really try their good to preserve life that be the fundamental principle the reason why the right hon lady and both oppose the bill be that as have be say several time we be not talk about just principle here we be talk about an actual bill know some people will criticise and say oh you would oppose this because of your religious view and all the rest of it actually take quite sensible and hope pragmatic approach to this have listen to all these debate and we have hear so many harrowing story of people last hour think we should treat people on both side of this argument with respect understand their point of view and respect the dignity of die people have always take the view that we should open up this debate actually have bring forward ten minute rule bill which of course will be object to at half past this afternoon say that we should have full study lead by the department of health and social care by health professional to work out how we can help people in their final hour have be to many hospice and care home and talk to many palliative care specialist who assure that they have the resource and skill nowadays to make those final hour pain free and bearable but we have hear testimony from other say that that be not possible if they could convince that there be some extreme case where people be die in agony totally lack in dignity in their final hour then would listen to those argument but do not think that be the bill that we have before we today therefore urge member to remember that we will be vote on bill and think that the bill be so riddled through with difficulty and inconsistency think it will be subject to human right legislation it be very difficult to argue that we can ask somebody to assist in person death when they be within six month of dying of cancer although there be no universal testimony or acceptance about how we work out those six month but not if they be suffer from some appalling degenerative disease or be quadriplegic or have no quality of life so think there be actually an argument that if we pass this bill today we will move in the direction of canada and we will have death on demand will end on this point before vote for this bill just pause for moment and think would it be well we have hear about the many hour on the abortion bill and the universality of clinical acceptance of it before we vote for this bill do we not think that we should ask the health department to have profound and knowledgeable study work with the royal college on whether it be possible to have decent palliative care not just in our wonderful hospice but in all our hospital there be no doubt that in recent year particularly since shipman there have be fear among many nhs health professional about provide that degree of palliative care that degree of morphine fentanyl or these hugely effective modern drug so just pause and think we be not vote on principle we can come back to this and at later date we can get consensus and we can have really good bill that will allow everybody to die in dignity will speak briefly and cover just three point do not expect to persuade those commit to oppose the bill to change their mind hope that do not persuade those support it to change theirs this be the time to put our conclude thought on the record before seek their lordship opinion start where finish my speech on second reading agency since that debate last november have continue to meet constituent on both side of the argument and answer hundred of letter and email be sure that other hon member have do the same have meet mainly with group that oppose the bill include faith group because they have seek to change my mind have not change my mind be still drive by the plight of those suffer unnecessarily at the end of life wholly respect the decision of those who would not want assist die for themselves but can not accept their right to deny that choice to those who would for the most profound reason use the provision of the bill to end their life the pain suffering indignity and degradation of slow painful torture death be something none of we would wish on friend or relative on anyone if that suffer at the end of life in the narrow circumstance prescribe by the bill can be avoid who be we to deny that will my hon friend give way be not go to give way the obvious qualification to what should be clear and personal choice to leave life in matter and at time of one choosing be the risk of coercion and that have rightly dominate much of the debate for the past eight month there be two point to be make here first great effort have be expend and be reflect in amendment to the bill to make the safeguard as comprehensive and watertight as possible learn from and go beyond practice in other jurisdiction compliance with the provision of the bill be rigorous process but it be also practical one it be design to be transparent and to test the intent of the person seek an assisted death secondly some say that that be still not enough but with what be they compare it the answer at good and in some case be the status quo which may involve an investigation post mortem as to whether assistance have be give put caring love one at risk of prosecution but do nothing to prevent those of malign intent finally although have try to see both side on every issue there be one point on which the opponent of the bill be in my opinion just wrong whether the bill have thus far see due process have be in parliament for month over year and can think of few bills of this length and scope that have receive so much scrutiny and so many hour in committee or on which so much evidence have be submit and comment make member will vote against the bill for many reason even though by do so they restrict the choice of other they should compare the regime pre and post legislation and hope decide that the bill give great protection but ask they not to vote against it because we have lack the time or information to make decision we have not or because we do not as country have the ability to resource the bill we do great trust and great opportunity have be give to the member of this parliament this be the moment of decision and we should discharge it to the good of our ability thank you madam deputy speaker for call to speak for the first time on this bill do not vote on second reading in november in her opening speech this morning the hon member for spen valley kim leadbeater say that we could choose to vote with our head or with our heart and have be grapple with that tension and conflict over the past few month be afraid that can not agree with the chair of the justice committee the hon member for hammersmith and chiswick andy slaughter that the bill be strong now than it be on second reading my sympathy for the principle of assist dying be as strong as it ever be the idea of face painful death or bad watch love one in pain at the end of their life frighten but if there be one thing that frighten more than that that terrify it be the idea that someone love might choose to accelerate their death imagine it to be one last act of kindness for those of we who care so deeply for they and take away the opportunity for one last birthday together one last christmas share or even for something as simple as picnic the hon gentleman be make powerful point can he foresee circumstance in which child with anorexia turn decide to get assist die and the first time the family hear about it be after they have die be afraid that as the father of year old daughter can identify with that question bit too directly although should add that she do not suffer with anorexia of course it would terrify any parent that that could ever happen on that point will the hon gentleman give way no must continue the hon lady have intervene multiple time the promoter of the bill the hon member for spen valley have do well with some of the safeguard around coercion but the argument around coercion as we normally understand they from legal point of view miss the point we be talk not about where someone with improper aim and motif set out to cause someone to take course of action that they would not otherwise take but something much more subliminal it may be the wish to avoid be burden or read too much into the doctor suggestion when they raise assist death as something to consider few year ago be seriously ill at my most ill the doctor say that have chance of die within week when regain consciousness there be nothing that the doctor suggest to that argue over whether it be test an angiogram or any other procedure in my circumstance if have be in position where assist dying be possibility and the doctor have raise it entirely neutrally do not know how would have interpret it some member have speak of place high value on life as if it be some preoccupation of the religiously obsess be christian be very middle of the road anglican although do not take my faith lightly my church have never tell how to vote on an issue and it will certainly not tell how to vote on this one do appreciate particularly with my own experience that life be precious but one do not need to believe in an omniscient and omnipresent god to hold the view that life be precious and that we should take measure to shorten it only very carefully as say at the start do not believe that the bill have get well there be serious concern about it genuinely do not know whether it be possible to put in adequate safeguard to ensure that assist dying can be available for the case where we would like to see it but that would safeguard those difficult case the one that the mother of the house the right hon member for hackney north and stoke newington ms abbott speak so powerfully about in her very impressive and meaningful speech what do know be that if there be way this bill do not do it that be why will be vote against it on second reading in late november want to express the concern that have with the bill around coercion commercialisation and the pressure on people who feel that they be burden unfortunately there be not enough time in that debate and there be not much time today either during that debate the house be repeatedly reassure by some member that the bill be about to undergo rigorous scrutiny process in committee the question on second reading that we be most implored to consider be whether we want to keep talk about the bill indeed the right hon member for goole and pocklington david davis who be not in his place say it well say to both the bill sponsor that it have number of area that they know think they have to put right about dozen in truth official report november vol while the time for talk be quickly run out this bill remain far from ready too many concern remain partially or wholly unaddressed these thing have not be put right let highlight three of the issue that be originally concerned about first on the issue of coercion seven month on from second reading the bill still do not even define dishonesty coercion or pressure let say that clearly again it do not define coercion if we as legislator can not do that then who will far with the exclusion in the bill of assisted death from the coronial system vital opportunity have be miss to include the investigative oversight that would be most likely to spot coercion even if it be after the fact of assist dying secondly the marketisation of assisted die worry greatly and do not believe that it have be properly address in the bill we already know from last week debate that there be loophole in the advertising ban where future secretaries of state for health and social care could decide to launch public health information campaign on television online or in gp surgery outline the option of assist dying even bad in my view be the certain involvement of private commercial interest in assisted dying when we combine the know cost to the state from the impact assessment and the unknown cost the limited resource currently available within the nhs and the conscientious objection of large swathe of doctor which be surely inevitable we can foresee that assist dying will be largely privatised commercial operator with shareholder and desire to maximise profit will inevitably be deliver assist death in such circumstance they will find way to grow their revenue include through market it however subtly thirdly on the issue of feel burden on second read my hon friend the member for cowdenbeath and kirkcaldy melanie ward raise the issue of washington state where of those go through with an assisted death in similar process to the one propose in the bill do so because they fear be burden on family friend caregiver there have be no meaningful response to that argument in my opinion from those in favour of the bill ask colleague in favour of pass the bill to consider the follow scenario an old relative know that assist death be now possible and that their family be struggle to get by in difficult economic circumstance they have health condition with prognosis of five month to live even though study show that most such prognosis be wrong about of the time what will stop our parent or grandparent from decide to seek assist dying purely to do the right thing by their love one on that point will my hon friend give way have nearly finish for that matter what will stop relative anxious to receive their inheritance from subtly push the option of assist death to conclude as legislator the responsibility fall on we in this place to create outstanding legislation that provide clarity certainty and benefit to our constituent and to the country at large yet all my concern from the start of the process still remain indeed they have only grow we have repeatedly hear today that there be no alternative to this bill and that the status quo be the alternative well we have agency in this place the choice that we be make today be big change to the status quo so why can we not do other thing it be not simply choice between this bill and nothing else therefore will be vote against the bill and encourage colleague to do the same those of we who have come here today to support the bill do not speak lightly of life and death as some have accuse we we come here to recognise that this house have responsibility to draw line where there be none many of we have campaign for many year as the mother of the house the right hon member for hackney north and stoke newington ms abbott say to give voice to die people not because they want to be rescue but because time and again they be beg we for mercy it be worth reiterate that this bill be about not choose death but how to face death when it be already at the door it be about that final chapter of life that short chapter as many of our constituent have tell we time and again it be chapter that they write in pain fear and desperation we be here today to ask simple question in essence be the law in those final often agonising moment to be barrier be we to be barrier or be we here to be companion to assist those people to fulfil their dying wish believe in autonomy believe in dignity but more than that believe in compassion govern by care not chaos that be what the system lack right now friend as the hon member for spen valley kim leadbeater say we live with the cruel illusion that do nothing be neutral it be not those who have object to the bill be conspicuous in not say that they accept the status quo for however long the bill may take to reappear if it fail we have hear again and again story of people force to travel abroad to die in lonely circumstance we see love spouse prosecute for hold the hand of someone they have love for year we see lonely suicide in quiet suburban bedroom life end not because of terminal illness but because of lack of legal option the bill bring order where there be confusion it bring safeguard where there be silence and it replace secrecy with structure and fear with honesty notwithstanding the claim make today and elsewhere it have be build in the right way this house have take its duty seriously in all its form of legislation the bill have go through detailed scrutiny in committee and concern about coercion training eligibility and oversight have be meet head on and address through carefully consider amendment the panel model that we have now be shape by those concern to ensure the right expertise legal oversight and continuous consent check be in place from begin to end this be how parliament should legislate carefully collaboratively and with humility in the face of complexity to those who worry about coercion would say that the great risk of coercion be under the status quo today there be no check no panel no oversight we do not know who be choose freely because there be no system to ask and no conduct to examine we have hear the argument about slippery slope and would say this this law be very tightly draw there be no constitutional pathway here for expansion by stealth any change would require this house we to decide again it can not drift it can not slide it be anchor in law and in the authority of this place to those who talk about misdiagnosis say that the bill require two independent doctor clear clinical criterion and final check at the point of delivery even then the person must still be mentally competent and willing at every step the answer can be no but at the last at last there will be the possibility of choice to those who ask often movingly what if the patient live long than expect would say good they live this law do not force single death it simply allow die person to decide when enough be enough madam deputy speaker will finish with this have sit with die friend have watch the slow unwinding of body that once hold vigour humour and pride have see family try to honour the unspoken wish of someone too far go to speak finally will say this we do not honour life by prolong suffering we honour life by give it meaning and power the one thing that die people ask for in their agonising final moment be control over the disease that be destroy they the status quo my friend be completely unacceptable whatever you think of the bill it be indisputable that it be an improvement on what we have now and urge you to support it thank everyone who have contribute to this debate both inside and outside the house there have be great deal of passion and sometimes that passion flare up while we debate this really intense and personal subject and obscure the deep and profound compassion that we all feel how each of we face death be deeply personal and the decision surround it must honour every individual dignity and choice our goal must be to ensure that all patient be protect while we empower people at their end of their life with great autonomy and agency to make the choice that be right for they have spend many year as an intensive care nurse in the nhs have witness the reality of end of life care countless time have see patient find peace in their final day but also patient who have be unconscious or unaware that their death be come have see other endure pain and anxiety that no palliative intervention none would alleviate for they those experience have deeply influence my perspective on assist dying they have reinforce my belief that individual should have the autonomy to make decision about such personal and profound part of their life the end of their life that be fundamental to dignity at the end of life consent must always be freely give fully informed and revocable at any time as it be right now for anyone who agree to or decide not to undertake onerous painful treatment that medical and clinical staff say might save or extend their life every one of we can refuse treatment it be so important to understand that because we have have lot of discussion about coercion have to lay it out for the house there be lot of coercion in the system currently well mean family and clinician provide degree of coercion clinician clinical team and multidisciplinary team be set up to try to detect that and to have conversation with patient to get to the nub of their real wish have lot of faith in my clinical colleague and have faith that this happen as result of collective action by multidisciplinary team that be how healthcare work today be really pleased that after extensive debate on this bill particularly in committee we have go from judge make the decision to have panel because that reflect good practice in clinical work we now have multidisciplinary team and multidisciplinary approach to assess what the patient want will the hon member give way no will not many colleague have talk about whether this debate have be too short too long too complicated or not complicated enough have hear question about whether the bill be ready to for we to hand on to the house of lords to be clear believe that it be it be really important to remember that we have be debate this issue not just during this parliament the debate have go on for decade remember be teach by really strong advocate for palliative care when be student nurse he be dead set against assisted dying his argument be that if we bring in assist dying it will mean that palliative care will never get the funding and resource that it need something that so many people have say that be nearly year ago and we have not grasp that nettle as country at the end of this debate really hope that we can finally bring to fruition the ambition of almost every member of this house the ambition to ensure that palliative care work and be accessible to everyone in this country however if we do that be not reason not to have assist die assisted die be the choice of many people in this country and want it to be choice for if get to that point in my life want that choice available to and that will be true for some other member still other do not want to ever have that choice but it need to be there want people to think about themselves as well will the hon member give way will not it be important to think about ourselves as well sometimes we member of parliament think it selfish to think about what we may need but it be fundamental because this be about individual this be about each of we at the end of life the bill be much strong than it be at the start and be already convince that it be the right thing to vote for really think it be ready for we to hand on to our colleague in the other place many member of the public be behind we and commend the bill in its current from will vote for it on third reading and hope many other people will too it be pleasure to follow the hon member for sittingbourne and sheppey kevin mckenna though will reach slightly different conclusion from he although she be not in the chamber may remark on the principled stand take by the hon member for lewisham north vicky foxcroft not only today but in her decision last night think it will stand she in good political stead my colleague and will vote against third reading and that should come as no surprise to member in this house we do not do it from party political perspective though we will all act as one party and we do not do it because of whip we will act as one out of our common but personal faith we be assure that our belief will not be determine factor today in parliamentary term we understand that just because we hold view it do not mean that everyone in this chamber will hold it and our vote be equal the question before we today be not on principle it be on this bill we hear member say very clearly and forcefully on second reading that they wish to start the parliamentary process to see how the bill would evolve how it could be strengthen and what safeguard could be put in place we be assure that the bill be in bad position today than it be on second reading we hear member specify that there should be judicial involvement in the process another articulate their support for this legislation on the basis of legal safeguard that have now go we have be honourable in listening but honourably we have to reflect that the bill be not where it should be that the assurance offer on second reading have be remove that the balance promise in committee be not there and that the protection offer and suggest have be strip away just yesterday constituent tell that when she be diagnose with cancer for the first time she approach the matter with determination that surprise she and she survive when she be diagnose the second time she approach it with despair and have this bill be available to she she would have avail herself of its measure she would have satisfy the condition on the basis of medical advice at the time she tell this story yesterday and that diagnosis be in the quote share on second reading be as true today as when it be first say year ago medicine be science of uncertainty and an art of probability there be nothing that can be determine to the point of legal certainty or from our perspective moral certainty say to colleague across the house not those who like have define and determined position and principle position from which we will not yield but those who be actively think about what to do today that the parliamentary process have not serve we well whatever time it take the house of lords will debate and vote on each and every amendment we be not allow to and do not to the socialist in this chamber say you speak proudly of the value of the nhs and the value of welfare and you want to stand up for those principle so think about what you do today to the internationalist say it be not in your tradition to turn the other cheek or walk on the other side of the road you do not turn your back on the weak and the vulnerable the oppressed and the burden so please do not do it today this bill and your say on it will be final but it will be final in much more fundamental way for our constituent and our loved one throughout this united kingdom ask you to approach this bill and your perspective on it on the basis of your principle alone to the trade unionist say what do the trade union say royal college after royal college have express its concern fear and trepidation they have say that they will not stand over their member when it come to this bill but they have concern we do not need to think in the abstract in this chamber we vote for medicinal cannabis how many medicinal practitioner be prescribe it they be not because their trade union and their govern body do not support they or insure they in that endeavour this bill be not what have be outline not what have be promise and not as good as this chamber could make it hope that colleague reflect honourably on what they have say not only on second reading but to themselves on the basis of the principle that many colleague hold dear principle of socialism internationalism or trade unionism hope that they will do what we will do and vote for light hope and life rise order colleague can see how busy the chamber be and will understand that not everybody will get in but if speech be long than five minute even few colleague will get in call dr beccy cooper thank colleague across the house for bring thought and sensitivity to the debate here and in committee often think that this place do not show the good of we but in proceeding on this bill have hear consider debate people have listen to each other set out both side of the argument as new mp reflect on how this place legislate and how it could evolve and improve and think that this bill bring learning assisted dying be never go to be an issue without controversy and there have be much to consider will take few minute to outline why as medical doctor specialise in public health be supportive of the bill will include brief reflection on safeguarding and the provision of end of life care that have be raise by my constituent my hon friend speak of the view of constituent at very well attend public meeting of my constituent just before second reading one key question they want an answer to be how the bill could prevent vulnerable people from be coerce into take decision to end their life do she agree that as the bill have go through parliament it have be strengthen with safeguard against coercion and that the impact assessment say that through the bill we would have the strong safeguard of any jurisdiction in the world agree with my hon friend and will come to that point later in public health we focus primarily on prevention care for the population in other word we take decision use the good available evidence that have the potential to impact the health of thousand if not million of people there be almost always trade off in these decision quite often one see the label of nanny state throw our way that be because we deal with choice and freedom on population level when consider this bill ask myself which population be this legislation for what be the need of this population what freedom and choice be we be ask to legislate for as for the people for whom the bill will be relevant it be narrowly define population who can clearly see have specific need that be to say it be people come to the end of their life with terminal illness in public health at this point in our consideration we be often meet with we have already hear about this the slippery slope argument if you legislate for this group of people it will stop there however the criterion for someone to be consider for assist dying be clear in the bill have hear from constituent who think that the criterion be potentially too narrow but that be not what be in front of we today and any change by future parliaments will have to go through another legislative process look at the need of the population for whom the bill be relevant numerous concern have be raise in this area both from safeguarding perspective and in the provision of end of life care constituent and fellow parliamentarian have voice unease at the thought of coercion in this space that is if person meet the criterion for the bill but do not wish to access assist dying will they be coerce into do so by person or person with malign intent in public health we often refer to this balance as the precautionary principle we be supportive of people have choice but we need to be satisfied that the risk of harm be minimise in the context of assist dying this translate into take extra precaution to ensure that legislation do not lead to unintended consequence and abuse and there have be much debate on this the concern that have be raise be reasonable and valid but think they have be meet with reasonable response in the bill safeguard measure have be specify include clinician awareness support and training referral mechanism for any concern multidisciplinary board oversight specific disability advisory board independent advocate and multiple discussion to assure all party that the person have come to the decision of their own volition turn to the second area the need of this population end of life care be profound professional commitment for the people who provide it my heartfelt thank go to the healthcare team in my constituency who have reach out during this process to tell extraordinary story of compassion joy and hope bring to people in their final day they have also reinforce the fact that excellent end of life care should be standard offering in our healthcare system and that this be not currently the case as with public health end of life care be often see as nice to have rather than the essential part of our health system that it actually be have the pleasure of sit with my hon friend on the health and social care select committee be well aware as she be that palliative care be not where it should be that be one of the reason be vote against this bill today because we know as my hon friend know from her public health lens that there be social determinant of health surely we can not vote for measure today that would lead to social determinant of an early death thank my hon friend for his intervention but this bill be not about negating end of life care if anything it be shin spotlight on it and say that care dignity and choice at the end of our life should be afford to we all that bring to my final thought on legislate for choice our freedom from and freedom to currently if person would like to choose assist dying that choice be only open to they if they have sufficient financial resource this be an equity issue if person be financially poor terminally ill and near the end of their life they do not have the freedom to choose assist dying that do not mean of course that they would but this legislation will allow an equitable choice for this define group of people much of public health be determine by legislation and the underpinning premise be that we be create safe environment for population within which individual can make their informed choice think that this bill create those condition and therefore as public health physician be satisfied that can vote for it ultimately good death be something that we all want for ourselves and for those we love and care for my vote for this bill be base on the argument have lay out today but my broad vote and voice will always be for compassion understanding and continue constructive dialogue to ensure we do our good to improve the life of the people we serve until their die day many point have be make already today so will not cover they all briefly associate myself with the word of the right hon member for belfast east gavin robinson whose powerful speech summarise the point that many of we wish to make and those of the hon member for vauxhall and camberwell green florence eshalomi whose question have get to the heart of this matter this bill be about many different thing but fundamentally it be about two power and trust it be about the power over life and death not just over ourselves because we already have the power to end our own life it be call suicide it be not crime and have not be crime in this country for decade the bill be about different power the power of the state through its agent to exercise power over life and death yes the exercise of that power will be agree and approve of in advance but when the state take life even with consent that be huge shift in the relationship between the individual and the state it be transformation in the way in which power lie and we should be fully conscious of what be be do that be why this debate frankly need little more honesty we have hear the blandishment and the warm word of euphemism we have hear this call assist dying but the truth be that it be not assist die assisted dying be what hospice already do today help people care for they and support they this be assist killing or assisted suicide depend on which word we choose honesty in language be important if we be not even willing to be honest with ourselves in this place how on earth can we expect the court to consider the question we have debate when they have to look at these case say to all right hon and hon friend in debate like this we be all friend because we be all seek the right answer for our country that this be the last time we be go to talk about these question this be the last time that we be go to have actual authority over the word in this bill and no matter what interview we have hear and no matter what assurance we have be give today or over the past few week the only thing that matter be the word in black and white in the bill those be the word that will be interpret by judge for year to come will the right hon gentleman give way will not those be the word that will give power to ministers and to the secretary of state to exercise his or her discretion with the most cursory of oversight from this place let we be absolutely clear on what we be choose to do let we be absolutely clear that it be on we it be our responsibility to think not just for those who have option and power and those who will not be intimidate but for those who will be we must think of the weak and vulnerable to whom the mother of the house refer and for the community in our country who already do not trust the health service reject vaccination choose not to come early for cancer diagnosis and already have the bad health outcome we need to think of they choose to make that gap great be not just enable someone to access care but actively reject other in our community who should seek care but will not because of the fear this will raise in their heart we need to think really hard about that to those who say that there will be no change and that this be it there can be no further change say that the close legal equivalent to this legislation be the canadian legislation the close legal equivalent to we be the canadian parliament the close equivalent to the national health service be the canadian health system therefore give you will the right hon gentleman give way be not give way interruption the hon lady have speak for many hour be speak for five minute the experience of roger foley canadian live with degenerative condition warn we as canada have expand its assisted die law have face neglect verbal abuse and denial of essential care ve be tell my care need be too much work and my life have be devalue worse still have be approach and tell by healthcare staff to consider opt for medical aid in dying instead of offer compassionate support to alleviate my suffering it be suggest that should end my life sadly this be not the only example we have hear of this we have also hear of veteran with post traumatic stress order and other with limit condition today sadly we have even say that those who merely feel pressure be allow to access this service member have real choice today when that first or year old that first individual go and ask for this it will be we who make that decision it will be on our conscience it will be decision that have fundamentally change the relationship between the individual and the state in way that can never be reverse rise to speak in opposition to the bill today we be vote not on the principle of assist dying but on piece of legislation we do not exist in vacuum what happen in this house have real world consequence be all too aware of how unequal our society our medical system and our institution be in their treatment of disabled people my hon friend the member for lewisham north vicky foxcroft speak at length very movingly of her journey towards find that she could not vote for the bill due to her experience and prolonged engagement with disabled people and disabled people organisation know from my own experience that the value our medical establishment place on certain life be less than on other when be give the diagnosis of my daughter down syndrome the first thing the midwife say to after so sorry be can book you termination within hour that be choice that so many woman make because they be ignorant of the value of disabled life have have to fight for so many thing for my daughter because the establishment do not see her life as valuable in this country someone can terminate pregnancy up to week and six day if they have condition that be so horrific such as down syndrome cleft palate or limb difference because of the value we place on different life support the principle of assist dying yes but can not support this bill because we can not legislate against discrimination and we can not legislate out inherent bias what we can do be legislate for safeguard and for safety we can legislate over those treat the people we love and over those offer assist die we can legislate to make sure that the most vulnerable in society such as my daughter people who know the medical establishment and institution and society already view as second class in so many way do not have to face decision after be coerce or give bad advice as my hon friend the member for bexleyheath and crayford daniel francis have be at pain to point out to and other we do not have the adequate safeguard in place will my hon friend give way be afraid will make progress but thank she for her interruption laughter her intervention my apology we have be tell that there be panel that will provide safeguard and take into account all of someone circumstance and whether they have capacity however those panel may in exceptional circumstance the bill do not set out what those be opt not to even meet the person whom they be discuss we know that the panel do not allow for family member and carer and those who know that person if they have limit capacity learn disability or be unable to make certain decision themselves to play role in that process or have any right of appeal my plea to member across this house if you have not yet decide or if you think support this in principle but be concern about this have worry about this or think that might be okay be that it be not our role to send bill to the other place and out into the world hop that other will do our job for we and that it will all just come out in the wash that be dereliction of our duty as members of parliament if you have any concern about this bill now be the time to vote against it you must do that you must not think that someone else will do your job for you it be our decision that be what we be vote on today urge all member of this house to vote against this bill it be an honour to speak in this important debate on an issue that exemplify why choose to get into politic and come to this place to be part of big decision take in tune with public opinion listen to evidence and with the goal of make our resident well off have no doubt that all right hon and hon member here today intend to make their resident well off but in this case tragically well off mean suffer less and give they agency in the most painful moment of their life this bill address situation where the status quo be utterly unacceptable hope that we can all agree in this place that we have hear heartbreaking story from the family of those who have watch love one die in pain or of the fear of someone with terminal diagnosis face the prospect of an agonising death the choice we have with this legislation be whether we choose to do something about that status quo or not reject this bill imperfect as it may be will continue the pain of those who be let down by the current law they be guarantee victim of system that be let they down will the hon member give way will make some progress thank you start by make the somewhat unusual case that this issue for which we be gather here on friday give up bake sale and constituency surgery be not quite the big deal it have be whip up to be by both proponent and opponent do not believe that we be consider fundamental change in the relationship between doctor and patient or seek to change the relationship between the state and the individual do not believe that we be step on to slippery slope or unpick the very purpose of the nhs as some have suggest we be here simply to give those who already face terrible decision doctor patient and their family real choice of how to face those decision and protection in law for choice that be already be make today will the hon member give way will make some further progress this bill would simply give the choice to those who will die and those eligible will die soon on the manner and timing of their death and it would protect doctor and family from legal repercussion at such tragic time this be not bill about the choice between life and death it be about the choice should we want it of how and when we will die this be the ultimate choice we speak sometimes of the right to choose of the right to decide how one might bring life into this world debate about which on tuesday this chamber show that there be huge majority in favour of the right of the individual we have chance to neatly bookend the week by establish the existential right of the individual when give terminal diagnosis to choose how one might exit this earthly realm will the hon member give way will make some progress today due to the extraordinary courage of the hon member for spen valley kim leadbeater who have give we once in generation opportunity for this place to catch up with public opinion truly believe that we can take one more step forward towards regain public trust and confidence in the system when public polling show overwhelmingly time and again that the public back the change between and in the late poll release implore those on the fence to at least listen to public opinion if not my word will my hon friend give way will continue nothing say however be intend to simplify the issue and acknowledge the fear of many that the palliative care sector be not fund sufficiently for there to be rational and viable choice between manage care at the end of life and the choice to end one own life therefore welcome the inclusion of amendment which match my priority of the improvement of palliative care ahem in conclusion in the heart wrench word of decca aitkenhead who write in the times last week and which find particularly move critic of the bill have begin to frame the debate as if leave the law as it stand do not hurt anyone it do she say that opponent worry about speculative hypothetical victim but the status quo create indisputable real life victim will my hon friend give way will not sorry be close to closing she go on to say the bill opponent portray it as cruel heartless and macabre wish they could have sit at her friend charlotte bedside hear her groan let die and see what cruel heartless and macabre actually look like this bill be the right thing to do it have be scrutinise amend and debate this bill be ready please vote in favour today to give our resident choice if colleague do not want cough at the end of their speech it be good to keep they under five minute this house have hear many personal story over the course of the bill see love one die long protract death be not an experience that would wish on anybody but once it have happen to you the memory never fade there be many important technical legal and medical aspect of the bill that be essential to ensure that it operate in the safe way possible but support the principle of personal agency over dignified death come from the heart and from the personal experience of each and every one of we be aware that the scottish parliament have its own legislation in progress on this very difficult issue but wish to share my own story with the house to help in the decision that it must take my brother david be year old when he arrive at work one day and the manager on the shop floor tell he that he look pale he have work tough physical job for year and be strong full of life man his manager be so concerned at david pallor that he take he straight to the hospital after two week in hospital he be give the devastating diagnosis of an advanced stage of pancreatic cancer over the next month david try everything he could to stay alive however after an unsuccessful operation to try and remove the cancer and take part in trial for new drug he slowly begin to lose mobility the last few month of his life be live at home in hospital bed the strength and resilience of his wife jackie to take care of he day in day out remain an inspiration to as david health decline his painkiller be increase far and far his painkiller become so strong that he could no long speak and we do not know if he could hear we his body become skeletal and his speech gradually disappear in one of the last time when he still be able to speak he call out to from his bed and tell that if there be pill that he could take to end his life he would very much like to take it david would suffer in silent pain for further three week he could never have know that would ever have the opportunity to stand in this place and ask colleague to make sure that other do not go through what he go through have do right by my brother by speak here today what david need be humane safe and trusting process available to he at home that would give he agency over his last week and month that be what this bill offer that be the choice that this house be finally today in position to give to those suffering from terminal illness and commend the bill to the house it be privilege to follow the hon member for glasgow north east maureen burke and many other who have give brave testimony of their own personal experience in this matter join the tribute to the hon member for spen valley kim leadbeater who think have conduct herself with decency dignity and compassion throughout this process but have hear she and other say that the decision we have to make today be whether or not we be in favour of the status quo and respectfully disagree our job as legislator be to consider rigorously the propose legislation before we and those who propose it bear the burden of persuade we that this be the right change to make and not change that may bring problem as big or big than those we be try to solve have spend nearly year in this place that make our law and practise in the court that administer they have have ministerial responsibility for sentencing and for the crown prosecution service have faith in our system of law but have also see the limitation on our ability to avoid the negative consequence of the law we make however hard we try so very often the legislative decision we take be about balance of risk in this case the risk of not change the law be that we leave some of our constituent in pain where it could be avoid and expose their love one to the fear of prosecution for act of love and mercy acknowledge that risk and have feel the anguish and desperation of those who want this bill to pass for the very good of motif but good people can come to different conclusion on the balance of risk here and think that we take big risk in change the law that be because of the signal we send in the legislation we pass signal send by change in the law matter when parliament change the law it bring consequence for those who break the new law but it also intend to change behaviour create new criminal offence increase maximum sentence or even strengthen regulation be act that we hope everyone will take notice of and behave differently as result because they recognise that parliament on behalf of society as whole be signal its disapproval of certain action or practice if that be true for legislation that make unlawful what be previously lawful why should the same not be true for legislation that make lawful something that be previously unlawful we be send signal there too that society through parliament believe that something we use to think be unacceptable be now acceptable in this case that assist someone to die be now something of which we approve believe that be bind to have an impact on those who in great distress at the end of their life may already be think that it would be well if they be out of the way do not want to live in society in which anyone include the terminally ill be encourage in the belief that their life be not valuable and value to their very last moment though it be not its intent fear that the bill bring such society close that be why can not support it as we consider whether to put the bill into law we must reflect on our solemn duty as legislator to protect the wellbeing of our community and safeguard they from harm there have be much debate about give people choice about what happen in other jurisdiction and about matter of faith and principle have hear from nearly constituent the vast majority of whom oppose the bill for range of reason too oppose the bill on second reading and set out my concern include those of principle as well as major concern about safeguarding as former child service manager with more than year of frontline experience believe that far from issue of safeguard be improve in committee many of the provision have actually be weaken my concern be similar to those of the right hon member for chingford and woodford green sir iain duncan smith the high court stage safeguard be remove from the bill fundamentally alter the basis on which member vote on second reading and the panel that replace the court approval and the voluntary assist die commissioner who would oversee they be new and untested concept they would not have the power or function of court or tribunal they would not be require to question witness and they could not compel they to attend the doctor who would assess people capacity and freedom to choose an assisted death would not give evidence under oath and nobody would cross examine they the new assisted die commissioner would run the assist die system and at the time be responsible for monitoring investigate and report on its work replace the role previously give to the independent chief medical officer the very definition of terminal illness have prove to be seriously flawed because it would allow people with anorexia to qualify once their physical condition deteriorate amendment be table in committee to introduce an enhance test of person mental capacity to make the choice to die on second reading hon member be assure that the exist law in the mental capacity act be try and test yet in february the chief medical officer write to the committee to clarify that there be no enhanced test for life and death decision under this act the committee also vote to allow future health secretary to change at will the act of parliament that establish the found principle of our nhs the language that first pass into law in the nhs be establish to secure the physical and mental health of the people of england and the prevention diagnosis and treatment of illness however because that do not include assist people to take their own life the bill as amend now contain power for those foundational word to be change by secondary legislation follow the committee stage chair session title committee of the unheard to hear from expert who have not be invite to give oral evidence in committee we discuss the impact of exclude family and love one as be this bill position importantly the committee allow we to explore issue around people with disability people from other jurisdiction specifically canada and black asian and minority ethnic community have the committee receive that oral evidence it may well have come to different conclusion finally the bill have highlight the promise of choice for choice to be real there must be genuine option to choose from but what have be highlight be that palliative care provision be woefully inadequate and that the bad serve be also the most disadvantaged from the most deprived community worse should the bill come into force the provision of palliative care be likely to be compromise if hospice have no legal right to opt out of assist dying no such opt out be propose in the bill that bring back to our role as legislator the question for we now be this after all the consideration can we be satisfied that our duty to protect people wellbee and safeguard they from harm will be fulfil if we pass the bill from everything that have see hear and read the answer must be no on second reading speak in support of the principle of the bill because believe that freedom of choice especially at the end of life should always rest with the individual that it be the individual with terminal diagnosis who be well place to decide when it be their time to slip away as society we do not talk about death enough it be one of those subject that we shy away from but thousand of our fellow citizen each year must come to term with terminal diagnosis their medical treatment and their final day put on record my thank to the hon member for spen valley kim leadbeater for the way that she have conduct the debate know that it have be difficult at time particularly with the criticism come from outside this place vote for the status quo voting against the bill will not solve the problem indeed with the advance of medical technique that prolong life but not necessarily the quality of life the case for the compassionate ending to one life will continue to grow at least one brit every week be take the stressful and too often lonely journey to switzerland for an assisted death at the cost of to decide the time of one own death be an option only available to those who have the wealth will the hon gentleman give way be not give way as supporter of the bill have listen to the debate closely and agree that we need well palliative care across the uk my own grandparent be both superbly support by amazing macmillan nurse in their final week battle incurable cancer but recognise that this support be not universal across the country and that more need to be do to improve this important service the blunt truth of the matter be this if someone be die from an incurable condition they could have the good palliative care possible but ultimately they be still die in her final week my nan tell that it be her time to go that she have make peace with her god and that she do not want to endure the next few week of decline in her physical and mental health day before her death she be hallucinate from the high dose of medication to treat her pain tell vividly how she be fly spaceship that be not how she want to spend her final week and know that because she tell so she like so many other have be deny her final wish the legislation have receive far more scrutiny than much of what we vote on in this place and rightly so the public bill committee meeting interview witness and divide time on propose amendment as country we have be debate this subject for over year can recall as year old law student discuss the case of diane pretty and her campaign back then to change the law believe the bill as present be narrowly define with the necessary safeguard to ensure that those with terminal condition can freely choose the time of their own passing there be those in this house often through religious belief or otherwise who could never support bill of this kind that be their right and respect that but that right should not extend to deny the choice to other people there be those who argue for what they see as even great safeguard but we should remember that legislation must be balance and workable in the real world beyond this chamber the bill be not about shorten life it be about shorten death ask all hon member across the house to support it in general this debate have show parliament at its good inform consider and passionate have not speak in it before have listen reflect read and seek to understand the intention and the impact of the bill particularly on the most vulnerable will now take five minute to say four thing first be bring up on the right to die my mother who be disabled often in great pain and cancer survivor be member of the voluntary euthanasia society and exit as dignity in dying be previously call can honestly say that newcastle united feminism and the right to die be mother milk to my position be not base on ideological cultural or religious reason urge colleague not to vote for the bill because it be without the rigour or scrutiny necessary to make assisted die work in practice have great deal of respect for my hon friend the member for spen valley kim leadbeater and the minister for care my hon friend the member for aberafan maesteg stephen kinnock they have say that the bill have receive more scrutiny than most government bills but this be not your average bill it fundamentally change the relationship between state and citizen it allow the state to take the life of citizen yes it be on request but that be still huge change we say that it be the first duty of any government to keep our citizen secure but now the state will also be able to kill they our nhs be set up to secure improvement in physical and mental health and as my hon friend the member for mitcham and morden dame siobhain mcdonagh have so powerfully argue the bill could change the found principle of the nhs clinician be train to save life now they will also be able to kill people the job of our police and armed force be to protect life and liberty now they will also protect those who take people life because this mark fundamental change in the relationship between state and citizen it require much more public and parliamentary debate we have not even begin to interrogate all the social implication of this change all of human life be here it will change the ethos of the nhs it will enable private company to kill private citizen there will be an information campaign so that everyone be aware that the state be able to kill they will my hon friend give way no will not take any intervention thank you particularly fear the impact on the most vulnerable and disadvantaged those without the social capital of so many arguing for the bill there seem to be an assumption that those who have be most unequal in life will suddenly be render equal in death but the least value by society be often those who value themselves the least we know that the last year of life be so often the most expensive for the nhs and the most distressing for friend and family why not save everyone the trouble of be burden this bill lack the safeguard which we must have to deal with the reality that there be powerful economic and personal incentive for both the state and family member to encourage the vulnerable into take their own life we should specifically consider the impact on ethnic community we know the prism of racist assumption through which healthcare have too often be administer the huge inequality in maternal health and mental health to name just two example there be nothing in this bill to protect the vulnerable and those whose experience of life and death have already be bias finally to vote against this bill be not to accept the status quo it be not our job now to propose well bill that be on report and at committee stage it be our job to judge the bill as it be and that be why say to hon member please do not vote for this bill it be always an honour to follow the hon member for newcastle upon tyne central and west dame chi onwurah like many hon and right hon member in this house have genuinely agonise over which way to vote on this issue because have change my mind over the year largely influence by constituent come into surgery or inform about their own deeply personal experience that include horrific story of see love one in their final day but also recall lady whose mother do go to dignitas she say that it be decision that she think be absolutely right at the time yet since then she have regret help her mother with that every single day of her life and believe that she help contribute towards her death therefore these be very complex and deeply personal issue also respect the more than constituent who have contact about this issue over the last few week would also like to acknowledge the contribution of two people who greatly admire dame esther rantzen and tanni grey thompson get to know dame esther rantzen in unusual circumstance when we stand against each other in luton south in the general election well it do not end well for either of we tanni grey thompson of course get to know very well as the sport minister they be on different side of this debate but appreciate their contribution which show that people can productively use their profile and personality in order to contribute to debate however be afraid esther rantzen do love you but respectfully disagree with you on this issue know that every mp want to do the right thing on this issue today no one side have monopoly on compassion all of we want to make the right decision and this be not an easy choice every now and again in this place we have the awesome responsibility of make decision that we know could ease suffering or could cost or save life this be one such decision this be one such vote if be make such choice make decision that will inevitably lead to the shortening of life want to be absolutely confident that be do so for the right reason and that the risk and unintended consequence be minimise and be afraid that this bill do not meet that high confidence bar will the hon gentleman give way will not out of respect for everybody else who wish to speak at some point in the future bill with different word strong safeguard and more robust impact assessment perhaps bring forward through different parliamentary route might pass that confidence test this bill do not but it may well pass and have join other in argue and vote for enhancement to safeguard particularly for the disabled those with eat disorder or mental health problem those who may feel that they be burden and of course the vulnerable who be expose to the risk of coercion believe that some improvement have be make to the bill but not enough continue to have significant concern about the potential for assist die to be abuse and to be extend way beyond the originally intend scope finally must mention one area of disappointment in what have otherwise be an extremely respectful debate and that be about the tone of some of the discussion and the somewhat dismissive attitude that have be express towards those with religious belief as though such belief be not valid in this debate they absolutely be those who express belief in god and the sanctity of life should be respect not sneer at it be perfectly legitimate for religious belief to influence one view on assist dying otherwise this debate have be largely respectful and have indeed show the house at its good again would like to thank all my constituent who have contact while know that some will disagree with the decision and the vote will cast today hope they recognise that have try to exercise my judgment carefully and in good faith as indeed have every colleague in this house this be my first time speak to the bill so want to start by thank my hon friend the member for spen valley kim leadbeater for have the courage to bring forward such significant piece of legislation thank all hon and right hon member who have be part of the debate and who have work on the bill so far for their thoughtful contribution until this week have remain open minded and undecided on this bill my starting point in the debate be my own personal view be personally against assisted dying because of my christian faith and for selfish reason also as be little bit scared of lose people and be there at the end of people life but like all of we have receive significant amount of communication on this matter so too decide to launch my own local survey in which ask my constituent for their stance on the bill for against or undecided what become increasingly clear be that people be split on this issue fifty five per cent of people be against be for and the remainder be unsure that for figure be not insignificant promise my very close friend emma that would share the story of her mum cheryl who be diagnose with terminal stage cancer just over two and half year ago emma want to cherish every last minute of her mum life and she be outstanding at create those special memory with she in the last year or so emma be against assisted die at the time and want to do everything to keep she mum with she for as long as possible cheryl sadly die last year emma tell think if something like this be legal it would stop people have to go through what mam go through on those last few week of her life she could have have dignified pain free death instead all her dignity be strip from she and she be in so much pain despite the strong pain med will never be able to forget the scream hope this do get pass to give people like mam the choice and to be in control like be sure everyone else have receive similar comment from constituent about watch relative fade away in pain and agony suffer linger death and beg for it to stop will my hon friend give way will not because want other member to be able to speak support the bill on second reading to allow the debate to move forward and with the hope of satisfy my concern the main two be the definition of mental capacity and how it can be interpret and the safeguard in place to ensure that an individual be not coerce also want assurance that the bill be strong enough to avoid the slippery slope scenario that we have see in other country after listen to the debate on report and absorb the vast amount of information have receive from member and various lobbying organisation on both side of the debate and after meet people on both side include my hon friend the member for spen valley be satisfied that my concern have be address in my view the bill now have more control than when we look at it on second reading not few also reject the suggestion that the bill have not receive sufficient scrutiny the debate on assist dying have be ongoing for many year significant amount of analysis report and information be available the bill have go through hour of scrutiny in committee and on report and it will of course go through the same in the other place have spend time look at all the information and be sure other member have too believe in choice although at this stage in my life believe that assist dying be not for there be many who feel otherwise they should be able to make this deeply personal choice just as they can make choice about so many other element of their life such as whether to follow religion marry have child or get divorce these be life choice usually make by somebody of sound mind and with considerable thought we should be able to make the same choice about our death after much consideration be minded to support the bill on third reading will listen to the rest of the debate but must say that if third reading be not agree to we can not allow the debate to disappear for another decade the country need this option my constituent tell that we need to find an acceptable way to legislate as soon as be practicable this be the first time have speak in the debate madam deputy speaker and assure you that will keep my comment short and respectful and respectful of other be also conscious that none of we in this place underestimate the enormity of the decision that we face today do not believe it be heart or head decision that over simplifie very complex matter have no doubt at all about the sincerity of the intention of the hon member for spen valley kim leadbeater in bring forward this bill but would just gently say that in this place good intention do not always yield the good result that we might all strive for as have monitor the progress of the bill have continue to struggle with it and nothing in it have change my mind the importance of these debate be monumental that be underpin by the literally thousand of comment and email have have from my constituent in aldridge brownhills some have be write to on this matter since before the first debate at the end of november as the bill have proceed through this place have also struggle with the way that it have be liken to previous moral and ethical legislation would argue that the process be very different from that which go before hon member be correct that some of the most pioneering social legislation of the post war period be introduce via private member bills most notably the abortion act and the sexual offences act which decriminalise homosexuality it would be remiss of not to point out that both those bills go through an extensive government lead public inquiry which pave the way for legislation medical advisory committee under the chairmanship of sir john peel consider the abortion bill and the wolfenden committee consider the law on homosexuality be afraid that advice be sadly lack for this bill the government have set up wide range of policy review and it would have be totally appropriate for such review to have be seek on this matter much have also be make in this debate of the idea that the bill be slippery slope and that in the future the bill will be extend and extend that point be make because of what we see in other country as modern society we must come to term with have conversation and debate on death do not believe that today have to be the end of that conversation but genuinely do not believe that the bill be in the right place to go forward to the house of lords and will therefore vote against it briefly to those who be say that our attitude be we debate the issue but we send the bill off to the other place for it to do our job say that be not what be here for believe that we be here to debate this bill in fact want to abolish the other place ten year ago when the issue be debate before could not give my speech but my position be repeat by many member agree with assist dying in principle but think that we do not have the safeguard available however today will support the bill because measure relate to many of the issue raise in that debate have be build into this bill measure on how the assessment would be do and measure to ensure that the panel include psychiatrist clinician and other ten year ago do not argue for judicial review as do not have the confidence in the judiciary that some hon member have want more expert but at that time the expert be split they have always be split on the issue and there will never be unanimity across the profession on the subject one issue to which have pay careful attention be mention by my hon friend the member for lewisham north vicky foxcroft may just say that be so proud that she resign over the benefit cut know how difficult that be for she she be my whip she be the nice whip have ever have she be right that the majority of the disability organisation particularly the campaign one be oppose to the legislation that be why try to ensure that some of the issue that they have raise have be translate into the bill it be huge breakthrough for this house to build in the disability advisory group with representative from whole range of disability group include hope disabled people against the cuts the radical group that will advise on the implementation of the bill another issue raise be about whether the nhs be ready for the legislation as say year ago it will take year to build up that capacity which be why the four year implementation schedule be so important to the choice be not between palliative care and assist dying we want the opportunity to have good palliative care one of my close friend die two week ago in hillingdon hospital and want to thank the staff for the palliative care that they give he so wonderfully at the same time know other who have suffer greatly and want to go but what have they be force to do hide away the drug over period of time send their family away and then take the drug and die lonely death recently another person starve themselves to death because there be no other option can not stand by and allow that to happen any more the right hon member for north west hampshire kit malthouse say that what be most important at the end of life be control but it be also dignity through this legislation want to provide that dignity for those who have decide that the time have come much of the debate on this bill have focus on dignity control and choice over the past six week have have to confront those concept head on while watch very close family member unexpectedly lose most physical capacity overnight it be difficult when someone you love deeply who have be proud strong and independent person be unable to perform the most basic of human function without help the mental impact of that physical incapacity be utterly devastating for they and for their near and dearest that indignity and loss of control have feel unmanageable on day when the care have be poor and so much more manageable when the nurse and healthcare assistant care for my love one have not be totally overstretch and cop without break when they have be able to ensure that pain be well manage and when the basic personal care that give we dignity and boost our wellbeing can be provide that bring to the heart of the conundrum we face today many of we in this place want to give people choice and autonomy over how they leave this world but the reality have see it up close and personal these past six week be that our nhs and care system be nowhere near up to give people that choice it be creak at the seam be very grateful that my amendment have be accept but report on its own be not go to improve our palliative and end of life care and we have have no commitment from ministers yet that they will do so the result will be either people choose to end their life before they want to or those who already have huge distrust of the system particularly those in minority and disadvantaged community whose voice have be hear the least in this debate choose not to access the care that they need and die an even more traumatic death do not believe that supporter of this bill want either of those thing to happen today we parliamentarian have to cast possibly one of the most consequential vote of our time in this place on such complex and sensitive issue as assist die it be only right that we turn to expert and make evidence base decision the royal college of psychiatrists and the royal college of physicians which be both officially neutral on assist dying have say plainly that they can not support this bill not least for reason to do with the most fundamental principle of mental capacity which sit at the heart of this bill therefore say to colleague across the house it be not too late to think again the very people who will be task with deliver the service we be legislate for today and by the way we still have no idea what that service will look like or how it will be fund say it be not safe how many life take in error be too many one one in one in this house clearly support the principle of an assist death as do the public but not at any cost this bill be not fit for purpose and the expert have tell we that the safeguard in it will not adequately protect those who most need indeed expect we legislator to protect they implore colleague today to vote it down and say to ministers on the front bench it be your responsibility to go back and do well do not start this process oppose to the idea of assist dying but have work in the field of domestic abuse find myself increasingly concerned about how this bill would impact on those who be most vulnerable to coercion and abuse as labour mp reflect on why join the labour party it be because of our commitment to protect the vulnerable and fighting for equality suspicious of individualism and narrow notion of choice that turn blind eye to the impact of that choice on other if could legislate to create bill just for would be tempt by these measure but believe my role as an mp be to legislate in the good interest of those who have no voice whose choice be often limit by poverty the patriarchy racism trauma ill health and state and societal failure we must recognise that if we advance this bill yet far today there will be unintended and undesirable consequence and it be the bill in front of we that we be vote on today not the principle or distant promise that the other place might fix the hole but what we know be in and not in this legislation would like to briefly illustrate the reason why believe this bill will create harm for family across our country imagine the scenario of your mother you be there when dad use to belittle she in public it be joke put she down but in the house you would hear he say that she be worthless and ugly and would be well off dead you get out of there as soon as you could but she would never leave she love he and could not see life for herself outside of his control you could see her health deteriorate but he often stop she from go to the doctor or reach out to friend one day you get call from your dad to say she dead she get an assisted death you worry that she take her life not because of her illness but because it be the only way out from the abuse you fear that your dad make she do it but there be no chance for you to tell anyone about your concern and there be no automatic requirement for an investigation by coroner would you ever be able to prove his malign control now that she be go imagine that you have brother who have struggle with an eat disorder ever since he enter secondary school he be sexually abuse by family friend and never receive any real support for what he go through and court backlog mean that the criminal case be still ongoing he spend long and long watch social medium influencer pay by assist die company to advocate for what they call peaceful end to life he begin to starve and doctor withdraw treatment because they claim nothing more can be do you get call only few month after his birthday to tell you that your brother have opt for an assist death will my hon friend give way no thank you be sorry but we have to make time for other we know from other jurisdiction that it be disproportionately old and disabled people who would access assist dying these be two of the group most vulnerable to abuse or coercion particularly by stranger through financial abuse and cuckooing coercion be not just risk with this legislation but certainty there be million victim of domestic abuse in the uk even if this bill implement gold standard training we do not know that it will professional will not be able to identify everyone it be sadly inevitable that if the bill pass it be the most vulnerable people in our society who will experience wrongful death prominent campaigner in favour of this bill say even if few granny get bully into it be that price worth pay for all the people who could die with dignity please we must not settle for this in system design to end life there can be no room for doubt or human error coercion and abuse be real they happen all around we all the time whether or not we want to see they as do feel like burden perceive yourself as burden be common phenomenon associate with have terminal illness one that often lead to desire to die this bill allow that feeling of be burden to those close to you and to society more broadly to be act on rather than treat research have find that doctor wrongly predict how long terminally ill people have to live in over half of case there be so much life leave to live after terminal diagnosis we should not relinquish our bond duty and responsibility towards each other as fellow human being urge colleague to reject this bill rise to speak in favour of this bill first though thank the hon member for spen valley kim leadbeater for the way in which she have approach the bill and for have engage with member across the house on both side of the argument on their various amendment vote in favour of the bill on second reading on principle but also because of something constituent say to about the status quo she say it be cruel and can not disagree with she it be definitely cruel for my constituent ann who be interview by the police for support her husband in go to dignita for week afterwards in her grief she face the uncertainty of police investigation for the current system be unsatisfactory and it be real privilege to join other to scrutinise this bill in committee it be my belief that it be strong for have go through that process there be one change in particular would like to speak to which be the inclusion of social worker on the panel people in that profession deal with complex challenging and sometimes dark family dynamic on daily basis and believe that include they on the panel be the right thing to do for those reason will be support this bill today and hope other will too be proud to support my hon friend the member for spen valley kim leadbeater as co sponsor of this bill through her leadership compassion and dignity she have be beacon of hope for so many thank the many hundred of constituent who have write to or have face to face appointment with to discuss this complex and emotive issue there be strongly hold belief on both side of the debate both inside and outside the house absolutely respect those with view different from mine and hope that they will respect my view after all it be possible for all of we in this place to disagree well people on both side of the debate have accept that we can and must do well for die people and their loved one that have be clear throughout this debate too many of we have witness the devastation cause when we be deny choice at the end of life until the law change die people in britain will continue to suffer unbearably in their final week and day with many try to scrape together the fund for an assist death abroad or take their own life behind closed door urge right hon and hon member to keep such experience in the front of their mind when they go through the lobby later at the heart of it this bill be about choice those who wish to exercise their choice can do so and those who do not wish to do so simply do not have to the bill introduce practical measure to assess eligibility guard against coercion and ensure rigorous medical oversight and robust monitoring of the process die people have none of those protection under the current law the status quo be fail people each and every day pay tribute to colleague from across the house who serve on the public bill committee regardless of what side of the debate they be on they strengthen the bill by accept key amendment include the establishment of judge lead multidisciplinary panel to oversee every application with oversight from psychiatrist social worker and lawyer the requirement that assist dying can only be discuss with patient in the context of all their end of life care and treatment option mandatory training for doctor and panel member on detect coercion and the creation of disability programme board the bill require that patient be inform about all care option to ensure that everyone have access to the good possible pain relief emotional support and hospice care this will ensure that choose an assisted death be never result of ignorance or lack of care be pleased that the bill have bring about long overdue discussion about palliative care if we be honest very few people in this place and outside be shout about it from the rooftop beforehand sincerely hope that after the passage of this bill we will continue to discuss how we can improve palliative care because it should not be an either or by have robust palliative care and the option of assist dying we will truly have option that will meet individual need and the value of each patient finally the momentum for law change be spread across the british isles and beyond last month msp vote by clear majority to pass liam mcarthur assist die bill the isle of man bill be await royal assent and will potentially be available for terminally ill resident from the direction of travel be to give die people true choice at the end of life we can not leave die people in england and wales behind rise order it will help other if member can keep to four minute it be often say that parliament be the conscience of the nation but believe that it be also its safeguard there be people who will benefit from physician assist suicide as implement in this bill but there be also people who will be harm those with mental illness those in care home those who feel burden those who be make to feel burden and those who be abuse the bill safeguard be inadequate the royal college of psychiatrists the royal college of physicians of which be member and the royal college of pathologists and countless doctor professional and charity have all be ignore in pursuit of absolutist principle above understanding it be facile interpretation of autonomy to give it no bound or to ignore its prerequisite we must hear the concern and act accordingly today for who be we if not the champion of the vulnerable and the voice of the voiceless the question before we today be this do we believe that this harm to the vulnerable be worth it say it be not say we vote down this bill today we be face with defining choice we have debate assisted dying for month and in some way we could never have enough time for this wish there have be more opportunity to debate the amendment but can also say base on my time in these debate that hon member have approach these issue with great dignity and care my hon friend the member for spen valley kim leadbeater who be friend of mine and who be very proud of have lead this debate with characteristic humanity decency and honour be sure all of we have find that whenever we have approach she with our concern or those of other she have have willing ear and an open heart pay tribute to she opponent of the bill have also work tirelessly to understand and voice people concern and like my hon friend the member for spen valley they bring that expertise so that all voice could be hear today my office have be approach more than time by people in wirral west regard this issue and that have show that people be guide by all faith and none as other have say that deserve great respect think back to meeting hold to discuss this matter in melrose hall in hoylake with more than constituent with candour and respect people share their personal story they disagree wholeheartedly but they do so with compassion and dignity they be the good of we stand here recognise that however today end up we will let people down whether the bill pass and people who would otherwise not choose to have an assist death go through with one or whether the bill fall and people who believe should have the choice to end their illness on their own term be deny that opportunity be conscious of that yet the vote before we be not on the harrowing story we have hear but on system and it be that system that worry about as it would have implication that go beyond individual case the consequence of get this wrong be severe and the risk of get it wrong with an nhs still in recovery be too high will the hon member give way will not take intervention the hon member for twickenham munira wilson table an important amendment about palliative care that have open door to an important conversation and thank she for that if our nhs be not able to deliver the high quality of care at the end of person life now would assist die improve that or could it end up create one sided choice know that hon member will be concern that there will never be good time for the nhs to introduce this that it will never quite be ready for assist dying hear that but sincerely do not believe that it be ready to bear the weight of the system we be vote on today be not settle on the issue of coercion either we have hear from expert across the house my hon friend the member for bexleyheath and crayford daniel francis and the hon member for richmond park sarah olney have speak about mental health issue and learn disability and my hon friend the member for lowestoft jess asato talk about issue of domestic abuse and how they could intersect with this my hon friend the member for vauxhall and camberwell green florence eshalomi my right hon friend the member for hackney north and stoke newington ms abbott and the right hon member for braintree sir james cleverly speak about how ethnic minority community could be impact by the bill and about the trust in the health system and the dynamic that could lead to someone take their life worry about the quiet imperceptible and unspoken coercion that could emerge if we go ahead with this system worry about vulnerable people who would feel duty to die and be not satisfied that the bill have enough safeguard against that for that reason be vote against the bill and call on other to do the same say to those watch at home that hope they share my confidence that whichever lobby colleague walk through today they have reach their decision with great care and consideration to weigh up the consequence good and bad of this vote be the burden of duty that such bill bring share that burden with other today we all believe come to this place every day determine to improve not just our society but the life of those who live in it our constituent we want to give they more choice and opportunity but we also have responsibility to protect the vulnerable and alleviate suffering do not believe that that responsibility have ever weigh more heavily on any of we or be more present in our thought and our debate than it have today we have debate this number of time and the bill have be through the scrutiny of committee thank the hon member for spen valley kim leadbeater for all her work and the committee for its work in come back with bill that firmly believe will provide the choice that those people who be suffer at the end of life not only deserve but be call out for we to give they would like to reassure all of those in the disabled community and those perhaps suffer from an eat disorder or mental health issue that they be not in any way put at risk by the bill the committee go to extreme length to ensure safeguard and those people will not be eligible for an assisted death because they do not have terminal illness this have be difficult road for all of we we have share personal experience and those of our constituent do not think that any of we will go through the lobby without have have some doubt and without have examine our own conscience and our own responsibility but believe that the committee and the house have come up with bill that do what the people of this country want it offer choice to adult with terminal illness with the safeguard that we need ask all member to support the bill it strike that the judgment before we today be this would permit some terminally ill adult to choose an assist death reduce suffering without inadvertently create undue risk to other be clear have work in the nhs for year that the bill absolutely can do that know the length that the nhs and our hospice movement go to when provide care at the end of life the beloved pet come in for the last cuddle or the compassionate conversation in the middle of the night that calm fear some have suggest that our health service could not safely introduce assisted dying for patient who be already in regular contact with the health service because by definition they be terminally ill know not just the professionalism of nhs staff have also see the thoroughness with which other medico legal route for example mental health act tribunal which in many way be analogous to the provision of the bill be implement the nhs have show over decade that it can safely implement social and legislative change pass by this parliament the abortion act be implement safely by the nhs as be the regulation and provision of in vitro fertilisation under the human embryology and fertilisation act the bill have rightly be amend to allow up to four year for commencement to allow all the necessary preparation to take place the chief medical officer remind we that the nhs deal with life and death decision every day while the process in the bill be new crucially they build on solid foundation of exist practice currently under the mental capacity act as other have say person with terminal illness receive critical care can say doctor want to die turn off this machine we use simple test under the act to permit that under this bill there be rightly further safeguard but the decision when someone say doctor want to die give something to drink be essentially the same this be absolutely not about the state kill people these people be die at the moment the cmo also give we evidence and he stress that the secondary legislation power be necessary to permit ongoing safe regulation those power not only require the secretary of state to ensure that code of practice and regulation be in place they also give he the opportunity to react post implementation should there be any concern case it be right that we be thorough in our role as legislator have see at first hand my hon friend the member for spen valley kim leadbeater sit with official from the department of health and social care and the ministry of justice to ensure the workability and safety of these provision that be not the case for the status quo with people die lonely death of suicide or go to dignita for those people there be no check on capacity or coercion there be only trauma therefore commend the bill to the house fully appreciate and respect the differ view on both side of this debate and thank the huge number of constituent in epping forest who have contact about the bill this legislation to permit assist dying or suicide leave with many concern fear that some frail and vulnerable people may start to feel burden to their family and may feel some pressure to proceed down this path also worry that the legislation will fundamentally change the doctor patient relationship and that it will be foundational change in what our precious nhs be and stand for be concerned about the possible pressure that the bill will place on medical practitioner when it come to diagnosis and prognostication which we know be not an exact science furthermore although our palliative care sector provide high quality compassionate and dignified care at its good access to palliative care across the country be sadly not at uniform level for all people who need it at the end of life sadly in term of funding and delivery the majority of palliative care be leave to the charitable sector that be in no way intend as criticism of the amazing charity and hospice involve in the delivery of that care but it be not right that the state will fund how someone come into this life with obstetric maternal care neonatology and paediatric but not how they leave it our priority should be address the palliative care situation before we go anywhere near bring in assisted die legislation finally want to make some remark as veterinary surgeon will the hon gentleman give way will not preface these remark by say that be in no way equate the passing of an animal with the passing of human which be of completely different order of magnitude but the end of an animal life have sometimes be draw into the discussion of human assist dying many of the protocol and drug be similar to those be discuss for human as veterinary surgeon have be involve in help countless animal large and small pass away for many reason each decision with the owner be very difficult often heartbreaking but the final act be not always routine and do not always go smoothly or accord to plan apart from couple of powerful speech from hon member last week we have not really address the issue of medical procedure and complication in this human debate shudder to think of the implication for the patient their love one and the co ordinating doctor if thing do not go smoothly and peacefully that must surely give we all pause for thought for those and many other reason will again be vote against the bill for the final speech before call the front benchers call lola mcevoy thank my hon friend the member for spen valley kim leadbeater and celebrate her courage and kindness throughout this whole process agree with many in the house that the status quo be unacceptable that be why most of we be here and urge colleague who like be in favour of the principle of choice at the end of life to vote today not on the principle but on how the bill will work in practice this be not an opinion poll and there be very real trade off without palliative care parity across the uk this new way to die offer replacement not real choice be pleased to have the support of the former prime minister the right hon gordon brown as well as huge number of medical professional on these argument be bring up around death and be still smile know about good palliative care because my dad would take to the hospice to meet his patient that he have grow to love as child remember he get promote to new nurse consultant role they be expert in their field of nursing and be promote to fill the gap in expertise in make decision on crucial palliative care and pain relief my dad positional and relational power to give confidence around decision making and to support less experienced but more senior staff in essential decision around life and death mean that those decision could ease lot of people pass when decision be delay the patient suffer unnecessarily and we have hear that happen in the story and many case of poor palliative care that have shape this debate today in the interest of time will skip to my final point the practical reality of what we see today be that without radical improvement to palliative care join up digital system and clear record centralised datum on when and how we talk to patient about the treatment they be get and about what that mean not just for the length of their life but for the quality of their life we will continue to have postcode lottery with finite number of expert in our nhs this decision to bring in this new way of die will simply deprioritise address the gap in the provision of good quality palliative care which will affect most of we in favour of offer new option to the minority of people who will be eligible that be not in line with my value and that be why can not vote for it call the shadow minister may begin by first thank the clerks for the considerable work they have undertake to support member across this house in prepare amendment across so many different element of this complex issue know that you mr speaker give great deal of thought to which of those we vote on also know that you have difficult balancing exercise in give time to this bill versus the limited time available for friday sitting say again to the government that be deeply disappointed that they choose not to assist you mr speaker and all member by provide further time on the floor of the house so that every single member who simply want to speak could do so tell member how many hour be spend in committee when so few member can participate in that be of little comfort to those member who have be unable to put their view on the record on the floor of the house but we be where we be join other in acknowledge the very hard work and sincerity of the sponsor member the hon member for spen valley kim leadbeater now be the moment for we vote on her bill in what we have to assume be its final form there might be change make in the other place but there might not be if member vote for the bill today they must do so happy that this be the version that will come into law as we conclude return to what say on second reading no one on either side of this debate can claim that only their side be motivate by care and compassion for other we have hear powerful speech motivate by concern for other both from those in favour and from those against this bill we hear powerful example from the mother of the house the right hon member for hackney north and stoke newington ms abbott my right hon friend the member for north west hampshire kit malthouse and the hon member for glasgow north east maureen burke who serve the memory of her brother well on either side of the debate we should resist the temptation to give ourselves false comfort those support the bill and be sure even the sponsor member herself will accept that there be no such thing as perfect law and certainly not in an area like this no one can be certain that the concern raise by opponent of the bill will never transpire in any case member support the bill should vote with an understanding that there may be unintended consequence similarly those oppose the bill should do so accept that they can not rule out that some people of sound mind without undue pressure from other would want to access assist dying we have hear about the very real suffering that people at the end of their life can experience how much that suffering can be relieve by palliative care have be point of real contention but the most powerful medication for relieve pain have equally powerful side effect and that should weigh heavily with member consider vote against while opponent of assist dying may prefer an improvement in palliative care instead they can not guarantee it will happen do not think it be fair to say that those who ultimately vote no to the bill be as some have describe actively happy with the status quo be sure that all of we at some point have see problem of human suffering of one form or another but oppose plan to alleviate it because we think it might make thing bad in some other respect that do not mean we be happy with the problem that still remain take all that into account member have to undertake difficult balancing exercise want to end my remark with the word we start the day with word that be hear in the chamber every time we sit be not religious but the meaning our daily prayers convey be think of universal assistance we be encourage to lay aside all private interest and prejudice and to keep in mind our responsibility to seek to improve the condition of all mankind say those word be easy if only it be as easy to have the necessary wisdom to always know what exactly it mean to improve the condition just of our constituent let alone all mankind the daily prayers can not help we with that unfortunately and today we do not even have the help of the party line all of we at one time or another have rail against the whip and its encouragement to vote for something we think be unwise but if we be honest that encouragement can be great help lot of the time the extent to which the debate cover the view of professional and representative organisation reflect member try to find help of another form in place of the whip most of we be not expert yet we have to make decision that even expert disagree on but let we welcome the fact that here today as we wrestle with this decision we be truly do exactly what we be send here to do more than on most other day even if we might be uncertain about our vote we can be absolutely certain about that stand at the dispatch box alongside the minister of state ministry of justice my hon and learn friend the member for finchley and golders green sarah sackman not as the mp for aberafan maesteg represent the view of my constituent although thank each and every one of they who take the time to contact with their consider opinion but as the minister responsible for ensure that the bill if pass be effective legally robust and workable thank member across the house on both side of the debate for their consideration of this legislation through its parliamentary stage and for their thoughtful contribution particularly thank the member of the public bill committee for their detailed scrutiny over more than sitting and hour this bill have receive more parliamentary time than most government and private members bills and the debate have be respectful and well consider throughout it be worth note of course that the subject have receive extensive and detailed consideration over number of decade both in this house and the other place as well as beyond parliament many member will recall that the bill before we today follow many year of examination and analysis include report such as the inquiry of the health and social care committee in and the accumulation of evidence from other jurisdiction would like to pay tribute to colleague and campaigner on both side of the argument for their contribution to this profoundly important conversation will make some brief comment about the most significant alteration to the bill since its introduction from the perspective of their importance to the technical and legal workability of the legislation the scheme set out in the bill now include assist die review panel multidisciplinary panel would grant certificate of eligibility if they be satisfied that all the relevant requirement have be meet the panel would have to hear from the person seek assistance at least one of the doctor and any other relevant person they would be responsible for monitoring and report on the operation of the act role that be previously assign to the chief medical officer the commissioner would also appoint dedicated board to advise on the impact of the bill on disabled people the bill commencement clause have be amend so that any provision that have not yet come into force will automatically do so four year after the bill be pass specific training requirement for doctor play formal assess role under the bill have be add there be now provision for an independent advocate to support qualifying person to understand their option for end of life care and the process under the bill in term of employment protection amendment that have be make on report mean that no one be under any duty to participate in the provision of assistance in accordance with the bill there be also now employment protection to protect employee and other worker from be subject to any detriment from opt in or opt out of provide assistance under the bill and to protect employee from dismissal it just fall to to thank all hon member once again for their extremely valuable contribution to this sensitive debate and to reiterate that should it be the will of parliament for this legislation to pass the government will ensure the safe and effective implementation of this service claim to move the closure standing order no question put forthwith that the question be now put question agree to question put accordingly that the bill be now read the third time jack abbott luke akehurst dan aldridge douglas

belt development rayleigh and wickford motion make and question propose that this house do now owatemi be grateful for this opportunity to raise the important matter of the potential development of the green belt in my rayleigh and wickford constituency in addition be sure the minister respond to the debate have many press demand from his constituency diary on friday so be personally grateful to he for be here in the house of commons this afternoon to respond on behalf of the government to add context will briefly explain to the minister bit about the geography of my constituency and how that be pertinent in relation to future development in essence south east essex be something of peninsula border to the south by the river thames to the east by the north sea and to the north by the river crouch and the river roach which run inland from the north sea as far west as the village of battlesbridge there be two principal east west artery that run from london into south essex namely the the southend arterial road and the which run broadly parallel to the but far south close to the thames both road be already extremely busy during the morning and evening peak be sure the minister be familiar with the concept of heat map whereby the busy the road the dark the shade of red they appear on the map both road be effectively glow bright scarlet during peak period because they be already at between and capacity in the morning and evening rush hour in simple english these road be already maxe out despite number of junction be upgrade along both road in recent year in simple english these road be already maxe out despite number of junction be upgrade along both road in recent year when we look at medical infrastructure the theme of system creak at the seam be unfortunately repeat both southend and basildon university hospital be part of the mid and south essex nhs foundation trust along with broomfield hospital at chelmsford the three hospital be merge some year ago admittedly under conservative government and it be fair to say that the merger have not be great success in the case of southend hospital accord to the senior trust management last autumn prior to so call winter pressure the hospital be already at to bed capacity once winter pressure be add in it go well beyond and unfortunately there be frequent incident of patient on trolley in corridor the situation be similar at basildon hospital slightly far west have raise basildon hospital with the minister before in addition gp surgery in south essex have patient list above the national average and be under tremendous pressure too for brevity our education infrastructure be also under considerable pressure especially with regard to place in special educational need school have try the minister patience by mention all of this in order to try and explain as frankly as can the serious infrastructure pressure that resident in my constituency and right across south essex be already experience give these it be absolutely critical that any future development should incorporate large scale infrastructure investment to be provide well in advance of the ten of thousand of extra house that labour be seek to build in south essex as part of their desire to create an additional million home over the course of the parliament for the avoidance of doubt accept that there do have to be some additional house building clearly young people can not live at home with their parent forever but any such construction have to be do sensibly at pace that the local infrastructure can realistically accommodate in an environmentally sustainable way so as not to adversely damage the natural habitat nor degrade the quality of life of the people who already live in the area they have right too when it come to housing target be afraid that the minister and have very basic philosophical difference admit that under previous conservative government we do at one time have system of mandatory housing target whereby official in whitehall could set target for house building for each local authority and then leave it up to the local authority via its local plan to decide where that arbitrary number of dwelling should be build be one of number of conservative back benchers who lobby very hard to have that procedure change to system of advisory target whereby whitehall could set benchmark but local authority with special circumstance for instance large proportion of green belt be at the very least give the opportunity to argue back and make case for reduce such arbitrary target if they threaten to be realistically undeliverable in practice very much regret that the incoming labour government immediately revert to system of mandatory target make bad by their overreliance on computer algorithm in order to calculate the number of dwelling supposedly require in each local council area the prospect of so call devolution and local government reform about which be deeply sceptical have only threaten to make this already complex situation even more confused in short believe it be highly unlikely that labour will achieve its million target not least because it now incorporate policy of make of all new dwelling affordable that be exactly the same policy that be operate for year by the labour mayor of london sadiq khan it be matter of record that mr khan never get anywhere near his housing target indeed they have now be reduce at the expense of increase target in the home county include in my home county of essex the affordable policy deter many house builder from build anything at all as it fail in london believe it will now fail elsewhere across the country as one example phillip barnes group land director at barratt developments which have billion per year turnover raise concern about the policy in blog in august he warn that exist site within the green belt in draft local plan application for housing will not be able to provide affordable housing he go on to say that since the draft nppf as it then be barratt have already pull four in flight planning application on draft allocate site because the spectre of render the scheme unviable due to the unacceptably reduce or remove land value for the landowner nevertheless labour doctrinaire adherence to the million figure mean that they be give local authority target that be so high as to be realistically completely undeliverable short of massive infrastructure investment which the government be clearly not in financial position to provide last month alone borrowing be billion will now raise with the minister some specific example of where his government policy be already begin to cause threat of unsustainable development in the green belt some month ago labour lead basildon borough council publish their regulation draft local plan the proposal anticipate build an incredible dwelling across the borough council area during the planning period out to about of which be anticipate to be build in and around the town of wickford in my constituency for the reason have already articulate there be absolutely no way that the infrastructure in and around basildon billericay and wickford can possibly cope with massive house building on that scale not least because about half of the site be in the current metropolitan green belt basildon borough council have publish number of document supposedly relate to infrastructure but they be incredibly thin in actual content for instance the supplementary document on health and medical infrastructure say absolutely nothing in detail about the expansion of capacity at basildon hospital at the heart of the borough that be despite the fact that accord to the nhs own metric each new dwelling could represent an additional patient for the hospital produce an overall total just shy of new patient for hospital where they be metaphorically already come out of the window as it be all basildon extremely limp document on health say on the subject be that it will all be sort out by the integrate care board have double check that with the leadership of the mid and south essex icb which be itself now in the course of reorganisation into countywide icb be assure that there have be absolutely no discussion between basildon borough council and the integrated care board about the expansion of capacity at basildon hospital basildon reg plan should be find unsound on those ground alone move on to the rochford district council side of my constituency we can already see how the government target be have an adverse effect there too as one example taylor wimpey recently begin consultation on plan to build up to house in the metropolitan green belt in an area of land between mount bovers lane and gusted hall lane in hawkwell the local community be up in arm about that and if the minister have the time to drive down main road in hawkwell he would see protest poster in almost every window against this completely unsustainable development in the environmentally sensitive upper roach valley the site be wholly inappropriate for development and indeed it be specifically exclude within the current rochford district council local plan policy state the core strategy state that the upper roach valley will be protect from development which would undermine the area role as green space provide informal recreational opportunity moreover policy which relate specifically to the upper roach valley say policy seek to protect the upper roche valley from development so that it can become vast area for informal recreational opportunity the policy go on the council will strive to see the upper roach valley become vast green lung provide informal recreation opportunity for local resident the council will protect the area from development that would undermine this aim and will continue the approach of create the right condition for flora and fauna to flourish with the minimum of interference should explain to the minister be firmly opposed to the propose taylor wimpey development which be completely contrary to two very specific policy in the excellent rochford district council local plan as have just emphasise there be absolutely no very special circumstance that would justify house building on this scale in this part of the green belt which be extremely popular with my constituent for leisure purpose jogging and dog walking all of which contribute to their wellbeing however this be by no mean the only example of where inappropriate development be now be propose in my constituency when be seek re election last year mr speaker my final leaflet be head give mandate to fight dollymans farm in short this be another site in the metropolitan green belt slap bang between the two large town in my constituency namely raleigh and wickford during the general election campaign warn about bloor homes which have reputation as highly aggressive developer and it must be say treat my former constituent appallingly in propose development of some home at ashingdon which be now on the eastern fringe of my constituency that development be rightly oppose by rochford district council but bloor subsequently win at appeal where among other thing rochford district council hire transport consultant mysteriously change side the night before the public inquiry commence as part of its proposal bloor offer number of section commitment include new doctor surgery on the site some two year later not one brick have be lay to that end despite my attempt to raise this matter with the integrate care board on several occasion prior to the boundary change there be no sign whatsoever of bloor undertake any proactive activity to keep its word about the gp surgery to that sound powerful warning regard its proposal at dollymans farm in essence bloor now envision initially build dwelling on the dollymans farm site its proposal for dollymans farm be trojan horse the site be firmly within the metropolitan green belt and would represent completely inappropriate urban sprawl remind the minister that paragraph of the national planning policy framework the so call planning bible which be sure he now know off by heart state the fundamental aim of green belt policy be to prevent urban sprawl by keep land permanently open to allow development at dollymans farm would be utterly contrary to that fundamental tenet of the nppf the home initially propose take up only fraction of the land on the whole dollymans farm site as be confirm at recent public consultation exercise that the company hold at rawreth village hall and that attend one need only take single glance at the propose site plan to see that this proposal be trojan horse and that if the dwelling be approve further application for thousand more on the same site will no doubt follow we simply do not possess the transport medical or educational infrastructure to cope with urban sprawl on this scale about half mile from the wick as the local mp intend to fight these totally unsustainable proposal tooth and nail because of so call devolution the labour government have cancel the local election in essex however there be by election in the wickford park ward on thursday june and those wickford resident who be lucky enough to have vote can use it on thursday to protest against bloor homes completely unsustainable proposal to build so many home in such an inappropriate location therefore urge my constituent whatever their personal politic might be to vote for the conservative candidate lewis hooper on thursday in order to demonstrate to bloor homes that we really mean business and we do not want its development at dollymans farm perhaps the most egregious example of attempt to overdevelop my constituency relate to the propose new town on the border between southend and rochford in the area around bournes green in essence the proposal be for around dwelling on either side of the rochford southend border in answer to question to the deputy prime minister on monday april she confirm to in the commons that those dwelling on the rochford side would be in her word above and beyond the mandatory housing target which be already over dwelling that rochford district resident be be threaten with by this current labour government for the record be completely opposed to these proposal as well however particularly wish to draw to the minister attention the fact that there appear to have be some serious irregularity in how all of this be propose and would be grateful for his close attention to they when the original expression of interest be send in some month ago rochford district council be something of rainbow coalition but lead by the liberal democrat group it transpire that the expression of interest that be send to the department the new town taskforce be never approve by any committee of the council let alone by the full council itself there be even some confusion about whether or not the leader of the council who be then councillor james newport actively endorse the proposal in short the whole initiative appear to have be effectively officer lead and officer dominate since then the leadership of rochford district council have change hand as the liberal democrat group effectively collapse and be now divide into various faction some of whom no long identify as liberal democrats shall not try the minister patience with all the twist and turn in this process but none the less suffice to say that at time it have be like something out of gilbert and sullivan the new conservative lead administration work with rochford district residents and several other be attempt to bring stability to the council at meeting of the planning policy committee on june the council formally decide to withdraw its support for the expression of interest as submit to the new town taskforce in other word rochford have withdraw from the propose new town decision that wholeheartedly support as we just do not have the infrastructure to cope with it moreover in her speech to that committee the redoubtable councillor danielle belton say the following about how the eoi be submit in the first place this be about transparency and do right by the community we serve so finally should add that as the incoming leader of rochford district council very concerned about what appear to have happen here but think it be important to establish the fact and learn from they so for that purpose will shortly be establish an independent externally lead investigation to get to the bottom of all this and how exactly this submission come to be send in the first place we will then report the finding of that investigation to full council and via they to our resident in due course give that an external investigation have now be initiate be sure the minister will agree that it would not be appropriate for to comment far in detail suffice to say at this stage that something appear to have go seriously wrong in how the expression of interest be submit which be even more reason for the council rightfully to withdraw from the whole process before leave this topic should perhaps add in pass that there be emerge rumour that brentwood borough council which share the same chief executive as rochford mr jonathan stephenson have also submit an eoi for new town but for far large number than be envisage for the rochford southend equivalent merely observe that there appear to be bit of pattern here will leave that for my hon friend the member for brentwood and ongar alex burghart he be in his place in the chamber listen to this news about his constituency to pursue with brentwood borough council and no doubt eventually with the minister on separate occasion to summarise year experience as constituency mp have teach that there be such thing as good development but that work only if it be something that be do with people rather than to people my genuine fear hope the minister will appreciate what be say be that labour top down approach from both central government and labour lead basildon council very much appear to be do thing to people rather than with they be elect to parliament to represent my constituent and can assure the minister that essex people be not slow in put across their point of view as my email inbox regularly testify indicate assent my hon friend the member for brentwood and ongar be nod his assent we do accept there have to be some new house building in our county but not on the scale that the government propose in order to meet random ideological target of million home even at the risk of materially undermine the quality of life of people who live in essex already finally even if the minister do not agree with today have know he for some time hope that he will at least respect that my concern be genuine and hope that he will take at least some notice of the point that have make this afternoon on behalf of the constituent who kindly re elect recently let begin by congratulate the right hon member for rayleigh and wickford mr francois on secure this debate while may disagree with number of the argument he make for reason will expand upon in due course know that he speak with genuine conviction on behalf of those he represent and no one can doubt his commitment to his constituency in the time available to intend to touch on all the substantive issue that the right hon gentleman raise although will not go into individual planning application for reason that he will understand start by remind the house about the problem that the government be work to resolve it be not believe in doubt that england be in the grip of an acute and entrenched housing crisis to ensure that we have planning system that be gear towards meet housing need in full the government introduce new standard method for assess local housing need as part of the revise national planning policy framework we publish in december and we make that standard method mandatory that standard method now rely on baseline set at percentage of exist housing stock level to well reflect housing pressure across the country and use strong affordability multipli to focus additional growth on those place face the big affordability challenge south east essex would be one of those we have be entirely open that that will mean that all part of the country include essex must play their part appreciate that some right hon and hon member simply do not want to see housing growth in their constituency do not name the right hon gentleman in this respect and some may even question whether housing need exist on the scale that it do and that the government be clear that it do however the government be clear that we must have ambitious target to begin fix the housing crisis afflict our country and that decision make locally should be about how to meet housing need not whether to do so at all turn briefly to local plan the plan lead approach be and must remain the cornerstone of our planning system as know the right hon gentleman understand due to the secretary of state quasi judicial role in the planning system be unable to comment on the detail of his or any other specific local plan however want to underline that the good way of allow community to shape development in their area be to have an up to date local plan that ensure the provision of support infrastructure so that development proceed in sustainable manner in the absence of an up to date plan there be high likelihood that development will come forward on piecemeal and speculative basis with reduce public engagement and few guarantee that it will make the most of an area potential have fail to adopt plan since basildon now have one of old local plan in the country state of affair that be put this as diplomatically as possibly can detrimental to the resident of rayleigh and wickford so be pleased that the new leadership at basildon council be seek to address the failure of its predecessor by bring forward new local plan premise on meet housing need want to make it clear that expect their neighbour at rochford to progress their local plan and consult later this year in line with the update plan timetable to support local planning authority in their effort the government be award million of new funding as part of that rochford and basildon council be each award approximately for local plan delivery and for support with the cost of undertake green belt review it be now each authority responsibility to ensure that their plan unlock growth and secure the housing job and infrastructure their local people deserve turn next to the process of plan making which be important in regard to some of the issue that the right hon gentleman raise national planning policy be clear that the standard method should be use by local authority to inform the preparation of their local plan once local housing need have be assess authority should make an assessment of the number of new home that can be provide in their area this should be justify on the basis of evidence of land availability and constraint on development for example in national landscape and any other relevant matter planning inspector will consider those issue if they be raise when the plan be submit to they we expect local authority to explore all option to deliver the home that their community need include maximise the use of brownfield land work with neighbouring authority and where necessary review green belt land when allocate land the first port of call must be previously develop land put on record again that this government be fully commit to brownfield first approach to development that be why we make change to the revise national planning policy framework last year to place an even strong emphasis on the value of brownfield land development as the right hon gentleman will know in september last year we publish work paper on brownfield passport to explore how far to prioritise and accelerate development on brownfield land and ensure that the default answer to suitable proposal on such land be simple and straightforward yes just last month we publish work paper explore way that we can speed up the build out of consented site include brownfield site so they be deliver as quickly as possible on the right hon gentleman point about the exist developer contribution system we be committed to strengthen that to ensure that council be able to negotiate properly on what public gain can come through the developer contribution system and to hold developer to account for the commitment they make however we know that there be simply not enough brownfield land in the country to deliver the volume of home that work people need let alone enough site that be viable and in the right location that bring to the green belt the government be commit to preserve green belt which have serve england town and city well over many decade not least in check the unrestricted sprawl of large build up area and in prevent neighbouring town from merge into one another we have not change the five purpose of the green belt that be set out in paragraph of the national planning policy framework and we do not propose to alter its general extent instead our reform replace haphazard approach with strategic and targeted approach to green belt land designation and release as result of our change the national policy now include clear direction that where development on the green belt be necessary it should be direct towards the least valuable part of the green belt previously develop or low quality grey belt land the sustainability of site must be prioritise and local authority must pay particular attention to transport connection when consider whether grey belt land be sustainably locate because we recognise the value that the public place on the green belt we have take step to ensure that any necessary development on land release from it must deliver high level of affordable housing the provision of new or improvement to exist green space that be accessible to the public and the necessary improvement to local infrastructure to ensure that resident benefit those new golden rule which be the mechanism by which we will deliver that public gain will apply where major housing development be propose on green belt land but should be clear that the requirement for high level of affordable housing be for green belt land specifically regardless of whether it be release through plan making or subject to planning application be right to say that the minister describe sustainability particularly for green belt development as golden rule understand that the planning inspectorate be begin to take that approach too could he quickly confirm that hear that correctly in judge particular application particularly when local authority seek to release land as grey belt land they do have to have sustainability as concern when case go to the planning inspectorate for example on appeal all these matter will be consider but the right hon gentleman can find the definition of what need to be consider in the nppf be more than happy to point he to that turn very briefly to nature because the right hon gentleman do mention the environment our reform will help to deliver the home and development that our country need but we have be very clear that these must not come at the expense of the natural environment or rural community we be clear that policy and decision should recognise the intrinsic character of the countryside and we be maintain the strong protection for the good and most versatile agricultural land we have preserve protection for high quality green belt land and for land safeguard for environmental reason such as national landscape as have say we be ensure that major new development in the green belt deliver more accessible green space and support nature recovery thank the right hon gentleman once again for share his concern on this matter with the house while appreciate that there be principled and strongly feel difference of opinion between he and on these matter trust that have clearly lay out the government position as ever would be more than happy to speak to he outside the chamber and to discuss any issue of local concern question put and agree to house adjourn
