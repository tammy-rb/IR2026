dental surgery which visit last week my hon friend be right that many of the pressure on our hospital such as the princess alexandra in harlow be result of pressure in other part of the health and

while improve access to primary care general practice be value part of the nhs and gps be vital part of our nhs family in fact they be deliver more appointment than ever before and we recognise the significant pressure they face at the same time we know that patient be struggle to see their gp which be why we have invest an additional million into the arrs to recruit more newly qualified gps

practice call the chair of the health and social care committee last week visit summertown health centre staff there implore to say to the government that the issue be not just more money we welcome

already about the need to shift out of hospital into primary and community service the shadow minister talk about choice conservative members seem to welcome the billion investment but oppose the mean of raise it be afraid they can not do both if they support the investment they need to support the way in which we raise the money if they do not support the way in which we raise the money they need to spell out how they would raise it or be honest about the fact that if they be still in government they would continue to preside over mismanage decline one gp describe the situation as schrödinger primary care gps be see as private contractor so not exempt from the ni increase but they be exempt from the small business relief because they be deem to be public do the department of health team knowingly go along with the treasury team plan to tax primary care without mitigation lead to cut or do it not understand or spot the complexity of what be go on so mitigation have to be put in place

political dissent as she say the so call be guilty only of exercise their right as guarantee under the international covenant on civil and political right and basic law and of exercise their right to freedom of speech assembly and political participation china imposition of the nsl in hong kong have erode the right and freedom of hongkongers and the uk government will always stand up for the people of hong kong the jailing of pro democracy campaigner in hong kong under the draconian national security law be appal it be serious blow to freedom in hong kong the harsh application of this disturbing law to suppress people in hong kong can not go unanswered in government my party consistently champion for that law to be repeal and we give safe route for british national overseas in need of protection be proud to have establish that scheme as the then home secretary we also publish report twice year on the situation in hong kong to raise our grave concern about the erosion of freedom with the chinese authority and at the united nations yesterday the prime minister meet president xi and say he want respectful relationship where both country try to avoid surprise he even confirm that he have call in the application for the new chinese embassy but less than hour later the sino british declaration have be trample on yet again with the sentencing of pro democracy campaigner where do that leave the government reset with beijing do the prime minister actually secure any commitment on hong kong yesterday will the prime minister now be hold further conversation with president xi to convey his concern about this appalling jail why do the minister for the indo pacific this morning not call in her statement for the repeal of the national security law the official no read out of the prime minister meeting with president xi fail to mention jimmy lai case we understand the prime minister do raise concern but that be not enough do he call for jimmy lai to be release and for an end to his politically motivated trial yes or no answer be need because there be an important distinction between the two the uk have an historic and moral commitment to the people of hong kong we must stand up for their right under the international covenant on civil and political right and basic law the government must provide the mettle need to handle the relationship with china to stand up for the freedom and democracy of hong kong and to raise their game the government absolutely agree about the historic relationship between the uk and hong kong and the current incredibly strong and important relationship in opposition my party rightly support the measure for british national overseas we have be crystal clear in our view on yesterday sentencing repeat that it be clear demonstration of the hong kong authority use of the nsl to criminalise political dissent respectfully have to say to the right hon lady that when she seek to lecture the new government on our approach to china she should be aware of what we see over the past year wild oscillation in policy towards china that go from the golden era period right through finally to complete lack of engagement that be out of step with our partner include the us france and germany which be have those conversation the new government have be determine to have those conversation the right hon lady refer to the prime minister meeting where he make very clear his concern about human right issue he do raise jimmy lai case that be very clear from the footage of that meeting if she have not see it respectfully encourage she to look at it we will continue to raise human right issue as part of our consistent approach to china call the chair of the foreign affairs committee the verdict and sentence of the be like the national security law itself and the treatment of jimmy lai clear violation of the sino british joint declaration on hong kong follow the meeting between president xi and the prime minister will my right hon friend please share with the house what step the government plan to take to ensure that the joint declaration be adhere to be grateful to my right hon friend for the work that she be undertake on this matter through her leadership of the select committee the uk government have be very clear about these issue the right hon lady rightly mention the case of the british national jimmy lai whose trial will resume tomorrow and whose case be priority for the uk government the foreign secretary raise it during his first meeting with china foreign minister wang yi at the summit of the association of southeast asian nations on july and as have say the prime minister also raise it during his engagement few day ago we will continue to call on the hong kong authority to end their politically motivate prosecution and release jimmy lai immediately and we will continue to press for consular access and indeed exert pressure in relation to the other human right issue that be of such concern to everyone in the house call the liberal democrat spokesperson we be deeply concerned by the sentencing of the beijing assault on fundamental liberty in hong kong libertie that it be oblige to preserve under the joint declaration continue we have moral duty to stand with hongkongers not least jimmy lai meet his son sebastian last week his father have be hold for in solitary confinement for more than four year despite serious health condition do the minister understand that meet chinese ministers as the foreign secretary and the prime minister have in the last month without set out any consequence give china the green light to continue we see under the conservatives that this passive approach yield no result so do the minister agree that there should be no further ministerial meeting until these human right abuse be address and specifically do she agree that there should be no visit by the chancellor to beijing until jimmy lai be release the foreign secretary have also meet the family of jimmy lai and like all of we on this side of the house be deeply concerned about his situation jimmy lai be of course year old and there be deep concern about his welfare the uk be absolutely clear about the fact that he must be release immediately have to say however that do not agree in any way with the hon gentleman characterisation of the current uk government approach during the latter year of the previous government we see what be arguably passive approach and lack of engagement with no meeting and visit and that be not the right approach to take it follow the golden era when there be very different approach an approach some would say that be not clear eyed the current government be instead be consistent we be engage where it be necessary to challenge as well as engage where it be necessary to compete and indeed to co operate that be the right approach when it come to these matter of human right as well as our relationship with china more broadly as chair of the all party parliamentary group on hong kong thank ministers for their effort and recognise the effort of the prime minister however after nearly four year in solitary confinement for jimmy lai and with trial begin in court that we know will only ever find he guilty at what point do the delicate diplomacy have to give way to something more like demand for his freedom be grateful to my hon friend for his recognition of that engagement as mention few moment ago the uk government be deeply concerned about jimmy lai situation but we have be crystal clear and that include the clarity provide by the prime minister which in respect of this issue as well as other be very much in evidence during his meeting at the have sit watch both government on this one and do not think that any government have the right to accuse the party that be formerly in power and talk about what it get wrong because that government get it all wrong and this one be get it all wrong as well the key point be this the minister have refer to all those who have be incarcerate but particularly to jimmy lai who be in solitary confinement yesterday when the prime minister rightly start to raise the issue of jimmy lai and human right all the journalist be clear out of the room straightaway because the chinese government do not want they to hear what he be say just before that meeting president xi say that china would brook no interference when it come to democracy and human right and that be one of his four red line put this question simply to the minister do she not think that without some kind of sanction china will go on and on america have sanction many senior official in hong kong for these abuse and we have sanction none do she not think it be time for we to say we will sanction someone if you do not stop believe it be appropriate to make relative judgment so that we can assess the right way forward for the uk relationship with china that be why the uk government be conduct an audit of our relationship with china so that we can have consistent approach we believe that be incredibly important so be afraid that respectfully do not agree with the right hon gentleman have ringside seat for some of the action of the previous government during the golden era and for what be suggest then around trade protection we need to move forward with more clear eyed approach and the uk government could not have be clear on these matter of human right include the prime minister himself as the right hon gentleman just acknowledge on sanction he will understand of course that will not speculate on future designation as to do so could reduce their impact but can reassure he that the fcdo continue to keep potential sanction designation under close review over hong kong family have settle in read over the past few year include in my constituency and have stand alongside hong kong activist in peaceful demonstration here in the uk the onerous sentencing of pro democracy activist in hong kong will give people broad reason to fear transnational repression and continue harassment here in the uk can the minister assure we that she will work to upkeep not only the bno visa programme and the path to citizenship but the civil liberty of hongkongers here in the uk who may be at risk of transnational repression be grateful to my hon friend for raise this issue have read her fascinating book which cover human right in china and she be clearly an expert on these matter as well as have constituency experience the uk government view be that any form of harassment be unacceptable and that political freedom must be retain include in the uk and above all for bno we will continue to ensure that that be the case in the hong kong police issue arrest warrant for eight overseas activist under the national security law what be minister do to challenge the extraterritorial reach of the national security law we be very clear as be the previous government at the time of the passage of that law we believe it be incredibly important that people in hong kong and beyond be able to exercise political right and indeed to participate politically all that the group of individual who have just be sentence be do be exercise their right to political participation we will resolutely defend that right include in the uk and elsewhere look forward to the minister report on the audit of the relationship with china and of the continuum of action from sanction onwards that the government be look at in the meantime may ask the minister to raise with the chinese government the case of carol ng man yee who be colleague of mine in unite and labour party member she be involve in organise for unite in the dispute with british airways over the year and she become president of the hong kong confederation of trade unions she stand in the primary and lose but then take no further action she be sentence to four year and five month may ask the government to raise her case and particularly the need for she to have visit from her family and her trade union rep so that we can impress upon the chinese government that in addition to our lobbying for her release we need to ensure that there be humanitarian treatment of such prisoner be grateful to my right hon friend for his support for the government ongoing audit of our relationship with china and for the information that he have provide about one of the individual who have be sentence in china be aware that an australian citizen be among those who have be sentence but be not aware of the information provide by my right hon friend about his colleague who have be sentence for her work in the uk it be very helpful to be aware of that and would be grateful if he send more information about this matter today bring together parliamentarian from country and the eu to call for the chinese communist party to immediately release jimmy lai it be extraordinary for the prime minister to meet xi jinping in the same week that jimmy sham trial resume yet the prime minister use just word in support of jimmy cause in his meeting with xi and no he do not call for jimmy release he just mention his poor health what we learn be that the government have call in plan for new chinese communist party mega embassy as favour to xi and at his request why be sure that the hon lady with her considerable experience will be well aware of the fact that the prime minister be at the leader summit which every member of the attend be sure that she will be aware of how these meeting work on the embassy to which she refer it be standard for application to be call in if they affect other government call in the application should not be take as any indication of our view on the merit of the scheme as this case will be determine by ministers in the ministry of housing communities and local government it would not be appropriate for to comment far be pleased to sign the letter from parliamentarian of country that the hon member for rutland and stamford alicia kearns just mention and thank the minister for confirm that meeting take place with sebastien and the foreign secretary can the minister outline how we will work with other country in concerted co ordinated effort as we have hear many of they have individual in arbitrary detention in hong kong how can we co ordinate across those country to get the release of activist such as jimmy lai be grateful to my hon friend for raise the need for co ordination obviously there have be co ordination among parliamentarian which have be very positive to see and the uk government will continue to co operate with other on these issue we have also work with other country government on case involve dual national thank the hon member for rutland and stamford alicia kearns for organise powerful letter and be glad to be able to put my name on it give the concession that be give to china by the prime minister and the particular responsibility that we have to hong kong what do the prime minister get out of the meeting can the minister tell we the read out from the prime minister and when will she publish her audit follow the question from the right hon member for chingford and woodford green sir iain duncan smith will the audit include the option of sanction be grateful to the hon member for his question the read out can be easily access will not read out all of it but will underline the fact that it make it very clear that the prime minister say that he want to engage honestly and frankly on those area where we have different perspective include hong kong human right and russia war in ukraine that be take directly from the read out of the meeting as say there be also footage of it which the hon gentleman can easily access on sanction refer he to my previous response so long as we be limited to say how cross we all be about our different perspective and the minister keep sanction under review china will take not blind bit of notice will it the right hon gentleman will be aware hope that go into detail about sanction in advance be extremely problematic for the entire sanction system it would reduce its effectiveness which be why government of all complexion do not comment on future designation this be bad day for human right but for the hongkongers live in my constituency it be frightening day beyond the broad reassurance that the minister have already give what specific action will the government take to protect hongkongers live in the uk from state surveillance recognise the concern that will be cause by this matter as articulate by my hon friend the member for earley and woodley yuan yang the uk government be absolutely resolute in our determination to ensure that bno be able to live their life freely and without prejudice or fear in our country we remain absolutely committed to uphold their human right and we will continue to do so if there be specific instance of concern would be grateful if the hon gentleman inform of they my constituent and friend sir henry keswick who die early this month be for many year the chairman of jardine matheson he be great believer in the opportunity for good relation between this country and china there be an awful inevitability in the fact that the day after the prime minister meet the chinese president and declare new era of positive relation the sino british declaration be comprehensively breach do the pragmatic relationship that the prime minister think he can have with china include get assurance that the national security law will not jeopardise the interest and welfare of british business and employee work in hong kong would like to communicate my regret at the passing of the hon gentleman constituent who seem to have have great expertise and engagement on these issue the prime minister be very clear that while the uk will seek to co operate with china on area of mutual interest we will also compete and indeed challenge where we must that be explicit in his message as it have be from day one of the new government that be why we be conduct the audit to ensure consistency towards china on all issue across government it be clear that any hongkonger who cross the chinese communist party face grave risk will the government update the foreign commonwealth and development office guideline on overseas business risk to include more detailed information on the risk pose to business by the hong kong national security law particularly article my department keep all form of guidance continuously under review that include guidance for business people and of course for traveller that be the case for hong kong as for every other location where brit might be operate in those determination we will ensure that we look at whole range of factor cover personal safety and legal risk thank my right hon friend for her statement like other speaker in this chamber have large hong kong community in my constituency in colindale and that community be very worried about transnational repression will the minister meet and other mp to discuss this issue be grateful to my hon friend for raise the concern of his constituent such concern have indeed be articulate by other in this chamber either the minister for the indo pacific the hon member for hornsey and friern barnet catherine west or would be delighted to meet he to discuss this last month the foreign secretary tell the house that he have make the release of jimmy lai his priority yet the official downing street read out of the prime minister meeting with president xi just say that they discuss different perspective on human right and do not even mention jimmy lai by name how can the release of jimmy lai be government priority if on the eve of his show trial the prime minister official read out can not even mention his name after he meet the man responsible for his arbitrary detention would respectfully refer the hon gentleman to the footage which be widely available and which make the point extremely clear be sure that the right hon lady will gather the frustration that we all have on both side of the house about what be go on she probably share it what step can she take with the chinese government to address what can only be see as political lawfare give that our prime minister seem to have some access to the chinese president do the minister agree that we can not sit back while people be find guilty of nothing more than propose candidate for democratic election and that we be watch the death of any pretence of democracy in hong kong the uk government be not sit back we be stand up and we be be very clear indeed about our position mention early the clarity with which the minister for the indo pacific have state the uk government position that follow engagement on these question from my right hon friend the foreign secretary who be now beside on the front bench and of course from the prime minister it be incredibly important that we have government who raise these matter directly with the chinese government it be arguable that we have bit of vacuum in that respect over the few month

consequence and it be putin and his ally who be recklessly escalate this war with iranian ballistic missile be use to strike ukrainian city and north korean troop be send to attack ukrainian soldier when we support ukraine we be not just aid its fight for freedom we be also contribute to our fight for our freedom the freedom of all state all over the world to choose their own destiny and future

since he first seize crimea and sponsor insurrection in donbas and even long since he have seek to meddle in ukrainian affair all to further his own interest he have track record of violate past agreement he show no sign of want peace he would seek to exploit any pause in fighting to win his troop respite before resume hostility as he do after the fail minsk talk underline these truth because they must inform our strategy if we want to see peace restore in europe we need putin to see that there be no route to military victory we need to make the price that he pay for his senseless war even higher we need to remember that the price that we would pay for his victory would be high still we need ukraine to stay strong so ukraine need we to stay strong by its side that be what this house

everything we can to support it military economically and on humanitarian level thank my right hon friend for his statement indeed thank he and our right hon friend the defence secretary for their joint leadership on this matter the key issue as far as can see be the shipment of oil oil be the lifeblood for putin finance his illegal activity and sanction be the way we have to stop that will my right hon friend the foreign secretary give an assurance that there be now no british individual or company engage in the illegal shipment of oil or its financing if he can not give that assurance today what further action will he take so he can come to the house in the relatively near future and do so my hon friend question allow to say that sanction have deprive russia of more than billion since february which be equivalent to four more year of funding for the invasion he be also right however that there be shadow fleet and over the past few month have issue more sanction on those behind that he be also right to single out the enabler who might exist in our own country he can trust keep this under close scrutiny and there be more to come suspect over the come day he be absolutely right to make it crystal clear that we can not have uk business and enterprise individual support russia in its war effort welcome the foreign secretary statement but will push he on the issue highlight by the chair of the defence committee the hon member for slough mr dhesi britain have continuously lead the way right from the start whether on the provision of javelin or main battle tank or on the argument about fast jet read the newspaper would have believe that the foreign secretary have be lead the way in push for storm shadow to be use in russia he dismiss that and say that the matter be not to be discuss but when will we hear from the government that the ukrainians will have the ability to use storm shadow on target in russia will it be next week next month next year the americans be sham we we should not be sham we should be lead understand the right hon gentleman strength of feeling and why as back bencher he be double down on the issue think he will see that this government have lead and continue to lead in the debate right across our ally he will also understand however that we need communication discipline on these issue that be what we see with our opponent in russia the dprk and iran therefore lament little some of the debate that we read across the newspaper member be not go to get those sort of leak or suggestion from at the dispatch box as chair of the all party parliamentary group on ukraine thank the foreign secretary and the defence secretary for all their staunch work in support of ukraine we have hear lot of talk about escalation

all party parliamentary group on ukraine to champion the country cause in this parliament and beyond with the visit he have make and his update to over the past few year he raise number of issue and want to assure he that we be alongside he and we continue to be alongside the ukrainian people my hon friend raise an issue that think be important and which have not come up so far the malign activity of russia and the hybrid threat it be engage in right across the region one country in particular moldova be on the front line of russian hybrid threat and the interference in its election have be entirely unacceptable we stand in solidarity with the people of moldova and continue to support they against the threat to journalist and the disinformation from the russian regime and the other extreme example be receive thank the foreign secretary for his statement as have be acknowledge this war have be go on not just for day but for more than decade with ukrainians fight for our freedom as well as for their own country independence wish to put on record my party support for the action that we have take so far and in particular our support for ukraine have number of question for the foreign secretary on drone technology we be see delay in release some of the licence will he mention that to his colleague in the department for business and trade can we get some more in country co operation give how far ukrainian technology have advance do he agree that we can no long continue to allow the russian federation to able to strike ukraine with impunity finally billion worth of russian asset have be forfeit will he at least make commitment to look into release that so that we can fund ukraine properly slava ukraini the hon member ask number of question he raise the issue of licence which have also see mention in the paper can assure he that we have look at that matter thoroughly there be no sense of our hold anything up we have the most robust export licensing regime in the world we stand by that regime which be actually put in place by the previous government and there be no sense at all of it hold thing up unnecessarily the hon member be right to raise the issue of technology drone technology in particular have enable both the uk and ukraine to target russian attack with precision can reassure he that we will continue to lead on the matter of seized russian asset and over the come month intend to redouble my effort with our ally who be not as advanced as we be on this issue welcome the foreign secretary statement and the detail that he have outline today will he provide little more detail on the discussion that we have have with our friend and ally across the west can he also reassure resident in britain about the part that they can play he have speak very eloquently on that indeed my local ukrainian community centre have play very important role in our area thank my hon friend for his question say to the british people that they should take heart from the fact that this parliament be speak with one voice if we as country do all that we can to ensure that militarily and economically ukraine can get through and if we be able to push and nudge our ally to ensure that we be in that place then thing will get hell of lot tough for our russian opponent and we should take heart from that in think about the winter we should continue to do all that we can to send equipment over to ukraine and to support ukrainians in this country it be tough for the people in ukraine at this time some be still leave the country for obvious reason all of our effort be not in vain they be hugely hugely important and be hugely hugely grateful despite the foreign secretary congratulatory assessment the fact remain that russia be run ring around western sanction and that it be use black and grey fleet to threaten the global maritime order have hear nothing from the foreign secretary about what he intend to do about that can he enlighten we do not take issue with the right hon gentleman say that there be still gap and hole and that putin have be very clever in attempt to get around the sanction that put in place but on october we sanction further oil tanker in the russian shadow fleet bring the total number to and in the margin of the european political community summit at blenheim palace we lead the call for action on tackle the shadow fleet which have now be endorse by country in the european union therefore the suggestion that we be do nothing do not hold we will also continue to address the circumvention of sanction which include highlight the risk to partner such as kazakhstan uzbekistan turkey and the united arab emirates and support their effort to continue to tackle the problem welcome the statement by the foreign secretary will he join in pay tribute to the huddersfield ukrainian club which continue to support family who have have to flee ukraine include many child it be really important probably now more than ever that we work closely with our european ally so can he set out how we will strengthen that co operation as ukraine face long and challenging winter how will we help it cope with the relentless attack on its energy infrastructure be grateful to my hon friend for her question as outline this morning speak to meeting of the weimar group of nation across europe it be not forum in which the uk traditionally participate but be very grateful to the polish foreign minister radek sikorski for reach out at this time and ensure that the uk italy and spain be part of that group along with france and germany that be an indication of how united we be attempt to be at this time my hon friend rightly raise the big issue around energy over the next period she call to mind the pernicious attack by russia over the past hour which have be drive at those energy supply and be basically try to turn the light out in ukraine we must do all that we can in co ordinate effort to repel that activity and to help ukraine repel that activity over the come month my question for the foreign secretary be about security guarantee as we mark day since russia full scale invasion we should remember that ukraine ally fail to deter russia in advance of the invasion do understand why country at war can not be admit to nato but we must never again offer some meaningless paper pledge like the budapest memorandum what be the government late thinking about meaningful security guarantee by ukraine ally from the point when the fighting stop the hon gentleman ask good question but it be easy to look back in hindsight personally be critical that the uk do not play part in the minsk agreement we be absent and we could have play far great role our belief be that ukraine rightful place be in nato ally agree in washington that there be to be an irreversible path to full euro atlantic integration include nato membership and that be the right thing to do in the meantime the uk and our ally be step up support for ukraine immediate and long term self defence the hon member be right we must ensure that when this war end and it will end one day it can not start again and that will mean very serious security guarantee for ukraine may thank the foreign secretary and members across the house for the very strong cross party support for ukraine that have be show over recent year and no doubt will continue to be show on saturday have the privilege of attend an annual art exhibition run by the helping our ukrainian friends organisation in north west cambridgeshire although

extraordinary people be make so many mission to ukraine they be face danger as they go into poland to provide support on the border it be quite incredible of course congratulate all those in his constituency on the work that they have do thank the foreign secretary for his statement but can not hide my disappointment that he have nothing to say about free the hand of the ukrainians to use our long range missile how can he lament the attack on ukrainian infrastructure when he will not allow the ukrainians to use our weapon to strike back and retaliate he say all the time we do all we can but we be not and we be now foot dragging we use to lead now the americans be in the lead can invite he to change the paradigm of this war and lead from the front by set an example as the former defence secretary my right hon friend the member for stone great wyrley and penkridge sir gavin williamson describe as we do in the past otherwise he be foot dragging not lead be not foot dragging we be lead but we must be careful not to discuss these plan in detail in the house gently say to the hon member that we must not abuse the fact that this be democratic chamber that putin and other pore over trust we be lead in that debate we want to put ukraine in the strong possible position be discuss that with the ukrainian foreign minister just yesterday in new york and will meet the ukrainian ambassador after this statement we will ensure that they be in the strong possible position thank my right hon friend for his personal and relentless leadership on sanction against those aid and abet

do his utmost to end the continue delay to the release of the billion from the sale of chelsea football club which remain untapped at time when the humanitarian need be so high thank my hon friend for that question and for his continued work we be committed to strengthen sanction enforcement through the october launch of the new office of trade sanctions implementation we have introduce new civil monetary penalty for certain trade sanction breach and the ability to make detail of breach public yes we will look at the situation in relation to those entity in hong kong see that he raise the issue of chelsea football club during question to the defence secretary just few week ago again confirm that that definitely remain in view welcome the foreign secretary statement he say that we would provide billion year in military aid this year next year and every year that it be need that be very much welcome not least in ukraine equally eight week from today there will be new administration in washington so ukraine need assistance now putin will probably not pay price in eight week time because of all the sounding come out of washington ukraine need help now to hit back at putin now the point the hon gentleman make be precisely the point make to european ally this morning do not have the northern ireland accent but believe make the point as forcefully as he have just do want to put on the record my thank to the hundred of exeter and devon family who have play host to over ukrainian family over the past day also thank those ukrainian family for bring such life and vitality to the

that any decision to permit the use of storm shadow missile will ensure the safety of civilian and be in compliance with international law this be the second or third occasion on which have be able to

in accordance with international humanitarian law aviation accessibility motion for leave to bring in bill standing order no beg to move that leave be give to bring in bill to make provision about the accessibility of air travel for disabled passenger to make provision about the power of the civil aviation authority to enforce accessibility requirement to remove the limit on compensation for damage to wheelchair or other mobility equipment on domestic flight and for connected purpose seek to introduce legislation to create strict regulation for airport and airline to ensure that they can facilitate the smooth journey of disabled passenger to enter the airport navigate security board the aircraft and have safe journey before disembark at their destination the bill aim to grant great power to the civil aviation authority to fine airport and airline for not comply with regulation to accommodate disabled passenger it also aim to provide adequate compensation to they and to promote further accessibility in future development in the aviation industry accessibility in air travel be not just matter of convenience it be matter of right dignity and equality it be about ensure that everyone regardless of their mobility or physical condition can enjoy the freedom to travel whether for work family or leisure without face undue barrier or discrimination pay tribute to baroness tanni grey thompson and thank she for spending time last week to discuss with her direct experience of these issue also pay tribute to the secretary of state for transport for announce this month that she be set up the aviation accessibility task and finish group that group to be chair by baroness grey thompson will report back next summer and will be dedicate to examine the current legislation it will report on how to break down barrier in order to make air travel well and more accessible for disabled passenger my bill aim to assist with implement any recommendation as well as address exist issue relate to fine and compensation place on record my thank to sophie morgan christopher wood and their colleague at the rights on flights campaign for their work to raise awareness of these issue since its creation in their group have campaign admirably on accessibility in air travel my bill take into account their work in design propose assist air travel act that recommend extend the accessibility and right of disabled people in air travel be grateful for their continue support in the creation of my ten minute rule bill all too often we hear story and see video of wheelchair user be force to crawl through or off an aeroplane because of lack of equipment knowledge and space on board be grateful to frank gardner who like sophie morgan and baroness grey thompson have highlight those issue and his own experience such experience be sadly also share by blind and sight impair passenger research conduct last year by which show that the most inaccessible or challenging act of air travel be navigate the airport arrange assistance to board and disembark the plane and get to and from the airport the issue of accessibility can occur at check in desk and security alongside lack of clear signage and inefficient procedure once passenger have board the plane the issue begin to manifest tenfold for disabled passenger the current design of many aircraft do not meet the need of disabled passenger there be often inadequate space for wheelchair user to navigate the cabin and facility such as accessible bathroom be limited or non existent on many flight although airline may offer assistance to board and disembark the quality and availability of that assistance can vary drastically from one airline to another and there be little if any regulation make airport legally liable for the bad treatment and discriminatory practice against disabled passenger would give consumer the ability to sue airline for disability discrimination many air carrier do not provide the space or the safety requirement for passenger to fly in their own wheelchair to facilitate that wheelchair block should be include to allow wheelchair user to remain safely in their chair throughout the flight many of those change will be an ongoing development in new aircraft and should also feature wide aisle large accessible bathroom and priority seating for those who require special assistance accept that number of leader in the field be work to design new range of airline that will redesign aircraft to make that part of the journey experience easy those who be able to get on to plane in the first place be often leave with the worry of their wheelchair be damage in transit or because of lack of knowledge among airport staff it be therefore paramount that single set of rule and regulation be apply to all airline to promote well knowledge among airport and airline staff and to minimise the risk of damage to wheelchair and mobility scooter it be of paramount importance that passenger can quickly access and use their mobility equipment once they have reach their destination but that be hinder by any damage sustain so measure must be put in place to ensure that air carrier and airport manage body have the mean to transfer securely and stow mobility aid that would avoid all form of hand carrying of power wheelchair and other large mobility aid minimise the risk of damage and the risk of injury to staff it also require further training for airport and airline staff on assist disabled traveller from the airport to the boarding of the plane staff must also be provide with training on manoeuvre disabled passenger and their mobility equipment in an emergency there need to be more consistency in the accessibility service provide by airline and airport too often the quality of service can vary from one airport or airline to another and that inconsistency lead to confusion and delay for passenger we need clear standardised protocol that can be rely upon by all the caa be responsible for the regulation of aviation safety in the uk but it be inhibit in that because it lack the power to fine airline instead it must rely on take business to court to force they to uphold passenger right it be therefore imperative that suitable compensation and penalty charge scheme be introduce with new legal right for complaint handling reporting and enforcement procedure that would include plan for the caa to be able to issue financial penalty to airline that fail in their obligation to disabled traveller and would ensure that the caa have legal power to fine airline and other actor in the air travel sector if they fail to look after disabled passenger and their mobility device whether any harm be due to damage or neglect that would help to create an equal basis in air travel for disabled people airline and airport typically have their own claim procedure to follow which lead to lack of cohesion and often to more confusion and difficulty for consumer in navigate the process the combined outcome can lead many consumer not to claim for their owe compensation in november the caa independent panel recommend new consumer enforcement power and reform alternative dispute resolution scheme without the necessary enforcement power consumer face lengthy wait to receive assistance and be often misinformed about their right and the caa do not have the power to investigate concern currently the amount of compensation available through those complex rule may be limit to around but many wheelchair be worth six or seven time that amount the issue be exacerbate by the fact that although airport should be responsible for provide temporary alternative when wheelchair or mobility aid be repair or replace that do not have to be on like for like basis as the parent of wheelchair user fully appreciate the issue outline by campaigner like other my family have decide for many year that fly would simply be too much hassle and that the distress of damaged or lose wheelchair at the end of flight be too upsetting to consider every person should have the right to use an aeroplane for leisure family or work purpose however the current facility of airport and airline and the caa lack of power prohibit disabled passenger from access aviation travel my bill be applicable to all carrier domestic and foreign undertake flight within from and to the airspace of the uk as well as to all airport within the uk the bill provision extend to tour operator ground handler service provider stakeholder and subcontractor involve in provide good and service to disabled people travel within or through the united kingdom the aviation accessibility bill would make the necessary change to the law to ensure that airport and airline be well able to provide

further message from the lords may be consider forthwith without any question be put proceeding on any further message from the lords shall so far as not previously conclude be bring to conclusion one hour after their wakeford question put and agree to passenger railway services public ownership bill consideration of lords amendment must draw the house attention to the fact that financial privilege be engage by lords amendment if that lords amendment be agree to will cause the customary entry waive commons financial privilege to be enter in the journal before clause purpose improvement of passenger railway service beg to move that this house disagree with lords amendment with this it will be convenient to discuss lord amendment and government motion to disagree lord amendment be delighted that the passenger railway services public ownership bill have return to this house thank members of both houses for their careful scrutiny and commend the collaborative cross party approach take during the passage of the bill to date place on record especially my thank to the rail minister lord hendy of richmond hill and to baroness blake of leeds for their valuable support and for lead the bill so expertly through the other place three amendment be make there that we will seek to address today in this house before speak on the amendment remind both houses that the government be elect on manifesto commitment to bring franchise for train service back into public ownership where they belong in line with the wish of clear majority of the british public and in direct response to the failure of the previous government public ownership will end the gravy train that see the taxpayer foot the bill for more than million each year in fee to private operator which ultimately benefit their shareholder not passenger and not the taxpayer it will allow we to strip out inefficiency and waste and will pave the way for the creation of great british railways end the fragmentation of the fail franchising system and bring together responsibility for track and train under single unified leadership with relentless focus on those who use the railway make statement to the house only last week set out the early progress that we have make in fix our railway there be long way to go in restore public confidence and pride in our railway after year of failure but the journey have begin will briefly set out the government position on the two non government amendment that be make to the bill in the other place lord amendment seek to insert purpose clause in the bill and to require to have regard to it be sure that the amendment be well intentione and be delighted that after year of decline performance the conservative party now recognise that reliability and punctuality actually matter to passenger be more than happy to reassure the house that improve the performance of the railway be at the top of my priority list especially in view of the mess inherit by this government really do not need purpose clause to remind of that in my first few month in office have spend my time make sure that railway leader pay much more attention to punctuality and reliability than they have in recent year as well as be unnecessary lords amendment be misleading and potentially harmful because it pick out improve the performance of passenger rail service as the sole purpose of the bill if that be really its sole purpose the good thing we could do would be to cut train service from the timetable the easy way to make train run on time be to run few of they hope that hon member on all side of the house can agree that that would be absurd improve performance be of course vital objective but it be certainly not the only one from save million of pound each year in fee to private operator and strip out inefficiency and waste to simplify the arcane fare and ticket system and make rail service more accessible all those thing and many more be priority that we will address through public ownership and our wide plan for rail reform the government therefore can not support lords amendment and urge the house to oppose it in my opening remark set out for the house the urgent need to deliver meaningful change in view of that the government can not accept amendment the practical effect of the amendment would be to delay the programme of transfer into public ownership and prolong the fail franchising system that have inflict so much misery on passenger delay the transfer would mean defer the benefit of public ownership as well as the taxpayer have to pay million of pound more in fee to private operator clearly the government can not accept that especially give that we promise the electorate we would manage the transfer without unnecessary cost the additional cost to the taxpayer be why the amendment trigger financial privilege as the house will see on the order paper and as you have lay out madam deputy speaker have also make it clear numerous time that this government will not put up with the appalling standard of service previously tolerate for far too long passenger and our constituent deserve much well have hear loud and clear the call for the poorest perform service to be bring into public ownership first understand those call and deeply regret that the contract we inherit from the previous government make it very difficult to do that but sadly that be the position we must start from we have make it clear that we will bring service into public ownership as exist contract expire which will allow we to end franchising entirely within three year and crucially avoid the need to pay compensation for end those contract early assure the house that the rail minister and be monitor the compliance of train operator with their contract like hawk if an operator performance be poor enough to trigger right to end its contract early we will not hesitate to exercise that right and bring its service in house at the early possible opportunity we will continue to hold operator foot to the fire to ensure that they deliver well for passenger our plan to bring service into public ownership as exist contract end be the right plan and the only responsible one lord amendment would wreck that plan and urge the house to reject it finally the government be pleased to table lords amendment in response to powerful contribution by baroness brinton baroness grey thompson and other who speak on behalf of the many disabled people who use our railway echo the rail minister comment in response to that debate the railway have not do enough to meet the need of disabled people we simply must do well and we will lords amendment send very clear message by make it explicit in the equality act that publicly own train operator be subject to the public sector equality duty lord amendment be accompany by two verbal commitment by the rail minister which be happy to reiterate for the house first the government will work with representative of disabled passenger to develop an accessibility road map that will explain the action we intend to take to improve thing for disabled people or other require assistance in advance of gbr be set up official report house of lords november vol secondly the government will now fund the next phase of improvement to the passenger assist app which be to be deliver in close collaboration with disabled passenger lord amendment be universally support in the other place and be grateful for the constructive discussion that have take place in relation to it be confident that we can continue to work across party to improve accessibility on the railway and urge the house to support the government position today call the shadow secretary of state thank the other place for provide these amendment although the measure in this bill be not surprise and we have state our opposition to its fundamental from the outset we have make the case that in effectively nationalise the operation of our passenger railway we risk go backwards its core provision will mean that the progress make on passenger service since privatisation will not be carry on that say we do agree that there be need for reform and we support the reform lay out in the williams shapps review but the reform propose by this government go too far and will undermine any potential progress that be why the lords amendment we be discuss be of central importance neither of the two amendment pass in the upper house descend from the government intention to bring the franchise into public ownership and they be clearly reasonable and measure as the noble lord moylan point out glare omission from the bill be of course the passenger official report house of lords november vol this be the passenger railway services public ownership bill yet it say nothing about the passenger lord amendment attempt to put that right and put the passenger back at the head of the bill as the drive force in what the government be try to do and to require ministers to test their action under the bill against the standard of whether it will improve matter for the passenger it clarify that the secretary of state must in take any action under the provision of this act have regard to this purpose which be the improvement of passenger railway service it be simple but deeply important amendment that will ensure that the bill which be little more than an ideological undertaking if it lack the propose amendment would be require to act unambiguously in the service of passenger railway improvement how could anyone oppose that there be little public appetite for ideological measure that be not base on the improvement of the passenger experience and to reject this amendment would be tacit admission that the government be reject the principle that legislation direct at the passenger service should be in line with service improvement in do so they would reject the general public consensus urge the government to support the amendment on those ground if they choose to reject it it be incumbent on they to explain why they have decide to make significant legislative change to our passenger railway that could risk worsen service lord amendment contain simple measure to ensure that the government when terminate exist franchise agreement consider operational performance and terminate the worst perform franchise first enable franchise that be currently work well to continue that would clearly be in the good interest of passenger can the shadow minister tell how much that proposal would cost taxpayer give that he support the amendment presume he have detailed financial breakdown of exactly how much money he be ask the state to commit the point of the amendment be to put passenger at the heart of the decision make we be ask for hon member how much the point of the amendment be to put passenger at the heart of the decision making and the propose amendment would ensure that this legislation be in the service of improve passenger experience not purely in the service of fulfil an ideological undertaking lord amendment would also ensure that the government alongside stakeholder consider carefully what performance datum be most relevant to passenger experience and would ensure that that data be take into consideration when undertake the action facilitate by the legislation fail to understand why the government would be oppose to such clearly reasonable protective measure but can guess in justify this ideological legislation the government have make clear their intention to utilise selective performance datum rather than clarify the relevant performance information for its own administrative use or for passenger understanding they be obscure it allow the government to fulfil an ideological project untethere from the public wish to see their experience on the railway improve of course the government could choose to put politic aside and support the amendment and we call on they to do so if they do that would signal that while they be undertake this ideological rail project they be also seriously consider the need for the legislation to make an actual improvement to passenger experience this amendment will help the government action and it be not found on selective principle failure to accept the propose amendment will also fail to ensure that the ideological measure be undertake by this government take into account the need and experience of passenger will the shadow minister give way be just wind up such failure will only further the approach already take by this government of prioritise political convenience over substantive action we urge the government to support these amendment and in do so mitigate the negative impact of their legislation and work to protect and support passenger madam deputy speaker you will perhaps be relieve to know that will not detain the house particularly long rise to support the government but also to say something in favour of the motion in the secretary of state name relate to lords amendment read the lords debate on their amendment and and sympathise with the notion that passenger receive the poor service from train operate company may wish its franchise to be terminate early however the point of this bill be not simply to take over the bad franchise but to recognise that the private operation of the passenger rail service have deliver poor service for passenger in general and that the remedy be to return all passenger franchise to public ownership and close control say to conservative members that the british public speak on this issue at the last election if we look at any of the research and analysis on the passenger rail service it be abundantly clear that not only do the vast majority of the british public want to take our railway back into public ownership and control but the majority of conservative supporter want the same thing perhaps that tell we great deal about why the party opposite be the party opposite why conservative members no long sit on the government benches the hon member for orpington gareth bacon make many reference to ideology do not know how many time he mention the word but ask he to cast his mind back to the railways act if ever there be an act of ideology that be it john major take step that even she whose portrait must be remove be not prepared to take she recognise that it be ridiculous step to take suspect that the mover of the motion in the other place be seek device to disrupt the orderly transfer of passenger rail back into public ownership which be well achieve with the least cost to the taxpayer by do so as each franchise contract expire be hearten to hear conservative members be so evangelical about the issue of performance and punctuality where be they for the past year why be they not do anything about those issue will the hon member give way will certainly give way look forward to it the hon member have mention remove franchise base on performance and passenger satisfaction but which operate with passenger approval rating will be one of the first franchise to be remove actually think that lords amendment be quite sensible in that it look at how we prioritise some franchise operator operate very well recommend and well approve service perhaps the hon gentleman would like to tell we where he think the dividend go when they ship out of the system the conservative party be quite content to see massive dividend pay out to abellio nederlandse spoorwegen deutsche bahn and every other nation state on the planet that could subsidise its own transport system because of the ridiculous system impose on this country railway by the conservative party rather than serve passenger and performance what we get be money ship out of our system for decade subsidise other nation state transport system if that be not good example of barmy ideology do not know what be we be correct that and rightly so the minister in the lords my noble friend lord hendy say that the government do not believe that we should either pay compensation for termination or keep pay fee to own group of train operating company when we do not need to he also clarify that some contract may end early if their performance require it if we have the opportunity to put passenger out of their misery by end fail operator contract early and bring their service into public ownership we will do just that official report house of lords november vol the government be clear that they be move ahead with restore passenger rail to public ownership they have clear plan to do so but lords amendment create obstacle to do that it be not in the interest of passenger and hope the house will throw it out when we vote later call the liberal democrat spokesperson our current railway system be simply not fit for purpose and know speak for everyone in this chamber when say that have to change if we be serious about growth we have to get serious about rail after year of tory neglect we must get our network back on track and put the passenger first across the world there be example of both publicly and privately own train company that do exactly that because of that we need not be ideological about ownership rather we can take pragmatic approach that be why the lib dems have be and remain agnostic about the ownership model adopt as the government have themselves admit nationalisation be not silver bullet it will not automatically deliver cheap fare more reliable and frequent service or well passenger experience while nationalisation might offer economy of scale it come with new danger those of we in this chamber old enough to remember the travail of travel on british rail be unlikely to become misty eyed at the prospect of go back to that future although we might well shed tear in short nationalisation alone will not fix the mess that the government inherit from the conservatives the devil as so often be in the detail and eagerly await publication of the forthcoming rail reform bill which we will scrutinise keenly to ensure that it do not succumb to the same demon that hold back rail in this country for decade whether it be in public or private hand turn to lords amendment throughout my party scrutiny of this bill we have be ask one simple question will it improve passenger outcome as the secretary of state have often argue that be what nationalisation be mean to do and it be why she rightly describe herself as passenger in chief the amendment be consequently important it make it clear that the primary purpose but not the only purpose of the bill be to improve passenger railway service and it require the secretary of state to have regard to that purpose when make any decision use the power under the act so do not understand why the passenger in chief do not want this commitment enshrine in the legislation statement of the bill primary purpose would not add any significant cost place extra demand on the secretary of state or impose any new burden on great british railways it would however provide foundation on which her decision might build and act as guide principle whenever she use power under the act as my noble friend in the other place argue requirement on the secretary of state to improve passenger standard at every turn should not be controversial and be surely not something with which she disagree so be surprised that she seek to excise the statement from the bill and urge member from across the house to vote against the government motion to disagree lord amendment require the secretary of state to rank franchise agreement by performance and to nationalise franchise in that order start with the bad but in each case only if the secretary of state be satisfied that it will result in performance be improve there be some logic to that approach if we go simply by when franchise be due to end some of the well perform franchise would be nationalise first and some of the bad last which be why we originally propose this amendment that same amendment in its entirety have now be put forward by the conservatives imitation be of course the sincere form of flattery and be duly touch by their action only wish that they have take the same approach to brexit however follow discussion with and reassurance from the minister in the other place we now believe that the wording be too inflexible and that the cost of implement the amendment be too high so we be unable to support it we do however share some of our conservative colleague concern and we ask the secretary of state to consider use the power in the bill to extend franchise that be perform well where appropriate as be mention by the hon member for fylde mr snowden if franchise be do well the government should not rush to fix something that be not break they should prioritise nationalise franchise that be perform poorly lord amendment would make the public sector equality duty apply to publicly own railway provider that be very welcome and be pleased that the government have bring forward this amendment after pressure from lib dem colleague and other in the other place we be all shock by baroness grey thompson account of be force to crawl off train this summer nobody should be compel to do that in and it be appal that it be constant reality for many only one in four mainline railway station have step free access and about of they have no tactile paving this make our public transport difficult if not impossible to use for many live with disability that be simply not good enough public transport should be accessible to all and everyone in society should benefit from the improvement to service that we all hope to see ensure that the public sector equality duty apply to nationalise rail service be step in the right direction do of course appreciate that the government be work under the assumption that it would however enshrine that in the bill will help to strengthen that commitment consequently welcome the commitment that the minister in the other place make and hope to see further proposal for make transport accessible in the upcoming rail reform bill as much more still need to be do have see at first hand in my constituency how hard it be for local community to receive funding and support to make train station more accessible local lib dems in wimbledon campaign for decade to achieve step free access at motspur park and be delighted that will soon be attend its unfurling however this should not have take decade to achieve we have likewise be wait for many year for raynes park and haydons road to be make step free and we continue our campaign know that the secretary of state take this issue seriously and look forward to hear her plan to revive the access for all programme plan on which she and her department be work rise to support the government motion to disagree with the lords amendment britain railway be not work as they should and nowhere be this clear than in my constituency of burton and uttoxeter community such as ours have face delay cancellation and limited service in uttoxeter sunday train do not run until pm leave passenger strand or have to resort to drive to their destination in burton high fare and overcrowded train be daily frustration on some service it be so difficult to get seat that it be bit like be labour mp at prime minister question we can and must do well this be not an isolated issue it be the direct result of decade of privatisation model that promise efficiency but deliver fragmentation and sky high cost it have leave passenger pay some of the high fare in europe all while billion of pound flow into the pocket of private shareholder instead of be reinveste in well service our commitment to bring rail franchise into public ownership be the first step towards reverse this failure public ownership will allow we to reinvest billion year back into the system that money will improve service reduce fare and modernise our age infrastructure that be about not just the system but the people it serve public ownership mean that passenger will have real say an accountable passenger standard authority will give local people voice in how their railway be run my constituent want more frequent service and affordable ticket and they want to know that when they wait for train it will actually turn up public ownership give we the chance to listen to concern and act on they cut fare and invest back in the railway be not just about convenience it be about connect people to job education and opportunity for every spend on the railway the economy gain that money go straight into create job support local business and boost regional economy fix britain railway be about more than just train and timetable it be about build system that work for people not profit this government plan for public ownership put we on the right track now we must go far by invest in infrastructure lower fare and ensure that community such as mine be no long leave wait on the platform remind colleague that their contribution should relate to the lords amendment want to speak to lords amendment will briefly make few point first but fully understand that should not go through the debate we have already have on this bill that debate be about conservative members belief that we will drive improvement in the railway by put the passenger at the heart of thing and by ensure great competition and private sector investment while the labour party argue through its manifesto that it can do that through the nationalisation of rail we have have that debate but lords amendment be about pragmatic way in which the proposal can be well implement with the passenger at the heart of they fully accept that we be not have the debate over again in fact it be quite refreshing to see the labour party not break one of its manifesto promise but instead actually push on with the bill as say in my intervention have passenger satisfaction rate but it be one of the first franchise that would lose its licence labour lord snape say on november that it would make no sense to remove franchise such as the greater anglia one which have great public support for the way in which it operate its service in response the minister say that amendment would not make sense because we could simply play the game of target however the government can play the game of target whether or not the amendment be make it do not really matter whether the government can stack target or cut datum certain way we need to call thing out and put passenger and improve service at the heart of the bill lord amendment and be pragmatic step to take we accept that the labour party be implement manifesto promise but the lords have make reasonable recommendation on how thing could be do well and how we can put the passenger at the heart of the bill the amendment look at where passenger already get good service and stage change in way that will not be disruptive to passenger who already get good service on the railway network wish to associate myself with the comment of the secretary of state for transport have hear what she say about some of the amendment from the other place can say that she be far more generous person than be have not be in this place long but can certainly tell mischief when see it mischief from the other place and be afraid from the opposition because the intention here be not to put the passenger at the heart of the bill if conservative members when in government have genuinely want to put passenger at the heart of the railway they might have act differently over year of abject failure spend lot of time on the railway as do many member across the house when travel between westminster and their constituency see that failure daily as have do most of my adult life at time when regrettably the conservative party have be in government conservative members can not even explain how much the amendment would cost as say rail privatisation have be failure the lords amendment do not seek to overturn the decision of this house of course not but they would cause considerable delay however rail change make by this government will be meaningful unlike those make by the previous government do anyone remember great british railways which the former member for welwyn hatfield be incredibly proud of except there be problem the railway be not great and quite often they be not own by british company although suppose we do at least have to give he the fact that they be railway under this government there will be great british railway with one single train operator and we will deliver fundamentally well service come from part of the country that be proud of our railway tradition george stephenson the father of the railway come from not too far from my constituency and each week walk over high level bridge design by his son robert stephenson which still carry train to this day the stephensons would be appal to see the state of the british railway system today we transport railway around the world yet those travel across europe or asia today will see rail system that be far beyond what we have in the home of railway that be national embarrassment finally lords amendment on the public sector equality duty be excellent and will support it the point be well make early today during debate on the ten minute rule bill about the indignity that disable people too often face on the railway thank member from the other place for table that amendment and the secretary of state for indicate the government support ultimately the public sector equality duty be high bar as it should be and as this labour government bring other service back in house would like that public sector equality duty to be apply to they let say how grateful be that the government have accept lords amendment the accessibility of public transport be crucial for all those who wish to use rail service and be currently unable to do so because of their disability need all village station in my constituency lack step free access and it be deeply frustrating for train user that they have to schlep into guildford wonderful as guildford town station be they should not have to travel that far they should be able to get on the train and head where they want to go accessibility be not just for those with disability concern as it improve the service for all user think of mum and dad with buggy and cyclist step free access make train more accessible mean that more people use they that improve the level of traffic on our road which lead to the goal that we all share to reach net zero and create green future endorse lords amendment and will support it look forward to see the detail of the government accessibility road map and step change in the speed of delivery under the access for all programme rise rise call graham leadbitter the snp support the bill and the government position on the lords amendment mainly because the snp government in scotland have already drive forward with public ownership sadly without full and normal power of independence those will come in due course the bill be the current mean to support and underpin those action by the scottish government accept the secretary of state position on lords amendment to take an example from my constituency inverness airport station be open relatively recently and that add time to the journey between inverness and aberdeen kintore station in aberdeenshire be also open add time to the overall length of the journey but do not think anybody would dispute that those be good improvement to the railway they open up the railway to far more people mean that more people be use the line spend money on rail service and take car off the road even if the overall journey time have not be reduce therefore the definition of an improvement in performance be really important and the amendment give no indication of how that will be deal with for that reason the snp do not support it we agree that lords amendment could result in further loss to the public purse and the paying of excessive fee over an extended period we want that money to come back to the public purse so that it can be reinveste in the railway and increase the usage of our train this be not the there be lot of talk about go back to how thing be prior to privatisation but governance and scrutiny be now in very different place from year ago and we should acknowledge that railway that be publicly own might bring about real and sustained age of the train which we might recall from our youth with real infrastructure investment like that see in scotland we want to continue to do more of that that will drag people back on to the railway and move they off the road which will contribute to our effort on climate change and gently improve people life that be why we support the government position on the lords amendment rise order the hon member for derby north would have be call soon if she have be consistent with she bob but know she have be here throughout the debate so call catherine atkinson thank you madam deputy speaker rise to speak in favour of lords amendment and the public sector equality duty welcome the government plan for an accessible road map and the fact that they will work with disabled community to ensure that the bill properly meet the need of people with disability who travel on our train in the other place the minister for rail note that although some change can happen quickly such as the map other take long due to the longevity of roll stock encourage the government to work with roll stock manufacturer to formulate plan as to what change need to be make to our train so that they can be modernise to ensure that future generation of stock serve the disabled community give the direction on accessibility sustainability and affordability know that not only the east midland rail cluster that my constituency be in but the whole industry will be inspire to be the first so that other country will want to follow hope that lords amendment will encourage all those who be championing improvement for our disabled community call the secretary of state to wind up thank all member for their important contribution let start by echo my hon friend frustration with the opposition position sit for two and half year in the place of the shadow secretary of state the hon member for orpington gareth bacon beg his predecessor who sit in my current seat to take action on performance on behalf of passenger so forgive but will not be lecture by the party that give avanti west coast nine year extension will certainly not be lecture about put ideology before the interest of passenger this bill be one step towards the big reform of our railway in decade it will put passenger first and look forward to debate with all member of this house as the railway bill be introduce and pass through the house appreciate the constructive way in which the hon member for wimbledon mr kohler approach the debate as set out in my opening remark be concern about potentially perverse incentive we have already publish our six objective for the railway in our get britain move white paper which cover reliability affordability efficiency quality accessibility and safety hope that he and other member will accept that those objective adequately and comprehensively support the objective of put passenger first thank my hon friend the member for middlesbrough and thornaby east andy mcdonald for his passionate defence of the government position and his comment on the ideological position that the conservatives have pursue he expose the huge flaw in their argument as they attempt to frustrate the government progress on this important reform my hon friend the member for burton and uttoxeter jacob collier give passionate account of the impact of the poor performance of the railway that we have inherit it cut entire community off and he outline the importance of have an accountable railway system which these reform will deliver by have single point of access to great british railways through which member across this house and crucially local people through their local leader can hold the railway to account there be powerful contribution from my hon friend the member for gateshead central and whickham mark ferguson and the hon member for guildford zöe franklin on lords amendment which will be transformative in ensure that the railway be accountable under the public sector equality duty that we lift our ambition and aspiration for our railway and that passenger particularly those with accessibility need be at the heart of this reform be grateful to the hon member for moray west nairn and strathspey graham leadbitter who speak for the scottish national party agree wholeheartedly that we be not go back to the or to british rail be obviously far too young to remember it anyway this be not network rail or british rail reboot this be an enormous once in generation opportunity for new organisation with new culture and new ethos bring genuinely new era for our railway finally thank my hon friend the member for derby north catherine atkinson for her consistent passion and contribution on behalf of the wide supply chain can happily commit that we will work with roll stock manufacturer as part of our accessibility road map on that note ask the house to support the government position by reject lords amendment and and accept lords amendment question put that this house disagree with lords

friend rightly pay tribute to sir brian langstaff everyone should be grateful to he for what he have do in recommendation of his second interim report he be quite clear that the compensation body should be at arm length from government and chair by completely independent judge with sole decision make power do the government accept the core of that recommendation the infected blood compensation authority have operational independence the government have stewardship over the amount of money allocate as my hon friend will appreciate the billion be huge and substantial commitment do not pretend for moment that any amount of money can actually provide recompense for the scale of the injustice but at the same time it be an indication of the commitment from the prime minister the chancellor and across the government to deliver justice in say that should say that be grateful for the work and co operation of hon member across the house in particular once again thank my predecessor as paymaster general the right hon member for salisbury john glen for his effort in government as indicate in the debate last week look forward to continue to work in that spirit with the new shadow paymaster

make in respond to sir brian report but much more remain to be do will set out the government full response to the recommendation to the house in line with the timetable sir brian set out but hope in the course of this debate to assure right hon and hon member and most importantly those in the community that we have listen we have learn and we be take long overdue action the inquiry report be persistent in uncover the truth unshakeable in its honesty and damning frankly in its criticism it be absolutely clear that fundamental responsibility of patient safety in healthcare be repeatedly ignore and that what happen would not have happen if safety of the patient have be paramount throughout the culture of wilful ignorance run through the report and continue to proliferate as the scandal develop it speak to government across decade and state more focused on discharge its function whatever the risk and whatever the cost the report chronicle suffer of almost unimaginable scale thousand of people die prematurely and continue to die every week life completely shatter evidence destroy victim undermine family devastate and child use as object of research it be truly horrify injustice however sir brian report go much far he lay bare the institutional defensiveness that exist within the government and indeed the civil service which lead to the truth be hide for so long compound the pain and the injustice sir brian highlight the consequence of civil servant and minister adopt line to take without sufficient reflection when they be inaccurate partial when they should have be qualified have no proper evidential foundation or make unrealistic claim that treatment have be the good it could be these action be the very antithesis of public service and that be why know there be such collective determination to learn the right lesson and to act on they there be so much that can be say about the volume of evidence that sir brian have uncover and know that during this debate many member will raise vital issue but let be absolutely clear the report detail utterly unacceptable failing on chilling scale and this government will do everything in their power to address they through act on these lesson we must ensure that all those who have suffer and those who have campaign have not do so in vain let now turn to the recommendation that the inquiry make in its report first will touch briefly on the progress that have already be make know that member on both side of the house be keen to hear the detail of what the government intend to do in response the recommendation be wide range and be be give full consideration as have say will provide an update to parliament by the end of the year against each and every one of those recommendation will begin with compensation have already update the house on number of occasion on the progress that be be make be grateful to member on both side of the house for their contribution to the debate on the regulation that we have make to establish the infected blood compensation authority and the core route for compensation for infected people but be also grateful crucially for the support there have be throughout the house to ensure that the delivery of compensation be not delay in any way by parliament what assurance can be offer that the infected blood compensation authority have sufficient staffing and resource at its disposal to meet expectation of the swift payment promise by the government can assure the hon lady that the government will ensure that the authority have the support it need expect it to be make the first payment to infected people by the end of the year and to start make payment to affected people next year further regulation will be require for people who be affect but that will not disturb the timetable that have set out intend the second set of regulation to be in force by march next year more than billion have already be pay out in interim compensation and the government have open application for interim payment of to the estate of deceased people who be infect with contaminate blood or blood product and have not yet be recognise last week constituent come to my office whose mother have die year ago eight month after blood transfusion she have receive when give birth to her fourth son when the family go back to collect the medical record they find that they have all be destroy when we talk about cover up they rightly make that link be there anything the government can say to reassure my constituent that her case will be hear the infected blood compensation authority will obviously take and know this because of the discussion have have with sir robert francis sympathetic view of the level of evidence that will be require sometimes the problem be that the issue complain of date from so long ago but another chilling aspect of this scandal be in some case the wilful destruction of document that be something that we have to take into account when it come to secure justice for people have have the privilege of meet several member of the community and be grateful to they for continue to campaign on this issue let also openly express my gratitude to sir robert francis and david foley of the infected blood compensation authority for continue to work with the community to drive that delivery of compensation forward end the defensive culture in the civil service and government be cultural change that should unite all of we throughout public life that be why work be under way across government to strengthen responsibility relate to candour and transparency for public servant in the king speech that open this parliament the government set out their commitment to legislation to introduce duty of candour for public authority and public servant and the prime minister confirm at the party conference that such legislation would be deliver he say it law for the sub postmaster in the horizon scandal the victim of infected blood windrush grenfell tower and all the countless injustice over the year suffer by work people at the hand of those who be suppose to serve they he also say that the hillsborough law would be introduce to parliament before the anniversary of that event on april next year one of my constituent contact recently to talk about the death of her husband who contract hepatitis as result of infected blood the impact on she and her family have be massive even with the interim payment that she and they have receive can the minister confirm that the infected blood compensation authority have be establish and be undertake the necessary work to deliver payment to victim of this injustice as soon as possible can indeed confirm that the authority be work in way that will allow it to scale up as quickly as it possibly can the need for speed in deliver compensation payment be paramount memorialisation will be really important in how we remember the victim of this scandal sir brian langstaff make compelling case about the need to recognise what happen to people and for it to be recognise by future generation official have begin the necessary work to respond to sir brian recommendation on memorialisation and we recognise that this be an incredibly sensitive issue that we need to get right sir brian langstaff recommendation call for fundamental change to the way that politic and government operate and for one of the large compensation scheme in uk history that be entirely in line with the scale of the injustice that he have uncover give the scale of the recommendation be commit to update formally on they within the month timeframe set out by sir brian langstaff but assure member of this house and indeed the infected blood community that we will drive forward this vital work we will deliver the change that be need which will stand as testament to the bravery and determination of people who have be so badly fail pay tribute to all those who fight so hard to bring we to this moment their effort be monumental and we commit again today to ensure that they have not be in vain commend the motion to the house before call the shadow minister wish to make short statement about the house sub judice resolution understand that several legal case relate to contaminated blood product have not yet conclude however give the public interest in this issue mr speaker have exercise his discretion to allow reference to specific proceeding where necessary as they concern issue of national importance call the shadow minister the infected blood scandal be one of the most painful and shameful chapter in the history of the british state for decade hundred of individual with bleed disorder and other condition be infect with hiv hepatitis and hepatitis due to the use of contaminate blood product such as factor viii and factor ix which be often import from overseas not only be those infection preventable but warning from the medical community be ignore by successive government and the national health service the victim and their family have endure unimaginable suffering include the loss of love one and social stigma and tragically many have even be blame for their own illness the health service that be suppose to treat they heal they and look after they and the part of the state that be suppose to protect they betray they the institution of this country fail the victim and their family at such scale that it be almost beyond comprehension be pleased that this subject have be bring forward to be debate today because subject as important as this deserve to be thoroughly discuss in the house as this be my first debate as shadow minister for the cabinet office want to put on the record that although there will be much that the right hon gentleman and disagree on this issue be not one of they he can be sure of our support as he work to put right historical wrong which continue to have devastating impact on family across the country this issue be simply beyond party politic thank the paymaster general for update the house today and for the tone and tenor that he have already strike in this place since the general election the infected blood inquiry establish in by the former prime minister theresa may be only start because of the tireless effort of victim and their family but it have shed horrifying light on the true scale of the tragedy echo the paymaster general thank to sir brian and his team for the great service that they have give in conduct the inquiry it stand as testament to the power of the victim voice and to the need for transparency justice and accountability at all level although be here today on behalf of his majesty opposition want to reiterate the word of the previous prime minister my right hon friend the member for richmond and northallerton rishi sunak who apologise on behalf of not only the previous government but government stretch back to the know that this sentiment be share by the current leader of the opposition and the whole of our party we be truly sorry that successive government and the nhs fail to listen to medical expert victim and their family and the inquiry reveal decade long moral failure at the heart of our national life great many of its victim and love one sadly die before they ever see the truth be acknowledge be pleased that this government and the previous government have publicly recognise the scale of the damage and acknowledge the mistake and most importantly be now take step to try to make amend and provide support and compensation for the many victim we on this side of the house will continue to support the government ambition to make the first payment before the end of this year it be important that the government be push ahead with the compensation scheme which be of the size and scale that be rightfully deserve by the victim include those who be sadly now deceased and their family and that it will take into account all the medical financial and emotional suffering as have say the minister will have our full support on this side of the house an apology be as he have say meaningless without not just redress but redress at speed in addition hope that the right hon gentleman will be work far with the health secretary to help implement strong medical screening protocol as well as safety measure to ensure that the uk blood supply continue to be safe and free from contamination scandal like this can not be allow to happen again so the government must continue to ensure that the global standard for blood safety be meet and regularly update this include improve regulation where appropriate around the sourcing of blood product and constantly update where possible the method for virus detection it be also important that we far enhance training and education for our healthcare professional regard ethical practice patient consent and the safe use of medical product know that lot have change in the national health service in the nearly year since the start of the scandal but key aspect of this total failure be the lack of informed consent and the failure of healthcare professional to adequately communicate the risk associate with treatment as the inquiry have show there be numerous case of disrespectful attitude towards infected patient which be completely unacceptable patient be often blame for their condition or treat as though they be burden as the inquiry have recommend training must include the ethic procedure as well as patient centre care this scandal sadly be painful case study on what happen when this be not the case medical staff in the nhs should always approach patient with dignity and empathy as we know they almost all do on daily basis they should ensure that all risk and benefit be clearly communicate and that the right of patient be uphold add to this point and perhaps more broadly as society we must continue the great work of recent year on destigmatise those with condition such as hiv and hepatitis note the exceptional work of the terrence higgins trust on the former in particular as have be say the victim of the infected blood scandal be victim not only of the nhs and the many government failing but of social stigma and discrimination as the inquiry find they face vilification despite the fact that many have receive contaminate blood product through the same nhs that be blame they through no fault of their own encourage the government to continue with public education campaign to combat the stigma surround blood bear virus and hiv as well as implement well protection in the workplace and public life so that we can be sure that those infect be not subject to the pain of further discrimination would like to put on record my own thank to the brave victim and their family as say at the start of my speech we would not be here today if it be not for they and for their campaigning their hard work their faith to keep go when nothing seem to be change and when the message simply do not seem to be get through their relentless will to fight know that great injustice have be do and their love for their friend and family member many of whom be sadly no long with we today who be all impact by this terrible situation their courage be truly awe inspire and no amount of compensation will ever undo the great tragedy so great be the pain and suffering they have be through sincerely hope that they will have some peace one day peace in the knowledge that their government and their health service have listen and that all their hard year of campaigning and the abuse and vile vitriol that many have face be not for nothing in the end after far too long they have indeed be hear and because of all their combine effort and sacrifice we can now come together to ensure that nothing like this ever happen again they have move the nation and this parliament with their deeply personal story and we be all deeply sorry for everything they have be through and for everything and everyone they have lose thank they all for their extraordinary bravery in the past three year alone have speak in this house at least time about the delay that the victim of contaminate blood have face in obtain the justice and compensation they deserve progress have be painfully slow and as my right hon friend the paymaster general say there be much anger frustration and mistrust for we to deal with as it have not go away it have not be dilute by the general election and those seek compensation be rightly angry and mistrustful in may the inquiry find that more than people have sadly die as result of this scandal roughly one victim die every two day many without receive compensation would not like to calculate how many people have die since first speak about contaminate blood in the house my right hon friend mention further legislation and between now and then more people will sadly pass on as result of this scandal appreciate that my right hon friend have have only few month to try to rectify the consequence of the previous government slow response to sir brian langstaff demand again urge my right hon friend to do everything in his power to ensure that the infected blood compensation authority hire the staff need to address the challenge and to design the procedure require with the utmost urgency be sure that my right hon friend have get the message have speak in the house many time of my constituent sean cavens who be one of the young people in the country to be infect with hepatitis as result of be give contaminate blood he have campaign tirelessly on behalf of fellow victim of the scandal many people have die wait for justice at the current rate of settle claim which be another huge issue victim and other be concerned that many more people will die without see of compensation for themselves or their family they question whether the government be act quickly enough with only claim expect to be deal with by the end of the financial year and more than claim in limbo share their concern be not sure if that be good enough sean be now year of age he be infect with hepatitis and other virus in he wonder where he fit in the selection process he will not be alone in wonder whether he must simply hang on and hope to survive long enough to see justice do for he and his family while the scheme currently have no effect on payment make through the infected blood support scheme that will cease to be the case in the new financial year hope my right hon friend the minister will review that approach and extend the deadline so that people who receive payment after march do not see that deduct from compensation through the new scheme will my right hon friend the minister consider that point fundamentally sean and other be concerned that those currently on the infected blood support scheme be not automatically be offer the core route payment they wonder why they can not be offer lump sum payment equivalent to payment up to the average life expectancy of they be also concerned that the rate of compensation to be offer be rumour emphasise the word be only of current annual payment be sure that will be outline by my right hon friend in his wind up speech the uncertainty about the compensation scheme date of infection criterion be cause concern for victim the burden of proof for those who be infect after screen for relevant virus begin be deem by the infected blood compensation authority to be high but without any clarification on what that actually mean in practice will the minister provide such clarification screening begin for hiv in november and for hepatitis in september but for hepatitis it be as early as december as mention sean be infect with hepatitis in he need to know how that will affect his final compensation for instance will the ibca take into account that the screening test for hepatitis in be estimate to have be only effective will the ibca recognise that victim be treat for hepatitis with the retroviral drug interferon which have well know serious side effect on patient mental health will that be reflect in their compensation will the minister confirm that sir brian langstaff recent guidance contain in his letter date november regard the sibling of victim who deserve compensation will be accept by the ibca and reflect in any compensation scheme that it design will as sir brian have recommend any family member whose relationship be so close to the victim that damage to their own mental or physical health cause by witness their sibling suffering be reasonably foreseeable receive full compensation if they be so damaged it have be report that the ibca will only compensate sibling of victim if they live with the victim in the family unit for full two year will the minister ensure that that arbitrary restriction be not contain in any ibca compensation scheme will the minister confirm that the family of any victim who die before his or her application to the ibca have be complete will receive full compensation there be indication that the ibca interpret the inquiry final report as say the contrary that it intend to pay only those who live long enough to receive final reward that can not in any way shape or form be correct it be not fair and it be not just will the minister ensure that those who as child be purposefully infect with contaminate blood in the name of medical research be award enhance punitive level of compensation to reflect the country abhorrence at such horrific criminal behaviour carry out by medical professional who have swear to dedicate themselves to heal the sick that be one thing just can not understand the whole tragic scandal be an absolute disgrace but it be really abhorrent that this great country of our experiment on little child those child many of whom have not survive deserve the compensation how much they should be award be obviously to be determine as have be state but bear in mind the abhorrent nature of what we have do as nation ask the minister to ensure it be enough the infected and contaminate blood scandal be just one of far too many injustice in the uk in recent decade in which powerful people have treat institutional reputation career prospect and in number of case profit as be more important than working class life hillsborough orgreave the postal service horizon scandal and grenfell all share this shameful characteristic each one send out message that ordinary working class life do not matter the minister can take this opportunity to show that this labour government think that the life of ordinary people matter by ensure that the victim of contaminate blood product receive just and meaningful compensation without any further unconscionable delay call the liberal democrat spokesperson be grateful for the opportunity to speak in this incredibly important debate begin by pay tribute to all those who have their life destroy by the infected blood scandal and everyone who have campaign for justice they include my constituent gary webster for those who be not familiar with his story gary be bear with haemophilia and at the age of nine he be send to treloar college specialist boarding school in hampshire his parent hop that the school on site medical facility would enable gary to lead as normal and happy childhood as possible all the boy at the school and their parent trust the doctor who see they implicitly but in fact the boy be be give contaminate factor viii blood product import from the us gary be in his final year at school when he be tell that he have be infect with hiv aids and hepatitis and that there be no guarantee that he would be alive in six to month of the haemophiliac boy who attend treloar between and have since die the infected blood inquiry report by sir brian langstaff find that death illness and suffering be cause needlessly to people with bleed disorder by treat child at treloar with multiple risky commercial concentrate prophylactically and as object for research and treat child unnecessarily with concentrate especially commercial one rather than choose safe treatment one can only imagine the pain of the survivor and all the family and it beggar belief that it have take so long for they to get justice the thousand of victim of the infected blood scandal and their family from across the uk have be wait far too long for justice accountability and compensation the liberal democrats welcome the introduction of the infected blood compensation scheme we be glad that it will bring the victim of this gross miscarriage of justice include those who be infect and those who have be affect close to the justice that they deserve it be crucial that this compensation scheme be implement as quickly and effectively as possible we be also back call by the survivor for duty of candour on all public official the infected blood scandal campaign organisation factor have highlight that the guidance on the infected blood compensation authority website state should an eligible affected person die during the application process to the scheme their compensation award will not be pay this be in line with the inquiry recommendation however factor have examine the inquiry second interim report and in the summary of conclusion on page at conclusion sir brian langstaff say where an affected person who have not make claim die the sum that they might have receive if they have claim should not become part of their estate the key wording be who have not make claim will the government update their policy and ensure that all affected person who make an eligible claim have their claim honour that be important for those affect who be elderly or ill and be concerned that they may not live to see the end result of the claim process hope the minister will look at that as matter of urgency the infected blood scandal have highlight the importance of robust blood safety measure and tool will the government look into the merit of pathogen inactivation technology to ensure that no one else unnecessarily suffer from infected blood and that we have safe reliable supply of blood product speak with gary webster on friday and as he put it the whole process need speed up after so many year of secrecy deceit and delay the government must ensure full transparency about the progress of the scheme and

for as long as be in this place will use this platform to speak up for they and their right as our much miss and beautiful friend jo cox teach we whatever our difference we always have so much more in common than that which divide we may first commend the hon member for gedling michael payne for his maiden speech think we can all agree that it be very moving and that he do great credit to his family and constituent apologise for not have be here for the first few minute be run over from portcullis house have the privilege of be the minister with responsibility for the infected blood compensation scheme on may bring the scheme to the floor of the house speak from the government dispatch box in the six month prior have be determine not know when the election would be call to do everything could to bring that compensation scheme to life after so much delay that delay have be as the hon member for blyth and ashington ian lavery rightly say totally unacceptable for too long in my remark to the house will pay tribute to the victim explain some of my experience as minister and make some observation on what lesson and next step may need to take place first acknowledge the work of my successor as paymaster general the right hon member for torfaen nick thomas symonds he have do virtually everything that would have do have the electorate overall give we different outcome though will always be available to member of the public to ask question in this house as be my responsibility as an opposition back bench mp believe that he be do everything he can to move the scheme forward as quickly as possible and will come on to the mechanic of that in moment during the month of may participate in meeting meet representative of group in london leeds birmingham cardiff belfast and edinburgh each meeting be profoundly emotional and move moment for and the official who accompany meet people who have go through unimaginable suffering and uncertainty for not just matter of month but in some case number of decade some have be infect through their marriage some have be bear as haemophiliac and have be treat in way that have the consequence we have speak about today some have transfusion when give birth to their child some receive blood transfusion from import that prove to be defective some have hepatitis or hepatitis some have hiv many have combination of different condition some have be family member of those who have be infect it be humbling but tragic set of moment in those conversation look those individual in the eye and say be deeply sorry on behalf of the british state it be great privilege to be ask to do that on behalf of his majesty government but we must learn lesson collectively from the endure failure to come to term with what have happen over the course of so many government and so many decade many of the individual meet have campaign relentlessly and pay tribute to they today will not draw on individual name because there be just so many people and it would be unfair to all those whom meet it be right that we bring forward second interim payment and it be right that we recognise the affected community as well as the infected community it be tragic to see that there be sometimes dispute and division among many of the community because so much time have pass and so much fear exist around who would be look after first and about whether there would therefore be constraint on the money available will step back to last year after the remembrance weekend in be ask to move from my long tenure in different role in the treasury to the cabinet office to become paymaster general the year before have have some exposure to the challenge of make provision for compensation and my immediate predecessor the former member for horsham have do lot to try to ascertain what have be do collectively in government the truth be that there be very wide envelope it may have be between billion and billion and it have move around accord to what analysis could be do that be because the parameter be fundamentally go to be base on how much compensation we would pay the different group who be infect and affect my predecessor start that process and pay tribute to he for what he do also pay tribute to the former chancellor my right hon friend the member for godalming and ash jeremy hunt who say to when leave the treasury you have one duty in that job that be moral duty to resolve the compensation scheme honestly believe that he be critical in ensure that we get to where we do on may pay tribute too to the right hon member for kingston upon hull north and cottingham dame diana johnson who do so much at every question session she sit just behind where stand now challenge on what be or be not do as the paymaster general know too well there be always constraint his official will say would say that at this point we be always try to say more but be acutely aware of how frustrated all the community be and that unless what say be crystal clear it would set off another storm of speculation on social medium on the advice of my official appoint sir jonathan montgomery who in the early month of assemble small group of technical expert to advise on how to translate the compensation study of sir robert francis into full compensation scheme we ask how across the five head of loss injury impact social impact autonomy the care award and the financial loss award we could put number on the relative suffering across all the different condition how could we put number on the loss of normal life the loss of the ability to work the loss of sense of respect from the community in which people live and the stigma that other member have refer to it be suggest to at the time that have do it the wrong way round that should have engage with the community take the view that we be not go to get this resolve if we have do it that way round but know it be critically important for all the community to be engage with and always have that expectation and intention that be why when announce the scheme to the house on may establish series of engagement where sir robert francis meet representative of the infected and affected community to go through the scheme and establish where change need to be make those engagement happen in june pay tribute to my successor the paymaster general who engage with the output of that work and as per the timetable that have be agree make virtually all of the change that be request today understandably hear speed be urge across the house that this should happen quick to get the payment make totally understand that and to some extent agree with it however want to reassure the house that david foley who be now set up and think head up the infected blood compensation authority as an arm length body of government be superbly experienced civil servant neither nor the minister could have write the cheque ourselves to set up the process and system for evaluate entitlement and get money out as quickly as possible for those infect individual who be alive around speed be obviously an imperative the reason take the decision on the second interim payment alongside the from october be that receive advice and press and challenge my official to get to number that be the maximum that everyone would receive however it be of course wholly necessary not just to get first tranche fully pay out but to get everyone else pay out acknowledge that there be question about how to verify the date of infection but despite all the bad thing that have happen obviously we must reconcile speed and effective decision make with ensure that we pay the people who be entitle to the payment in sir brian langstaff seven volume report of which go to see the publication on monday may he make number of recommendation and the minister have indicate the government willingness to honour those the national memorial and biannual meeting with those who have suffer in order to get to grip with the duty of candour want we as house to be clear and honest about what we be really ask for because the report span decade and different generation of ministers civil servant and orthodoxy in the medical profession we need to encourage curiosity among individual who see thing go wrong but be hold back from be truly candid because there tend to be group think which prevent thorough interrogation of what should be do distortion happen recollection have varied and medical professional would make different judgment now from those they would have make at different point in the past we need to be wise about what the duty of candour will look like but we need to grasp the core argument that brian langstaff make we have to change the culture across government and public service and in politic hope the minister do not move on but if he do hope he move up if he stay in his position however he can have an impact over time when minister move they have receive wisdom from their official of previous iteration and we sometimes need to encourage the infusion of new ministers to ask challenge question and allow progress to be make have profound concern about public inquiry lot have be say in recent month about the multiple public inquiry that have occur how we can make they more systematic and align the secretariat and the process they run can obviously be streamline they be present as the only cathartic method for the british state to come to term with something that have go wrong and they be often not constrain in any way they be typically lead by retire high court judge and have nothing against they but we sometimes need to broaden the expertise such as by have economist and other people involve in look at these thing pay tribute to brian langstaff because the inquiry be massive undertaking but seven year be an enormous amount of time be not an expert on this but let we think about the read across to the covid inquiry many people have expectation of what that will deliver but in other country such analysis have bring forward recommendation and change much more quickly we have to get the balance right not to cover up anything but because we end up put thing into the long grass for so long we as parliament need to come to term with that have probably speak for too long but hope can be forgive for do so give the role have want to pay tribute to the work that have be do by those responsible for bring we to this point pay tribute to all the victim and campaigner who have be so determined despite numerous knock back from government over the year my own government absolutely have to take their full share of the blame interim arrangement be make and ad hoc compensation scheme be set up but responsibility be not take by the british state and it be absolutely right that we have do so now do not think that social medium be very helpful in try to come to term with the trauma of all this or in give clarity to those who need it wish david foley and the ibca well think there will be series of letter about how to interpret individual recommendation but he be set up an efficient mechanism which once it start deliver will deliver more and more rapidly be convince of that for some it can not come soon enough but hope that very soon we can draw the right endure lesson from this national scandal and hope it will never happen again pay tribute to my hon friend the member for gedling michael payne for his maiden speech it be clearly special for he to represent the area in which he grow up he have so much personal experience and memory and he speak passionately about his family be sure they be very proud of he today and that he will be an excellent representative for gedling remember his labour predecessor well we be both elect on the same day and perhaps can challenge my hon friend little and say that he have big boot to fill as his predecessor be an excellent member of parliament it be worth remind ourselves of how we get to this stage in spite of everything we have hear about the excellent progress be make in response to sir brian langstaff report there be still an enormous amount of frustration out there among victim and their family in the and as many as people with haemophilia and other bleed disorder be treat with factor concentrate contaminate with hiv and hepatitis viruse almost all of they be infect with hepatitis and around people include child be also infect with hiv some of those unintentionally infect their partner or other family member more than three quarter of those infect with hiv have since die as have around one third of those infect with hepatitis of those still alive many be in poor health due to liver damage or from live with long term hiv additionally around people be give blood transfusion that be infect with hepatitis all that be avoidable by the blood and blood product be already know to transfer virus it be know that the use of pool blood product significantly increase the risk of infection those risk be ignore by lead clinician ministers and civil servant and they fail to take appropriate action to end the use of those product and ensure the use of safe product pharmaceutical company and lead clinician do not share appropriate information about risk with patient and patient group they fail in their duty of candour it be no wonder that the victim of those crime mistrust the state the state that should be there for they to protect they and be on their side we be here because despite many die along the way and with one victim die every four day the survive victim refuse to give up they refuse to be defeat they win their battle and over and above that they win the right to be include in the decision as sir brian langstaff make clear in his report all along the victim have be lie to refuse access to information their record have mysteriously go missing and more recently they have find themselves repeatedly let down by the government it have to be say in the form of the cabinet office the cabinet office control the decision of the infected blood compensation authority hear what the paymaster general and minister for the cabinet office say to early about operational independence but ultimately the cabinet office be make the decision and victim be not include in the way that sir brian recommend victim feel that decision be be make without their involvement those suffer with hepatitis feel particularly exclude and do not feel that their suffering have be fully recognise in the compensation scheme in his interim report sir brian langstaff say that there should be an arm length body will not read the whole recommendation but he say recommend that an arms length body should be set up to administer the compensation scheme with guarantee independence of judgement chair by judge of high court or court of session status as sole decision maker the report go on to state that the body should involve potentially eligible person and their representative amongst those in small advisory panel and in the review and improvement of the scheme and permit the hearing of applicant in person none of that be part of the compensation process yet it be clearly there in the report and it be sir brian langstaff intention that the victim should be involve much more in term of listen to the victim there be an extensive consultation exercise during the general election campaign my predecessor set that up and it continue under the aegis of civil servant in that period afterwards recommendation be make have listen to the community about change the scheme the government accept the implementation of of those recommendation suggest to my hon friend that that show listen to the concern about the scheme original formation in respect of the infected blood compensation authority strongly recommend that he as chair of the appg meet sir robert francis and david foley he can speak to they about precisely the involvement of the infected blood community which be hugely important be fully aware of the consultation that take place but what sir brian langstaff describe be the ongoing involvement of the victim in the process by their be part of an advisory panel and continue to advise the compensation board know that david foley be at the conference at the weekend for the organisation that represent people with hepatitis that organisation be pleased with the discussion it have with he but none the less and in spite of that people who be at that conference have since make clear to that they feel frustrated and that ultimately the cabinet office be in control of the decision make process my right hon friend may take issue with that but he should take note of the fact that that belief be out there and we need to deal with it the hon gentleman be right to labour the point all that we be hear from the representative group those who make sure that they represent all those in the infected or affected community be that they want consultation with government they just want to be listen to and properly consult as all these regulation be design go forward the hon gentleman be absolutely right do not understand the minister sensitivity around all this he have to be aware be pretty certain that he be that there be this sensitivity when it come to the community could not agree more with the hon gentleman be try to make my right hon friend the paymaster general aware of the strength of feel out there that need to be address we will not satisfy people about the process unless we address those concern one thing drive that concern be that the current process be not what be describe in sir brian report and it be not what be expect at the time he publish his report the victim and their representative feel exclude on top of that they feel enfeeble because of the lack of resource for advice and advocacy there be furth to go if the victim be to have complete faith in the process there be frustration that the people they have be battle against have be put in charge of the reparation surely my right hon friend can see their concern the death rate be now one every three day and the increase in the rate be largely due to the fact that those with hepatitis have be suffer with long term chronic liver disease the red book for the budget set out that compensation will be pay over five year at that rate another people will die without get justice the treasury must not become another reason for justice for victim be delay will my right hon friend guarantee that that will not be the case be aware that sir brian langstaff have write to my right hon friend about the rule on sibling of year of age at the time the sibling pass away will he explain to the house or write to on this exactly where that ruling come from it do not seem to appear in any of the recommendation or in sir brian report have speak before about the offer to former pupil of treloar school which they consider derisory it be another example of what happen when victim be exclude from the process also draw my right hon friend attention to the report of the secondary legislation scrutiny committee which be an excoriate criticism of the cabinet office it expose what it describe as lack of clear and understandable information in the explanatory memorandum and lack of preparedness for deliver the compensation scheme the committee doubt that the cabinet office will be able to pay compensation by the end of the year be he confident that the committee be wrong and that payment will be make by the end of the year lastly large amount of money be make by pharmaceutical company and other while victim be be exploit and in some case even be experiment on that do not come about because of mistake they be deliberate action which in many instance be criminal the british taxpayer must not pay the full cost alone those who make money from this appalling scandal should be require to make significant contribution in spite of what my right hon friend may consider negative speech welcome the progress that we have make but there be much furth to go to deliver the justice that sir brian langstaff set out in his report it be always difficult to follow somebody who have say almost exactly what have intend to say in my speech what will try to do for you madam deputy speaker be rephrase it in way that will hopefully be helpful and useful to the house be grateful to follow the hon member for eltham and chislehurst clive efford who raise number of really important issue about which those on the government front bench should listen carefully notice the paymaster general reaction to the hon member for eltham and chislehurst he have get to relax little we be try to help and to be the voice of the community who be tell we these thing they want to be engage and properly consult with they want to be part of the process that be what they be tell the all party parliamentary group on haemophilia and contaminate blood and that be what we be hear from all the representative group right across the united kingdom perhaps the paymaster general should just take on board some of the thing that we be try to put forward about the feeling and opinion of lot of the community and what they be say to we directly as consequence of what be happen congratulate the government on honour their commitment to have debate it be pity that we do not get the full day but one thing have notice be that it be get bit quieter in the chamber when we have these debate and statement hope that there will not be fatigue when it come to discuss important issue relate to the infected blood scandal as we as house will need detailed approach to the ongoing compensation scheme really hope that we will not get to stage where the government see this as job do and another box to be tick think there we go infect blood be deal with and we can now move on it be incumbent on all of we who be involve in the campaign to ensure that we continue to press the government ensure that we talk up on behalf of our constituent and those impact and affect really hope that we start to see some new labour members in particular take big interest we use to have really involve detailed debate where people turn up and play their part as be sure that many of they represent people who be impact and affect it would be good to see few of they turn up think it be it be good sign that there be few member of parliament in the chamber because it show that there have be meaningful progress do not see tetchiness from the minister what see be somebody who have listen carefully to the representation of the community and act on they accept and acknowledge that there be outstanding matter but actually when infrastructure have be set up in some case for year to campaign it can be quite difficult to adjust to delivery mode there be no one in the house more experienced than the right hon gentleman pay tribute to what he do in government and how he bring this issue forward he be right we must be bit careful but all of we involve be just try to take the debate forward he be possibly right that there may be satisfaction that thing have move on and we be at different stage in the campaign but it be still important that we continue to ask question of government that be what we be all try to do in this debate will the hon gentleman give way will so long as the hon member do not poke in the back as he do the other evening my constituent have mention an outstanding issue that must be address current proposal only include sibling who be under the age and live in the same household as an infected person for at least two year after the onset of the infection the requirement for sibling to have live in the same house should be remove do the hon gentleman agree that the loss and suffering of sibling who do not live in the same household for two year be no less than that of sibling who do do and be happy that my speech have provide the hon gentleman with another opportunity to make one of his intervention as he do in practically every debate that he attend he make good point which the house have now hear want to reinforce the point about ibca arm length process the hon member for eltham and chislehurst be right that it be abundantly clear in both the interim and the full report that there be general expectation that ibca will be truly at arm length divorced and separate from the government we can not get into the head of sir brian langstaff when he design the scheme but think that he expect there to be proper arm length body that would be responsible to parliament not government what we have be the other way around and that will probably be okay but for extra security those of we who be interested would like to make sure that it be properly independent accord to sir brian langstaff original intention as long as there be sense that this be government influence body there will be continue suspicion from community that have be let down so badly for decade by decision maker and government that this be the same old approach that we have see in the past ask the minister to find way to ensure that we get that proper judge lead arm length body that be responsible to we as the representative of the people of the united kingdom and not just exclusively to government have no issue with all the tribute that people have make to david foley and all the other people involve because they have be fantastic but we be already begin to see cabinet office base appointment come through for ibca again we be not really see consultation with those at the sharp end of all this we need some more of that sir brian langstaff say that two expert panel one represent the legal part of the issue and the other the health part would work almost simultaneously and in concert with each other to feed back to the chair of the board it would be good to see that start to emerge he also say not as clearly but it be intend that an expert panel would comprise those represent the community both the infected and the affected they would have similar role to feed into the chair of ibca hope that some of that will happen there be widespread support for what this government have do and billion be significant sum that everyone be confident will go most of the way towards meet the compensation expectation but there be issue member have touch on some of they will rattle through they do not want to detain the house and have raise they before but just want to make sure that we do touch on they the hon member for eltham and chislehurst be absolutely right that the for those catch up in unethical research be far too low this be come back to all of we again so really hope we be able to revisit that then there be those who be treat with interferon as matter of course they have not be properly and fully include in the compensation scheme so again hope the government be able to look at that there be concern that hepatitis payment banding do not match and reflect the suffering cause that be what have be hear from constituent involve in the campaign so hope the government will be able to look at that there be the issue about bereaved parent and child who will receive very low compensation payment if they be not the beneficiary of the estate of bereaved family member think that could be address no compensation have be pay to sibling for their loss and suffering if they be over compensation for lack of earning should consider future career progression that be prevent from occur rather than simply exist career that be cut short lastly on my list which be not long but be substantial be the fact that the need for date of infection be cause great deal of anxiety and confusion among the community believe that most of those issue could be properly address with the full involvement of community representative if they have full and open access to government ministers and be able to play their part in design any future scheme the community should be involve to provide valuable information and advice on the most pressing issue that need to be address one issue that want to turn to in the bulk of my remark be the part of sir brian langstaff report that have probably receive the least attention thus far the why of all this why do this happen why be we mislead for such long time we have have useful discussion about compensation and it be great to see that progress but unless we explore and examine the reason why it happen we will not learn all that much as we go forward the duty of candour bill which will come on to be useful positive and helpful development but unless we have proper examination of what go so badly wrong then be not entirely sure we will learn the full lesson of what happen over the past couple of decade the inquiry uncover shocking revelation about the government handling of the issue include failure to provide full information to those affect by contaminate blood and the delay in acknowledge the extent of the problem sir brian inquiry find that both ministers and civil servant adopt line to take or strategy to avoid provide full and candid response to the crisis that lack of openness contribute to the suffering of those impact leave many victim and their family feel unheard and ignore for decade those of we in the house in the noughtie who be raise these concern and issue on behalf of constituent who present in our surgery remember be dismiss by nothing to see here letter from successive health ministers would not say we be fob off exactly but we be certainly tell that there be nothing we should really be concern about with all the serious issue that be raise there be real sense that none of it be be take seriously sir brian langstaff recommend that ministers and senior civil servant should be legally require to provide candour and completeness in their response to public concern that bring we to the duty of candour bill promise by the government think all of we involve in this campaign be delighted to see it feature in the king speech we look forward to the government introduce it most of the bill be predicate on the response to hillsborough key lesson have be take from the infected blood scandal and from other scandal such as the horizon post office scandal all of we who have be involve in these campaign will look forward to our opportunity to debate and design the bill statutory duty of candour for all public servant include civil servant and ministers would hold public official accountable for their action and require they to be transparent in their dealing with the public such law would compel civil servant and ministers to act with integrity and fully disclose all relevant information even when it might be uncomfortable or damaging to the government reputation in the course of the langstaff inquiry andy burnham point out that during the tainted blood scandal and even early in various material the government have frequently employ the phrase no wrongful practice be employ in our debate on this issue often refer to andy burnham evidence to the inquiry because it be particularly compelling and very helpful probably receive more letter from he when he be health secretary than do from any other health secretary he talk about the letter that he use to send to member of parliament and express his concern about the inaccurate line provide by departmental official he believe that those line perpetuate false narrative that fail to address the need of those whose life have be so devastatingly affect he emphasise that the government response to the infected blood issue be drive primarily by fear of financial exposure and he believe that explain the comprehensive failure to address the concern of the victim over five decade have call for further investigation or inquiry into why this be allow to happen in major department of state give that it clearly lead to many of the difficulty that we be now address through various compensation scheme much of the debate have touch on the langstaff inquiry but separate look at what go wrong would be useful and cathartic for the government and would help they to shape their duty of candour bill be not here to criticise they although it sometimes sound as though be think that they have make good start with all this and we be all grateful for the billion for the compensation scheme become involved with this issue when couple of my constituent be catch up in it remember those early day when we do not know what be go on and the letter from the department of health make the situation all the more confusing over the decade have come to know member of the community some have come down to the house of commons tell their story and ask we to question ministers pay tribute to haemophilia scotland and the scottish infected blood forum which have make excellent representation on their behalf the fact that we be discuss the issue now and have be able to see clear way forward be largely due to the case that they put and the fact that they be able to confront member of parliament the government and ministers and we should give they due credit for what they have do to bring we here today want to record my thank to my right hon friend the member for kingston upon hull north and cottingham dame diana johnson and the right hon member for salisbury john glen for their tireless effort in seek justice for the victim of the infected blood scandal the issue have have an impact on countless family and welcome the government ongoing work to address it with the seriousness that it deserve today want to share the story of jean anziani the mother of one of my constituent jean be nurse who come home with cut on her hand after patient struggle during blood draw cause the glass syringe to break within just over week her health have decline so rapidly that she be rush to hospital where her child year old kenneth and year old christine have to wear full protective gear just to visit she by then jean be unable to recognise her child only day after receive that cut she pass away at the age of just christine share that story with it be truly heartbreaking and bring tear to my eye jean have contract hepatitis the current support scheme focus only on those diagnose with hepatitis or hiv leave victim like jean without the acknowledgment or the compensation that they deserve the scheme be originally design to address the most commonly identify infection but they have unintentionally exclude people infect with hepatitis as result jean daughter christine be unable to receive any compensation or recognition for her loss would be extremely grateful if the paymaster general could look into this matter for and have further discussion this truly have be one of our nation bad ever scandal and injustice thousand of patient contract hiv or hepatitis virus or both from contaminate blood and this be not an accident or something that could not be avoid nor be it down to pure negligence or people not be sufficiently attentive although there be plenty of that the report be clear about the systematic collective and individual failure in identify and manage infection risk from blood product and in the response of the health service and the government this issue affect the constituent of very many mp but it have particularly tragic depth of salience in my constituency east hampshire be home to treloar non maintain special school and college that deliver outstanding education nurture and care to child with some of the most profound disability however it be also the place where there be terrible concentration of victim of this scandal because to haemophiliac patient be there at any one time it come to be see as unique opportunity to study the disease and haemophilia centre be establish at the nearby hospital in towards the end of the the hospital still cater to the need of the wide community but the haemophilia centre be relocate to the school ground the inquiry report dedicate an entire chapter to the experience of pupil at treloar and to how research objective often outweigh the good interest of the child the inquiry hear that of the pupil with haemophilia who attend the school between and only around remain alive have speak to number of my infected or affected constituent over the year include adrian ade goodyear man who speak with remarkable dignity and determination will quote briefly from his most recent message to the camaraderie and unity of we former pupil well the handful of we that be leave we have stick together to get to the truth due to the promise and pact we make towards our lose when they be live as well as for their family we have be wait very long time for the truth about string of failure omission and wrongdoing start with the failure to achieve domestic self sufficiency and the decision to allow the importation of high risk factor viii concentrate which in many case be procure via commercial arrangement that make infection more likely because the product come from high risk group include prisoner and drug user we be complacent about the risk of hepatitis and slow to respond to the risk of aids and we permit research to be conduct on people without tell they or in the case of child their parent or inform they of the risk in some case we fail to tell people that they be infect thus close down the possibility of their manage the progression of their disease or its transmission to other in other case people be tell starkly and insensitively about diagnosis of hiv there be defensiveness lack of candour the active destruction of evidence and of course the absence of meaningful apology or redress for so many year in his statement on may my right hon friend the member for salisbury john glen rightly accept sir brian langstaff recommend five category of pay award and confirm additional interim compensation payment there now need to be clarity about the basis on which claim can be assess and the speed of those payment campaigner have raise concern about the information source available and hope that the minister can provide assurance that step will be take to ensure that there be easily accessible information to support people make compensation claim have be ask by former pupil at treloar to ask about the compensation amount of and which have be mention by the hon member for eltham and chislehurst clive efford it would be helpful to have on the record and in hansard an explanation of those sum of money we have talk about memorialisation and the national memorial the inquiry also recommend that there be memorial dedicate specifically to the child at treloar and that it be provide at public expense hope that the minister can provide an update on that either in his closing remark or in follow up correspondence hope that one of the positive that can come from this generation will be the instituting and institutionalise of duty of candour in both letter and spirit the report recommend review of the exist statutory duty of candour which require nhs organisation to be open and transparent about mistake and harm in care and require leader in health service organisation to be personally accountable for respond to concern about safety think we all welcome the bill appear in the king speech for this generation we need to make the duty of candour an establish principle across the whole of public service which be something in which we be all involve in our different way as parliamentarian and member of the government nothing can ever make up for all these failing but we can at least ensure that the compensation scheme work as well as it can and that we as state face up to our failing and truly learn the lesson so that we can have confidence when we say never will this happen again we must always remember that at the heart of any public scandal there be people so many of my hon friend this afternoon have tell tragic story but also story of courage and humility alongside other brave courageous victim and their family becca jess and their sibling have campaign for justice for people infect and affect in love memory of their father joe like they welcome the decisiveness and commitment from this government with family like they in mind would like to ask the minister to outline when he expect the second set of regulation to be lay before parliament how victim and their family can continue to be involve and inform of progress and how claim can be make call the shadow minister should probably start by pay tribute to my predecessor in this role my right hon friend the member for salisbury john glen who have also be paymaster general he have do so much on this issue and will touch on his comment bit later also thank my hon friend the member for kingswinford and south staffordshire mike wood for open for the opposition today will just mention to the paymaster general and other ministers in the department that they obviously continue to have our broad support we should never stop acknowledge the size and scale of this issue which be almost unimaginable to member from across the house my hon friend the member for kingswinford and south staffordshire say that we need to see justice and that be what all the victim would like thank all member who have speak in this debate and agree that what happen to the victim of the infected blood scandal be profoundly wrong and should never be repeat the establishment of the inquiry in be the right first step towards do what we can to repair the damage inasmuch as that can ever be possible be pleased that the work start by the previous government to adopt the recommendation put forward by the inquiry be be continue by this government must point out though how important it be for the government to stay on schedule and start deliver payment through the infected blood compensation authority by the end of the year as the paymaster general outline we will ensure that that happen it be incumbent on we all in this house to do our part to restore trust in our state because that have be damage as well as thousand of life ensure that those payment go out as be committed to be an important part of that more broadly will reflect on the challenge ahead before do that will touch on couple of remark make by member in this debate the hon member for gedling michael payne make his maiden speech and he speak kindly of his predecessor who be good friend of mine he probably do not remember but campaign against he back in when my right hon friend the member for newark robert jenrick be young by election candidate today the hon gentleman speak very strongly of his personal story he clearly have the clarity and volume of town crier so even if we do not always agree with he we will certainly hear he from this side of the chamber welcome he to his place the hon member for blyth and ashington ian lavery the hon member for eltham and chislehurst clive efford who speak for the appg and the hon member for perth and kinross shire pete wishart talk about different aspect of this subject but they each mention the child who be use for research be sure that the minister will want to reflect on that in his closing comment all three hon gentleman touch on the patient voice one recommendation be that the patient voice should be improve with the routine collection of patient satisfaction datum and with funding for patient advocacy group and charity perhaps that be one way that patient and those affect could continue to be involve my right hon friend the member for east hampshire damian hinds mention the obvious impact of the case in his constituency as well as the need for memorial to those affect hope the minister will touch on that too my right hon friend the member for salisbury touch on broad issue not just for the cabinet office but for ministers in all departments it be important that we encourage curiosity rather than group think we all have duty of candour and think of those who work for we it can sometimes be difficult in political environment the minister should also reflect on my right hon friend point about public inquiry it be obviously important to get to the truth but the cabinet office might want to reflect on the speed at which we do that as well as on who can achieve it and how we have hear about the need for strong medical screening protocol and safety measure to ensure that such scandal can never happen again it be also important to acknowledge the need to continue interrogate our risk assessment and mitigation measure more broadly across our health service and the government while settle into my new role as shadow paymaster general look forward to work with the government to see what assistance can offer as well as fulfil the opposition job of hold they to account will do so in the same spirit show by labour members on this issue will hold the government to account to ensure that we do all we can across all area of government to implement the strong possible risk assessment mitigation and response procedure it be important to have consider communication with affected group too the inquiry acknowledge that there be failure within the nhs to properly implement informed consent and to ensure that patient at all stage of the healthcare system understand how their personal care relate to the large risk while appreciate the good work be do to make progress on this issue we must not take our eye off the ball on any aspect of the government work be sure that there be still work to be do in the department of health and social care in the cabinet office and across government to ensure that inform consent and patient communication be work properly at all time and to ensure that government framework in our health and care system be be properly and continually evaluate so that the need for holistic informed consent do not fall victim to complex and often disjoint system that require not only work on the health and care front but on broad governance framework and improve cross government collaboration that speak to the core issue raise today with which agree the government must continue to ensure that global standard for blood safety be meet and regularly update as hon member have mention look forward to work in opposition alongside hon friend in other shadow role and undertake cross party work to ensure that the regulation around the sourcing of blood product and virus detection be strengthen as with the other measure mention want to ensure that that be do robustly and ahead of time and not as reactive measure as have sadly be the case in the past one of the most difficult element of such an inquiry process be to acknowledge that too often we make the change that be need to prevent problem only when the consequence of that problem have reach intolerable level we need to resist box the issue raise today into direct consequence for our health and care practice when much more fundamental interrogation of our governance and practice framework be need as my right hon friend the member for salisbury note as numerous speaker have say the inquiry shed clear light on the continuous failure on the part of institution to properly address the issue as it come up in far too many case infected patient be distrust disbelieve and at point treat with outright disrespect although it be important to acknowledge the significant change that have happen across our health system to tackle that we should never become complacent we must remain vigilant about the need for medical staff in the nhs to approach patient with trust dignity and empathy we must ensure that our communication framework and staff training properly reflect those issue the inquiry make it clear that the victim of the scandal be victim not only of institution but of widespread stigmatisation and prejudice whatever our party affiliation we can all agree that we should continue to progress the good work that have happen since that time and to support the fantastic organisation that continue to take on that important activism put on record my thank to the brave victim of this scandal and their family they have step forward bravely and steadfastly to fight for their dignity against the wrong commit upon they and for proper recognition thank the former right hon member for maidenhead for introduce the inquiry back in also thank the inquiry leader for the essential work they conduct without which we would have make much less progress at an even slow pace no amount of compensation will ever make up for the wrong commit and the tragedy suffer of course many who have be affect be no long around to see the small benefit of compensation offer small amount of hope to those affect be confident that hon member in this house from all party have hear they and trust they we know the suffering that have be bring upon they they have fight valiantly and relentlessly and hope that they can take some comfort from know that their fight lead to the recognition of the scale of the scandal and to the action that government of both colour have take to ensure such scandal never happen again hope history will show that further such suffering be avoid because the victim of this scandal expose the wrong of the past in closing once again express my deep regret for the continuous failure of government over the year on this issue express my support for the cause of those who continue to fight assure the infected and affect who be still fight and member of this house that and my colleague on the conservative benches will do all we can to continue our cross party work which we know still have to be do in the relatively non political spirit of this debate ask the minister as he continue to work with opposition members to address the outstanding issue for the victim and their family to be open about make adaptation and change to address those issue and to ensure that in the process of undertake compensation we do not end up alienate segment of those involve and ignore the suffering of those who have be affect thank hon member who have speak today the victim and their family and all those who have play their part by do what they can to ensure that something like this never happen again stand here as the minister for public health and prevention humble and with large degree of humility the department of health and social care be rightly hat and despise by the infected blood community we let they down for that be personally sorry and my department collectively be sorry say that in heartfelt way because for the past decade and half both as shadow public health minister and as back bencher have raise the issue of the infected blood scandal on behalf of the campaign and of my constituent who be infect and affect now that stand here as minister in the department responsible feel it be incumbent on to give that heartfelt apology it be too late come for so many but hope that those who be still here and their family and love one will accept it in the spirit in which give it be sorry we let you down and we must make sure it never ever happen again welcome the two new opposition spokespeople the right hon member for basildon and billericay mr holden and the hon member for kingswinford and south staffordshire mike wood want to start in the way the right hon member for basildon and billericay finish by assure he that the government will work collectively and constructively with member from across the house from whichever party they come and whichever part of the united kingdom they represent this be an issue that have stain the body politic of our country for too long and it be incumbent on we to work together across party and across artificial division to make sure that we get the good deal for our constituent and their family also thank all right hon and hon member who have contribute to the debate thank my hon friend the member for blyth and ashington ian lavery and my hon friend the member for gedling

scene as well as at the dispatch box the hon member for perth and kinross shire pete wishart have similarly be tireless campaigner as have the right hon member for east hampshire damian hinds the infected blood scandal be one of the most appalling in our nation history it be an institutional failure of the high order span decade from the national health service to the civil service to ministers across successive government at every level those the public trust to protect they fall short in way that be both tragic and catastrophic they let down victim their family and our country in the course of this debate we have hear the name sean gary thomas jean ade and joe they remind we of the real people those who be deceased those who be infect and those who be affect they be real people not statistic and it be important that we never forget that victim be deny the truth many pass away before they see justice the state work to protect itself and those people pay the price must echo the tribute that have be make to sir brian langstaff and his team by member from across the house their steadfast pursuit of the truth finally bring this decade long scandal to light sir brian and his team have set we on path towards begin to right the terrible wrong that be commit they uncover litany of collective and personal failure as many hon member have highlight by share story from their community and constituency each one be significant in its own right and together they add up to complete disaster sir brian find that this national scandal could have be prevent it be already know that these treatment be contaminate yet the warning be disregarded time and again people in position of power and responsibility have multiple opportunity to halt the transmission of these infection but on each occasion they choose not to act many in this house have campaign for justice for long time give voice to those who have be repeatedly silence in particular wish to pay tribute to my right hon friend the minister for policing fire and crime prevention and the secretary of state for wales thank my hon friend the members for gower tonia antoniazzi for hornsey and friern barnet catherine west and for newport east jessica morden and the hon member for thirsk and malton kevin hollinrake also thank the former member for worthe west peter bottomley and the now mayor of manchester andy burnham in this debate today we have again hear from my hon friend the members for eltham and chislehurst and for blyth and ashington the hon member for perth and kinross shire and the former paymaster general the right hon member for salisbury as government we will do our utmost not to repeat the mistake of the past we be elect on manifesto that commit to act on the inquiry finding and to put right historical injustice the public rightly expect nothing less of this government than fulfil our moral obligation to compensate victim and we aim to do so without delay in october the previous government spend million on initial interim payment of to the living infect follow the publication of the inquiry final report in may furth million be pay as second interim payment of to all uk register living infect victim the government have also commit in legislation to pay to the estate of the deceased infect to recognise those who have not yet receive payment and to ensure that some of those affected such as parent child and sibling be support that scheme open on october we recognise that money can never make up for the heartbreak that victim and their family have experience and much of the inquiry criticism apply to the way that my department the department of health and social care and its predecessor operate my constituent brendan lose his left leg while serve with the british army in decade later he discover that he have be infect with hepatitis during the operation that save his life know have talk to brendan that while he be pleased that the government have commit to provide compensation he be keen for we all to understand that because of his community live experience there be an inherent distrust of the state his instinct on be tell that the state will spit out number be understandably not to trust the process will the minister reassure brendan that all compensation offer will include detailed breakdown of the datum and rate use to make the calculation can give my hon friend and brendan the commitment that we will do just that to reassure those who rightly have lose all trust in public authority and particularly in my department because of the dreadful action that lead to their infection she have my assurance that we will do what we can to reassure brendan and many other like he who rightly have no trust leave in we that we will rebuild that trust be sorry not to have be here for the opening speech do the minister recognise the fundamental similarity between the way in which the victim of this scandal and those of the post office scandal and no doubt other terrible scandal be treat by the state do the government have any plan possibly on cross departmental basis to try to educate the bureaucracy that when terribly difficult and potentially expensive thing like this crop up they should not follow this well wear path of denial and cover up the right hon gentleman raise an important point indeed it be acknowledge by my right hon friend the paymaster general and minister for the cabinet office in his opening speech that this be just one of number of scandal that follow similar pattern when the scandal have be uncover rather than try to protect the victim the state have try to protect itself it be absolutely crucial that the state learn not just from each individual scandal but collectively that it be the same mindset that have lead we to all these different scandal with similar outcome for victim that level of learning have to be genuinely across government and know my right hon friend will lead on that in the cabinet office the government will set out our formal response before the end of the year but give that there be absolutely no time to waste want to take this opportunity to update the house on the work already under way to address some of the inquiry recommendation to prevent future harm the department continue to explore option to enhance candour and openness across the national health service to empower patient voice the nhs be review clinical audits relate to haemophilia service to identify any gap in patient involvement alongside work on new clinical service specification which will set standard for service across england to protect haemophiliac the nhs have convene an expert group to hear advice from the specialised blood disorder clinical reference group dedicated taskforce have be set up to consider its recommendation the general medical council be work with nhs england and other to look at way to ensure that lesson learn be reflect in training for doctor nurse and other healthcare professional let be clear to the house the government do not see this scandal in isolation sadly repeat patient safety failing have erode public confidence in our health and social care system so we be take step to fix the culture of the national health service my right hon friend the secretary of state for health and social care have be clear that we will not tolerate nhs manager who silence whistleblower openness and honesty be vital to ensure patient safety nhs staff must have the confidence to speak out and come forward if they have concern there will be no more turn blind eye to failure our wide reform to nhs performance will provide great transparency for the public who pay for it measure will ensure that top talent be attract to the most challenge area and persistently fail manager will be sack that be about ensure that the right people be in post to lead our nhs with the resource they need to do their job if we get that right we will be able to look back on this moment as turning point for patient safety and for leadership apologise madam deputy speaker be in committee at the start of the debate but do have my name down to speak some of my constituent be impact by the scandal and it have take they this long to summon the courage to come forward obviously represent they and northern ireland we have talk about the hillsborough law and the need for duty of candour do the minister agree that it be important that that be roll out not just in england and wales but right across the uk so that as he say those family be never again impact in that way hope that can reassure the hon lady that although health be devolve across the four nation and can speak only on behalf of the nhs in england on number of the recommendation both the department of health and social care and the cabinet office be work closely and collaboratively with ministers in the devolved administration indeed and my right hon friend the paymaster general recently have meeting with ministers from scotland northern ireland and wales to talk about how to take forward the recommendation on four nation basis where possible and with mutual support across the four nation where there be individual recommendation pertinent to the devolved part of the united kingdom hope that that reassure she that we be work together although can not comment on the change that will be need for health service in northern ireland which be matter for the minister of health in northern ireland mike nesbitt be quite certain that those service will carefully and closely consider our work here in england and the work in other part of the united kingdom we have wait too long for these action people have wait too long for compensation indeed right hon and hon member have wait too long for this debate more than people die before they see justice family and our country be let down there be level of suffering that be so difficult to comprehend because question be not ask at the time institution do not face up to the failing and fact be cover up now we know the truth as we reflect we be make concerted effort to improve because that loss need not be in vain will respond to some of the question raise throughout the debate and will refer to other question directly in the relevant part of my contribution should miss anything because of time constraint will write to member in opening for the official opposition the hon member for kingswinford and south staffordshire talk about destigmatisation of hiv and hepatitis hope that he understand that the labour party make clear manifesto commitment to end hiv transmission in england by official at the department of health and social care the uk health security agency nhs england and broad range of system partner be now work together to develop new hiv action plan which we aim to publish by summer next year and destigmatisation will be key part of that plan my hon friend the member for blyth and ashington ask about psychological support for family and friend reassure he that nhs england have establish the infected blood psychological support service in england which support its first patient in late august that include support not just the infected but the family and friend affect want to turn to departmental failing the report outline comprehensive condemnation of the organisation of blood service licensing decision blood safety and patient safety with harm compound by the reaction and handling of government again recognise humbly the criticism of the department that stand at this dispatch box to represent and its predecessor and be committed to ensure that tragedy such as the infected blood scandal can never happen again this government will prioritise patient safety to ensure that the nhs treat people with the high quality safe care they deserve repeat inquiry and investigation have highlight significant issue with patient safety which have cause deterioration in public confidence as we hear from my hon friend the member for aldershot alex baker in an early intervention we must absolutely fix that the health secretary have be clear that we will not tolerate nhs manager who silence whistleblower culture of openness and honesty be vital to ensure patient safety we want nhs staff to have the confidence to speak out and we will give they that the hon member for eastleigh liz jarvis raise the question of the safety of blood product while no medical treatment can be completely risk free current safety standard for blood donation and transfusion be rigorous and england blood supply be one of the safe in the world process be in place throughout the blood donation journey to ensure the safety of blood and blood product include the donation safety check form test for specific infection donor deferral regulation and inform consent accord to serious hazards of transfusion the risk of serious harm because of blood transfusion in the united kingdom be low at one in blood component issue turn to timeline so far more than billion have be pay in interim compensation payment to victim of the infected blood scandal as we hear early application open on october for interim payment of to the estate of deceased people whose death have not be recognise parliament have now approve regulation that give the infected blood compensation authority the power necessary to pay compensation through the core route to the infected both live and deceased the infected blood compensation authority have begin to process its first claimant under the infected blood compensation scheme in my intervention on the hon member for perth and kinross shire pete wishart ask about the sibling who qualify one sibling seem to be worth more than another sibling and that seem absolutely wrong understand that there have be no reply to that in the minister sum up maybe he be come on to it if he be apologise but would love to have response because my constituent have ask to ask that question and ensure that we have response can assure the hon gentleman that the minister for the cabinet office be carefully consider this matter if the hon gentleman would like the minister for the cabinet office will write to he but he be consider it we expect the infected blood compensation authority to begin make payment to people who be infect under the infected blood compensation scheme by the end of this year payment to the affected be expect to begin in follow second set of regulation turn to question raise by the hon member for perth and kinross shire about the independence of ibca it be rightly operationally independent parliament would clearly expect the government to have oversight of scheme of this size and for there to be proper management give the amount of public money go into the scheme it be true that there be only two non departmental public body that be independent of the government one be ibca and the other be the national audit office it be absolutely right for ibca to have that report november vol correction on that point the national audit office be directly accountable to parliament through the public accounts commission be the intention to create similar sort of arrangement as envisage by sir brian langstaff in which there be direct accountability to parliament rather than to the department should clarify for my hon friend that ibca be operationally independent that be important but it be absolutely right that member of this house be able to scrutinise its operation its working and indeed its use of public money we be talk about great deal of public money and ibca have to be democratically accountable to this house albeit operationally independent of government ministers in its day to day business this be really important point both myself and the hon member for eltham and chislehurst clive efford have now raise it with the minister he have rightly identify the experience of so many people catch up in this crisis and the fact that they do not trust the government or government institution would it not be more of comfort to they to know that ibca be like the national audit office accountable to parliament rather than to government agree with the hon gentleman which be why ibca be operationally independent that be the crucial thing here it do not have the fingerprint of ministers all over it because that be where the distrust come from it operate independently but as public body it be accountable to this house for how it spend that money and how it operate as an organisation while ibca be operationally independent to ensure separation between executive ministers and the functioning of that body it be accountable to this house think that be absolutely the right balance endorse what the minister have say about the way in which ibca have be set up it seem to an entirely sensible arrangement that respect the need to have some distance from government but clearly there can not be bespoke arrangement for every single entity that be set up this be the point be try to make respectfully about sir brian langstaff early he do brilliant job but some aspect of this issue will need slightly different judgment make by ministers welcome the decision that the minister and his colleague have make thank the right hon gentleman for that intervention hope that member across the house can see why we have set ibca up in the way we have it be for precisely that reason we have to have that operational separation from ministers and the executive but there also have to be political oversight from all quarter of this chamber because this be public body spend public money and great deal of public money at that as have say we be aim for the second set of regulation to be in place by march that will support our intention that payment to the affected begin next year there be important detail especially in relation to sir robert francis recommendation the majority of which the government have accept that must be work through ahead of the second set of regulation this include detail such as the eligibility criterion for people who be affect and how the government should define the parameter of the definition of unethical testing turn to payment the selection of those who have be contact for first payment be decision for the infected blood compensation authority the first group of people who be receive invite to claim be first those who be know to be already eligible for compensation secondly those register with support scheme which mean we be likely to have much of the necessary information for these people already thirdly those from area across the uk and fourthly those who represent range of infection type and of severity within those infection let turn to some of the question raise about this area the hon member for eastleigh mention people die before compensation be award hope can reassure she that when person with an eligible infection have tragically die before receive compensation we will ensure that their personal representative can claim compensation on behalf of the deceased estate hope that clarify the point for she my hon friend the member for swindon north talk about the exclusion of victim with hepatitis from the compensation scheme people with chronic hepatitis and those who die in the acute period be eligible for compensation as be their loved one as affect suggest that my hon friend write to the minister for the cabinet office with his constituent detail so that we can look more closely

landscape thank my hon friend for raise that important point he have also be vocal in his support for british citizen who have be arbitrarily detain and on wide human right issue commend he for his work on that agenda the fcdo point about the toolkit be really important the difficult question that we have to ask ourselves be how have we reach the situation where one of our citizen be languish in

around the globe how much its work be appreciate and respect on the world stage we have many fine diplomat and public servant but have to say in all candour that it have be fail for many year in its handling of state hostage taking and arbitrary detention of british national abroad ryan cornelius include in the last parliament the foreign affairs committee publish significant report with number of recommendation not all of which be take up it criticise the fcdo for its unnecessarily defensive culture in this area which impede scrutiny harm victim and their family and undermine public trust the report find that previous government of all stripe have fail to learn the lesson from respond to such situation and have be slow or unwilling to call out guilty country our atlantic ally the united states and canada have learn those lesson and create official role to co ordinate the response to state hostage taking and arbitrary detention in order to get their people home which be of course priority for all of we indeed the creation of such role be one of the committee recommendation to the foreign office and the foreign secretary this time last year when the foreign secretary be the shadow foreign secretary he commit labour government to create special envoy for arbitrary detention and state hostage taking warmly welcome the minister of state to her role think can still call she new minister few month into the new government and know that she take these matter seriously ask she to reflect back to her colleague and the secretary of state that we should stick to that commitment let we follow in the footstep of canada and the united states and let we not be advise out of that promise by official as conclude return to the heart of the debate with one simple request to his highness sheikh mohammed as gesture of friendship for the continue prosperity of our country and for our mutual security hope that he will grant clemency to ryan cornelius the uae national day
