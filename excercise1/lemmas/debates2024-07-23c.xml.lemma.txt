have many excellent cafés in our area to anyone who be listen to my speech and think that this newbie mp be not do too bad job of sell the merit of her home town can thoroughly recommend the cake at sea lane café on goring beach the coffee at both coast café and finch in worthe town centre and the breakfast at the bluebird café in ferring among many other at this point should also confess that my extolling of the virtue of cake and all credit to the house staff for the incredible muffin in the parliamentary café be temper by the fact that be by profession medical doctor and as my child will testify be reasonably obsess with make sure that cake be part of healthy balance that allow we to enjoy all the different type of food to be fair my child would not necessarily recognise that description and might just say that their mum be bit of nag with carrot obsession and an aversion to play computer game for too long but such be the joy of parenthood when people ask what type of doctor be and definitely do not have the patience for phd the response that be public health consultant be often meet with slightly puzzled stare recalibration of what they have hear and the decision that be probably gp by another name however be delighted to join my hon friend the member for oldham east and saddleworth debbie abrahams to represent public health here in the house it be the reason choose to go into politic it be the art and science ofkeeping population well and help people to live healthy life appreciate that today debate primarily concern home affair and immigration so will talk about public health on the basis of the explicit principle that health be essential in all thing to ensure safety and security for all people as part of my public health training spend time with the health protection agency now part of public health england that training stand in particularly good stead during the pandemic when find myself with daily slot on bbc radio sussex talk about covid debunk myth and provide reassurance that our fantastic scientist and public health specialist be do everything possible to develop vaccination and to keep we safe the result of the covid inquiry publish last week reveal the clear conclusion that investment in preventive measure be always money well spend and that be sadly lack before the pandemic public health funding be cut by between and so there be some salient lesson to be learn quickly about prevention be well than cure my time in local government as public health consultant and subsequently as councillor and council leader teach that politics be often the frontline where we grapple with the issue that arise from inequality and inequity two indicator which tell we that the decision make by those of we in position of influence be not yet decision that be maximise the health and wellbeing of the people we represent the resource require to meet basic human need should be available to everyone regardless of where we live or which family we be bear into for people like in public health and politic there be wealth of datum and evidence as well as would contend basic common sense show that when resource be not allocate fairly to allow everyone basic human need to be meet we all suffer for it people do not thrive without clean water clean air access to green space and good food our physical body become far less resilient to illness when those be not available to we and the same be true of poor housing poor education and poor job the causal link between poor housing condition and poor health outcome be long establish with health outcome associate with poor housing cost the nhs an estimate billion every year we know that exposure to poor housing condition include damp cold mould and noise be strongly associate with poor health both physical and mental inequality in life expectancy be increase especially for woman in worthe west woman live in one of our poor area will live an average of year less than woman live in one of our wealthy area and for the population as whole the time spend in poor health be increase as sir michael marmot so saliently put it if health have stop improve it be sign that society have stop improve when people become physically and mentally ill potential be lose and before you know it your country do not have national health service it have an overwhelmed national sickness service be so proud and privileged to be part of the labour intake of for too long now our politic have be make people sick this be the start of journey that very much hope will lead to politics that help to keep people well for many generation to come reduce inequality and inequity will allow everyone to do well the politic of health be the narrative of our nation government who focus on the health and wellbeing of the people we serve be government who enable we to rise together to face the challenge of both today and tomorrow be grateful for this opportunity to make my maiden speech in this important debate be in awe of the maiden speech and all the other speech that have be make today and on previous day the standard and quality of both this intake and long serve members be inspiring be

barking be young and more diverse than the london and national average that be one of the thing that make it such vibrant place in which to live but it face challenge the unemployment rate in the constituency be bad than in any other london borough and average earning be much low than elsewhere shamefully of child in barking be live in poverty economic growth be critical for the whole country and for my constituent economic growth be what allow government to invest so that we can all benefit from public service school our nhs frontline service run by local authority and welfare system that value dignity for the individual economic growth mean additional investment in crucial work deliver by child service tackle youth crime and violence in our community but economic growth do more than just pay for decent public service it can deliver people good well pay job that secure roof over their head food on the table and hope for the future it be the only route out of poverty and indeed it be how my grandparent break away from the cycle of poverty that be why wholeheartedly welcome the government commitment to economic stability and growth outline in the king speech last week include plan for national wealth fund alongside new deal for work people also support the government commitment to address the housing crisis especially because it be one of the driver of poverty the average house price in barking have go up by over the last five year and rent have soar there be thousand of people in temporary accommodation and quarter of my constituent live in the under regulate private rent sector that be why the government plan to bring forward renter right bill to end section no fault eviction be so important for barking as be their commitment to speed up planning and infrastructure to get more home build the king speech be an agenda from government who be on the side of my constituent it be plan that give hope to people in this country who for too long have feel abandon hope for the future with deliverable plan to improve life be why enter politic and be sure why member on both side of the house enter politic it be why serve as council leader before come to

of africa to the heart of the midland leicester that city nurture school and shape it would be fair to say that no matter where be in the world there be corner of foreign field that be forever leicester the vibrancy the diversity and occasionally the complete rawness of the city be the backdrop of my upbringing remember very well as child those free small cold bottle of milk that use to get at school remember very well when it be steal from as well remember embark on my life journey with friend from all different creed colour religion and no religion and we make life for ourselves in this amazing country remember also moment of racism one that come to mind be with my late mother we be in park and be set upon by group of people who hurl abuse and foul thing include language and object in our direction but those incident be supersede by kindness love and understanding from the great people of this country as the young child by distance be often refer to by my family member as the mistake but my mother always refer to as miracle and ever since then begin to believe it my mother who do not get the opportunity of formal education in her lifetime ensure all her child make the most of what this country have to offer it be this mother who when suggest when grow bit old that want to study history at university look at as if be about to become history so like dutiful child do optometry at university and that bring to here have check the archive and it appear be only the second optometrist to have ever become an mp so hope can bring little of my professional skill to help the house to focus on what matter and not be myopic in our decision making with laser like reflection believe we can bring vision to matter before we and not make real spectacle of ourselves but the serious point be this with well usage of optometrist our gp service and our pharmaceutical colleague we can ease the burden on secondary care in our hospital we all need to work join up and together as we be on the topic of health at this juncture would like to pay tribute to my predecessor jon ashworth shadow health secretary for more than five year before latterly taking on the shadow paymaster role he have the honour before of represent the wonderful leicester south constituency in his maiden speech in he say it perfectly be privileged to represent constituency of huge diversity vibrancy and tolerance and while we must never be complacent our community generally live harmoniously together we be part of city renowne across the world for welcome incomer family have come from across the

son gary lineker be still on the bench we have the tigers for our rugby force and the foxes for the cricket whilst the rider be usually top of the court in basketball and in mark selby we have snooker world champion but on serious note we must invest in sport facility not only to continue this rich tradition but to give our youth opportunity to improve their physical and mental wellbeing and occupy their time in positive pursuit too many of my young constituent tell they have nothing to do and we must give they that opportunity young people also bear the brunt of the housing crisis and in leicester we face overcrowd and waiting list of over six year bad than some london borough we urgently need more affordable home leicester another miracle be where we find the remain of the last

regardless of what you may have read and hear about we to quote shakespeare my heart be ten time light than my look my city be united city we celebrate all religious festival christmas diwali vaisakhi even the caribbean carnival with equal vigour and have live in harmony for over half century however in recent year fracture have appear sow by those who wish to divide we often by weaponise language understand that our isle have finite resource but we must always have infinite empathy infinite sympathy and an infinite vocabulary to build bridge not to destroy they in the word of the great muslim sufi poet rumi we must raise our word not our voice it be rain that bring forth flower not thunder during my campaign be humble think know my city but really do not within my city there be an underbelly shadow city within city while use to speak about people who have conflict between eating and heating during my campaign meet they food bank at on tuesday morning have over people queue and be tell that be one of the quiet day they have ever have we must tackle the cost of live crisis and reduce the wealth inequality in our country it be not ethical or sustainable for any civilised nation to go on that way one poignant incident from my campaigning be when knock at house and lady peer through partially open door could not see her whole face but see enough to see life of sadness and tragedy she explain that she have have relatively successful life but something have happen work little bit of bullying and she go into depression cycle and never really recover she say to will vote for you if you can do one of two thing what do she ask she say if you could just plant tree so can see it that would make smile and if you could get fountain so can see some water trickle vote for you forever it be important to remember that it be the simple thing that people want and that make the big difference to their life they want someone to speak up for they in these corridor of power to speak about the injustice in the world to give voice to those who do not have one who have no might authority or power whether that be the forget in yemen the victim of conflict in sudan or the victim of the ongoing devastation in palestine regardless of where they be in the world will always endeavour to speak truth to power and demand that this new government take action for the poor and dispossess not just the powerful finally if my campaign ever have catchphrase it would be the chinese proverb that say the good time to plant tree be year ago in order to enjoy its beauty its shade and its fruit but the next good time be today we must plant that seed of unity equality and justice now to ensure that our future generation can enjoy the fruit of friendship fairness and peace

observe some of the difference between holyrood and here this institution be old and often more complex as indeed be many of its member and there be many procedure and protocol to learn but while there be difference between the parliaments the purpose we have be common one to serve our constituent we have hear over the past week how it be vital to have strong relationship between the uk government and the devolved administration that be of course true however believe that there be still too few opportunity for member of each of our uk parliaments to work together on many matter of share responsibility and interest hope that there can be great collaboration between all our parliamentarian in the course of the next five year on personal note may say that be proud that my wife claire baker continue to serve the people of mid scotland and fife in the scottish parliament with such skill and dedication be delighted that claire and our daughter catherine could be in the gallery

for the people of glenrothes and mid fife the constituency stretch across fife from methil buckhaven and the wemyss village on the coast to ancient markinch and the new town of glenrothes and from kinglassie and cardenden and the village of benarty to lochgelly and kelty those and other community in the constituency have their own history and priority but so many be link by their proud connection to the mining industry that be why the decision by this government to end the injustice of the miner pension scheme so that fund in the scheme be keep for its beneficiary will be so important for so many of my constituent the community of my constituency can look back on proud industrial heritage but it be vital that they can also look forward to their future as hub for innovation technology and our grow renewable sector the biomass plant at markinch the hydrogen for domestic energy pilot at buckhaven and the fife energy park at methil be all example of how our constituency can benefit from the exciting plan for gb energy and our goal for scotland to play lead role in make britain green energy powerhouse we have to seize this opportunity buckhaven and methil have the high number of deprive community in fife which be why we have to realise the ambition for the area and increase employment through expansion in renewable it be vital that uk ministers work collaboratively with management union the scottish government and fife council to ensure that despite the financial difficulty of harland wolff which operate the fabrication yard at methil the skilled job and apprenticeship at the yard be secure along with its infrastructure and facility that skilled workforce and the facility at the yard will be instrumental in realise fife ambition to be thriving hub for the renewable sector in scotland it mean so much to to be give the chance to be champion for our part of scotland my mother be teacher at beath high the school attend by one of our most celebrated novelist sir ian rankin who grow up in cardenden in the constituency in sir ian book set in darkness inspector rebas carry out criminal investigation at the scottish parliament we can only

be and how we can look to well day even after the tough of time when be grow up in fife my father be vicar in lochgelly during the miner strike my father in law jim be proud member of the national union of mineworkers when stand for election to this place in he give miner lamp to bring with to westminster if win to remind what be here to do be not elect in and after that election nearly year

record for the big gathering of pirate in any one place record that we try to beat every year on pirate day although one of my predecessor in represent rye be himself real pirate be relieve to say that that can not be say for many of they sally ann hart work extremely hard for our constituency and thank she in particular for her work in support of woman and child flee domestic abuse legacy that hope to build on another thing that we wholeheartedly agree on be speak out about the unacceptable level of abuse and intimidation that too many member of this house have face particularly woman the plaque of the late jo cox be face we and that of sir david amess be behind they be constant and tragic reminder of where that can end also pay tribute to my labour predecessor michael foster he be well know in our area for help so many resident and for have be passionate champion for hastings and rye during his time in this house many member will know our area for very famous battle that take place in historian may still be argue about where exactly it take place but it be safe to say that it have cement our place in the history book since then we have continue to play our part in british history from be immortalise in the novel the ragged trousered philanthropists to be the birthplace of television perhaps what define we most though be our community spirit underpin by our volunteer and charity who do so much our calendar be full of carnival and festival from jack in the green to bonfire night those event be make possible only by volunteer who give up their time to give back to the community and raise money for our local charity volunteer also maintain and protect so many of our amazing public space from hastings country park to rye harbour nature reserve and camber sands there be also some point of our history that we would rather forget such as the unveiling of certain stone tablet in hastings during the general election campaign by my right hon friend the member for doncaster north ed miliband that stone may have be consign to history but know that my right hon friend will be back very soon to unveil some new green energy infrastructure and that it will be long last than the stone although we have often find ourselves at the centre of historical event we have not always feel all of the benefit our road and rail infrastructure be stick in the past we may be similar distance from london as brighton be but our train line take twice as long we lie at the end of the road that have be describe as the least develop in the south east of england as any driver

national average trend that have get bad over the past year people wait long for an ambulance in my constituency than anywhere else in the south east of england and the situation be particularly bad in our village and rural area such as winchelsea where people wait minute on average when have stroke or heart attack that be why this government plan to cut nhs waiting time can not come soon enough as seaside destination our area have benefit hugely from tourism but we be also at the sharp end of the housing crisis with spiral rent and simply not enough home be build too many of my constituent be leave in poor quality rental accommodation whether by southern housing or private landlord that be why so welcome the measure in this king speech to get britain build again build more home and give
