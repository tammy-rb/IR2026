oral answers to questions energy security and net zero the secretary of state be ask zero carbon electricity system what recent progress he have make on meet his target to have zero carbon electricity system by what recent progress he have make on meet his target to have zero carbon electricity system by in week this government have hit the ground run for our target by end the onshore wind ban in place for nine year under the conservative party consent to more nationally significant solar project than in year of the last government and oversee the most successful renewable auction in history compare with the conservatives disastrous auction round that crash offshore wind this be government in hurry to meet our mandate from the british people and we be just get start thank the secretary of state for his really rapid action to reach our sustainable goal by it have develop real excitement in this country and the people speak to are genuinely behind this action in stroud we be develop community energy programme of put solar panel on every school and public building that agree to it what step be he take to support solar on school and public building and can he ensure there be no barrier to progress my hon friend be absolutely right about the importance of both rooftop solar and ground mount solar can tell he that as part of great british energy plan we want to work with local school local hospital and indeed local leader to have solar panel programme because this be way to rapidly decarbonise and to save money off bill thank the secretary of state for that answer cantonian high school in my constituency of cardiff west will be the first cardiff school to be operationally net zero in line with welsh government standard while the building work itself will feature significant reduction in embody carbon fairwater community campus will be collection of highly energy efficient building that be power from renewable energy source help cardiff to deliver on its one planet strategy which outline the city ambition to mitigate climate change will the secretary of state join in celebrate the development and agree with that this sort of collaborative vision be require to deliver on our net zero commitment both here and in wales order just to help everybody the hon gentleman be mean to go through the chair but he be look at the secretary of state as good look as the secretary of state be it be easy if the hon gentleman speak to and then can pick up what he say thank you very much mr speaker and you too if may say so laughter congratulate my hon friend but particularly the fairwater community campus on the work it be do think he highlight very important issue by help to decarbonise public building include school we help not only to cut our carbon emission but crucially to save money for those school that they can then use for frontline service the previous secretary of state commission the department to produce full economic costing for get to fully decarbonise renewable base grid by as the secretary of state want that be obviously the sort of information that should be place before the house so that we can have an informed discussion it may be good thing to do but we should obviously know what the cost be when will the secretary of state publish that information of course that work be ongoing in fact think the right hon lady the shadow secretary of state have write letter about it and we will be announce our plan in due course in my constituency two major offshore wind farm be currently be develop morgan and morecambe recently meet nearly farmer who will be directly affect by the cable corridor and the substation plan for the cabling route to connect to penwortham be work with the hon member for blackpool north and fleetwood lorraine beavers on potentially well route through her constituency which would mean major economic development revitalise an industrial area that have be look for major energy project for some time we be jointly write to the secretary of state and may ask if he would commit to work with we on at least assess that potentially alternative route for the cabling corridor the hon gentleman and he know this will obviously want to stand up for what he see as the good benefit for his constituency will be cautious about what say because there be proper procedure for planning decision include my quasi judicial role will make this general point to the house because think this may well be recur theme during question but if we want to get off the dangerous exposure to international fossil fuel market which we be leave with by the last government we need to build the grid every solar panel we put up every wind turbine we put up and every piece of grid we build will help to deliver energy security for the british people call the shadow minister not only be the secretary of state very good look fellow but we in this house all know that he be an incredibly hard work and very open minister as indeed be his whole team so know that the reason he have not reply to my letter of september be that he and his team will be work their sock off to get full and open answer to all my question he have already make reference to one of my colleague and say that he will produce in due course full system cost analysis may stress that it be incredibly important that we in this house have that system cost analysis as soon as possible so that not only can we analyse his ambitious plan for carbon neutral target but we can also explain to our constituent exactly how much it will cost they in their bill to deliver his target let tell the hon gentleman little about the situation that we inherit from the last government because it be very relevant obviously he be not minister in that last government we inherit situation where there be no plan no plan for their target of clean power by no plan for their target of clean power by and no plan to avoid repeat of the bad cost of live crisis in generation this government be develop plan and will publish it in due course climate change international work what step he be take with his international counterpart to tackle climate change what step he be take with his international counterpart to tackle climate change what step he be take with his international counterpart to tackle climate change this government believe that we can only ensure climate security for further generation in the uk if we lead globally that be the message of the prime minister at the united nations general assembly with our world lead clean power plan no new oil and gas licence and play our part in reform the global financial system next month will be attend the talk in azerbaijan to stand up for britain interest it be brilliant to see the secretary of state commit to put climate diplomacy back at the heart of cabinet and know he will bring great amount of experience to that role sir david attenborough have repeatedly warn that our planet hang in the balance so will my right hon friend explain to the house what he will do to ensure that britain be once again main player on the world stage in tackle the climate emergency will he meet and representative from my constituency of paisley and renfrewshire south to discuss the work that they be do on rewilding in an effort to play their part in tackle the climate emergency it sound like my hon friend constituent be do important work she be absolutely right the last government use to say that we have only of global emission as if that be sort of excuse for inaction on the world stage we see it differently we see that only by lead at home can we provide the platform to lead internationally this government have in few short month put britian back on the world stage on climate and we will be work with our good endeavour to ensure that we tackle the situation we have inherit be afraid the world be mile off track for keep global warming to call chris vince thank you mr speaker do the training welcome the secretary of state warm word about our leadership on international climate issue which be in stark contrast to the previous government failing also publicly welcome his recent visit to harlow college less say about the racing game which he win the well do he agree that it be only thank to the commitment show by the new government to drastically deliver on climate change issue that we can lead on world stage neatly do although it be little long come on secretary of state my hon friend do very well and agree with he part of the problem with the last government do not doubt that there be people make good endeavour be that when we do something different at home to what we preach internationally such as say we be go to power past coal by open new coalmine people say well you be say one thing and do another consistency be the absolute foundation for global leadership welcome the secretary of state commitment to our international obligation whether that be clean power line or our own strong domestic climate policy that will help area such as rochdale with billpayer in recent year face the grim possibility of high bill this will make huge difference and the obvious comparison with the previous government be there for everyone to see will he outline to the house what further step he be take on the global stage at both and to increase our global reach on climate will say one thing in particular to my hon friend the prime minister say at the united nations general assembly that we will be unveil our nationally determine contribution our target for at we be do that because the danger be that the world settle into low ambition equilibrium when it come to tackle these issue by have align target we hope to set good benchmark and good example for the world the climate change committee have say that there should be no more than increase in airport capacity compare with level if we be to achieve net zero by yet current plan and recently approve airport expansion will allow for to increase in demand can the secretary of state explain why ministers in the department for transport be consider give green light to third runway at heathrow how on earth will that allow the country to meet its net zero target the beauty of carbon budget and the system that be introduce when be last in government to be fair it be carry on by the previous government of the past year be that they do at least in theory constrain what the government do it be very important that we take carbon budget seriously in our plan the plan we inherit from the last government be way off track for meet our carbon budget which be what this government will do very much welcome the secretary of state to his place climate change be real it be not myth the quick that everyone understand that the well can pose question to the secretary of state on rewilde there be some suggestion among expert that rewilde by plant tree on moor and heather might not be the most constructive way of utilise rewilding have he have an opportunity to look at the issue of rewilde on moor and heather which understand that many expert think be detrimental take the hon gentleman seriously on these issue and undertake to write to he or to have one of the ministers write to he make the general point that rewilding and nature base solution be an essential part of tackle the climate crisis international trade deal be great way of use our leverage to make sure we advance our agenda on thing such as tackle climate change the previous government let britain down massively conduct trade deal that let we down on farming on food production and especially on climate change will the secretary of state ensure that this government use the creation of new trade deal to advance our agenda on tackle climate change yes and that be something be already discuss with my right hon friend the business secretary call the shadow minister may congratulate the secretary of state on his appointment of rachel kyte as his climate envoy to support his work with international partner before her appointment do the secretary of state declare to official her link with quadrature capital which donate million to the labour party also do he declare her link to the green initiative foundation which give he yes or no answer will suffice all the proper process be follow by the foreign office which be in charge of the appointment have to say that this be very sad reflection on the conservative party rachel kyte be an esteemed person who be recognise for her leadership and all the conservatives can do be fle around baseless allegation onshore wind energy what step he be take to help increase level of onshore wind energy production after nine year of the disastrous bill raise ban on onshore wind in england this government overturn the ban in our first hour in office we have also set up the onshore wind taskforce to restore the pipeline of project destroy by the last government in the recent renewable auction almost gw of onshore wind be secure at price that make it among the low cost power source to build and operate when will the secretary of state bring forward proposal for community benefit for those live alongside wind and solar farm to great incentivise the permitting of wind and solar farm include ham solar farm in my constituency will that include minimum level of compensation for the community affect be sympathetic to what the hon gentleman say we be work on proposal on community benefit believe that when community host clean energy infrastructure they should automatically get benefit from it be also sympathetic to what he say about minimum level of support we be discuss that with industry at the moment and will come forward with proposal soon energy security what step he be take to improve energy security the energy shock of recent year have lay bare the exposure of our energy system to the international fossil fuel market that be why we have start mission to reach clean power by to end that reliance and ensure that the british people never again go through the sort of cost of living crisis that they have face in recent year under the conservatives people across hendon have pay the price for the previous government failure over the last year to invest in our energy system do the minister agree that the only way to get we off the rollercoaster of high bill be to invest at pace and scale as the government be do through our clean energy mission completely agree the only way to permanently protect hard work family and business from the high energy bill from which many be still suffer be to get ourselves off our reliance on the volatile fossil fuel market that be why we be roll out at pace and at scale the clean power necessary to do so which not only give we energy security but create good job bring down bill and help we to tackle the climate crisis the secretary of state will be aware that of the uk be situate on top of coalmine which can provide geothermal energy to heat house and business in place like ashfield will the minister meet to discuss how we can make that work in coalfield community very much welcome the hon gentleman question which must say be somewhat of surprise will absolutely meet he to discuss that we have be clear that any technology can be part of the solution and if that can be part of the picture will meet he to discuss the option and the technology more generally one of the way in which we can increase energy security be through community own and co operative energy scheme they give great control to local people who get say in where profit go and crucially they build resilience from international energy market will the minister say bit more about where community own energy will fit into the energy security plan thank my hon friend for that incredibly important question community energy have so many benefit in our energy mix include give community stake in our energy future we also know that there be many social and economic benefit that come from that we be committed to our local power plan which will deliver investment in community own project great british energy will have key role to play in support community capacity building and in that initial funding to help they deliver these project could invite the minister to meet cross party group of mps from the east of england to discuss how the review conduct by the electricity system operator can contribute to energy security and in particular to look at how undergrounding high voltage direct current cable could be cheap in the long term than pylon and more efficient for achieve net zero will he agree at least to have meeting with we on that basis be always happy to have meeting with any right hon and hon member across the house on range of issue so will take that away the evidence suggest that undergrounding be five to time more expensive and that actually it can have more of damaging impact on nature and natural habitat than pylon the important thing with all of this be that this be nationally important structure which be necessary for we to get to the target that we want to get to know that the hon gentleman take that seriously and will meet he and other but we have be clear as government that we will build this infrastructure if it be necessary job creation industrial communities what assessment he have make of the potential impact of great british energy on job creation in industrial community what assessment he have make of the potential impact of great british energy on job creation in industrial community the government have two key mission to become an energy superpower and to grow the economy great british energy will help we deliver on both those mission the under secretary of state for energy security and net zero my hon friend the member for rutherglen michael shanks will be take the great british energy bill through committee today and be excited for the job creation potential in our industrial community from engineer to welder and from electrician to project manager great british energy will be power by people across all the nation and region of this great country welcome the minister response and last week fantastic announcement about track carbon capture investment in teesside teesside have extraordinary potential for green job whether in sustainable aviation fuel with alfanar or in carbon capture hydrogen and so much else do the minister agree that only with labour plan for clean power by great british energy and our national wealth fund can we create well pay long term job in the industry of the future agree with my hon friend and thank he for his support doubt anybody would disagree with he on the benefit of our announcement on carbon capture and storage which will create job in the short term with carbon capture more broadly create up to job over the next decade or so interruption the opposition front benchers chuckle but wonder whether instead of dismiss that number of job they might welcome they alongside government members alongside carbon capture great british energy our national wealth fund and our british job bonus we be put in place the lever to encourage growth across our country and the climate change committee estimate that up to net new job could be create in low carbon sector by do the minister agree that gb energy be fantastic opportunity for wolverhampton north east to capitalise on the opportunity for research and start up on our forthcoming green innovation corridor and to put wolverhampton north east back where we belong at the heart of industrial growth and british industry agree with my hon friend it be fantastic opportunity publicly own great british energy will partner with industry to help we to deliver our mission of clean power by have be read about the green innovation corridor and be interested to see what it will deliver work in partnership with the private sector we can rebuild job across the west midland and far beyond do the minister agree with the head of the gmb union that the government plan to ban new licence for oil and gas will result in export job and import virtue agree with the gmb in its warm congratulation for our announcement yesterday to deliver carbon capture and storage across the country we be of course work closely with our trade union colleague it be interesting in opposition the conservatives suddenly quote the union when they refuse to even meet they in government we work very closely with the gmb and all our trade union to ensure that we have just energy transition and that we be create the job and skill of the future by become clean energy superpower energy social tariffs what recent assessment he have make of the potential merit of introduce energy social tariff we know that people be worried about their energy bill go into the winter and that for grow number of people energy be simply unaffordable we be absolutely determined to take this affordability issue and tackle it head on there be many different idea about what social tariff could look like and it mean different thing to different people we be clear that we will tackle the affordability question and look at the full range of option available to we but our priority my priority this winter be to ensure that family struggle with bill have support through our warm home discount scheme and to work with energy supplier to provide support be grateful to my hon friend for her response absolutely recognise that energy price over the last few year have escalate put particular pressure on household with low income and also those with high energy need such as disabled people and pensioner agree that the warm home discount scheme be valuable but it be limited and be concern for people with high energy need but on low income who might fall foul of the system as it stand we have be work flat out with energy supplier to ensure that they be provide additional support to family who will struggle with bill this winter in august meet all the supplier and there be shared commitment to do everything we can to support vulnerable household we have be work with they the industry body ofgem and citizens advice to ensure that there be proper package of support in place this winter so that we can support family who we know be struggle with their bill would it not have be well to put that proper package of support in place before the government withdraw the winter fuel allowance from so many pensioner we be have to clean up the mess that the opposition leave we yes we have mean test the winter fuel payment but we have also be clear that we will do everything we can do to support vulnerable household that be why we have extend the take up of pension credit and the household support fund and we be work flat out with energy supplier to provide additional support to all vulnerable household this winter thank the minister for her work warm home prescription can target that support towards elderly people and those with underlie health condition save our nhs as well as keep people warm over the winter the pilot have show real benefit will she meet to discuss that and other option to keep old people warm this winter we want to work with anyone who will help we reach vulnerable household be very happy to meet my hon friend to look at the full range of option available ofgem review of standing charge option paper close for submission on september can the minister offer any hope for bill payer in scotland that they will stop be penalise with the high standing charge on these island when will we see low charge we as government be commit to get down standing charge ofgem have consult and will report back in due course warm homes plan what step he be take to introduce his warm home plan what step he be take to introduce his warm home plan what step he be take to introduce his warm home plan we be run to deliver our warm home plan which will upgrade home across the country to make they warm and cheap to run we will set out the full plan in the spring but at the heart of it will be an offer of grant and low interest loan to support family to invest in insulation low carbon heating and home improvement critically alongside that we be commit to boost minimum energy efficiency standard for private rent home and social housing to tackle fuel poverty thank the minister for her answer and for her commitment to the warm home plan congratulate she on the announcement over the conference recess to end the scandal of cold draughty home in the rental sector which particularly affect people in my constituency in town such as haltwhistle throckley newburn hexham and elsewhere do she agree that often the very poor in our community be force to live in those cold and draughty property and it be important that we cut bill and give those family energy security agree one in four household in the private rent sector be in fuel poverty we need to bear down on bill our commitment to improve and boost minimum energy efficiency standard will lift million renter out of fuel poverty we be determined to do this alongside our big package to deliver clean power by which will drive down bill for everyone people across my constituency be worried about how they will afford to heat their home this winter be shocked to hear the former energy minister now shadow minister admit that his government should have go far and fast on insulate home which will certainly help do the minister agree that this be an admission of failure by the previous conservative government who have leave work people to pay the price can she reassure my constituent that this government will do well completely agree the legacy leave to we by the last government be woeful ordinary people family across the country have pay the price of that legacy we be clear that we will do and must do well our warm home plan will kickstart the upgrade that we need across the country so that we can deliver warm home that be clean to heat million of cold draughty home need update uk wide so it be great to hear that there will be proper plan rather than the itty bitty approach of spray bit of money here and there in the plan will the minister look at the fact that there be no national retrofit advice service in the uk can the government rectify that they could take leaf out of sadiq khan book because his service in london have help household agree with my hon friend there be critical role for national advice to ensure that people can access support and know the range of intervention available to they we will be look at that as we look at our warm home plan we be very clear that it will be comprehensive plan that will deliver the upgrade we need to see across the country one of my low income pensioner constituent have solar panel instal on their home through government scheme however they be now face an issue with bird nest in it which be cause huge amount of problem because the scheme do not come with protection will the minister agree to meet about this constituency issue because it be really affect one of my old constituent who sadly have also just lose her winter fuel payment yes will agree to meet to discuss the range of thing we can do very much hope the secretary of state and his ministers agree that if we be serious about energy security and net zero we must be serious about energy efficiency what step be they take in addition to work on insulate exist home to ensure that the promise million new home be build to net zero standard have solar panel on the roof and be fully insulate so that every new home be warm home we have an ambitious plan to build more home we want those home to be fit for the future we will put out information in due course on the standard we want across those home but we have an opportunity to do insulation energy efficiency and home that be fit for the future at the same time as build the home we need local authority play an important role as trust source of knowledge and expertise and guide householder for example to trust installer but they need the resource to do that will the department devolve some resource to local authority to fulfil that important role we see local and regional government play an absolutely fundamental role to reach home that we need to upgrade but also to help we deliver the scale of ambition we want local and regional government will be key part of our warm home plan call the liberal democrat spokesperson keep vulnerable people warm and lower their energy bill be be sure something we can all agree on across the house insulate home be key part of that puzzle we welcome the news that we will see the warm home plan in spring however do the minister agree that ahead of this winter we need an emergency home insulation plan particularly for the vulnerable along with allocate funding do she have any idea of the amount and allocation of funding in this parliament that there will be for insulate home we be really clear that as we develop our plan we absolutely need to get on with the job of upgrade home we have announce our warm home local grant and our warm home social housing fund which be target at low income family because we know there be job of work to do we be commit to an additional billion to invest in our warm home plan over the course of this parliament worker in high carbon sectors what step he be take to ensure just transition for worker in high carbon sector we be committed to accelerate the just transition for worker in britain to boost our energy security and ensure good long term job especially in north sea community we will work with they and other industrial region to develop plan ensure those worker be the people who decarbonise our country thank the minister for her response unfortunately the unjust transition we be see in grangemouth and port talbot be damn indictment of the lack of proactive approach to just transition over the last few year tomorrow at the treasury over major union and climate group will be call for new approach to the energy transition where instead of just de risk private profit there be governmental ringfence funding package for north sea oil and gas worker include help with skill and job creation will the secretary of state or ministers please meet the chancellor of the exchequer to ensure that those ringfenced fund be secure so that we can stop bet on the industry to do the right thing last week be the historic week when year of coal fire electricity generation come to an end and this week we have announce the new era of carbon capture and storage we will work in different way from the last government adopt proactive approach to ensure that the transition work for people and that we create new job as well at grangemouth we provide package of support for worker and at port talbot we manage to negotiate well deal than the last government we will use all the lever that we have great british energy the national wealth fund the british job bonus and the office of green energy job that we have set up to ensure that we get the transition right the secretary of state and the minister will know that civil nuclear have high employment multipli than any other form of zero or low carbon energy generation as part of the transition from high carbon sector what specific measure be the government take to retrain worker and transfer skill into the nuclear energy industry thus ensure that they benefit from job creation in this grow sector in my constituency and throughout the country obviously the last government do nothing about nuclear in year apart from come up with plan we will ensure that nuclear be an important part of our country future and we will be work to provide the right skill and job in the right place to deliver that grid capacity what step he be take to increase grid capacity we be halve the development time for new transmission infrastructure through reform of planning supply chain and other area deliver the grid capacity that be need to achieve clean power by and meet doubling of electricity demand by community be do their very good and lot of people be try to help each community to power itself my own village have its community solar project which be fully fund by local resident there be non profit organisation which have deal with local scheme by put solar panel on school with an element of community ownership and there be individual who try but be face with extortionate cost for connection to the grid the grid be really design for big old power station rather than small power creator try to plonk power into the system what can the minister do to encourage national grid to pivot and help community and individual to create their energy nearer to their home the hon lady be right to draw attention to the importance of community energy project throughout the country we want to see many more of they but we have inherit grid that need significant upgrading and we be now work apace to ensure that that happen part of the work that have be do with national grid and other involve try to identify the next step that be need to shorten the connection queue and also to make it more affordable for small community project to connect there be an important role for partnership as well with some of the big renewable project give part of their connection queue to small one and that be already happen in some part of the country there be no doubt that there be much more to do but we be as have say work apace to try to move this forward after year of inaction call the liberal democrat spokesperson as we have hear from my hon friend the member for wells and mendip hills tessa munt the lack of national grid capacity be hold back the uk push towards renewable energy there be numerous example of project that have be delay because they be wait to be connect to the national grid or because connection be too expensive in my constituency we can not even connect the solar panel and battery for the ambitious plan to decarbonise and electrify the refuse fleet for south cambridgeshire district council the project that have be delay include the building of new home which be crucial at present can the minister explain to we how we be to reach this stage on the scale and at the pace that be need the hon lady be right to highlight those issue the connection queue in particular be huge challenge with more than gw wait to join it the last government do some work to establish how the queue could be prioritise and we will now implement that but we need to go far it be clear that by we will need to build four time as much new transmission network as have be build since this be project to rewire the entire country to improve the current connection availability and to work with everyone include the new national energy system operator on the road map towards clean electricity generation what step his department be take to increase clean electricity generation the late contract for difference round secure record renewable electricity project across great britain this will deliver total capacity of gw enough to power the equivalent of million home the energy secretary will continue to work with industry to explore how the contract for difference scheme and other energy policy can be expand even far commend the secretary of state for his excellent work since he take office in accelerate clean electricity generation in the uk and commend the fantastic team he have with he the minister be right to say that there be clean energy imperative if we be to tackle the climate crisis boost our energy security and reduce our bill what step have the minister take to ensure that this government encourage and take advantage of the significant opportunity around community energy and will he meet and representative from my constituency of sheffield central to discuss how we can boost the growth of community energy thank my hon friend for her question she be absolutely right to say that in order for we to meet our ambition we will need whole range of different option community energy be critical part of that help to deliver energy security and low bill crucially it also give community stake in the energy future that be why one of great british energy five objective be to support the delivery of local power plan which put local community combined authority local authority and other in the drive seat in restructure our energy economy be happy to meet my hon friend and other to discuss this issue far contrary to what one of the ministers say early the last government bring about one of the large revival in nuclear energy in year in order to provide clean electricity generation yet we hear precious little from the new government on their plan for nuclear we hear only their plan for inefficient technology that will destroy the countryside why be they so anti nuclear and when be they go to get on with deliver nuclear energy will give credit to the conservative government on one thing they be very good at make grand announcement on delivery however they be much poor look at whole range of thing carbon capture be very good example they have lot of warm word but no delivery whatsoever on nuclear they have lot of warm word but no delivery whatsoever in year how many nuclear power station be build under the conservative party none we will get on with do the work if we want to see an increase in clean energy generation we need more announcement such as the one we see last week on the development of carbon capture usage and storage although that be incredibly welcome and sign of determined action from the new government there be still more to be do perhaps the minister can give an indication of when he anticipate he will be able to announce progress on track extension and share some information on track because that would secure thousand of job in the humber region my hon friend be absolutely right to say that in the three and bit month that we have be in government we have move at pace to deliver the large renewable auction in history and to make last week announcement on carbon capture we be work through the next stage of the process at pace and we will have further announcement in the week ahead do the minister agree that it would be well to have the right electricity system in or than to have the wrong one because of an artificial target which may be undeliverable by could be wrong but think the right hon gentleman previously say that his own government plan on onshore wind in england be not the right approach to take agree with he which be why we lift the onshore wind ban the reality be that whereas the previous government use to talk the talk on climate action we be the one now deliver and deliver an energy system fit for the future call the shadow minister one way to increase clean electricity generation in the united kingdom would be to invest at pace in new nuclear we leave government with clear plan to get to gw of nuclear power by do that target remain this be the whole point about the conservative government and it be why we have inherit such an economic mess they make series of announcement with absolutely no funding to back they up as you would expect mr speaker pay close attention to the conservative party conference and the hon gentleman make very astute point which be happy to repeat for the benefit of hansard and the house after year of conservative government we be now in position where it more difficult to build critical infrastructure than it be when we come into power could not have put it well myself our record on nuclear speak for itself we launch the small modular down selection process and great british nuclear and invest million in new advanced nuclear fuel we consult on new route to market for advanced modular reactor and new technology and grant development consent order for sizewell there be concern that there be go slow in the government right now so when can we expect final investment decision on sizewell will it still be this year be not aware when my right hon friend the secretary of state change the title of the ministerial portfolio that we have move away from have minister for consultation but it seem that all the hon gentleman be do in his time in office be launch consultation we be go to get on with deliver and we be move at pace on the whole of the electricity system include on nuclear and deliver on the thing that he fail to do topical questions if he will make statement on his departmental responsibility as well as our measure on onshore wind solar and renewable this government have begin legislate for great british energy and set out our plan for proper standard for private and social renter to take million family out of fuel poverty and on friday we announce deal to kick start britain carbon capture industry all of this will deliver our mission to make britain clean energy superpower it be right for bill right for energy security right for job and right for climate leadership welcome the action outline by my right hon friend particularly the recent announcement that gb energy will be headquarter in aberdeen with satellite office in edinburgh and glasgow can he outline the role that he expect the satellite office to take give the investment already under way in the port of leith for number of renewable company as well as the prospect for the supply chain and manufacturing will he consider leith as the location for the edinburgh site my hon friend be absolutely right to draw attention to our announcement on aberdeen as the headquarters of great british energy and the important role that it will play and also to the importance of the satellite office know from my visit to her constituency of the huge potential of her area on these issue and we want to drive job throughout the supply chain through great british energy call the shadow secretary of state the secretary of state promise in the general election to cut everyone bill by by pledge he will not repeat now that he be in office in fact one of his first act have be to snatch the same amount away from million of pensioner in poverty the right hon gentleman like to preach to politicise and dare say it to patronise but have one simple question for he to the million of pensioner who be worried about their heating bill this christmas will he apologise the people who should be apologise be the last government who leave this country in total mess billion black hole have to say to the right hon lady that she do have brass neck she say of the right hon member for north west essex mrs badenoch whom she be back in the leadership contest that she tell the truth and what do the right hon member for north west essex say she say have people in my constituency tell that they do need the winter fuel payment why do we not have mechanism for means testing that be her position there we have it no apology no recognition that it be the right hon gentleman government decision that be go to leave pensioner in the cold this winter he have to acknowledge this from the trade union to the cbi from blue labour to blairites and from the left to the right of his party people be sound the alarm that his ideological approach will see job lose and bill go through the roof even his old pal ed balls do not think that gb energy be go to deliver the green transition and read this morning that the prime minister brand new chief of staff be sceptic of the secretary of state approach the secretary of state be increasingly isolate in his party so when will he do the decent thing and set out the full system cost of his approach so that the british public can see what he be go to do to their bill oh dear oh dear the truth be that after three month of this government people have breathe sigh of relief that there be finally government with plan for the country interruption think the right hon lady should listen to what her own ministerial team have be say about she the former network minister have say that their infrastructure approach be hopeless the former energy minister say that the onshore wind ban be always mad and lord callanan say that the right hon lady have kick the solar consent into the long grass if be she would be hop for just one thing from the next tory leader shadow cabinet reshuffle grid capacity and the slow speed of new connection be major issue in west london it be hold back house building and it be hold back business exciting new green business such as allye energy in my constituency the conservatives do absolutely nothing in year to tackle the issue what be my right hon friend strategy and will he meet and local business to discuss how we can tackle this issue together and meet our mission around growth and good clean energy my hon friend be absolutely right to say that that issue be hold back project across the country which be why we have tackle it from day one we be attempt to release network capacity which can then be reallocate to accelerate the connection of viable project there be lot of work to do and we be build on what the previous government do to prioritise the queue and to build the necessary infrastructure that should have be build over the past year do the secretary of state accept that the only way we will both meet our net zero target and keep energy bill down be by press ahead with new generation of nuclear power station will he therefore accelerate exist project such as hinkley point and sizewell and press ahead with small modular reactor and advanced modular reactor technology agree with the right hon gentleman nuclear be an essential part of the energy mix we be mainly go to have renewable system but nuclear be an essential accompaniment fully support all the project he mention the previous minister of state for energy security and net zero have admit that the last government could have go far and fast on insulate home but say that he would wait to see how the new government tackle the issue when it come to insulate million more home across the country and reduce bill for million of family will we simply take wait and see approach whether it be our ending of the onshore wind ban the ccus funding we announce last week our plan for great british energy or our warm home plan we be hit the ground run to deliver our clean power mission the conservatives spend year dither and delay leave ordinary people to pay the price but we will get on with the job of deliver energy security so that we can secure financial security for family good job and climate action to achieve net zero we will need widespread micro generation alongside large scale project however as local farmer who want to install an anaerobic digester tell grid connection be both costly and subject to long delay what do the secretary of state plan to do to address these issue particularly in rural area such as my thornbury and yate constituency the hon lady raise question about the problem of grid connection that be familiar to many member we be build on work do by nick winser the former electricity network commissioner and we want to go far to tackle the problem of grid connection once and for all the great turbine of the rampion wind farm be off my beautiful coastal constituency although the uk have do well on offshore generation the job in this sector have not always be here in the uk what plan do the government have to expand offshore wind and to ensure that uk worker and supply chain benefit from that expansion my hon friend ask an important question of course we and the opposition have fundamentally different view we believe in an industrial strategy that will help to deliver our supply chain we believe in great british energy and we believe in sovereign wealth fund which so many other country have and the previous government fail to deliver we will make sure we have resilient supply chain that create job deliver energy security and maximise the economic benefit of the transition what guarantee can the secretary of state give to steelworker in scunthorpe that the grid connection require for new electric arc furnace will be ready on time next year the hon gentleman raise very important issue that be afraid be not solve by the last government we be work at pace with national grid and be sure the under secretary of state for energy security and net zero my hon friend the member for rutherglen michael shanks will be happy to talk to he far about the work we be do welcome the government commitment to increase renewable energy generation an important component of that be the development of associated infrastructure include battery storage facility such as those propose in cullingworth in my constituency how do the government plan to ensure that the safety of resident be not put at risk by such development and that there be clear community benefit from any renewable energy plan and the associate infrastructure battery will play an important part in the short duration storage require for the energy system we be build for the future it be question of balance community will be engage in the consultation process and will be convene roundtable with provider of battery technology and other short duration storage in the next few month to learn both from project that have work well and from project on which we could do well in future will happily share any information from that with my hon friend will the secretary of state commit to ensure that large energy supplier work with community energy organisation to generate and sell electricity locally at discount rate and provide fair community benefit as propose by the liberal democrats the hon lady raise the important issue that as country we be massively underpowered on community energy as part of the gb energy local power plan we will be try to change that learn from country such as germany and denmark which do much well than we we will certainly look at the issue she raise the clean power by mission show the clear intention of this government to get on with the just transition energy worker in falkirk grangemouth and across the central belt be rightly concerned about job between and under the previous government job in the uk oil and gas sector halve unfortunately some of the opposition party have oppose the stream of funding for clean infrastructure and job of the future that will come from an increase in the energy profit levy on the record profit of oil and gas giant do the secretary of state agree that it be time opposition party start put their own plan forward on how they would get on with the just transition and deliver clean energy job at critical time for worker and the climate my hon friend raise the important issue that what will define the future for north sea worker be whether there be plan for future job in offshore wind carbon capture and hydrogen there be no plan from the previous government this government be absolutely determined to ensure just transition for those worker use the power of government and proper industrial policy to make it happen on petrol price for the past year the government freeze fuel duty they cut it in and then froze it again the government instruct the competition and markets authority to carry out review and we come up with the pumpwatch scheme consultation be undertake in january but when write to the government in september to ask about its result they say they be look at it and would consider it in due course be the scheme priority for the government if not in what other way will they ensure petrol price be keep low at the pump be they go to freeze fuel duty will not comment on the budget obviously we be very sympathetic to pumpwatch it be important that there be fair deal for consumer at the pump exeter city council have work hard to install solar panel on council home to ensure that social tenant can benefit from low bill and participate in the green transition can the minister set out what more we can do to ensure that all tenant benefit from new green technology my hon friend raise such an important issue across the house we can have different view on ground mount solar but we need to do more on rooftop and to ensure that tenant for example council tenant benefit from such technology that be huge priority for we and we be work on it with colleague in the ministry of housing communities and local government what discussion have the secretary of state have with the scottish government regard the major planning application for an offshore wind farm between scotland and northern ireland which may well have significant implication for the giant causeway world heritage site the hon gentleman will understand that have to be careful in what say about planning issue but he should rest assure that have frequent conversation with my counterpart in the scottish government and no doubt that be one issue we will be discuss warwick and leamington must be one of the sunny place in the united kingdom give the flurry of application we have have for solar farm there be loss of amenity cause by one application but if that community be prepared to welcome onshore wind turbine of which we have none in warwickshire rather than solar farm would the secretary of state or the minister agree to support that will they meet to discuss the issue every planning application and development consent order be assess on its merit importantly the secretary of state for environment food and rural affairs my right hon friend the member for streatham and croydon north steve reed be polish land use framework which have long be need in this country it will set out the balance between food security the use of renewable energy the restoration of nature and the role of farming hope that will help with some of the issue that hon member be face the secretary of state and the under secretary of state the hon member for rutherglen michael shanks have speak passionately about the need to upgrade the national grid but do they recognise the concern of people across the east of england include in the witham constituency about what that mean for their local community the under secretary have say that he will meet members of parliament but ask he very politely whether he and representative and ministers from the department will also meet member of the community that be affect by this matter know from the question that have receive from the opposition that the right hon lady have be tireless advocate on these issue do understand the concern of local community about clean energy infrastructure which be why be so keen on the idea of community benefit it be important that community receive benefit for host that infrastructure we must have discussion about this matter in the house and across the country if we be to end our exposure to international fossil fuel and the kind of the cost of living crisis that we have see over the past few year which have devastate community across britain this infrastructure do need to be build last week announcement on carbon capture and hydrogen in my constituency demonstrate that we now have government of substance not of hollow slogan what discussion have the secretary of state and ministers have with the trade union to ensure that we build those facility with unionised labour thank my hon friend for his question after year of failure and inaction we now have government who believe in work with our trade union who have the backing of our trade union and who want to work to create good job in the industry of the future our announcement on carbon capture which be groundbreake and world beat will deliver just that the institution of civil engineers have call for spatial energy plan to utilise new and emerge technology to facilitate future net zero infrastructure planning will the government look to bring forward spatial energy plan and meet to discuss that yes we will be bring forward spatial energy plan that be one of the responsibility of the national energy system operator the hon gentleman make an important point we need plan for the system we can have plan for the system do by the neso and indeed wide strategic spatial energy plan which will be crucial for the country the warm home plan be excellent and much need in town such as mine but on warm home grant for insulation during recess meet large number of constituent who have be victim of fail insulation and cowboy workmanship under such government scheme some be live in horrific condition with useless warranty be the minister aware of their plight will she ensure that regulation be strong enough and will she meet and victim to make sure that this never happen again thank my hon friend for his question we be aware of those case of bad insulation and we be clear that we need to get firm grip on they to persuade everyone that we should be insulate and upgrade all of our home we need the high standard possible agree to meet he to discuss this matter far in my constituency new solar farm at barkham be be deliver that will provide clean energy for more than home and provide funding boost for wokingham borough council it will be connect in but there be concern that connection to the grid could be delay by year what step will the minister take to reduce similar delay and do he think that the government can meet their net zero target if the new renewable energy infrastructure can not be quickly connect to the grid thank the hon gentleman for his question similar point have be raise by many hon member across the house this issue affect area right across the country we be do what we can at the moment to prioritise the connection queue so that the most important project or those most able to be deliver can move forward there be much more that we can do on that but fundamentally we need to build much more network infrastructure in the first place so that we can speed up and reduce the cost of these connection for scheme such as the one he mention point of order on point of order mr speaker be concerned that the government have not always be consistent with the explanation that they have give of their policy in relation to arm export to israel in particular some of the explanation that minister have give in this house be inconsistent with account that have be give elsewhere include in the other place my noble friend lord howard be also pursue this matter in the other place this be critical foreign policy matter involve close ally mr speaker have you have any indication that the foreign secretary intend to come to the house to make statement on this matter and to clear up any misunderstanding that might have arise as result of discrepancy between what we have be tell and what ministers have say elsewhere be grateful to the right hon member for give notice of that point of order as he well know the chair be not responsible for the accuracy of ministerial remark either in this house or elsewhere but be sure that those on the treasury bench will have note his comment and be sure they have be take on board do not think we have hear the end of this yet so be sure as know the right hon member well that the opposition will not give up at this stage opposition day allotted day vat independent schools beg to move that this house regret that the government have decide to impose vat on independent school fee believe that educational provision should not be tax regret that the government be rush to implement this change part way through an academic year call on the government to exempt from the vat charge fee pay in respect of child of military and diplomatic family all child who have an education health and care plan or who be in the process of apply for one all child on sen support centre for advanced training and school in the music and dance scheme all child at school whose fee be low than the average per capita funding for state school place and child at religious school of denomination for whom there be no faith school provision in the state sector further call on the government to postpone imposition of the vat charge for school in area where state school in the relevant key stage be already on average over full also call on the government to postpone imposition of the vat charge for fee pay in respect of child who have start public examination course to september for pupil currently in year or year and to september for pupil currently in year or year and call on the government to publish full impact assessment of the effect of this policy on independent school and the state sector ahead of the budget there be day to go until the introduction of labour education tax and we be still in the dark many question remain for parent for child and for school when say school that be both independent school and state school and also for the local authority that be responsible for special educational need provision and generally for ensure that everyone can get place at school this be huge change which be be make in headlong rush there be big worry about child with special educational need or disability about military family about the talented musician and dancer of tomorrow about small religious faith and about the wide impact of all that on state school because this mean disruption big class budget overstretch and ultimately parent be less likely to get their preferred choice of school even those who do not necessarily object to this in principle be say it can not be push through this fast from the chartered institute of taxation to the nasuwt it be long stand principle that you do not put tax on learn principle all but universally observe around the world on the conservative benches we believe in that principle and we believe in the sanctity of parental choice the vast majority of child of course go to state fund school and we defend the right of parent to choose those school and defend the diversity of those school small number of parent choose home schooling we defend that right too and yes some choose the independent sector parent be the first educator of their child the state set an expectation of suitable education for all child and beyond that parent should make the choice of what be good for their child parent might decide to opt out of state education for any one or many of several reason quite often simply because they have find the school that they believe be right for their child and where their child be most happy rise rise be spoil for choice give way to my right hon friend during the election in the monks walk pub meet constituent who have stay in his small home and have one car for the family because they decide their bully daughter need to go to another school they have sacrifice with the support of wide family so that that child with special educational need can go to private school it be child and family like that who will be the victim of this spiteful policy do my right hon friend agree my right hon friend be right to identify that many parent make great personal financial sacrifice to do what they believe be good for their child some parent whose child go to independent school be rich and some be definitely not include in that latter bracket most of the parent send their child for example to small religious school in hackney salford or birmingham very many more be in the middle include many professional work in our public service the shadow minister have rightly underline the issue for those who send their child to faith school or independent school many constituent in strangford have tell that they have save and persevere have not be on holiday have not buy second car or have even continue to use their old car long than they should so that those money can go into their child education do he like find it impossible to understand how it can be that it be the labour party the party of conscience would say that have let we down on this issue and be go to penalise people who be hard pressed to find education for their child the hon gentleman be right about the financial sacrifice some make let we be clear it be possible to tax wealthy people or people with high income more but the government should be honest about it the way to do so be through the income tax system not through choice that people make to have their child in an independent school the hon gentleman do not mention this but might add that because the situation in northern ireland be different from that in england by the way the situation in scotland be different too the government need to think carefully about how the policy be apply throughout the whole united kingdom because vat be reserved matter and about what it mean for the hon gentleman constituent and other across these island my late mother and dad use to run pub and they pay their taxis it be private business that make profit why should these business not pay their taxis why should they not pay what be owe this be completely different situation independent school do pay tax indicate dissent no independent school do pay tax on supply no tax be charge on education whether in an independent school or in other setting and that be very long stand principle let clear up one very important definitional point which ask colleague to reflect on there be no tax break involve it would be tax break if person who have child at an independent school and be not take place at state school be charge less tax as result that do not happen in the united kingdom everybody contribute to state sector education whether or not they take up place the principle of no tax on learn be fast one and once we loosen it we do not know where we will go where might the treasury look next private nursery perhaps music lesson private tutoring what be the philosophical difference between independent school education and private tutoring let make point to demonstrate how rush and ill thought through this policy be my understanding be that if child in nursery have turn five but the other child in the class have not all the parent in that nursery year will have to pay vat on their child nursery fee that be how badly this have be think through my hon friend be right that come from the rush nature of the legislation the sloppy drafting mean that child who be not of school age get drag into this tax if they happen to be in the same room as child who be and there be concern about what might follow in other borderline case the government claim that the policy be about revenue not politic but have read the secretary of state twittering think hon member could be forgive for mistake the motivation it be entirely spurious for multiple reason to link this tax to teacher mental health support or anything else the money will go into general exchequer receipt and anyway teacher be not that many in the scheme of thing give the there be now that be compound growth rate of over five year and by the way lot few teacher than we recruit in the last five year mental health support team be already be roll out and they cover primary school as well as secondary school it be not clear what the difference be in the new government policy on mental health support other than that it will not include primary school to the extent that the vat revenue could be hypothecate it look lot more like that revenue would reduce cut to education resourcing rather than increase it if the policy be about revenue not politic the government could easily commit to one simple thing today they be confident they tell we that the policy will raise large sum of money and not create large cost will they commit to measure and report back on that and if it turn out against expectation that they be wrong will they reverse it thank my right hon friend who be give an excellent introduction to the debate be it his understanding that our military personnel and those serve in our diplomatic service will also be hit by this tax my hon friend be absolutely right as thing stand those who get the continuity of education allowance would be hit in part by the tax in the calculus that my right hon friend rightly ask the government to publish can we include the foreign receipt that the independent sector generate the roll of school in my constituency include very large number of child from overseas whose parent pay directly into the uk economy that school be now under threat the loss of that revenue will be substantial and the local impact huge may we have that factor in give that so far we have not see any figure on the loss of money and reputation that the closure of many such school will entail my right hon friend be correct substantial export earning come from the sector and from globally mobile set of family but would go far in addition to the direct export earning effect there be also an indirect effect for company decide where to site their european headquarters english education be big factor that be partly because of our brilliant state school which have improve so much over the past year but the availability of independent school be also factor the shadow secretary of state make strong point about the sanctity of zero rating vat for education be concerned that child clothe which be currently exempt from vat may be the next target notwithstanding the impact that the change to vat will have on individual family do he agree that private and prep school my constituency have five be enormous employer of people involve in building maintenance such as electrician and plumber and that the impact on the wide economy could well be profound order remind member to look towards the chair when they be speak or what they say will not be pick up by the mic then struggle to hear they know that the minister be struggle as well if member keep the chatter down it will help we both my right hon friend be of course correct about the economic contribution that school make locally and the large number of people they employ that point be also make by nasuwt which be worried about teacher be inadvertently push out of the profession if redundancy be make mid way through the school year my youngster have have mix of excellent learning include in nursery and in state education as have youngster in many family have personal and constituency interest in want all education setting to thrive so agree with my right hon friend the economic and employment impact of this new tax will be devastating for bus driver and maintenance team it will impact on so many livelihood and community the people pick up the unknown impact will be in the state sector the policy will just deliver more of the unknown my hon friend make very good point rise will take one more intervention before make progress so as not to try your patience too much mr speaker it be not that my patience be be test but do worry when shadow secretaries of states cover subject at length understand but we need to get on because lot of back benchers be desperate to get in in fact we have very eager opposition whip come in now you will find out mr speaker that will not test your patience want to take my right hon friend back to the point he make about the education secretary tweet which think be disgraceful hon member where be she the divisive language behind that tweet be disgrace give the many independent school that work hard and play by the rule do my right hon friend agree that the embossed notepaper that the secretary of state focus on be send to many child who be be sponsor through bursary or scholarship and whose parent work hard to give their child the good education the education secretary should apologise for that disgraceful tweet be grateful to my hon friend who as ever make important point too be disappoint that the education secretary be not with we for this important debate will make progress mr speaker because do not want to go on long than should to be clear we want to talk first and foremost not about revenue but about education school and child all child interruption no have be talk about school and child throughout if the government insist on plough on with this divisive policy they must at least exempt certain group of child for whom it would be especially unjust or counterproductive to impose this tax surely school that charge the same as or even less than the average cost of school place be not in the government sight when they devise this scheme there be small religious group that have no state sector provision for their denomination why should they be disadvantage the continuity of education allowance exist expressly to support family who be serve our nation in the armed force surely they should be protect the government acknowledge the role of centre of advanced training and perform art school that come under the music and dance scheme because again there be no equivalent specialist schooling available in the state sector then there be the many child who receive special educational need support include those with an education health and care plan whether or not they be at the school name in the plan and those child who be apply for plan rise ask my hon friend to forgive as must make progress as for child whose parent be price out of school or face its closure disruption to learn can be difficult at any time but it be even more problematic when pupil have start public examination course their next school might not even offer the subject that they be take or the exam might not be mark by the same exam board we need to think about those child the tax levy should be postpone until pupil who be now in year or or in the low and upper sixth form have finish their exam until or the wide impact of all will be feel by state school minister have say repeatedly that there be no problem because there be plenty of space in state school we have repeatedly point out that that be of no help at all if those place be in the wrong place or the wrong year group they need to be where and for whom they be require state school in my constituency be burst at the seam there be no spare space to move into for the more than child be educate in independent school there the fee charge by those independent school be quarter to half of the cost of state school provision per pupil be grateful to the hon gentleman in buckinghamshire we do not have the place we have lot of child in special education need and disability school faith school and other private school we can not cope with the capacity loss we have parent who be sacrifice everything to send their child to send school there be no provision in the county for they the policy will result in crisis of transportation and place and child will suffer as result be grateful to both my hon friend and the hon member for dewsbury and batley iqbal mohamed for their intervention indeed there be many place particularly at secondary school level where there be insufficient space available to accommodate significant minority be displace from independent school place such as bristol and bedford salford and richmond worcester and wycombe and bury north and bolton north east let we be clear local authority have duty to find space for child they take that duty very seriously and number of they be considerably worried about what may happen in year admission can be especially complicated in any case they can involve not only governor but the fair access protocol panel and ultimately secretary of state direction all of which can add up to month out of school create additional physical space in school obviously take time and build new school take long still time be need to adjust which be why our motion far call on the government to postpone imposition of the vat charge for school in area where state school in the relevant key stage be already on average almost full this government barely have their foot under the table and already they be government in chaos that chaos be exemplify by this destructive disruptive and divisive education tax that will interrupt learning create place demand where it can not be accommodate put far strain on the send system hit specific group that we ought to be try to protect likely generate much low revenue than anticipate and quite possibly even end up as net cost to the public purse in their headlong rush to make political statement the government appear simply to not have think through the consequence we call on they now to announce immediately that they be abandon the unrealistic january implementation date to publish proper impact assessment and then to entirely rethink this entirely counterproductive tax this government be elect to break down barrier to opportunity we be determined to fulfil the aspiration of every parent in our country to get the good education for their child we be committed to do so by improve state school and make sure that every child have access to high quality education we will start to make this happen by expand early year childcare for all by open new nursery across england we will recruit new teacher alongside improve teacher and headteacher training and we will roll out further mental health support to school and college in england those improvement to the state education system will begin our work to make sure every parent aspiration for their child can be fulfil we want to get on with these important change right away and to do so they must be pay for that be why to help fund improvement to our state school we have make the tough but necessary decision to end tax break for private school in the july statement the government announce that as of january all education service and vocational training provide for charge by private school in the uk will be subject to vat at the standard rate of know the minister to be an honourable man so will he take this opportunity to apologise to the house in the absence of the secretary of state for education for the malicious and spiteful tweet that she put out this weekend that tweet be ill advise even if one believe that this policy be the right thing to do neither nor any of my colleague will make any apology for want to improve state education across this country to make sure that the aspiration of every parent in our country to get the good possible education for their child can be fulfil that be why we have announce that any fee pay from the date of the july statement july relate to the term start in january onward will be subject to vat this package of support will put thousand of teacher back into school classroom in telford and across the country have my hon friend receive any representation to say that if this change do not take place those plan by this government who be elect by the people of this country would go ahead by any other mean my hon friend make an important point about the reason why we have take the tough decision to end tax break for private school it be to fund our education priority because we know that the way to improve opportunity for people right across this country be to make sure that our state school can provide the good quality education for all child the minister be in similar debate this morning in which he hear range of view he be treasury minister not an education minister or the education secretary will he commit to publish an impact assessment on the overall cost of this policy there be parent in the gallery listen to the debate this morning and it be clear that there will be legal challenge to this policy will the treasury also publish the potential cost of that legal challenge and the bill that his department will be foot in order to meet it thank the right hon member for her contribution first in term of an impact assessment while develop these policy the government have carefully consider the impact they will have on pupil and their family across the state and private sector as well as the impact they will have on state and private school in addition to have review analysis publish by third party such as the institute for fiscal studies the government have conduct their own analysis of the likely impact of these policy which draw on range of source on point of order mr speaker be not go to give way because be respond to the right hon member for witham priti patel order it be point of order so you do give way unfortunately be grateful to you mr speaker could you give any advice to on how we can ensure that the impact assessment that must have be conduct on this policy be share with the house it be fundamental order as you know that be not point of order do not waste my time carry on minister as be say to the right hon member for witham the government will publish tax information and impact note on the vat policy change at the budget once the independent office for budget responsibility have scrutinise and certify the costing of the final policy will the minister give way be still reply to the hon member right hon friend interruption maybe conservative members could sort this out on their side of the house before they come into the chamber but will continue reply to the right hon member for witham turn to the legal case the government have consider the policy interaction with human right law and be confident that it be compatible with the uk obligation under the human rights act hope that address the right hon member concern will the minister give way will thank the minister for kindly give way this policy will have an economic impact in each and every constituency on librarian on maintenance people and on those who work in lab in catering and as minibus driver everything that be predicate on school such as the one we be discuss will the impact assessment and the treasury look at the wide implication for employment as the hon member know there be establish process for develop tax information and impact note this one will be develop in line with the obr costing in the normal way and publish alongside the budget so she will see all the information rise have give way quite lot so be go to make bit of progress alongside the announcement about vat the government announce in july that private school in england with charitable status would lose their eligibility for business rate charitable relief from april subject to parliamentary passage of the legislation those change be set out in technical note that be publish online alongside draft vat legislation which together form technical consultation as part of that consultation the government both at official and ministerial level have engage with broad range of stakeholder include the devolve government we have listen carefully to the point that people have raise with we we recognise that while this policy will raise revenue to help support improvement in the state education sector it may lead to increase cost for some parent and carer whose child be in the private education system however let be clear while private school will now be require to charge vat on the education service and vocational training they provide we expect that most private school will be able to absorb significant portion of this new vat charge and keep fee increase affordable for most parent they will be able to make efficiency and recover the vat they incur on the thing they buy those recover cost can be use to offset increase for fee payer we be already see that some school have commit to absorb the vat liability entirely while other be choose to cap fee increase at or to keep fee as low as possible for parent have pop at get the minister to give way during the debate this morning and appreciate his do so now love the irony of what he be say which be we need to do this to raise all this money yet it be actually go to raise all that much money because it can be reclaim on the impact assessment it be really interesting that one line in the consultation document that go out this summer say the government understand that move school can be challenging how many of his own constituent have contact he to say they will have to move school as result of this policy and how do we measure the damage that move school be go to cause for so many child in our constituency have be clear the government recognise that some pupil may subsequently move into the state education sector as result of these policy however as be set out in technical note and take it from the hon gentleman comment that he have read it the number of pupil who may switch school as result of these change represent very small proportion of overall pupil number in the state sector the government be therefore confident that the state sector will be able to accommodate any additional pupil whom this policy will cause to move rise will make bit of progress because have be quite generous in give way so far want to address some of the question that the shadow secretary of state ask in his speech particularly about why we be introduce this policy from january the reason we be do so be simple we want to raise the funding we need as soon as possible to deliver our education priority for state school across the country importantly january start date mean that school and parent will have have five month to prepare for the vat change and his majesty revenue and customs stand ready to make sure school be support in deliver it will the minister give way be go to make some progress hmrc will put in place number of measure to ensure that all private school can be register ahead of january include publish bespoke guidance on ahead of october update registration system and put additional resource in place to help process application rise be go to make some progress because have give way quite lot so far ahead of this policy be implement the government have carefully consider the impact that these change will have on pupil and their family across both the state and private sector as well as the impact they will have on state and private school the government cost of these policy be currently be scrutinise by the independent office for budget responsibility the chancellor will confirm our approach to these measure at the budget when we will set out our assessment of the expect impact of this change in the normal way we recognise that as hon member have say these change may lead to some pupil move into the state education sector while the impact of this policy be be fully consider we know that projection by the institute for fiscal studies indicate that the number of pupil who may switch school as result of these change be likely to represent very small proportion of overall pupil number in the state sector less than any displacement expect to take place over several year be very grateful to the minister for give way this be about child and even the prime minister make choice to better the education of his child so put this in place in january halfway through year be go to have significant emotional impact on family and child that be why it should be delay if it be good enough for the prime minister to make such choice for himself why can not this government make choice for the rest of the nation and support the most impact family and child have make clear the reason why we be proceed with this policy to january date which be that we want to raise the money as soon as possible to invest in our improvement to state education there will have be five month for parent and school to prepare for the change will the minister give way on that point be still respond to the hon member for hinckley and bosworth dr evans so please let come back to that point hmrc be put in place bespoke guidance and it be stand by to make sure that school be properly register for the change all the evidence we have see from the ifs and so on suggest that the impact on the state sector will be very small which mean that it will not have material effect on child education rise be go to make some progress to pick up the point make by the hon member for hinckley and bosworth be not deny that some pupil may have to move into the state sector but we expect much of this to take place at natural transition point such as when child move from primary to secondary school or at the beginning of their gcse or level year as have say the ifs expect any displacement to take place over several year we be confident that the state sector will be able to accommodate any additional pupil and that these policy will not have significant impact on the state education system as whole rise be go to make some progress be sorry but have take lot of intervention would like to address the issue of special educational need it be point that many hon member have raise and know that some parent be concerned about the impact of this policy on pupil in private school with special educational need let start by say that we have consider this element of the policy very carefully our propose policy make sure that pupil will not be impact where they have acute additional need and an education health and care plan in england or its equivalent in other nation specify that these can be meet only in private school thank the minister for give way on that specific point because he be rely on those school still be open because other parent have not leave how will he address the situation in which parent of child need that extra support rely on such school for their special educational need yet those school have close because they can not afford to stay open any long we will take community wide approach that see improved send provision in mainstream state school as well as ensure that state special school cater for those with the most complex need as parent of disabled child the issue of send education in this country be very important to as it be to number of my friend and acquaintance let we be clear that the send system in this country be break and it be the action of the previous government that leave we with parent be desperate and have to search for alternative to mainstream education for their child the vast majority of my constituent who find themselves without suitable education placement for their child for reason of disability or educational need be unable to afford to send their child to private school do the minister agree with that perpetuate system of inequality be not the solution for our broken send system thank my hon friend for her comment she be absolutely right to say that we need to improve send provision for all child in this country in financially sustainable way and she speak with great experience rise let make bit of progress we want to improve state school across this country so that when people have child with special educational need they never need to send they to private school because the provision in state school be well that be the crucial point behind our approach which my hon friend the member for thurrock jen craft be right to highlight rise be go to make bit of progress because have be quite generous in give way so far be talk about when ehcp in england or their equivalent in other nation specify that child education can be meet only in private school in case where pupil need can be meet only in specified private school local authority will fund their place and be able to reclaim the vat similarly on business rate the government be develop an approach to address the potential impact of these change when private school provision have be specify through an ehcp more widely as we have just be address we as government be commit to transform the system for support child and young people with send in all school we need to deliver well outcome in financially sustainable way will the minister give way be go to make bit of progress to address some other point raise in this debate we know that small number of diplomatic official and service personnel be post abroad for extended period in such circumstance the foreign commonwealth and development office and the ministry of defence provide the continuity of education allowance to ensure that this do not interfere with their child education can give the reassurance today that the government will monitor closely the impact of these policy change on affect diplomatic and military family with any change to the scheme be consider order be sure the lib dems do not need coach be not quite sure what happen there but will carry on be make an important point which be that the government will monitor closely the impact of our policy change on affect diplomatic and military family with any change to the scheme be consider as part of the ongoing spending review will the hon gentleman give way on that point will make bit of progress in our consultation on the technical detail of this policy we have be engage widely and in depth and the view of mp be an important part of that as say early it have be tough but necessary decision to end tax break for private school we believe it be the right decision and one we need to implement as soon as possible to help raise the funding that we need to deliver our priority for state education in this country we be determined to make sure that education which be available for all be of the high possible quality because that be how we ensure that we meet the aspiration of every parent to get the good possible education for their child call the liberal democrat spokesperson thank you very much mr speaker and be grateful for the health secretary do not need coach you will hear that soon enough when hear that today debate would be about school think thank goodness we be finally go to give the crisis in our classroom the attention it deserve and have long overdue serious debate about the squeeze on school budget the shortage of specialist teacher the dangerous state of many school building the crisis in special educational need provision or the mental health of child but no in fairness expect the conservative party suddenly to start prioritise those issue in opposition after it spend year neglect they in government would be foolishly optimistic nevertheless hope that we will have the chance to debate they properly soon priority for the liberal democrats be ensure that every child no matter their background get the support and attention that they need at school so that they leave with the skill confidence and resilience to be happy and successful that mean the government invest in education as we invest in other vital infrastructure in fact liberal democrats believe that education be the single good investment we can make in our child potential and our country future that be why in our manifesto we set out number of way to make that investment we argue that put dedicated qualified mental health professional in every primary and secondary school be important we argue for an increase in school and college funding per pupil above the rate of inflation every year we argue for school meal to be extend to all child in poverty and for tutoring guarantee for every disadvantaged pupil who need extra support that package of investment in our state school would improve and boost the performance and opportunity for every child as well as close the attainment gap that limit the life chance of too many child from disadvantaged background crucially we set out in detail how it could all be pay for include by increase the tax on social medium firm who have do so much to worsen the mental health crisis in our school that be much bold package of investment than the one this government have set out so far and it be pay for fairly not by tax parent own investment in their child education think the shadow education secretary be advocate raise income tax to invest in even for lib dem that be push it the shadow education secretary be suggest to the minister that that be where he could find some order if member wish to intervene they should do it properly let we not have side banter as the rest of the chamber need to get in as well thank you mr speaker as we have treasury minister rather than an education minister open the debate for the government say gently that he should look at what the liberal democrats propose on reform capital gain tax as way to fund some of the important investment that we need in education rather than look at tax parent choice to invest in their child education the government policy would undermine two important principle first education should simply not be tax as we have hear all education provide by an eligible body include university education music lesson and tutoring be exempt from vat and vat should not be impose on any of those thing because education be fundamentally public good secondly parent have the right to choose what education setting be good for their child as liberal we have always champion choice and believe that nothing should get in the way of those important choice of course we want to get to point where every parent can choose local state school that meet their child need and give they the good possible start in life and opportunity to flourish but let we be honest with ourselves that be not the reality face many parent today especially when their child have special educational need liberal democrats have many time raise the crisis in send provision conservative cut to school and council budget mean that many parent and carer simply can not get their child the support they deserve the minister talk moment ago about sort out state school send provision so that no parent with child with send would need to send their child to private school but do he recognise that in order to sort out and fix our broken send system we will need not million but billion of pound be not entirely sure that the chancellor will be give that kind of money to the department for education in my constituency there be three independent school one of which be choir school in one of those independent school there be child with diagnose send and only one with an ehcp with that as the name school do my hon friend agree that give the crisis in attain ehcp especially in west sussex county council which be rank fifth worst in the country and where only of ehcp be give within the statutory framework of week there need to be more support in deal with the deluge that this policy will cause county council order may suggest that intervention be mean to be short and not speech especially if you be on the list people be go to go down to six minute time limit shortly please think of other thank my hon friend for that intervention she be absolutely right to say that because only child with ehcp will be exempt from the vat charge there will be the unintended consequence of add yet further pressure to what be already broken system indeed parent in my constituency have write to along those line to say that they now feel that they will have to go through the application process so many parent and carer be force to navigate postcode lottery and wait month as my hon friend say to get the support that their child be entitle to the hon lady be london mp like and part of the problem be that the term private school cover such wide category and such multitude of sin do she agree that this be also quite london issue have an unusually large number of these school with in my boundary there be year ago but one have since close know my hon friend on the front bench would be happy to meet so can feed in the comment that hear at the advice surgery and when door knock which would take too long to recount right now thank the hon lady for her intervention but would gently say two thing first would not describe private school as cover multitude of sin this be also not just london problem my hon friend the member for edinburgh west christine jardine who represent an edinburgh constituency say that she have the high number of private school in the country it be nationwide problem and the consequence have simply not be think through let return to my point about special educational need and disability for many family local state school simply be not equip to give those child the support they deserve that be why as we have hear there be almost child in independent school who have special educational need and disability but not an ehcp that be ten of thousand of parent not the super wealthy but carer who be work hard and make tough choice so that their child can have the nurture education they need for year the first five under coalition government state school in telford and across the country be tell to be efficient more creative and innovative to save money as budget be freeze and then cut why can private school not also be as efficient and creative to cut cost in their operation it seem it be one rule for one set of parent child and another rule for the vast majority of child point out for start that when the liberal democrats be in government school budget increase in real term and we introduce the pupil premium to help the most disadvantaged child when the tories be leave to their own device they slash budget and the pupil premium have be devalue over the year just want to return briefly to the topic of ehcp we all know that there be crisis in special educational need in my own constituency quarter of pupil attend an independent school at least or more student do not have an ehcp those parent who be pay for place at private school desperately want to get support for their child do my hon friend agree that it be crucial if the government insist on pursue an ill thought through policy that impact on child with special educational need that all child with diagnose educational need with or without an ehcp and those eligible for disability allowance should be exempt from that vat would rather the government do not go through with this policy at all and drop it but if they insist on press ahead with it all child with special educational need whether or not they be on the send register they can be identify in other way should be exempt will share story from constituent who contact recently they have two child both of whom have complex learning need and have struggle to thrive in their local state school after move to private school that be well able to support they they be finally make progress and most importantly to quote the parent they do feel like they be fail the child family have make huge financial sacrifice to give they this education include remortgage their home and cash in pension plan as this policy be set to be introduce in the middle of the school year this family and thousand of other have little time to prepare or save it will be disruptive for child who have already suffer enough disruption to their education in recent year this parent who contact tell we be terrified of the prospect of have to uproot our child for second time because we can see way to afford this rise labour rush through and ill thought through plan will snatch opportunity away from thousand of child just like my constituent you reflect on there be an exemption only for child who have ehcp and you mention that there should be an exemption for child who do not have an ehcp base on sen or disability my question be how do you define that there be huge scope for private school to say that they be send specialist there be not measure of whether that be the case how do you define those who have send or those with additional need beyond the scope of an ehcp order may gently say to the hon member that when you say you it be as though have say it want to reassure you that be not involve in any of this mr speaker would not dare to second guess your position on this issue the good way to deal with this issue be to drop the policy entirely but if we be to exempt child with special educational need good place to start be the send register just yesterday be discuss with one of the headteacher in my constituency the number of child on their send register and how they go about identify they school already do that in the state sector to support child we could apply those same rule and regulation in the private sector and those child should be exempt however would rather this policy be just drop altogether for all these reason the liberal democrats do not support end the vat exemption for independent school instead we want to see well partnership between independent school and local state school many already do that and be not just talk about few bursary here and free use of pool there be talk about genuine partnership work and the sort of brilliant collaboration that have see in school in my constituency where hampton school and lady eleanor holles school share staff time with reach academy in feltham they have also be mentor and coach pupil for medical school and other university place and the result have be phenomenal in disadvantaged part of west london where typically student be not go on to further or high education that partnership have bear immense fruit for those young disadvantaged people strip the politic out of this it be abundantly clear that substance aside the breakneck implementation be completely wrong and will throw family child and community into chaos it will also compromise the work of school such as eastbourne college which do great stuff give back to the community as part of the coastal school partnership do my hon friend agree that if this government be to insist on this policy go ahead they should at the very least delay it to ensure that our school our staff and our community be not throw unnecessarily into chaos thank my hon friend for his important intervention as have say before it be good that the policy be drop altogether but if the government insist on go ahead it should be delay we need further provision to exempt all special educational need child and not just those with ehcp those be two critical factor in try to mitigate the damage this policy will do do my hon friend recognise that thousand of child do not have ehcp my hon friend the member for chichester jess brown fuller refer to the deluge that would surely come to local authority in the form of application for ehcp that will be just when because of the legacy of the conservative government local authority be on their knee and can not cope with the level of demand that will far disadvantage the already most disadvantaged child think many of we certainly on this side of the house would recognise the point my hon friend make and many have already make it suspect that quite few people on the government benches would also recognise that this policy will be real challenge because member from all part of this house have be turn out in vast number at any debate on special educational need to discuss the major crisis in our state school provision for send pupil the system be break and it will have further pressure still come back to the point be make on partnership work the sort of exemplary work be talk about benefit child in the state and independent sector and we want to see it become the norm in every part of the country fear that it will be one of the first thing to suffer when school be force to make cutback under the government policy let we remember that most independent school be no eton or winchester of they have few than pupil those small school often in rural place will struggle to absorb this extra cost do the member agree that the policy threaten the viability of many independent school that have charitable status and serve deprived community include many independent school in blackburn such as faith school and those school serve child with special educational need this policy will put those school on their knee and vastly increase the number of space that will be require in public school in blackburn we do not have those space gently say to the liberal democrat spokesperson that you have now be go minute interruption no let finish before you make judgment call do not want you to speak for long than the government minister and we be shortly in danger of do that be sure you will be come to the end of your speech apologise mr speaker be just come on to the last paragraph of my speech but want to take some intervention from those on the liberal democrat benches perhaps the answer should be that you cut the speech if you want to take more intervention may just finish by urge ministers to look instead of damaging and counterproductive tax on education at way to get independent school to do more of that great partnership work with state school and their community and to ensure they be invest in that local community let we ensure that every child no matter their background or circumstance be give the support and opportunity they need to thrive let we support investment in our education not penalise it we come to maiden speech and we be now on six minute limit thank you mr speaker for call to make my first contribution in the house it be great honour to be here be so proud to be part of government who be put state education at the heart of our mission have not be an mp for long but have already spend lot of my time visit school in my constituency and have see and hear for myself the very real challenge that they be face because of the effect of austerity on their budget opportunity for young people be shrink in front of our eye be glad that we be make these decision so that we can invest more in the state education that of our child need would like to talk about the service of my predecessor as mp for north east derbyshire lee rowley constant refrain for when be campaign during the election be how well regard he be as constituency mp which be not always what you want to hear when campaign for the other side but it be clear sign of how well regard he be by his constituent also pay tribute to his service in the house where he serve in various ministerial position with distinction particularly recognise his important work campaign on behalf of those with ovarian cancer be sure that everybody in the chamber will join in thank he for his service it be huge honour to represent my home north east derbyshire will take few moment to talk about what that place mean to and indeed what home mean to for many of my colleague home be where they be bear or where they grow up it be very much the origin of their journey but for and many other like it be the destination as many of my fellow military veteran will know live in over different place over the past year as result of my military service whether that be small officer cadet bedroom in the royal military academy sandhurst keep to the ruthless standard of tidiness that that place demand standard that may have lapse since my first post to normandy barrack in the beautiful city of paderborn in germany or indeed the compound in kabul where serve on operation my accommodation have be varied transient occasionally use as target practice and rarely feel like home so when say that have find my home in north east derbyshire that be because have come home when turn off junction of the and see in the distance the latticework of green field of holy moor know that be home when be walk up market street to have cuppa at the café host or something strong at the three horseshoes know that be home after busy day canvassing when be get superlative chippy tea at new tupton fish bar or bacon cobb at woodhead in eckington know that be home when be cross the bridge over the river rother into killamarsh and see the sign for that village call by its original name please forgive my anglo saxon here of chinewoldemaresc know that be home when crest the hill at coal aston and see before across the valley the town of dronfield with the purple hill of the peak district in the distance know that be home want to say thank you to the people of north east derbyshire for see in the service and the value that they want to represent they in this place repeat the pledge that make during my campaign that will use each and every day here to serve you and deliver the future that know we can have well future base not just on promise but on real progress the work of this government have already begin and there be so much that know will make huge positive transformation for people in my constituency whether that be renationalise railway so that we can be proud of the service they provide again huge reform to worker right and renter right so that we can end no fault eviction or the establishment of the child poverty taskforce so that we can drive down child poverty just as labour government have do before and know we will do again there be much to do and much that be look forward to be part of delivery matter want to speak briefly about why that be and about the effect that it have on our democracy this be subject close to my heart as have mention serve in the military and nobody be so much affect by the decision of this house as my former colleague the decision that colleague sit in the chamber have make and will make will have direct impact on their life those decision could send they to dangerous place to do dangerous thing indeed some of my former colleague in the armed force have not come back would like we all to take moment now to remember corporal liam riley who grow up in killamarsh in my constituency and lose his life in afghanistan lest we forget hon member hear hear it be of deep concern to when see that the number of people vote have diminish over the past few year that so many people up and down the country see politic no long as the mechanism by which we govern ourselves and bring the change that we want for our community but as something do by some other people in some other place for the benefit of some other people it be our duty to ensure that we leave this precious democracy that we have inherit in well place than where we find it and that we show everybody that vote for an mp matter that vote for government matter and that vote for democracy matter that be how we can make the difference in the small town and village that make up place such as my constituency of north east derbyshire finally there be piece of advice that would like to commend to the house over the summer have the privilege of meet clay cross air cadet as take my place in the house commend their motto acta non not word we can all agree that that be good motto to have as member of parliament and indeed for the government excellent welcome the hon and gallant member for north east derbyshire louise jones to her place we need more people in parliament who have service in their heart also thank she for her good comment about her predecessor and in particular for her comment about corporal riley which know my hon friend the member for huntingdon ben obese jecty feel deeply thank she for take the time to do that sadly turn to decision by the government that do not have service to the country at its heart this be cruel vindictive policy that will damage the prospect of child in both state and independent schooling it be particularly damaging also for rural economy which seem to have be entirely overlook in rutland and stamford we have independent school that cater for vast number of pupil particularly those from military family and those with send and what be common to all those family be how hard they work for their child to have the right education for they have receive heartbreaking email from parent who have have to sacrifice the education they have work so hard for one be from mother of twin who be midway through their gcse year there be no space in the state sector for they twin who now question whether they will be able to sit their gcse because of this policy the entire county of rutland have zero available state school space in year and and only three send space rise be the hon gentleman just go to stand or will he ask to intervene will the hon member give way there we go be most grateful to the hon member do she not think that little bit of an apology from she and her colleague for the disgraceful send system that they leave as legacy be merit as people can not get ehcp or support in the state sector and council and cash strap family be turn to the private sector should she not apologise for the legacy that she and her colleague have leave the country be so pleased that the hon gentleman be repeat the line that the whip give he for this morning westminster hall debate be not talk about send it be deeply discourteous to the house to intervene on member with point that be completely separate from the point that they be make he will come to learn that in time as say the entire county of rutland have zero available state school place for year and that mean child will now not be able to get their education ask the minister directly what would he say to year old who be to be force out of their school in january with no alternative place to go and nowhere to do their study this be vindictive policy and it be absolutely wrong want to touch on the contribution to local rural economy in rutland education be the big single employer as say we have school across site in one secondary school in rutland and stamford contribute million to uk gdp it contribute million to local gdp million be pay in tax to hmrc and saving of million be make to local school through school place that be not take some of this school expenditure be on staffing and with the imposition of vat it be forecast to make loss for the first time ever job be be lose when of the budget be staff what do school do cut have to be make in people job more than people locally be employ directly by independent school and that be not to mention those work in the supply chain whether drive bus provide food or flower or work in cafés and shop rural economy do not have many option at the moment and independent school be bedrock for they the economic impact of these job on rural community should be consider in an impact assessment but very much doubt one have be carry out look at the national economic picture the adam smith institute conclude that every child in independent schooling contribute to the public finance the average save on vat make return to the taxpayer of if of independent school pupil leave the government will generate billion through this policy if to of pupil leave the government will generate no revenue if of pupil leave the government will lose billion because they be do something vindictive and wrong do the hon lady agree that people put their child through independent school be pay twice they pay once through their fee and once through income tax if they be remove from the system that will mean less money for education the hon gentleman be absolutely right these parent have already pay into the state school system as if their child be go to state school and they be net contributor to the local education system and the tax system because they have choose to ease the pressure on state school by take their child out this be basic economic and that be why the government do not understand it independent school make huge and optional contribution to the national teacher pension scheme some could choose to mitigate their increase cost from the imposition of vat by opt out of the tps what assessment have the minister make of the impact that this would have on the financial viability of the tps additionally number of independent school in my constituency provide home for child in foster care who would otherwise have no stability these be the kind of scheme they will have to stop that will again result in increase cost and impact on the state sector which will have to pick these thing up it be long stand international norm to exempt education from sale taxis nursery university tutor and other education provider be not include in labour propose vat increase although as per my intervention on my right hon friend the member for east hampshire damian hinds there be toddler tax which any parent with five year old child in nursery school will suddenly find themselves pay it be ironic that the labour party say that it believe in free university education for all yet many who take up apprenticeship or go into work will not go to university why do labour think that all of we who do not go to university should pay for other people to go to university but somehow when it come to this issue we should pay for other there be also question about the legality senior lawyer include lord pannick have argue that this proposal will breach european convention on human right rule on educational choice and access what assessment have the government make of the legality of this policy be already see the damage of this policy in the heartbreaking dilemma face family who have contact for help for some pupil halfway through their exam year there be no place in the state system the request be clear the government must delay the implementation until at least the end of this school year so that child be not disrupt in their education we need to exempt those pupil in year to so they can take their exam without the add pressure of school move we need to help local authority to boost ehcp assessment rapidly and we need to undertake regional assessment of available state school place to exempt pupil who live in area with no availability such as rutland understand that the labour party want to make an ideological attack on education and choice but urge ministers to sit down and think this through the rich will continue to attend private school and absorb the increase cost while family who sacrifice day after day will suffer for those who be interested do go to my local comprehensive and my child go to their local comprehensive but think it be right that we support choice for all tony blair once say education education education urge the minister to listen to the ghost of labour past and to do what be right for all child at both state and private school not what be right for reason of ideological dogma which be what the labour party be currently do day after day rise many back benchers wish to contribute and want to make sure that that happen back bench speech will be limit to four minute and maiden speech to six minute we all love debate but every intervention eat into the contribution of another back bencher so ask members please to be mindful of that refer member to my entry in the register of members financial interests be pleased to speak in this debate be proud to do so for the first time since be put back in my place by the people of bury north returner do not get to be maidens again so will just send my good to my predecessor and his family as be customary there be not much on which we see eye to eye but respect his work and time in office know how losing feel so sincerely send he my very good it will not surprise you madam deputy speaker but speak in favour of this government laser focus on tackle inequality in our education system support labour plan to end the state subsidy of private school and it be right that they pay vat as business expect to pay understand the aspiration of parent who work hard and save to provide for their child can introduce any member to thousand of they in bury north many live in some of the poor ward in the country few could ever afford to pay for private education for their child so do not expect they to pay for the private education of someone else child with state subsidy and their own hard earn money forty three per cent of child in bury north live in poverty and that be concentrate in just three of our nine ward that be an abject failure of the conservative party year in government spike of in as many year we can not ignore grow inequality under this government plan private school will become subject to vat although that present new financial consideration for those school would gently push back on the notion that the cost will automatically mean the same in term of fee rise private school have range of financial capability to absorb some of these cost reclaim vat on supply and service draw on interest from trust fund or asset consider how the fee for the use of school asset by the wide community can contribute to the overall budget introduce fee structure or fee for additional specialist support and join with school in neighbouring area or nationwide to pay for centralised service they will remain free to determine what to do but that be necessary in consider business cost none of this be new to school have meet some of the brilliant leader in our private school sector they be not exclusively innovative but on personal and character level have love meet they and those they teach bury grammar in bury north be one example however as someone who serve as state school governor until recently have see at first hand the budgetary pressure enforce on the school that teach of our child let we take moment to consider the conservative party time in office and what have bring we to this point under its leadership we see an atomisation of our school system zero accountability for multi academy trust the narrowing of the school system the off rolling of child with different ability and many young people leave without the support they need it preside over catastrophic financial crisis for local school and authority try to support child with special educational need while sen family have face immense frustration misery and often obnoxious bureaucratic barrier these parent be force to navigate labyrinthine system in pursuit of service that they be legally entitle to access but that remain hidden from view under lock and key send service be really important to people in my constituency as well do my hon friend agree that we be not anti independent school or private school or the work that they do he be right when he talk about the whole state sector do he agree that this be important my hon friend be absolutely right we be not anti we be for the many and the few conservative members want to remain in their comfort zone follow their election defeat we have all be there but it be the wrong place to be it be right that people pay vat on school fee be at termly governor meeting opposition members will like this when news of the last government bare minimum teacher pay rise come through there be some welcome surprise that the then government have do even the bare minimum that be quickly replace by the hard head financial reality from the business manager they confirm to the same meeting that even with the that have be keep in reserve to meet the contribution they be expect in bury to make the pay rise they would face budget deficit because the teacher would no long be on strike that be right the tories design system where the leadership of our state school have to rely on the unfair treatment of our teacher in order to come in under budget that be the reality that we face and it be their everyday experience there have be no math teacher for year and the leadership have be weigh up whether to buy in multiple teaching assistant for cover rather than science teacher for science if they could find one there be huge amount to do and this measure will only touch on fraction of the legacy that labour must clear

go to the bad school in the area do not get any gcse and when be hand my result the teacher say there you go anderson tell you you never make anything of your life my experience of education be not good but be conservative because believe in opportunity do not have those opportunity as child but believe that everybody should have they there be about child in my constituency who go to moor park school bedstone college or concord college have visit all three bring in vat for independent school will create huge pressure believe that the measure be rush it have not be think through and it will

holiday they do everything they can to give their child the good opportunity in life that should be champion we should not remove these opportunity we should have great state school across our country but if somebody want to work hard and strive and aspire to give their child the good opportunity they can we should not remove that we do that at our own cost grow up my dad be soldier and my mum also serve in the military many of my friend at school move around every two year or so too be soldier and have child while serve in the military know the minister be supporter of the armed force and even the secretary of state for defence have say how serious this measure be for military family in this debate there will be lot of to ing and fro ing but urge the government to take seriously the impact that this policy will have on military family to bring it in as blanket measure will be detrimental we will see people leave the armed force that will be the cost that would not be good way to do this be ask for time can we push this back we have talk about what to do to fill the gap recruit more people and raise the standard of state school will not have happen by january so we need to look for time to bring in this measure mid term do not work the measure will have an impact on special educational need and disability and people who aspire to send their child to private school but what be important to and many of my constituent be military family urge the government to think about that and come to decision very quickly about military family because people be decide whether to stay in the force or sign off our great man and woman in the armed force need certainty that their child education will not be disrupt call antonia bance to make her maiden speech thank you madam deputy

talk our area down will never of course the name black country be for the smoke of heavy industry there have be coalmine steel fabrication metal finishing and nail brick and chain making we be where the industrial revolution start james watt first steam engine haul coal in tipton at the bloomfield colliery today despite everything quarter of all worker in our area be still in manufacturing we may

every family my friend at the tuc work out that if wage have rise in the last decade by the amount by which they rise between and the average worker in my constituency would be week well off that be nearly five grand year more in people pocket in the black country we work hard but force big than any individual deindustrialisation thatcherism and the cruel austerity of these last year mean that good folk there earn less and have few chance and few choice than people elsewhere fully half of our kid grow up below the poverty line in infest in home with damp drip down the wall or in flat make

decline and for progress after all grow up in world where people like could not get marry but now our beloved daughter have both her mama name on her birth certificate to believe in progress be to believe that once again this country can work for work people it be time madam deputy speaker so my final word be to the people of our town tipton coseley wednesbury hateley heath be here to serve you always thank the hon member for tipton and wednesbury antonia bance for her passionate speech think be correct in say that she be an oxford university student union officer when arrive at the university remember her passionate defence of socialism then and have see it again today her daughter sit in the gallery will be very proud of she follow her speech unfortunately however that defence of socialist principle run like thread through the labour party today it should not come as any surprise that this new labour party which be willing to tax some of the poor pensioner in the country have no compunction about tax some of the most needy child in the country shameful act be not talk only about the more than pupil in my constituency who receive an independent education also speak for the many thousand in the state sector on whom this policy will have an impact labour members seem to forget completely about the impact on the state sector as walk along firgrove hill in farnham during the election campaign meet father who have just hear that the independent school to which he be go to send his two child have close that be in july and there be no place at the local state school weydon fabulous school even if it have space however that father would not have be able to send his child there because he have not send his child to feeder school so even if there be place not all child can get in this measure will have massive impact on education for those with special educational need and disability there be independent send school in my constituency include more house fabulous boy school jonathan hetherington the headmaster have speak passionately about what this policy will do to his school of his pupil be on an education health and care plan which mean that will be affect by the tax what will happen to those pupil for one thing they be likely to drop out immediately because their parent can not afford it perhaps they will then apply for an ehcp but it will take many month if not year for they to get it and they will be out of education during that time it be total disgrace equally importantly when they get the ehcp it will add massive cost to the local authority which be already overstretch the simple fact be that independent send school be save those authority money we also have to realise that independent school be huge employer certainly in my constituency in june during the election campaign knock on door in an area that be not affluent in fact it be the most deprived part of my constituency the gentleman who open the door inform that he would be vote conservative because of labour potential policy on this matter when ask he why he say that he be groundsman at one of the local independent school and fear for his job because the school be likely to close so this policy affect the economy as well if education be not charitable purpose and if educate our child be not fundamental principle that we in this house should support do not know what we be here for labour need to review this policy and scrap it as soon as possible you might imagine madam deputy speaker that member of the conservative party would understand how out of touch they be on these matter give that they be so roundly reject by the electorate in july however unsurprisingly they have demonstrate perfectly that nothing have change and it be business as usual as they leap to the defence of tax break for private education this government believe in equality of education for all our child and this policy be design for the betterment of of the uk school population only of child in the uk go to private school far small proportion than in the most recent conservative cabinet of which it be believe be privately educate perhaps that tell we something about why we be debate this matter today conservative members campaign against the government policy couch it as an attack on the aspiration of hard work parent perhaps they need to be remind that the warehouse worker cleaner shop worker carer nurse and teacher in my constituency be also aspirational for their child they work just as hard to provide the good opportunity for their child it be offensive in the extreme for the conservatives to suggest otherwise and to suggest that they be less deserving of support from this government accept that consequence of this decision may be that some people will no long be able to send their child to private school as school might choose to recoup the cost of vat through increase to fee however we should acknowledge the fact that private school have implement above inflation increase to their fee year on year in recent time over in real term since and this have have minimal impact on child move into the state sector say directly to parent should our ambition not be that they could send their child to fantastic state school that have the teacher and resource it need to deliver the education their child deserve and where they can excel both academically and culturally by mix with child from wide range of background and experience that reflect the society in which we live the conservative party be quite keen to promote and exacerbate two tier approach to the education of our child during its term in government system in which it be only state educate child who have to accept tough choice and shoestring budget we have school where the ceiling be prop up by scaffold school where teacher be force to buy basic school supply out of their own pay packet and school where the workload and condition have become so dire that teacher be leave in drove be delighted that we now have government who do not believe that state school alone should be ask to make difficult choice government who will end the tax break for private school and invest the billion that that choice will generate into our state school which educate of our child that be why will be vote against the opposition motion and in favour of state education call john milne to make his maiden speech thank you madam deputy speaker first would like to pay tribute to my predecessor sir jeremy quin who represent horsham for the last year he be dedicated mp and in my first couple of month have hear praise from many constituent for his past help an mp good work be often unsung and behind the scene and intend to continue his campaign on issue such as child trust fund would have to go back very much far to find fellow liberal mp to year to be precise be rock solid safe seat in first past the post system be not great for democracy so many people have come up to since the election and say it be the first time their vote have ever count horsham turnout be over and if we have proportional representation we would see that level of engagement everywhere for most of my life work as creative director in advertising before become local councillor five year ago would especially like to thank my family who be up in the gallery today for support in this unexpected career change because this be huge journey for all of we not just most of horsham be open farmland with patch of ancient woodland and village that retain strong sense of community horsham town itself be pretty enough to be charming but not so temptingly chocolate boxy that it get overwhelm by tourist as the name suggest horsham be once home for horse trading and to this day it be centre of excellence in the equestrian industry horsham be also where our great national poet percy bysshe shelley grow up with luck we will see he around town again soon if fundraise for statue in his honour be successful we have high achieve school both state and private and we want to keep it that way many of they have approach with concern over the vat imposition although horsham have never be the site of major battle it be where the dalek invasion of earth start through the work of ray cusick the bbc theatrical designer and long term horsham resident but perhaps the jewel in the crown of the constituency be the knepp estate the uk lead rewilding enterprise which now have international fame this be no frozen museum of conservation it be living breathe experiment in flora and fauna where nature herself be the key architect of course horsham be not immune to national challenge from creak health service to cut in public transport and crumble road but today want to focus on the positive horsham be great place to do business it be hard to believe it now but horsham be once centre of england iron industry later we become lead brewery town and today that tradition be carry on by energetic start up like hepworth weltons kissingate and brolly brewing which rather enterprisingly come up with lib dem brand beer during my campaign we be home to creative assembly one of europe large video game designer schroders world class investment company and innovative tech business like metricell which might one day help we solve our pothole problem that would surely be worth nobel prize whereas many high street have struggle horsham be bustle shopping destination for not just local resident but visitor alike urge member to join we at the carfax bandstand on friday evening in the summer where the district council have pump new energy into the town with series of free event theme on everything from ska abba pride and bollywood to german oompah music after quietish first year horsham be learn how to party whereas other community have be lose their local theatre our be get multimillion pound investment to help the council reach its net zero target after the last revamp under the tories the theatre reopen with that surefire box office attraction an evening with ann widdecombe wonder if she be still available as constituency that be now half town half rural horsham play lead role in strike balance between compete need we have large area of productive farmland make valuable contribution to food security but the same land be under pressure to provide housing and renewable energy installation all of these be positive thing but the same land can not do they all at once if there be one thing would like to focus on during my term it be housing strongly support the new government house building ambition but be surprised and disappoint to see that they be use the same flawed system to fix local target as before except with big stick the standard method as use since have be show to be hopelessly inaccurate way of assess local need nor will it ever make housing more affordable in horsham the average price of new house be high than that of the exist stock so the more we build the high our target go the exact reverse of what be suppose to happen horsham already have unbuilt permission we will be force to continue build house that people can not afford to satisfy local need that do not exist while heap further stress on to already overload local service and then we be surprised when people say they do not like it just to make thing more complicated horsham have its own unique challenge know as water neutrality which restrict water use for environmental reason we be catch between two government directive that completely contradict each other one rule say we have to build fix number of house per year but the other rule say we be not allow to build any house at all because we can not use any more water without damage the environment we be be punish for fail to build the house we be not allow to build this be planning system devise by kafka not beveridge for all the challenge would like people to see horsham as place of opportunity for everything that be go wrong something else be go right it be huge honour to represent the people of horsham one that never expect to have as someone who campaign on promise to serve as constituency mp could not ask for well constituency to work for to make sure that we get in as many valuable contribution as possible back bench speech will now be limit to three minute please be mindful congratulate the hon member for horsham john milne on give such passionate speech about his constituency he speak so eloquently about opportunity but need to speak about the shocking reality in our state fund school the gap in outcome between disadvantaged student and their peer be at record high and school absence rate be at record high we have send crisis child mental health crisis and teacher recruitment and retention crisis with year experience of teaching and work as deputy headteacher in state secondary school have have to manage the struggle that school face day in day out child have see more non specialist in key subject area reliance on cover teacher class size increase and school staff burden with excessive workload all this have have negative impact on learn and on child simply enjoy school despite the heroic effort of dedicated teacher and support staff but the damage be not limit to school it spill out beyond the school gate into the wide community there can be no deny the need for great investment in the state education system and it will be this new government priority to fix the damage cause by year of conservative neglect it be important to start by say that this entire policy be dogmatic and root in the politic of envy that really be self evident it come from self serve socialist government that be ignorant and blind to the harm that it will lead to for family up and down the country in the time that have would like to pose series of question directly to the government this be not only bad policy there have be no information on its implementation and what it mean for private school and state school that have be raise by shadow front benchers and think we should get some transparency would like response later on when the minister respond would also like to hear the detail of the cost cause by add vat to school fee and the cost of the removal of the business rate exemption the house have right to hear where the impact assessment be what the fiscal projection will be and what the cost will be across every government department that be affect that will be the department for education but also the ministry of housing communities and local government because it be local council that will continue to pick up the cost put question about this next matter directly to the exchequer secretary who be also in the westminster hall debate this morning we know that legal action be come and think that the government should fess up and tell we what percentage of the dfe budget will be put aside to fund the legal challenge there be parent out there who be so unhappy about this we meet some of they this morning and they be adamant that they will pursue legal action there be many other question such as about justification and the implication for local authority but think the point about send be important the house of commons have publish note that say that for the previous government have be increase send funding to over billion in real cash term be that funding go to go up under this government in anticipation of the implication of this policy for child with special educational need that could include grow demand for education health and care plan local authority be fail and many of they be labour authority some of they have go bankrupt as well in recent year there will be an impact on state school as they will have to accommodate additional pupil we need some honesty and transparency around this class size be go to increase in state school how be that go to increase the educational outcome of child attend state school how be that go to raise the bar and increase standard in state school we all believe in good educational outcome for all child across the entire country and we want our education system to be first class and to serve all child but fundamentally this be just an ill thought out policy that will have more cost associate with it and devastating impact for child attend independent school ask the minister in his summing up to show little bit of recognise the implication for these child labour members be giggle but actually this be about child and about the impact of this policy on child whose education will be affect it be privilege to follow so many excellent maiden speech today be glad to have this opportunity to talk about school and education because there be no doubt that school face very real funding constraint in my constituency there be state school that have be force to let staff go because the funding just be not there the institute for fiscal studies calculate that after school specific inflation have be deduct per pupil funding rise by in primary school over the last year and that spend shrink by in secondary that compare to real increase of between and over the precede year figure release in response to write parliamentary question show that over the last five year per pupil funding in birmingham grow less fast than in the west midland and across england as whole in fact while per pupil spending will have rise by just under between and cpi inflation will have increase by about in other word this be real term cut of around or loss of around for each child some of the school in my constituency have some of the high pupil premium rate in the country these be not just statistic they represent loss of opportunity loss of skilled and dedicated staff and the overcrowded classroom that flow from that at this point draw the house attention to my declaration in the register of members financial interests and my background as an officer of the gmb one of the union that represent school support staff there be much for school and parent to welcome in this government approach include end single word inspection judgment fund free breakfast club reuse space from fall pupil number to create new early year provision commit to new child poverty reduction strategy the first since the child poverty act be repeal and reinstate the school support staff negotiate body it have be welcome in this debate to hear the concern for school support staff role in the independent sector be sure that will extend to the state sector and hope that we will see cross party support for that measure want to make point around send the motion would exempt all child on send support from the vat policy but send support status be determine within school and school in the independent sector do not have the same budgetary restriction as state school which be oblige to set aside nominal send budget there be real risk of create false incentive as the today programme investigation demonstrate ours be the right policy and this be the wrong motion look forward to vote against it later today one in four pupil in surrey go to an independent school include more than pupil in my constituency and many of those pupil have special educational need we have have an increase rise in the diagnosis of condition such as autism the proposal be be pitch as fundraising measure but do not think anybody on the labour benches come into parliament to raise fund from pensioner in poverty and family of child with special educational need will come on later in my speech to whether this will raise any money at all in his wind up hope the minister will address this point what justification can there be to an immediate exemption of specialist school from the tax on september opposition members represent surrey constituency write to the chancellor to make that point in response to survey in my constituency parent respond of parent with child at independent school say that they would have to consider send their child to state school some speak specifically of the anguish they face have spend year try to find the right placement for child who might have adhd or autism and have finally get they settle now have to consider move they again some labour members have ask why those child could not be serve by the state sector we increase funding for the send sector by over the last few year but you can not magic up place overnight teacher at moon hall in reigate say that of their pupil be on ehcp and be not and that all those child would suffer the other point be that the state sector will have large class size so rather than improve the state sector all child in the state sector will suffer they will all have bad outcome the secretary of state for education should care about outcome not ideology but it be clear that she do not because we have see teacher union warn about the impact on the state sector the government have not publish an impact assessment accord to the institute for fiscal studies report that member have be quote we do not know how much money will be raise due to the uncertainty over child with special educational need appeal to all labour members to ask themselves and their conscience why we can not exempt child with special educational need from this tax it will not raise any fund it will increase class size in the state sector and affect the outcome of all child it must be reverse fourteen year of conservative chaos have leave behind trail of destruction in our state education system which be use by of our child be it not time that we put our effort into improve the state education system when knock on door before the election one of the main question be ask be where will we get the money to put right everything that have be put wrong by the last government leave aside the billion shortfall we now need to find extra money to recruit extra teacher to provide extra nursery breakfast club and mental health support in our school and to make all the other positive change that this government intend to make to create opportunity for all my hon friend have already highlight the thing we need to address in the state education system ultimately private school be business that have enjoy an exemption from vat be charge on their fee and it be now time to end that exemption have three private school in my constituency and have have meeting with the two that want to meet have have discussion with parent from those school it be fallacy to suggest that lot of student will leave their private school to go into the state education system have be ask whether this government have consider the timing of the policy implementation to reassure parent believe the exchequer secretary to the treasury my hon friend the member for ealing north james murray confirm that he have give due consideration to that point there appear to be two part to this debate ideology and practicality fair play to the labour government when they come in they say that they intend to introduce this proposal they tell the public and put it in their manifesto for which respect they that be important especially when compare with their policy on winter fuel payment but it be hard to see how it be not ideological when the secretary of state for education have tweet our state school need teacher more than private school need embossed stationery our child need mental health support more than private school need new pool our student need career advice more than private school need astroturf pitch this reek of prejudice and propagate class war and be sorry to say that the secretary of state be not here to defend her tweet she be decent woman and would like to think that she would apologise as say this be manifesto commitment and the labour government have mandate to deliver it but they also have mandate to deliver it in way that take the impact into account in response both to today debate and my question to the leader of the house we have hear that ministers have see an impact assessment if they want to champion this plan why not share the information with everyone one private school in my constituency that will be affect dixie grammar school have simply ask why can we not see what the impact will be that be not an unreasonable question as say to the minister early child be at the heart of this do not see the rush to implement this policy in january the prime minister put his child in an apartment because he be worried about the impact on his child education respect that decision but do he not see the problem with implement policy that will have exactly the same kind of impact by tear kid out of their school mark my word it will happen that be what the two private school in my constituency have say where be the report address the impact on their education in my constituency the big problem will be that we do not have the school place for pupil who move out of private school what will happen then we have not hear how this government will deal with that and that be the fundamental issue how will child and family cope the prime minister insulate his child but how will the government insulate the nation child be delighted to take part in this debate as be always grateful for the opportunity to praise and defend our public service particularly our state school and the million of people include the vast majority of my constituent who rely on they the opposition motion regret that the government have decide to impose vat on independent school fee well regret that the last tory government do all they could to deliberately and carefully dismantle defund and destroy our public service include state school for there be huge amount that could say but we be push for time and many member want to speak include lot of government members know there be more of we every day indeed there be lot that deserve to be say about our school we have hear many conservative members ask about the impact they suddenly care about the impact of decision make in this place but where be their talk of impact over the past year in st helens north of school have have real term funding cut since over million in real term or for every pupil where be the consideration of impact when the last government cancel labour building schools for the future programme and watch our state school crumble where be the talk of impact when the last government preside over send system that be fail over million child and that their own education secretary describe as lose lose lose where be the concern for impact when standard fall which they do will the hon gentleman give way no be push for time where be the consideration of impact when the inspection system do not and do not work for parent school or pupil where be the consideration of impact when child poverty increase where be the consideration of impact when the lack of investment in school support staff and basic resource mean that teacher be buy resource for their pupil where be the consideration of impact when we have recruitment and retention crisis among teacher we could talk about all these issue if the conservatives truly want debate on school but they do not they could have use today opposition day debate to talk about these thing but instead they have use their time to talk about our decision to end tax exemption that benefit only the wealthy they show no concern whatsoever for state school over the past year and now they be apparently concerned about impact make it crystal clear that the parent of state school pupil be every bit as ambitious loving and hard work as those who can afford to send their child to private school stand with they and stand with our state school other have talk about the effect on child of military family and on child with special educational need as well as the impact on friendship mental wellbeing job in both state and private school and the bursary but will focus on student in exam year declare an interest as have three child in private school one of whom be in her final year this measure be wrong but it be especially reckless for those in exam year we have hear lot about the step the prime minister take to ensure that his son could study peacefully to give he the good chance in his gcse why do he not want the same for all the other child in this country the measure be not only disruptive but potentially impossible local to my constituency stamford school offer level russian lincoln minster school offer level chinese and oakham school offer the international baccalaureate how could those child move into state school that do not offer their course even if their course be offer the timetable might not work and even if the timetable work the school might not teach the same period and text for example student at nottingham girl high school study the russian revolution as part of the aqa history curriculum might have to move partway through the year to branston academy which be teach the tudors under the ocr curriculum what should child take such course do should they change course merely month or even week before their exam should they try to learn the material themselves should they resit whole year of school will the government provide state school with the extra resource to help those child complete their course if they intend to do so will those resource be ready and available to the state school those child will be force into for january want to talk briefly about bursary go to state primary and state secondary school when be teenager hike with my parent in the north york moor meet young lad who tell all about the cool exciting school he go to where they do lot of outdoor stuff say would like to go there that would be really cool my parent say that far too expensive caroline we can do that then read about the scholarship they offer be very proud and please that gordonstoun school offer the opportunity to study at the sixth form there will always be intensely grateful for that the measure propose by this government will reduce the amount of bursary support available to student like and those currently receive bursary which enable they to get the education they wish for school will have to cut back the most obvious area in which to do that will be in their charity work the extra teaching staff they offer to pupil in state school and the facility they make freely available to state school this be short sighted measure focus entirely on the politic of envy and division last week have meeting with group of incredibly dedicated and determined woman in my constituency all of whom have child with special educational need we discuss the broken send system and what it will take to fix it would like to share their top three point first the woman say that when they chase for an assessment diagnosis or school place they be make to feel as if they and their child be problem when all they be do be try to ensure that their child get the same support and acceptance as any other child one lady say she be treat like criminal this mentality towards send child and their parent have to change secondly these parent want their child to be able to go to their local state school in their community but they feel that school have very limited understanding of their child complex need let alone an ability to manage they one mum tell about her child be exclude from school because their complex need be treat like behavioural problem however know for their part that school do not have enough staff or training to cope thirdly these mum be sick and tired of the lack of accountability in the system school be not be hold to account for the way they manage and incorporate send child into school local authority be not be hold to account for their service and home to school transport provider be not be hold to account for how they look after the child the fact be that the support system for child with special educational need and disability be break the answer lie in both funding and reform of the system we have to make tough choice on where to find that funding tough choice that the previous government duck rather than political point scoring we owe it to all the send child and their parent carer and teacher to work together and do everything in our power to fix this system as quickly as possible from listen to contribution make by member from across the house it be clear that these measure represent ideology over reality the policy be economically illiterate new consequence and implication be be discover by the minute and it will make bad every problem that government member say they perceive in the state system they keep say that they need to find more money to fill the black hole that they have magically find yet the headline show that they keep find billion for pet project every week be recently ask to go to public meeting with over concerned parent in my constituency listen to their story and hear about their circumstance from that evening alone before we even get to this debate it be clear that this policy be an ill conceive disaster wait to happen some child in fylde attend independent school hundred of whom receive provision for send school include aks lytham and kirkham grammar as well as small specialist independent school be major employer and have be at the heart of local community for generation the parent of the child at those school be often not rich they scrimp and scrape take on extra job miss holiday and do not buy new car because they have make personal decision about their child education every parent should have that right and should not face tax on the education of their child the idea that such parent be all just rich and can take the hit or that the school spend of their income on embossed stationery and swimming pool be simply nonsense this policy be fight the class war of the past with the future of the child of today lancashire county council have already say it can not get close to meet the forecast increase in place that will be need even before we get to the most acute send provision this tax on education will not just hit independent school some of which be already face closure it will hurt the state sector more say this as someone who be proudly educate at state school the policy be clearly the politic of envy do badly so much for the suppose grow up be back in charge for the record my wife be special educational need co ordinator in local authority school and one of our child be in receipt of an ehcp have hear account from parent and see at first hand the decision local state school have have to make to cut their budget teacher and staff have to subsidise classroom equipment make cut to the curriculum and mix year group to reduce teacher number which have an impact on child educate in the state sector in my constituency conservative members would do well to spend their time understand the real issue on the frontline and the impact that their decision make over the past year have have on my constituent in bexleyheath and crayford the ofsted area send inspection of the bexley local area partnership last december find widespread systemic failing lead to significant concern about the experience and outcome of child and young people with special educational need disability send the report conclude overall the voice of child and young people be not hear well in bexley the task of fix that lie with the bexley local area send inspection partnership and range of partner include our school at the same time because of the pressure in our school bexley conservative control council find that the only way to stave off bankruptcy due to its significant high need block overspend be to agree safety valve agreement with the previous government report to bexley school forum last week outline that it will undoubtedly be very challenging to succeed in both deliver the mitigation already envisage in the safety valve agreement the impact of which be assume to accelerate in and also in identify further realistic cost reduction to deal with the current level of overspend it say that the deficit at the end of this financial year be expect to exceed the safety valve assumption by while this unholy mess have be unravel impact the most vulnerable child in my constituency be shocked to see return publish in the electoral commission register an independent school in my neighbouring constituency but within my local authority area make financial donation to local conservative association be afraid that that sum up the sorry state of where we be while conservative members preside over year in government deliver position where teacher and parent teacher association be fund basic provision in our state school an independent school clearly do not find itself in that position as it be able to donate part of its profit to the local conservative association be clear in my election campaign three month ago that would support the policy to introduce vat on private school that be the mandate give to across bexleyheath and crayford for the reason outline will be oppose the motion today and support the government my child have be educate in both the state and independent sector speak early in the westminster hall debate about how labour plan to impose vat on independent school be tax on aspiration but it be also something else lack of understanding of how to govern the government education tax be not just lousy decision it be lousy plan as have already be say impose the vat in january the middle of the school year risk disrupt child education and force mainstream school to accept mid year student it deny parent time to prepare and do not allow independent school time to register for vat family of more than pupil study at independent school in the london borough of bromley and my constituency must find up to more per year to protect their child education or take the gruesome decision to remove their child from their friend and the school they enjoy even at crucial moment such as gcse and level year be that really what the government want one concerned parent tell that with their child just two term away from their gcse and level find local state school with the capacity to take they on and that be study exactly the same exam board would be impossible in truth the government have no idea how many pupil might leave the institute for fiscal studies which the government rely on estimate that up to people would leave independent school but it admit that there be too little evidence to be sure and that the situation be uncertain in the independent schools council estimate that if this change be impose pupil number would drop by more than over five year whatever the number it be safe bet that this will be slow burner with some pupil force out immediately other leave after exam and those who will never enrol result in year of uncertainty for school their staff student and teacher as many small school will simply wither away even moderate number of exit threaten to close small independent school the likely result will be few pupil few school and more significant pressure on mainstream school this be reckless recipe that will disrupt the education of pupil with special educational need pitch parent against council and burden mainstream school when the labour party say that it would not tax work people we have no idea that its target be child and pensioner this be ideological not practical and it will impact far more pupil than the government will admit to or recognise let we be clear in few short week when child up and down the country will be say goodbye to their friend when they will be struggle with the anxiety of be force to go to strange new school and when through no fault of their own they will be suffer academic pressure in an exam year it will be the result of government policy as one headteacher say to this policy be nothing short of cruel be new to this place indeed until july be teach at an independent school hon member oh indeed to all those opposition members who repeatedly say that this be policy of spite that this be an ideological attack that this be envy and that this be cruel and vindictive say that it be nothing of the sort this be about fairness have friend and former colleague who be right now teach in the independent sector in fact they be minute into period six as speak when someone run private business they pay vat we believe in pay our taxis interruption the hon member for boston and skegness richard tice make the point about charity will say the same thing to he that say to my former boss charge somebody year for an education be not charitable act education be charitable endeavour the hon gentleman be briefly the candidate in my constituency give the result it be rather shame that he do not continue to be so as understand it the opposition could have table motion about anything for today they could have table motion about the crisis face child in social care slowly bankrupt local authority such as mine they could have table motion about child poverty which result in hartlepool child not have bed to sleep in tonight they could have talk about the scandal of child arrive at school hungry the cut to our further education sector the drop of third in our apprenticeship and the school cut that have cost hartlepool school million in real term since but no they choose to talk about this the removal of subsidy that the pay for the who want to send their child to private school it be wrong and the myth attach to it be ridiculous do not have the time to go into the many thing that would like to say but want to finish on one simple point be sick and tired of hear people talk as if the parent of aspiration and the parent who work hard be only those who want to send their child to private school all parent aspire for their child all parent work hard for their child and we stand up for all parent and all child in this country it be pleasure to follow the hon member for hartlepool mr brash would just mention that be the child of aspirational parent from working class background there be three little word utter by tony blair that give lot of my family faith that an incoming labour government would be good government those word be education education education now those same people tell that they be disappoint in labour government who be go to tax education let be clear about this charitable education be not about the child in the school it be about the child who be not at the school it be about open up the facility to the community which be sure the hon gentleman know and it be about serve the community that be where the charitable status come from know that because my child be one of the who go to an independent school the hon gentleman talk about allegation of vindictiveness and ideologically drive policy they be come not from those on the opposition benches but from the hundred of email that we be get from our constituent our constituent be worried about how they will get their child into state school and the parent of child at state school be worried about what be go to happen to the resource at their school when it have to cope with the influx of child from the independent sector every year to of child in edinburgh go into the independent sector figure produce by the labour lead council just before the general election show that by the end of this decade school will be over capacity without any influx from the independent sector we have problem in education but this be not the solution to it it be especially not the solution in scotland be not go to preach to member about english education we have have year of damage and mismanagement of our state sector in scotland from the scottish national party to parent in scotland now it just feel like the labour party be join in there be one big flaw in this the minister say early that the money will go back into education but parent in scotland would like to ask how there be no mechanism it be reserved tax and education be devolve even if the government could come to some agreement with the snp how will they ensure that place for the child in edinburgh in independent school be available in their catchment area how will they make sure that they will be study the right subject and how will they do it by january it be just five month before they disrupt child education have listen to lot of people here today say that every child education be important yes it be every parent have aspiration for their child yes they do and every child deserve not to have their education disrupt with just five month to find solution that be not fair thank you madam deputy speaker for give the opportunity to speak in this debate find it incredible that after year and an abysmal record on education conservative members want debate on education but somehow be not surprised often joke that if they have the opportunity they would blame teacher for the sinking of the titanic although be tell that they have actually do so recently as former teacher see the conservative government abysmal record on education at first hand in fact be stand here in this house because of it when the former member for surrey heath declare that the majority of teacher be let down the child that they teach see red know that only those people who don the red rosette could fix the mess create by year of ideological cut between and spend per pupil in england fall by in real term one in eight school be in deficit by the end of and two out of three local authority be struggle to find funding for send provision in their school in of trainee teacher fail to qualify and leave because of the unmanageably high workload have recently speak to several teacher in essex know the profound impact that year of tory mismanagement have have on their mental health but it be bad than that in essex county council first raise with the government the issue of raac in our school and the government say that there be no money to fix it now in the failure to properly tackle this issue have be bear out last week visit jerounds primary school one of the many brilliant primary school in harlow which be currently unable to provide hot food to its child because its kitchen be still close due to raac sir frederick gibberd school in harlow cost million to build and because of the failure of the last government be have to be pull down the education system be break and it be break by tory design labour have plan to fix the education system but it require difficult decision remove the tax exemption on private school be not the politic of envy but it be necessary action which will generate between billion and billion for the uk government to invest in our school to invest in our teacher and to provide the people of harlow of essex and across our country with the good possible education will take no lecture from the conservative party about education let reiterate to the minister the ask that the opposition have in an ideal world we would prefer this policy not to go ahead but the mathematic of this place indicate that whatever the government wish to do they will secure this change should be delay until september that would allow for sensible planning clearly those with send and the child of serve military people or those in our diplomatic service should also be exempt would also like on behalf of many of the school in my constituency that have raise this to know whether vat will be applicable to summer school and other event that be put on bryanston school in my constituency have fantastic relationship with blandford high school unlike the treasury minister who open the debate have no skin in this game be not privately educate nor be my three child but north dorset be not particularly wealthy constituency seven hundred and ninety two job be link to bryanston school the soft power that the school provide in the international environment also need to be take into account bryanston school alone make contribution of million year to the local north dorset economy my ask be quite small in comparison to the ask that my labour opponent would have be make of the government have he win in july because when richard jones the head teacher of bryanston at church husting set out all the good work that bryanston do in the community its contribution to the economy and the job that it create my opponent say he be fantastically interested and would table an amendment to the legislation to secure an exemption for bryanston school so if the labour front benchers could not even convince their own parliamentary candidate in north dorset of the merit of this policy they have signally fail to convince the many parent and other who work very hard to send their child to school in the independent sector my final word be for the secretary of state for education after the terrible tweet that she put out couple of day ago she be the secretary of state for the education of all child irrespective of which sector they be educate in she use divisive word refer to our child versus theirs that be they and we she have aid the government case and argument not jot she be the secretary of state for the education of all child wish she would take her responsibility wee bit more seriously welcome the opportunity to speak about what it mean to have government who will not just talk about opportunity but take action to bring opportunity aspiration and ambition to not just of the population but of our child and young people like my hon friend note that the opposition motion express the conservatives regret over this policy do they not regret year of underfunde our state school do they not regret slash opportunity by shut sure start centre lock stock and barrel do they not regret grow child poverty on their watch do they not regret that more member on their benches have turn out today to defend tax exemption than do to defend their record on the nhs last night be proud to stand here today because this be government who be put ambition and opportunity front and centre in our mission our principle that everyone grow up in my constituency of southampton itchen should have the opportunity to get the good start in life to do well to be ambitious and to be support to fulfil their dream should not simply be the preserve of child in independent school every parent want the good for their child whichever school they choose have have parent who have take the decision to pay for private education for their child get in touch with very real concern which acknowledge that they be not all the super rich and that not all independent school be like the etons and harrows of the world but claim of an exodus from private school to state school be be afraid completely unfounded opposition members should be listen to the chief executive of the independent schools association represent less prestigious less expensive school who have talk about how many might benefit from trading down which mean more student and more income to their school as my hon friend the member for crewe and nantwich connor naismith note there have be above inflation price increase for those school year on year and there have be no diminishing of student number one small independent school that many child in my constituency attend say it have already make plan it have plan for business and they will pass just on to school fee so this be not about restrict parent choice it be not anti private school it be about fairness and it be question of priority improve all our state school to benefit everyone cost money and that be why we can not justify these tax break any more wonder read this tone deaf motion from the opposition what they would say to constituent in southampton where many school have have to ask for donation and where the teacher they do not think deserve pay rise have be struggle we make this choice with no apology want to say from the outset that this be clearly an attack on aspiration an attack on opportunity say to the constituent of the hon member for southampton itchen darren paffey that he vote for winter fuel payment to be slash and now he be vote for an attack on hard work family who will be struggle to make end meet go to state school and an independent school and be grateful for both those journey and the education that receive in both plenty of hard work family will be struggle to make end meet the first point want to make be about tone will come back to the education secretary tweet which be deeply offensive surely labour members must acknowledge it be simple case of math that people who be rich enough to afford vat increase whether it be which be the average or the whole will continue to send their kid to independent school and pay the fee it be the people who be struggle to make end meet or the really hard up family or god forbid parent of child who be on scholarship and bursary who will no long be able to send their kid to those school because those school will have to withdraw those scholarship and bursary as they will be less affordable so the tone of this debate be really important would caution the government to be more reticent on this they refer to tax break these be not tax break education should not be and be not tax and they be about to open that pandora box there have be lot of comment from government members about state school agree standard in state school should be improve they talk about the last year we deliver real term increase per pupil we have deliver record funding about billion they may challenge that but it be pure fact be happy to share those fact we do that and the result of that especially with our focus on thing like phonic which labour challenge when in opposition be that we now have some of the high reading standard in the world independently and internationally rat we also have some of the high rating in mathematic so the government may try to frame this debate as anything other than ideological but those argument be severely undermine by the education secretary tweet which put it out there that this be really class war my hon friend be make great point about how this change be ideologically motivated can he see why there be difference between private school fee which the government have choose to tax and something like kip mcgrath tuition which be also pay for form of education which they have choose not to tax at least yet my hon friend make an excellent speech about the practicality of introduce this change in january and she make an excellent point now about the slippery slope involve the government say that the money will be focus on educational improvement but there be no guarantee of that as it will go into the general pot they promise new teacher which be few than we deliver it be drop in the ocean which will barely make difference to the hundred of thousand of school that of course need extra teacher concede that point we should have well educational standard send will affect every member of parliament it affect be with north solihull parent group just few week ago those parent will no long be able to afford to give their child private education for send purpose and they will now have to rely on the state surely government members can see that that will far increase the burden on state provision particularly if they be right that there be lack of teacher the minister might address this point how do this policy improve state school provision how do it improve the standard and quality of delivery for send parent it be all right for the prime minister to make special provision for his kid and for the education secretary to have benefactor but what be these parent go to do be proud to have go to calder high school in my constituency the first purpose build comprehensive school in the north of england the history of that school and its teacher be fantastic but the building be not after year of under investment in the capital programme and the shameful cancelling of building schools for the future the building be crumble the same can be say for brooksbank school and todmorden high school which be also in calder valley all of they would have be schedule for rebuild soon have the government not cancel building schools for the future in the state sector the problem be not just that the building be on their knee there be also the issue of everything inside the building at the start of the previous government austerity programme we hear about teacher go without item or buy they with their own money glue stick book and so on now when talk to headteacher they talk about go without teacher and support assistant who be so vital for child need we can judge government or indeed an opposition by their priority frankly the fact that the first opposition day debate on education focus on the of student who go to private school show where this opposition priority be if they have hold debate on send would have welcome it because send provision have be leave in crisis in calder valley can point to multiple example of parent for whom advocate for their child have become second job and that be just those who have the resource to do so ahead of this debate ask headteacher what their priority for education would be one who do not want to be name say any therapeutic service be no long easily accessible no educational psychologist no speech and language therapist access for the increase number of pupil who can access the curriculum we need to focus on the next generation in state school in all school that should be our priority if ask my constituent in calder valley what they think billion should be spend on that be the value of this tax break it would not be the of child who go to private school have child at private school government members say that be not problem they say this be not criticism of private education this be merely revenue generation exercise not social engineering or socialist class war it must be coincidence then that this policy punish aspiration pull child down rather than lift they up and be be rush through as we have hear time and again it be socialist red meat policy to placate the labour back benchers who be have the gradual and terrifying realisation that they may well be single term member of this place the government need to think again we have hear serious objection to this policy not to its implementation because the mathematic of this place mean that the government have sufficient support behind they to force anything through however ill advise but we have hear serious recommendation for review improvement and tweak to undo some of the significant damage that this policy unamended will cause introduce the policy on january halfway through the academic year will damage child and child education these be real people some child have already leave the independent sector their education and that of thousand of other like they need to be consider by this government on child who be sit public examination this year my hon friend the member for sleaford and north hykeham dr johnson make brilliant and serious point which should be not cast aside but consider if child study under one exam board be transfer in the exam year to another system what do they do what be the government answer on the subject of pupil who be apply for education health and care plan of pupil at langley school in my constituency be treat for send and only nine of they have ehcp what do those other student do surely there should be delay for pupil who be apply for ehcp we have also hear from gallant members that military family be take decision now about their future in the armed service there be also specialist school for music and dance which be important for the fabric of our community and the quality of life in this country those thing be not offer in the state system do this not far make the case for the government publishing in full their assessment of the impact that the measure will have on school and child right across the country my right hon friend be absolutely right the government have publish no evidence to support their state objective there have be no impact assessment this measure be rush and vulnerable child be pay the price for internal labour politic shame on you fourteen year of tory neglect have leave many of our school on their knee the situation be no well in scotland after year of the snp scotland once world beat reputation for education have be tarnish regularly meet and hear from teacher whose passion and dedication be palpable include mrs boyd and miss mckay the primary teacher at struthers primary school in troon some of their pupil have send individual letter ask to join the fair trade campaign to be the change however over quarter of child in north ayrshire now live in poverty that mean that child be hold back even before the school day begin conservative members have forget about the effect of austerity on constituency such as mine they and the snp be live in their own fantasy have squander reserve through financial incompetence snp run north ayrshire council face million of cut in its upcoming budget the situation have only be worsen by the council tax freeze impose by the snp in holyrood the council now propose cut teaching post between and and remove total of hour of pupil support assistance equivalent to eight full time staff all school crossing patrol one full time post from the music service and one full time educational psychologist that will be travesty for child in north ayrshire and cast further shame on the snp education record in scotland the independent institute for fiscal studies have say that this vat policy will raise more than billion and will see significant additional education spend in england which mean significant barnett consequential for scotland and for the young people in my constituency today generation of young people deserve no less after suffer year after year of excuse this government be not prepared to settle for more of the same family and school in my constituency be deeply concerned about this policy they have contact to underline the pressure that it will put on they many have already start apply for state school place our independent school reckon that about to of their student will move into the state sector as we have hear the measure will have disproportionate impact on kid with send in my constituency roughly child be educate in the independent sector that mean lot of pressure on local state school lot of kid who have their special educational need meet by independent school be now apply for ehcp which mean extra pressure on assessment and provision support all my school be aspirational for all the child in my constituency this policy if enact as expect it will be will cause great harm would like the minister to be able to quote back datum analysis and stat to and to say ben you wrong do worry your silly little head it all go to be fine and here be the datum to back it up but he can not the data be not there because the government have not do the analysis this debate have sadly be drive by ideology about one in five child be educate at independent school in my patch must declare that have choose independent education for my child we will really suffer from this policy the under secretary of state for education the hon member for portsmouth south stephen morgan be good man know that member across the house especially new member who be find their foot in this place be start to think about policy and decision go forward say to they as say to the minister if you can not see the datum and analysis for this policy please ask why please ask for it listen to the conservatives and the amount of fearmongere they do one might think that previous government have totally trash the state sector think that be quite obvious as say school in both the independent and state sector be concern about the policy and the sudden movement of child in the middle of the year into the state sector which will struggle to find they place those child may be study for exam and have already experience covid disruption and the state school that they move to might not have the right course plead with the minister to look at the datum and do the analysis to see if the policy will make money or lose it and to consider the impact on child go back to the brutal bitter word of the consultation document that go out this summer the government understand that move school can be challenging if be child go through my gcse or level and be force to move into the state sector because of this policy the analysis of which can not see because the government have not do it or will not publish it and read those word would say please delay this policy think again look at it and try to mitigate the impact on child with special educational need on armed force family and of disruption during the school year please if you be not go to stop it at least delay it and do the work out congratulate the conservative party on call this debate today for the simple reason that it confirm what many of we already know that the tories be much more focused on the of pupil in private school than they be on the in state education give that the tory leadership contest be approach its exciting climax it be worth point out that state education have get barely mention in that contest so far know it be minority sport but we expect well in the last tory leadership contest liz truss spend her time either criticise her own state school or criticise the right hon member for richmond and northallerton rishi sunak for his time at the year winchester college at one point one of her team say that she will take no lecture in educational standard from an la base goldman sachs banker who go to school for the uber elite meow as my immediate predecessor in rochdale might say david cameron famously go to eton indeed it be michael gove who attack the preposterous number of his fellow cabinet ministers who have be to eton be delighted to say that there be more labour mp who go to my own state school oulder hill community school in rochdale than go to eton my hon friend the member for whitehaven and workington josh macalister and be both proud of that school tie sadly recent prime ministers and even education secretaries decide that the state sector for which they be responsible be not good enough for they during partygate we get use to the tory party think the covid rule be for other people will the hon member give way be sorry but will not give way do not have much time one rule for they another for the rest of we be the tory party approach back then now their approach be one school for they another for the rest of be just as toxic charge the real problem be money there be fall in spending per pupil between and bad of all we have have year of no overall growth in spending per pupil in our school squeeze that the ifs say be without precedent in post war uk history turn back to the tory leadership contest most of the contender for that poison chalice have claim that if elect they will restore private school tax break the fact that the tories plan to make another billion worth of cut to state school on top of their own record of austerity prove that they have not learn thing from their catastrophic defeat at the last election if they all put into state school an ounce of the passion the emotion and yes the hard cash they put into private school the public might start to listen to they again the tragedy of this debate be the vitriolic negativity when all of we could surely unite in our desire to improve the education of all the government could have do something so different they could have say to the independent sector you do well chap can you give we bit of help can you work with we can you share more of your expertise your wisdom your success and your facility in particular can you help with regard to special educational need where the independent sector be do so well at no cost to the taxpayer think that would have gain universal enthusiasm and support will the hon member give way no we be short of time as former governor of an independent school know that that approach would have be welcome by the independent sector instead the choice that the government have make will do the opposite of what they intend it be not go to raise anything like the funding they think it will almost child will leave the independent sector many of whom have special educational need so it will earn almost nothing speak early about the unintended consequence of this policy parent in my constituency have write to she have two child with special educational need at private school and she can not afford the vat so they be go to go into the state system the near place be an hour away so now the local authority be go to pick up the cost of the taxi service of over per child those be the unintended real world consequence of this choice by this government most shamefully of all because there be such lack of capacity in so many area and so many local authority that choice be go to result in big class size that mean more pressure on hard press teacher in the state system at time when we be try to ease that pressure this choice be go to damage the education of many hundred of thousand of child exactly the opposite of what be intend say to the minister and his government that they could choose differently they could pause this policy work with the independent sector and gain much more universal support instead we have legal challenge go ahead as finish ask the minister to answer this simple question if those legal challenge end up in the european court of human rights and it rule that the policy be unlawful will his government comply with that ruling call baggy shanker thank you madam deputy have do it again have be sorry madam deputy speaker but that be my local government background education be the foundation upon which we build the future of our country it open door break down barrier and create opportunity yet today so many of our young people be be leave behind by an education system that be struggle to meet their need labour be committed to change that by drive high and rise standard in all area in our state school ensure that every child no matter where they come from have the same access to excellent education when the tories leave office let we use the word also leave behind trail of devastation across our education system school be leave crumble standard be leave fall and they have the audacity to claim that they have maxe out on support for our child we know that that could not be further from the truth our state school be in desperate need of investment and that be why labour be make the tough political and fiscal choice necessary to prioritise our child future one of the tough yet most significant step we will take be to levy vat on private school and end their business rate exemption by do so we will generate over billion that money will be reinveste directly into the state education system benefit the of child who attend state school it be time to put an end to system that allow privileged few to enjoy tax break while the majority of our child be leave with less fund school and we know that be true what will this investment achieve it will be use to recruit and retain thousand more teacher ensure that every child have access to the quality education that they deserve we will reform ofsted improve our school and provide early speech and language intervention for our young child mental health counsellor will be place in every secondary school because we understand that child wellbeing be as important as their academic success we will expand career advice and work experience give student the skill and confidence to shape their own future we know that this work we need look no far than my own constituency where as leader of the council be proud to introduce the derby promise the city of derby have make order be go to call the front bench speaker at pm that mean that the remain member be not all go to be call unless they choose to make one minute contribution which can not recommend to anyone this be just to alert you that there will be some disappointment have come here today to speak on behalf of the child and young people in my bishop auckland constituency recently spend half day at an independent school in my constituency where speak with the student and have also host they here in parliament find they thoughtful and polite and credit to their parent and the school recognise the role that the school play in my community think it be right that the school retain charitable status which allow it to claim gift aid on donation and to reinvest surplus revenue without pay tax be fully committed to the school and to its fundraising effort that be because want all child in my constituency whether they attend state school or fee pay school to have the good opportunity to develop their talent and intellect no matter their background wish could say the same of conservative members but their action in government tell different story at recent roundtable with primary school headteacher in my constituency hear story of school dinner debt of per school because they be have to feed hungry child hear of child come into school with wet uniform because there be no glass in their window one teacher talk about have to support child who have experience horrific abuse but be not get support through camhs also hear about child who arrive at school behind where they should be because of the closure of sure start on social mobility be it not the truth that the conservatives scrap child trust fund under they sure start centre be close down school playing field be sell off and the education maintenance allowance be abolish apprenticeship be down youth service have be cut by since and there be five year waiting list for camhs decade have be lose because every school budget have less funding per pupil today than it have in be that not the truth here be another opposition member do not like hear it but in the past year private school fee have increase by check hansard to see whether we have debate with they all express their concern for the state education sector and about the impact of that increase but it turn out that when the increase be to make elite education even more elite they be silent see no reason why private school can not absorb the cost the hon gentleman talk about the elite but do he understand the impact of the policy he be advocate which be essentially that the elite the rich will still be able to afford independent education while those who be make sacrifice to be there will be the one who fall out especially those with special educational need be come on to that and if anybody in an independent school be struggle to cut their cloth accordingly as the state sector have do could introduce they to headteacher in my constituency who have have to do that because of cut impose by the previous government also suggest that independent school look at social tariff and other way to raise revenue nobody want to be do this this be not about the politic of envy conservative members have so far oppose every measure that we be take to increase revenue or cut spending and perhaps they need to realise that that be why they be on the opposition benches and we be on the government benches as we try to fix state education which be essential for our child join this debate as the son of educator my mum aunty uncle and grandad be all teacher in both the state and the private fee earn sector and it definitely make for interesting conversation round the dinner table also join the debate represent both state and fee pay school in my constituency particularly the fantastic northampton high school which be part of the girls day school trust network and whose student meet in parliament recently as parliamentary candidate for nearly two year and since my election as the member of parliament for northampton south have speak to countless constituent about our long stand well document and consult on plan to drive up standard in state education do you want to know how many of those parent be actually go to move their kid into state school once have speak to they madam deputy speaker the answer be zero it be right that the government focus on improve educational standard for those child leave behind by the conservatives who leave trail of devastation across education from crumble school to send sector in crisis their legacy in education should see they hang their head in shame when hard work teacher teach assistant and staff reach out cry out for help they do not listen when the independent institute for fiscal studies say that this proposal will raise billion for uk taxpayer they do not listen as my hon friend the member for bishop auckland sam rushworth say when fee pay school raise their fee above inflation through the cost of live crisis over recent year leave family struggle the conservatives do not listen only now when there be political point to score and when embossed stationery be at risk finally they wake up will the hon gentleman give way will not sorry no one in this house want to see the state education sector fail be sure no opposition member want to deprive million of student in the primary state education sector of the healthy nutritious breakfast that they will receive every morning pay for through this policy be certain that all member on the opposition benches want dedicated mental health support in every school pay for through this policy be almost certain that there be those on the opposition benches who want to vote with their conscience rather than the whip so urge member from all party to vote against this political statement and to support the government that the country choose to break down barrier to opportunity it be what our constituent want it be an honour to follow citizen smith over there in the large number of contribution today we have see the importance of this issue and the alarm feel by many member and their constituent about the government proposal be sorry to say that we have also have lot of politic of envy today we believe in evidence base decision making and as many member have point out it be become increasingly clear that labour plan education taxis remove vat and business rate exemption from independent school will not do what be claim will move on to the detail in moment but may first congratulate those who have deliver their maiden speech today thank they all for make gracious comment about their predecessor learn something about each of they today the hon member for north east derbyshire louise jones speak eloquently and lovingly about her beautiful constituency as do my hon friend the member for isle of wight east joe robertson who bring back many holiday memory for the hon member for glasgow east john grady give we all good advice on name child in glasgow the hon member for tipton and wednesbury antonia bance may or may not be aware that we share something in common as we be both student union sabbatical officer although in my case few year early the hon member for horsham john milne give perhaps the most eclectic speech today mention daleks pothole and ann widdecombe all in one speech be afraid that will not be so gracious about some other comment we have hear today from government members who still do not seem to realise that they be now in government and their job be to talk the country up they have constantly talk down not only the country but the education system let remind they that when we leave office education standard be go up and per pupil funding be at record level in contrast when labour be in office we be fall in the league table what brass neck labour members have when we look at labour record in wales we have be back our brilliant teacher and would hope that they would do the same the motivation behind this policy be clearly questionable the impact assessment be non existent and the saving illusory there be so many potential unintended consequence and uncertainty around these policy that at the very least the government need to postpone implementation although it would be well to scrap the plan altogether they be also move away from long hold principle that we use to agree on across the house that educational service be not tax at all it be terrible thing that they be now bring in we have five key category of concern the impact on state school the impact on government finance the timing of the proposal the consideration of exemption and the impact on send and ehcp will not repeat all my comment from the debate we have early but it be so clear that this policy will not only have detrimental impact on the independent school sector but negatively impact the state sector because the imposition of vat hike overnight will mean that some family will no long be able to afford the fee inevitably that will mean child leave the private sector and move to the state system put an additional burden on many local state school some of which do not have the capacity as say this morning it be not fearmongere or scaremongere it be happen already and we be already see it in school accord to some forecast instead of the predict billion saving this policy could cost the taxpayer money how extraordinary to choose this policy area to try to eke out some cash when so many other option be available if the government be brave enough out of total government spending of more than trillion be this really the policy that they want to prioritise on the topic of overall government finance we have not yet hear clearly whether the department for education will get more funding from the treasury if the number of state school pupil exceed expectation will they be expect to pay it out of exist budget have the government set aside capital for additional school space if it be need regard the timing of the proposal many member have mention that it be beyond belief that the government be bring in this policy in the middle of the school year when school be simply not ready for it it be not fair on the independent sector to expect school to get their head around new legislation register for vat and implement new system and process in literally matter of week and before christmas that will not happen we have also not hear whether the government will create exemption or special consideration for all these area military family student on music and dance scheme child attend small school language school or religious school those pay low fee or on bursary and child in exam year who may have to move to another school that do not offer their curriculum what be the government do about pupil with special educational need and those with an ehcp or in the process of gain one if as many predict there be displacement of child with send and ehcp into the state sector be there the capacity for that be there adequate additional funding support plan for local authority to deal with that predict increase in demand wish to make couple of other brief point before conclude as conservative believe in choice and will not criticise choice make by parent about their child education have no qualm however about criticise hypocrisy the irony that stand here as proud product of state comprehensive education defend independent school while the exchequer secretary to the treasury who speak early product of private education be pursue policy that could undermine independent school be not lose on or other many government members attend independent school or send or be send their own child to they and yet they be determined to increase the cost on other deprive many family of the choice they themselves have be glad to see the secretary of state for education now in her place after be conspicuously absent perhaps she will take the opportunity to apologise for the tweet parent who send their child to independent school pay twice for their child education and deserve well than to be treat with contempt by their government education secretary the divisive tweet that she put out last weekend be shockingly ill judge and ill inform sneer and smirk about embossed paper and swimming pool do she really not understand or recognise that not every independent school be like eton or harrow it betray an incredible lack of awareness and poor knowledge of the facility and financial status of many independent school it demonstrate that the policy be be promote not on evidence but on envy and spite ill inform and misplace envy at that agree entirely with what my hon friend have say will he add to the indictment of the secretary of state the fact that she fail signally to realise that she be the secretary of state for all pupil whether they be in the independent or the state sector the divisive language that she use be very rude signal of two digit to those family who take decision that she do not like my hon friend put it well do not have to add to his comment this be rushed and ill judge policy that will not raise the money the government assume it would undermine the viability of many independent school put immense pressure on the state school system and put in jeopardy the education prospect of thousand of student include many with special need we implore ministers to reconsider thank the opposition for bring forward the debate while the focus have be on private school and the implication of the plan tax change it have allow we to consider what be important in education it be important to support the aspiration of all young people and their parent and it be essential that all young people receive good education in safe and supportive environment it be certainly true that many parent choose to seek that provision in the private sector the government will always support their right to choose where to educate their child but most parent do not have that choice and all parent have high aspiration for their child we therefore need to prioritise our effort and consider how we can well serve the of child in our state fund school end the tax break on vat and business rate for private school be necessary decision to drive high and rise standard across our state school and give every young person the good start in life it will generate additional funding to help improve public service include the government commitment relate to child and young people this money will allow the government to expand early year childcare for all by open new nursery thus help parent back to work the government will recruit new teacher and improve teacher and headteacher training as part of restore teaching to the career of choice for the very good graduate the treasury be of course responsible for tax policy and have lead on the publication of the draft legislation and technical consultation since july as the exchequer secretary set out vat will apply to tuition and boarding fee charge by private school for term start on or after january it be right that we end tax break as soon as possible to raise the funding need to deliver those educational priority the treasury be assess the impact of these change in advance of the budget the independent office for budget responsibility will certify the government costing for these measure at the budget and that will also include the interaction with other vat receipt will the minister give way be go to make some progress the right hon gentleman speak early know that many member be concerned about child with send interruption member can shout as much as they like but have some really important point to make about send know speak for the country the right hon gentleman certainly do not assure members that the treasury have seek to ensure that these change do not disadvantage pupil who need provision that be unavailable in the state sector let be clear pupil who need local authority fund place in private school include those with local authority fund ehcp will not be affect by the change that be because local authority be able to reclaim vat when they be charge for other pupil this change should not mean that they will automatically face high fee the government expect private school to take step to minimise fee increase include through reclaim vat incur in supply education and boarding also note that ifs analysis show that the number of child in private school have remain steady despite real term increase in average private school fee since and rise since member from both side of the house mention transfer to the state fund sector there be always some pupil move between the private and state fund school sector approximately maintain private school close every year for range of reason where school do close pupil may transfer to another private school or move into the state sector we simply do not accept in the case of recent closure that this have have any connection to our policy on vat quite simply the evidence do not bear that out the number of pupil who might switch follow these change represent very small proportion of overall pupil number in the state sector any displacement be likely to take place over several year and will mostly come from parent choose not to place their child in the private sector to begin with rather than child leave the private sector all child of compulsory school age be entitle to state fund school place if they need one understand that move school can be challenging experience and local authority and school already have process to support pupil move between school number of member also raise concern about capacity there be always range of pressure on state fund school place and the department for education work to support local authority to ensure that every local area have sufficient place for child who need they that be business as usual and local authority and school already have range of option to increase capacity where it be need we be confident that the state sector will be able to accommodate any additional pupil and that there will not be significant impact on state education as whole congratulate my hon friend the member for north east derbyshire louise jones on her maiden speech know she will be real champion for child and young people in her community also welcome my hon friend the member for bury north mr frith back to this place and congratulate my hon friend the member for glasgow east john grady on his maiden speech he speak eloquently and with passion about his constituency and the need of his constituent it be also real pleasure to hear the maiden speech from the hon member for isle of wight east joe robertson who describe so well his beautiful constituency place enjoy holiday in as child look forward to work with he on issue affect the solent region my hon friend the member for tipton and wednesbury antonia bance give an excellent maiden speech it be evident that she will be strong voice in this place nationally and for her community congratulate the hon member for horsham john milne on his maiden speech and wish he well on his unexpected new role in this place and on deliver opportunity for all the hon member for south shropshire stuart anderson and other mention military family know that colleague in the ministry of defence and the foreign commonwealth and development office will closely monitor the impact on affected military family consider support via the continuity of education allowance scheme small faith school be raise by few member those school meet the need of dedicated faith community often at low cost know that treasury colleague have meet representative from those school to ensure fairness number of right hon and hon member speak about the impact assessment as my hon friend the exchequer secretary to the treasury set out we be consider the impact of the policy and will publish tax information and impact note at the budget in the usual way in conclusion this government be elect to deliver change across our country not least in our school our mission to break down the barrier to opportunity be exactly what our country need this party be show that education be once again at the forefront of national life urge member across the house to demonstrate that by vote against the motion question put the house proceed to division will the serjeant at arm investigate the delay in the

keir mather the house have divide ayes noes question accordingly negative farming and food security beg to move that this house recognise the real and immediate challenge face by british farmer as result of wet weather and rise cost note the importance of food security as an essential component of national security in an increasingly uncertain world regret that the million extension of the farming recovery fund be yet to be pay out be concerned that report suggest the farming budget be to be cut by million call on the government to confirm that the full million of additional farming recovery fund support for those flood million for internal drainage boards to protect agricultural land from flood and storm and million allocate to technology and productivity scheme announce early this year will be use in full and without delay that no reduction to the farming budget will be make and that any underspend will be roll forward as in previous year and to keep farming and food production high on the agenda by commit to continue to host the annual farm to fork summit in downing street continue to publish the annual food security index and appoint tenant farming commissioner and far call on the government to secure the long term future of domestic food production by ensure the good agricultural land be protect from inappropriate development include large solar development by tackle rural crime and by ensure that the next generation can get into farming by protect agricultural property relief give the increase uncertainty in the world with covid ukraine and now the middle east food security be more important than ever and should be see as key part of our national security britain farmer face real and immediate challenge which mean that the government must take action now that be why we have call this debate between october and march england experience the most rain in any month period since record begin in in particular storm babet and storm henk cause significant damage leave thousand of acre under water and land saturate for prolonged period this have prevent many farmer from get crop into the ground and where they have be able to do so their crop have be compromise of course farmer have do their good to respond but recent research from the energy and climate intelligence unit and the agriculture and horticulture development board have suggest that england be head for one of its bad harvest on record the wheat harvest in england alone be estimate to be down more than million tonne which represent an reduction since last year and the total harvest for the five key crop wheat winter barley spring barley oats and oilseed rape be set to be down by over or million tonne on the five year average we risk be increasingly reliant on import and unfortunately there seem to be no relief in sight english county experience the wet september on record and input cost remain high if we do not support our farmer now many farm business say that they be unlikely to survive as secretary of state prioritise food production at the oxford farming conference announce more money choice and trust for farmer increase rate pay under the sustainable farming incentive and announce in january that be introduce new option to well reflect the range of farm in the shadow secretary of state time in office why do he and the government of the day fail to get million out of the door and into farm in constituency such as mine will come on to the underspend because that be one of the key dividing line between the two side of the house after we come out of the eu secure an agreement with the treasury that all the underspend from the new scheme would remain in the department for environment food and rural affairs budget for farmer and for defra at the end of this month in the budget we will see whether the secretary of state have secure the same term for any underspend we know that the previous government make whole raft of commitment that there be no way of pay for so there be no credibility to the suggestion that the right hon gentleman secure something from the discredit treasury that he be under the key question be if that money be so desperately need why be it not be spend as we come out of the european union new scheme be set up include the sfi to support nature and farming they represent shift from the eu scheme under which of the money go to of landowner we be able to design new scheme we listen to farmer and that be why announce at the farming conference an average increase of in payment and more choice to well reflect the variety of farm include upland farm we respond but the point be that underspend all remain within the defra budget the key question which be sure the secretary of state will come to be whether he will give similar commitment to the house that any underspend will remain in defra give that we have just face the wet winter in year and give that in september county have the bad rain on record would add one thing to what the shadow secretary of state be brilliantly say this be matter for farmer in herefordshire as much as for those elsewhere ross on wye rural town be under water as result of the flood do he share my view that the whole ecosystem ultimately feed into the river and into river pollution on which he take such lead with the action plan do he share my hope that the plan will be support by the new government as well as by the river champion that he put in place very much agree my right hon friend allude to one of the key question be ask by many farmer around the river wye what have happen to the million that be announce for farming support around the river wye again there have be so little detail from this government so hope the secretary of state be able to give some reassurance to my right hon friend we also give farmer other support in february we introduce the big package of productivity grant in order to boost the deployment of the late technology and enhance yield on farm we improve protection to prevent the good land from be take out of food production include through the announcement in may on strengthen the guidance on solar farm we respond positively to the national farmers union request through the annual food security index and we host the farm to fork summit in downing street rise know that the clustering of solar farm on some of the good food production land in lincolnshire be live issue suspect that might be what my right hon friend want to address do not want to get into the debate for and against solar farm but even those in favour of they should surely agree that we should not have concentration of acre of they around one town namely gainsborough should the secretary of state not consider such matter in the round and take all the application together the secretary of state should be do that but there be marked difference between we persuade the department for energy security and net zero to strengthen the guidance against solar farm but the secretary of state be be push around by his cabinet colleague the energy secretary have already walk all over he grant permission for whole load of solar farm and allow the clustering that be cause such an issue will give the house an example of how the secretary of state be not champion farming baroness rock be true voice in the department for environment food and rural affairs for tenant farmer and she write the review of tenant farming that commission in previous role in no but it seem that she have be sack or ask to leave the defra board it would be helpful if the secretary of state say why such respected and talented figure have to leave her role will my right hon friend give way will and then will make some progress my right hon friend be talk about the clustering of solar farm but that be not the only problem they be be build on high quality agricultural land which be nonsensical it be and further concern in my constituency be that the consultant who do soil sampling for the developer be often feel to be interpret and grade the quality of soil in way that be not consistent with local knowledge back in may the previous government allocate million of additional support to farmer hit by the wet weather they extend the farming recovery fund to more farmer so that it cover all those affect in england on top of that in march we announce the allocation of an additional million to internal drainage board which be essential to protect agricultural land from flood and storm we now have labour government who neither understand nor care for rural community hon member rubbish they be not so vocal when they launch their manifesto which devote just word to farming there be not single mention of farming in the king speech because the government have make the active choice to de prioritise british farming and food production on the immediate challenge the answer to recent parliamentary question back up what the sector be tell the million of additional farming recovery fund support be yet to be pay out we have just establish that we have have the wet weather for year and that county have have particularly challenging weather yet despite have know scheme with an extra million they have not allocate that much need time critical support the secretary of state need to explain why the nfu say its member simply can not wait any long for the support yet labour seem to want to keep they wait report suggest that the million for the internal drainage board be also on go slow and we need to know why for the long term labour ministers have overrule official to cover some of the country good farmland in solar panel they have reject the plan for bind food security target it have even be suggest in medium report that they plan to cut the farming budget by million indeed it be report that the nfu president have say that his member be be keep up at night by the cliff edge that labour lack of commitment on the agriculture budget be cause the government need to change course they need to give immediate confidence to the sector and show that they care about food security to do so they need to commit to five thing first that the full million of additional wet weather support we announce in may will be pay out in full as the first ever female director of the national farmers union in year think can speak with some credibility here represent tiverton and minehead which include the quantocks and exmoor have to say you have some chutzpah my farmer tell that you sell they down the river say to government members that we need to work together on this because our lot on the liberal democrat benches know more about farming than they do order remind hon member that if they use the word you it mean would never suggest such thing of you madam deputy speaker could not quite spot the hon lady question it seem to be more of statement be sure that farmer in tiverton as well as those around the country want to know why the million that be allocate in may have not be give out the lib dems may not care about that money but conservative members want that support for farmer secondly the million of support for internal drainage board need to be deploy in full and without delay thirdly the million allocate for technology and productivity scheme need to be honour in full fourthly the government need to confirm there will be no cut to the farming budget an issue that be cause so much concern so that we do not lose the million that have be allocate for this year fifthly we need commitment from the government that they will keep the farm to fork summit in downing street they will have the food security index and they will appoint tenant farming commissioner look far ahead the government must do more to give farmer confidence that mean rule out the removal or reduction of the agricultural property relief well protect farmland from scheme for solar and pylon and ensure that food production be central to the land use framework only by do those thing can they show that they be back our farmer and protect food security but sadly fear an urbancentric government simply will not do that not least with labour secretary of state who be currently get push around by his cabinet colleague it be only this conservative team who be and will be voice for rural business rural community and our rural way of life with improved farming production at its very heart welcome the opportunity to restate this government support for farmer who produce the food that feed the nation and protect our beautiful countryside farmer be the beat heart of rural community across the country promote economic growth and stewarde our land food security be national security in our increasingly unstable world be little surprised that the conservatives call this debate after they completely fail our farmer and undermine britain food security after year of tory chaos confidence among farmer be at record low more than farmer and agri business have be force out of business since the conservatives leave lack of infrastructure to protect farmer from extreme weather and no action at all to reduce soar energy cost this government will correct the mistake of the past can the secretary of state give some comfort that the money that be allocate for the action plan for the river wye will be retain even if not necessarily for the purpose that it be create for will he also reappoint the current champion for the river who have so far do excellent work be grateful to the right hon member for his intervention and for the representation that he have make to personally on this issue know that he feel passionately about it and indeed it be very important issue be afraid that we will need to wait until the conclusion of the spending review which be normal practice in government but his word have be hear and his concern recognise farming and food security be the foundation of our economy our community and indeed our environment farmer be badly let down by the previous government who offer only stick plaster to deal with the great challenge face by british farming this government will work with farmer to help they transition to new farming method that be more sustainable both financially and environmentally we will reduce the soar energy price that have hit so many food producer so hard there will be no more dodgy trade deal that undermine british farmer this will be government on the side of britain farmer the secretary of state be right to say that farmer be very important part of the community his leader the prime minister say to the nfu last year that solar farm should not be create by take advantage of tenant farmer this be live issue in my constituency and many other where tenant farmer will be deprive of their livelihood by new solar farm will he stand by that commitment and say quite clearly to his cabinet colleague that tenant farmer must not lose their livelihood by the creation of solar farm recognise the point the hon gentleman be make and thank he for his intervention will comment later in my speech on further support that we would wish to offer tenant farmer do recognise the situation that they be in on september meet representative from my local nfu and whole group of farmer who be desperate to see both the recovery fund money disperse and the support for the internal drainage board will the secretary of state please put their mind at rest in this crisis situation in which they find themselves and commit to make sure that that money do flow talk about the budget we need action now to support those people if what he say about energy security and the centrality of farming to this country be to be more than just word it be regrettable that this government inherit from the previous government flood defence in the bad condition ever record of course recognise that farmer need support but they need long term support not just the stick plaster approach that we have from the previous government we will be look at how we can do that the environment agency have already make million available so support will be available to farmer that be face flooding in the here and now however it be in the spending review that we will look at how we can provide that long term support so that we can give farmer and indeed other business and homeowner protection from the kind of severe weather event that we be see much more frequently due to climate change while the secretary of state explain to the house what he be do and what he will do will he spare thought for the farmer of northern ireland our agrifood industry be shape and control not by the law that this house make not by the law that the devolve parliament make but by the law make by foreign parliament namely the european parliament in more than area of law of which affect our agrifood industry that be how our law be make how be that even approach be democratic and how be agrifood in northern ireland mean to be shape to meet its need if its own representative can not even make or change the law that govern it be very pleased to say that have already have two meeting with the northern ireland environment minister to talk about how we can co operate well to support farmer in northern ireland have also be speak with my right hon friend the secretary of state for northern ireland who share that interest farmer and family across my constituency be again hit by devastating flooding recently do the secretary of state agree that the continual recurrence of these issue highlight the previous government failure for far too long to take flooding seriously can he reassure farmer and family right across my rural community that he will take all the action need not only to mount co ordinate multi agency response in the aftermath of flooding but to ensure proper mitigation in the long term have the pleasure of visit my hon friend constituency and farm there during the election campaign and thoroughly recognise the point that he raise it be little hypocritical be it not for the conservative party to complain that not enough be be do on flooding when their government leave flood defence in the bad condition ever record rise will now make little progress have take quite few intervention and other members want to speak our new deal for farmer will boost britain food security protect our environment and drive rural economic growth by tackle the root cause of the long term issue they face climate change rise price for energy feed and fertiliser unfair supply chain and access to labour we will ensure that environmental land management scheme work for farmer and where funding be allocate for farmer we will make sure it reach farmer end the tory underspend that see hundred of million of pound hold back we will improve these scheme by work with farmer to boost food security and promote nature recovery include upland lowland grass and tenant farmer upland farmer have be leave behind farmer in the upland have be lose their basic payment each year but have not be able to access new scheme we have arrive in office to find no credible plan to address that leave thousand of the most remote and isolate farmer without clear path for their family business or community we need fair approach for all farmer we all understand that my right hon friend have inherit in his department panoply of different crisis from the crisis face our farmer to flooding he be absolutely right that try to get the environmental land management scheme to achieve what be originally intend for it be one of the big issue face britain farmer appreciate it be very early day but what be his sense of what the major failure be right now and what might we look forward to in his plan to sort they out the environmental land management scheme be take the right approach but they need to work well for all farmer too many farmer feel that they can not access they or do not get the support that they need my proposal be not that the government will dictate to farmer how those change should happen but that we should work with farmer in partnership to hear their voice and allow they to influence change to those scheme that will make they more effective in achieve the many outcome that we seek to get from that government funding we will not tell farmer how to farm we will achieve this by work together with they in that new partnership recently meet the tenant farmers association to hear its view about improve support for tenant farmer agree that the proposal for tenant farming commissioner have merit and we will make an announcement shortly our new deal will protect farmer from be undercut in trade deal the conservative government trade deal with australia and new zealand be disaster for our british farmer they be sell down the river as the conservative party allow the import of food produce to standard so low that they would be unacceptable in this country instead of back british farmer the conservatives undermine british farmer we want to see more support for british farmer more opportunity for british farmer not few we have already deliver early first step for british farmer secure access to the us market for uk beetroot grower and to the south african market for poultry producer instead of the botched tory brexit deal that throw up barrier to trade and block great british food export we will seek new veterinary agreement with the eu to tear those barrier down and get our food export move again put money straight into the pocket of british farmer be grateful to the secretary of state for give way second time he talk about the importance to community of farmer particularly intergenerational farmer we understand that consideration be be give to withdraw agricultural property relief in the budget at the end of october will he confirm that that will not happen if it do it would be the end of intergenerational farming in this country understand the hon member point and the importance of intergenerational farming but he will understand that can not anticipate the outcome of the budget process do the secretary of state agree with about the urgency of sanitary and phytosanitary deal and probably of rejoin the pan euro mediterranean convention because of the damage be do to british farmer by brexit border taxis the national farmers union try to warn the shadow secretary of state that farmer be face an existential threat because they can not import the seed they need tomato seed pepper seed and oil seed rape we now hear from port that very few check be be do make mockery of the idea of any food security do my right hon friend agree that when the shadow secretary of state make list of what could happen apologise for the mess they make at the border should be at the top as always my hon friend make an important point very eloquently during the election campaign speak to farmer up and down the country as do before that and have do since who be absolutely furious that have be promise continue access to the european market where they be sell their great high quality british produce they be instead take financial hit as trade barrier be throw up and they could no long sell into those market we want to correct that by seek new veterinary deal with the european union to get export move across the border again we will not allow food producer to continue to bear the brunt of unfair supply chain farmer deserve fair price for the food they produce and we will bring forward proposal to make sure that happen one of the big cost rise affect british farmer have be energy bill we will prevent future price shock by switch on gb energy so we can harness the power of wind wave solar and nuclear energy to keep bill down and take back control of our own energy supply from foreign fossil fuel dictator like vladimir putin the secretary of state talk about the importance of cheap energy solar and food security clearly land need balance what representation have he make to the energy secretary to be clear that the good farmland should not be use for ground mount solar the hon lady have make that point to before and reassure she that even at their most ambitious extent solar farm would not cover more than of agricultural land for farmer climate change be also significant concern the reason we be see such heavy rainfall be climate change that be what be lead to the flooding and drought that be damage farmer if we do not take action to transition to clean energy economy farmer will continue to suffer from thing that none of we wish they to have to deal with as dairy farmer and tenant farmer perhaps have unique experience in this matter obviously be welsh as well and realise that agricultural policy be devolve to wales this issue involve the aftermath of brexit under the eu common agricultural policy wales receive around of the total uk cap budget which be base on our rural lifestyle in wales and farming criterion such as the size number and nature of farm if allocation be calculate use the barnett formula and population figure instead we would have only of the total agricultural budget order can remind the hon lady that intervention need to be short sorry be very new and apologise can the secretary of state guarantee that wales will not miss out on any increase in the uk funding settlement for agriculture and rural development due to the reduced allocation thank the hon lady for her intervention and can reassure she that have have multiple conversation with the welsh deputy first minister who be also the environment minister in wales to ensure that those concern be hear as we go through the spending review process it be always difficult in the couple of week run up to the budget because can not give definitive answer as she will understand but that will become clear once the chancellor have make her statement towards the end of the month we will use the government purchase power to buy more british produce for our hospital and prison again put money directly into the pocket of british farmer crime be another issue that be run out of control under the conservatives and no wonder after they take so many police off our street crime in rural area have skyrocket by almost third since our new deal for farmer will see the first ever cross government rural crime strategy to crack down on antisocial behaviour fly tipping and gps theft issue that have repeatedly be raise with by farmer and people live in rural community will the secretary of state give way on that point if the hon gentleman will allow will make little progress have take up an awful lot of time and be only about halfway through and want to leave time for other to speak it should be of huge concern to every one of we that the suicide rate among male farmer be three time the national average and the high among any sector in the economy take this opportunity to pay tribute to mental health charity the royal agricultural benevolent institution for its excellent work in tackle that alarming and unacceptable situation we will tackle the mental health crisis in our rural community by recruit more mental health professional across the nhs and set up young futures mental health hub for in every rural community after few than day in office chair the first meeting of the new flood resilience taskforce funding allocate to flood defence have be leave unspent for year but we will speed up the construction of flood defence drainage system and natural flood scheme so that we can offer farmer and rural community well protection from extreme weather in the long term member be aware that the government be currently conduct spending review to fix the foundation of our economy after the previous government crash it and leave behind staggering billion black hole in the public what they do be not funny the problem that it have cause british farmer and people live in our rural community be not funny think the conservatives should show little more humility after what they do while that process be live there be little that can say on individual spending area can say however that we recognise the challenge cause by the wet weather early in the year and in recent year that be just one challenge among many for farmer right now few week ago meet farmer in essex who have case of bluetongue in his herd be grateful to farmer for comply with movement restriction intend to stop the spread of that disease we will confirm plan for the farming recovery fund investment in internal drainage board and other grant as we complete the budget process we will also work with farmer to reduce agricultural water pollution from run off and to look at way of improve their nutrient management and the effectiveness of regulation boost productivity in farming be hugely important grant and direct investment be part of achieve that but we need to think big and look for more endure solution the conservatives sell farmer out undercut they with dodgy trade deal with new zealand and australia to return to my right hon friend previous point this government have secure for uk beetroot grower access to the us market worth approximately per year in increase export do he agree that the contrast in trade agreement could not be starker in trade deal labour protect farmer the conservatives sell they down the river happily agree with the point that my hon friend have make the labour party be on the side of farmer the uk have world class science and innovation capability develop new technology and technique for use by farmer and grower will be critical for our food security for business resilience to climate change and for promote economic growth we have set up new british infrastructure council to steer private investment in rural area include in broadband roll out across rural community and in electricity grid to power our growth we be reform the apprenticeship levy to improve rural apprenticeship and skill and give farmer the freedom and flexibility to upskill their workforce and be open specialist technical excellence college to match skill to local economy few week ago the minister responsible for farming and food security my hon friend the member for cambridge daniel zeichner table statement on the previous government astonishing underspend in the farming budget they fail to get million that be allocate to farmer into the hand of those farmer be work with treasury ministers to ensure farmer have the public investment they need and although the financial inheritance from the previous government be appal there be no shortage of positive thing that the farming budget can and will deliver clean air and water food security abundant wildlife and biodiversity and thriving and connected rural community those thing be the foundation of sector worth billion of pound the large manufacturing sector in the country can assure this house that be make the strong case for that funding despite the financial black hole and flatline economy the conservatives leave behind food security be national security and of course energy security be also national security this government will deliver the mandate we be elect on our plan to boost solar power do not risk the uk food security even in the most ambitious scenario less than of the uk agricultural land would be use for solar more broadly there be challenge and trade off land be finite but the pressure we put upon it be increase rise will finish my speech if member do not mind that be why this government will do what the previous government fail to achieve despite repeat promise we will publish land use framework provide more clarity and start conversation on land use and how we can maintain food production restore nature and grow the economy farmer do fantastic job for our country they produce the food we eat and steward our beautiful countryside and they deserve our support but the previous government let they down our new deal for farming will offer farmer fresh start action to cut energy bill action on rural crime action to open market to trade and export and action to cut the appalling level of mental ill health that affect farmer right across our country welcome this debate and the chance to restate this government support for farmer after year of failure change have begin call the liberal democrat spokesperson it be an honour to take part in this debate and to speak not just on behalf of my party but as the member of parliament for farmer from the cartmel peninsula to the eden valley the yorkshire dale the westmorland dale and the lake district for wonderful farmer throughout the length and breadth of westmorland and lonsdale be humble and utterly privileged to be their mp be here primarily not to say how great the liberal democrats be be sure that be self evident but to state how utterly unspeakably valuable farmer and farming be they be valuable for produce the food that we all eat if member have eat anything today they should thank farmer they be utterly valuable in our fight against climate change they be on the frontline tackle that threat and be our good answer to the nature and biodiversity crisis that we have in our land they be the people who protect the town and village near the countryside from the expensive and heartbreaking horror of flooding and who support and protect our heritage and in my constituency in particular underpin our remarkable tourism economy across the country tourism and hospitality be our fourth big employer but in cumbria that sector be our big employer some people work within the industry it be billion economy undoubtedly farming be the backbone the backdrop and the underpinning of that wonderful and important tourism and hospitality economy farmer need to hear that and they need to hear that they be value by this place and by this country because they do not feel that they feel beleaguered yes beleaguer by thing that be beyond our control the weather or the global shock that be undoubtedly cause huge pressure on farmer but also deeply beleaguered by public and government policy we have an agriculture policy mint by the previous conservative government and for the time be at least maintain by this labour government that be base on this be the mad thing have hear myself say in this place and have say some mad thing disincentivise the production of food can we believe that that be literally the case it be policy create by the conservative party and that for the time be at least be be maintain by the party currently in power the consequence be that only of the food we eat in this country be produce in this country have talk to adam day from the cumbria farmer network and he have be report in the farmers guardian so this be an absolutely legitimate figure we have year on year reduction in the number of sheep in this country of if we destock the fell of animal we will soon after destock the countryside of human being it be deep threat to our ability to feed ourselves be follow the hon gentleman remark with great deal of interest do he agree that the vast majority of people in this country give the choice would rather buy british food certainly all the survey that have be do would bear that out however one of the principal problem be the information they be provide with by the supermarket and be afraid the cynical way in which many of those supermarket approach the labelling of food suggest it be british when in fact it be not what do he suggest we do to give consumer who have not yet be mention in this debate the genuine choice they be seek and to help our farmer along the way the right hon member be absolutely right support the nfu call for accurate labelling that be enforceable and he be right to say that to move on if we be lose farm and lose farmer which we be as we speak not only be we lose our ability to feed ourselves as country but we be undermine our ability to deliver for the environment let we not fall into the mistake of think that this be debate between care for the environment and produce food we either do they both or we do not do they at all some of england land mass be agricultural and the figure would be great across the uk as whole if we think we be tackle the climate and nature crisis without farmer we be kid ourselves the green policy in the world will just be bit of paper in drawer if we do not have the farmer on the ground to put they into practice farmer in frome and east somerset like many farmer work tirelessly to produce food for our country however do my hon friend agree that it be vital to acknowledge the role they also play in restore nature and mitigate the effect of climate change and that the government need to support farmer to develop natural climate solution to restore nature completely agree with that and it lead on to what be go to say next which be to praise michael gove the environmental land management scheme create at the beginning of the last parliament have an awful lot go for it and there be actually cross party support for the idea of public money for public good as my hon friend rightly point out will say this we have search high and low for brexit benefit and this might be one of they the common agricultural policy be riddle with all sort of failure some of which have be mention already elm provide the possibility to have bespoke farming and cultural environment policy that actually deliver what we want in the place where we want it and provide environmental good be absolutely part of that however this positive idea with all party support be botch by the last administration there be billion budget for england alone erode of course over five year by inflation and all the shock we have talk about yet even that pitiful budget which be freeze by the last government be underspent by million what do that mean it reduce our ability to feed ourselves as country to restore nature and to tackle climate change we do not spend the money not because farmer do not need it but because of surplus of complacency from conservative party that think the countryside would always vote for it because of lack of care for farmer their family and their community and from fundamental absence of competence my message to the secretary of state the treasury the prime minister and every labour mp be this please do not let the treasury take financial advantage of tory incompetence do not bake in the underspend please secretary of state do not give in to and protect this budget because without that public money we will not get those public good please fight your be pleased to hear he say that he will do so in fight his corner he will be fight the countryside corner and want to support he in that would like the labour party to understand why the conservatives botch the transition and why the money do not get spend one of the few efficient thing that the previous administration do be to get rid of the basic payment on time and without any delay that happen without any problem whatsoever what do not happen at the same time be the adequate roll out of new elm payment in particular the sustainable farming incentive we have stop start approach and many people on historic stewardship scheme for example be simply not able to get into the sfi at the westmorland county show few week ago speak to youngish hill farmer in his mention this particular case because it be so typical of all the other have speak about in my constituency and beyond he say to that by the end of the process he will have lose in basic payment from his annual income he will gain in sfi and by the way that cost he in agent fee that be net loss every year of and that be typical that be why there be an underspend please do not bake it in the secretary of state rightly speak about mental health and in this time of flux and change have never worry more about the mental health of my constituent and of farmer in particular the suicide rate among male farmer be three time the national average the conservative party leave rural community such as mine face mental health crisis close family friend of mine rocky poulson take his own life just four day after farm inspection find that of his sheep be tag with the wrong coloured ear tag leave he face criminal sanction and the embarrassment of that among his friend and colleague order may respectfully suggest to the hon lady and all member she should be sit if be stand that intervention should be short they should be spontaneous and they certainly should not be read out as if they be part of speech be sure the hon lady have make her point she really have and completely sympathise with she and those around she over the loss of her friend the hon gentleman make an important point about young famer and mental health and know there be brilliant project in his patch call grow well do he agree that the young farmer of this generation be very different from those who grow up with who be very much chemical farmer post war this generation believe in habitat and conservation and all they ask for through elms be strategic framework by which they can grow their business in the long term that be the good security we can give they agree with that and thank the hon gentleman for raise growing well at sizergh and tebay and the fantastic job it do in build mental health and connect that with the countryside particularly want people who be not from rural constituency to imagine what it be like in this time of flux and change when people see the money go out the door and do not see it come in typically farmer be male they will be my age or even old than and they will be perhaps the fifth sixth or seventh generation who have farm that farmstead they see the very real prospect of be the one who lose the family farm what do that do to someone head we have hear the horrific consequence and we need to love cherish and care for our farmer and recognise the terrible situation they be in at this moment of flux as past president of the young farmers clubs of ulster think the hon gentleman point be very apt at this moment across the uk of farmer under say that mental health be their big concern it be not only about lose the family farm it be about worry where the next payment come from it be about rely on make that payment and about what they do for the next generation and the one before and after mental health be real problem and be disappointed that the secretary of state do not go into any great detail on that issue hopefully we have establish that we need to care for those who feed we and care for our environment farmer need friend so let mention one potential very important friend the prime minister people may be aware that during the general election the prime minister turn up in my constituency have the claim to fame that mine be the only constituency in the entire united kingdom where labour lose its deposit by the way my labour opponent pippa be excellent and it be nothing to do with she but the prime minister come to the langdale valley in my constituency despite the fact that be blackburn rovers fan be pleased to see gary neville there people will remember the party political broadcast that labour have during the election campaign as well as the prime minister recent speech at the labour conference where he talk about the importance of the langdale valley to he personally grow up and to the development of who he be be move by that as the member of parliament for the langdale valley be grateful to he for say that langdale need friend and this be moment where langdale could do with the most important of friend particularly when it come to spend money will read out some word from hill farmer relate to the prime minister comment about his upbringing in the langdale valley he say that he be move that the prime minister champion langdale so well but he then say that farming community in langdale and other upland area be face severe financial hardship with many wonder whether they will survive they have now lose or more of the basic payment scheme an integral part of their business income which will actually all be go soon these farmer be almost all in old environmental stewardship scheme which mean that they be hardly able to access anything from the new elms scheme and the sustainable farming incentive not because they do want to but because of computer and agency issue in defra if the prime minister love langdale will he please prove it by ensure that we invest in hill farmer and in farming more generally we have focus on what the last government get wrong will the hon gentleman give way happily give way to my neighbour thank the hon member for allow to intervene be fellow cumbrian mp and grow up in the lake district so be pleased to see the prime minister story of an area that know and love as well do the hon member agree that while the shadow secretary of state introduction to this debate challenge we over our budget the real issue that hear from farmer in cumbria be that it be one thing to have budget but if we can not get it out the door it be pretty meaningless do he agree that that be the real challenge that be the real challenge so we need to ensure that there be more money in the budget for welfare scheme and support to ensure that farmer can carry on farming if we be take the basic payment out relentlessly without anything to replace it the government should not be surprised if there be carnage that be not just personal carnage and tragedy but also reduction in our ability to feed ourselves as country let we concentrate for moment or two before shut up on what we can do to put thing right first the liberal democrats believe wholeheartedly as in our costed manifesto that there should be an additional billion pound in the budget we recognise that we can not restore nature tackle climate change or produce food on the cheap we want to use at least some of that money to invest in trust on farm advice conservative member early make the point about how much of the eu money go to big landowner but the problem be that the current situation be even bad who be not get in it be small farmer if someone be work hour week on their farm they do not have time to go and get inform and to engage in the process outside they need someone they trust on their farm to hold their hand through the process of get into this new world so that there be future for they and for their family that be where some of that money need to go we need to recognise that much of the money have disproportionately go to big landowner both public and private the bbc report and know this to be true that one landowner alone evict tenant from one estate in in april give people notice to quit that estate the distribution of money between the rich farmer and the poor be even bad than it be under the common agricultural policy and we never think that would even be possible but we be see what would describe in no way lightly as the lakeland clearance and as we lose livestock we lose people want to say something else positive have already mention at least one conservative positively baroness rock also do tremendous job with the tenant farming review the shadow secretary of state predecessor do not meet she in all her time in her position be concerned to learn that baroness rock get the sack whatever happen she have be remove from her role as the report be hugely important tenant need protect and there must be tenant farm commissioner urge the government to take on baroness rock report and recommendation in full without any mitigation or equivocation the government could also ensure that people in stewardship scheme be allow into the sfi let we ensure that farming in protected landscapes which be really important grant scheme be renew its current end date be the end of march let we also do something fundamentally radical but blindingly obvious let we make food public good let we ensure that our agricultural policy actually encourage people to produce food this issue be not just about transition people have talk about the trade deal the conservative government throw britain farmer under the bus when it come to they there be also the lack of access to our near market which some labour members have mention and the importance of restore and normalising relationship with our big export market over the channel for generation the conservatives will carry around their neck like an albatross their record of betraying and take for grant our rural community in general and farmer in particular do the hon member agree that one of the element of that betrayal be on rural crime which increase again in the last month will he join in congratulate cumbria rural crime team on their one year anniversary and in support the government commitment finally

end up move to other area to find more affordable housing that in turn mean few young family few child and school with fall number on roll small business include farm pub and restaurant suffer as well as they struggle to get staff due to the lack of affordable accommodation nearby it be vital that we address this housing crisis pay tribute to my predecessor sarah dines who stand up for the farming community in the dale something that very much hope to continue have have the pleasure of meet her predecessor lord patrick mcloughlin who be in the other place and hope to benefit from his vast experience of the constituency the main industry in the dale be unsurprisingly tourism leisure and hospitality quarrying and agriculture be hopeful that the new government can secure veterinary agreement with the european union to give our struggle farmer boost have spend much of my first few week in the role speak to farmer to try to understand what the key issue be for they food security in an increasingly unstable world must be high priority the dale have great historical significance accord to the anglo saxon chronicle in the century the northern king meet edward the elder at the bakewell burh and choose he as father and lord effectively create the entity that we call england arkwright mill at cromford be the birthplace of mass production and of course it be power by renewable energy recently meet the arkwright society which be restore the site for the benefit of future generation and do great job also recently meet jamie needle who have take on masson mill another of

backwards today health service be barely stand still we need to reduce the waiting list and to get million working age people back to work as soon as possible know from my time as the mayor of derby that so much of the good be do daily never make the headline good deed do not appear to sell newspaper or attract advertising but in my few week in this role have already meet some remarkable people and organisation who be make difference in the constituency and far afield aquabox be cromford charity with over volunteer who supply clean water solution to people in disaster zone terry eckersley at river network provide social housing and second chance to people in need bakewell youth theatre have be lead and inspire by sue stones for year appreciate that this be on different scale but chatsworth house no less have give invaluable opportunity to child and young people in the area by have takeover day at the world famous stately home must mention ben woodroffe our world champion toe wrestler yes it thing as well as be great bloke and champion he have raise valuable fund for the mental health charity mind hope the day of have reasonable expectation that one child will do well in life be not over but they seem at least to be on pause lack of housing reduction in opportunity due to political decision making unrestrained social medium and climate crisis mean that my child be enter adulthood with much great uncertainty than do as foster carer of teenage child for year know how tough thing be for young people in general but they be much hard for young people leave care now than they be just few year ago local authority be run on fume so the support have diminish and unfortunately the prejudice against care experience young people still persist the new government must work towards fix the broken child social care market address the lack of placement sufficiency and end the profiteering from vulnerable child that be drive our local authority to the brink of bankruptcy do not even bother to check with the commons library but be very sure that be the first former singer of progressive metal band to be elect to this house although my gig day be behind think be extremely pleased that the labour government will seek deal with the eu to help our touring act who suffer no end of red tape when try to get to the continent to ply their trade the uk music industry have be an enormous success story over many decade and we need to support all of it not just the multimillion selling act but the one play to couple of hundred people who will hopefully be tomorrow multimillion selling act during my campaign be strike by the sheer number of constituent whose no priority for an incoming government be either the climate or nature so feel empower to say that as influencer and maker of law we have duty to think not just in the short term and until the next election but about those who have not even be bear yet and to leave behind habitable planet be particularly proud to campaign under banner of public service service to our constituent and the nation country first party second we be here not for the status but for the people who elect we will try to keep remind myself of that we must deliver on our commitment but we must also treat the staff here the staff work in our office our colleague in local government and in the civil service and our constituent with the respect that they deserve if we can do that we will move this great bastion of democracy little close to the people it serve rise order due to time pressure there will immediately be three minute time limit other than for maiden speech which member should try to make around seven minute long certainly no long call sir john hayes will make five point in three minute if can pull that off trust will go up even far in your estimation madam deputy speaker first this government like all government need to recognise that the food chain in this country be distort by the power of handful of huge corporate retailer for far too long they have take the lion share of the agricultural cake it be critical that we rebalance the chain in favour of primary and secondary producer previous government have do some work on that with the establishment of the groceries code adjudicator be in government when that be set up but it need more tooth to act on sharp practice by retailer who run ragged over primary producer secondly we need strategy for food security that mean recognise that food security be as important as energy security they must not be make competitor one with the other we see during covid and after the start of the war in ukraine just what damage the unforeseen and unexpected can do to international market and supply line it be critical that we grow more of what we consume and shorten those supply line to ensure that people will be feed by produce that be make here in the united kingdom be my right hon friend disappoint as be that the secretary of state do not say more about food security and how we can make sure that great share of our food come from this country my right hon friend have be champion of these matter for considerable period have hope of the secretary of state have debate just before the recess in which the minister for food security and rural affairs participate make the case for food security and he give fair hearing look forward to the meeting to which know he be about to invite can bring along group of farmer and grower to have that ongoing conversation the core point be that food security matter it not only help with economic resilience but assist with traceability quality standard all those thing my third point be stimulate by the secretary of state comment about investment and our need to think big we do indeed to maintain productivity and efficiency in farming and grow we need to look to the future that mean great automation and change the way we go about the food production business it mean great integration but not at the expense of the small farmer and grower an efficient system do not necessarily mean exclusively huge farm business as we need an entry point to the industry if we simply create handful of very large corporate farmer we will not allow the kind of fluidity necessary to maintain the health of the industry my fourth point be on procurement the government need to use procurement to support british produce it be not that difficult but no government of any party have get it right we have make some progress over time as different government have launch different initiative but we need to use the public purse to support what we do in this country more effectively my final point be this we can have debate about the detail of policy but as have be say by the shadow secretary of state and other we need to take big view than the partisan knockabout that too often prevail in this kind of discussion this be about the future good of our people through the production of food to feed the nation as chair of the all party parliamentary group for food security have be work across the house to ensure that we work towards affordable food that be available and accessible to everyone yet from some of the contribution have hear from conservative members it be clear that over the past year they have not reflect on how they have fail rural community we would not be here today if they have hold the mantle on food security our farmer already have low confidence because the conservatives erode their trust but our rural community be not political football they deserve respect they want action not word if the opposition think that rural affair be tricky ground for those on the labour benches they can well and truly think again just look at our new crop of labour mp we win seat right across the country from scarborough to south pembrokeshire the farming community have firm friend on the labour benches let turn to work that the government be do from unlock precision breeding to launch new deal for farmer the government work on food security transcend the work of single department from seek to secure new veterinary agreement to launch gb energy which will lower production cost we be also pave the way on flood resilience if may will draw on some local context in york visit fantastic carrot farm in york outer but be gobsmacke to hear that in bad year of flooding it can lose quarter of its crop dread to think about the impact if we do not turn the tide of climate change that be why urge the continuation of critical resilience fund to support farmer like the one meet water scarcity be critical issue there be real pressure despite the wet month on record it must be year since we last build reservoir and farmer struggle from drought too as my hon friend say many labour member be supportive of farmer be proud farmer daughter and be delighted to speak in this debate the previous government sell farmer down the river we have disastrous trade deal and they suffer from terrible weather we can at least say that that be not the tories fault do my hon friend agree that if we be to support welsh farmer they need strong financial package thank my hon friend who be fantastic advocate for her constituent the agriculture budget be hugely important to protect food security another critical issue be biosecurity so be disappointed to see that the opposition leave it out of their motion at present the uk have number of confirm case of bluetongue be brief by the deputy chief veterinary officer early today welcome the secretary of state action on bluetongue serotype vaccine that couple with the exclusion zone policy be welcome first response to what be complex crisis fuel by climate change will not get into the intricacy of midge and the wind from the continent that be clear signal that the government be take biosecurity seriously want to touch on my recent engagement with sainsbury hope colleague from across the house will join in welcome food retailer that put food security at the heart of their business model be encourage by what sainsbury be do be conscious of time but just stress that food be one of the critical national infrastructure sector in the uk food security be national security so respectfully say to the opposition stop the politic and work constructively with we on food security it be great to see the government make progress look forward to work with they to safeguard britain national food security call dr roz savage to make her maiden speech thank you madam deputy speaker for the opportunity to speak to the house also thank my hon friend for their contribution to this important debate on food and farming it be an absolute honour to address the chamber as the newly elect member of parliament for south cotswolds it be new constituency form from part of the former cotswolds and north wiltshire seat the hon member for north cotswolds sir geoffrey clifton brown continue his service in his constituency while james gray serve north wiltshire for year although mr gray and my political view may differ substantially he be dedicated constituency mp and hope to follow in his footstep in that regard at least the cotswolds have well deserve reputation for natural and architectural beauty it always gladden my heart to see the soar slender spire of st mary church in tetbury the elegant honeystone building around the marketplace in cirencester or the awe inspire arch of malmesbury abbey we have beautiful village include three category winner of the wiltshire best kept villages competition ashton keynes seagry and hankerton we have vibrant community thrive business and visionary innovator and inventor king charles have the good taste to choose highgrove near tetbury as his country home and his garden be well worth visit be still wait for my invitation to join his majesty there for an organic cream tea south cotswolds be rural constituency characterise by rich agricultural landscape with proud farming heritage and plethora of fabulous farmer market full of tempting goody eighty seven per cent of the land within the cotswolds area of outstanding natural beauty be dedicate to agriculture and we have more than farm holding in south cotswolds employ over people our beautiful landscape be diverse mix of crop and grassland and livestock farming constitute significant sector with cattle sheep and pig can recommend cirencester livestock market as probably the good place in the constituency if not the country to get gargantuan farmer breakfast that really set you up for the day if not for the entire week the cotswolds be know for our traditional farming practice most of the farm be family run and often have be for many many generation but there be plenty of innovation too early this year host an event at the royal agricultural university in cirencester where we hear that many farm in the region be embrace sustainable and regenerative approach focus on soil health wildlife conservation and local food production the royal ag itself be lead the field so to speak with zero dig farming method however not all be rosy in the cotswolds garden our farmer be frustrate by the absence of long term strategy they need to plan or year ahead beyond the next electoral cycle they need clear vision of the future vision that can survive change of government we need to attract more young people into farming last year help couple of farmer to bring in the brussels sprout harvest as stand in muddy field on grey december day they tell about the problem they have have in recruit young people into farming thirty eight per cent of farmer be or old and only be under astonishingly it seem that not many young people enjoy be out in the middle of field in all weather do hard physical work for very little money significant number of they do but the main obstacle be gain access to land be pleased to hear the secretary of state imply that he would be work to encourage more young people into farming make it easy and more rewarding for they to help to feed our country high quality food that have not travel halfway around the world on the south eastern edge of my constituency really exciting initiative be under way at the marvellously name crapper landfill site which be lead on sustain circle this concept aim to meet of community food housing job and energy need within define radius around the community increase self reliance and resilience the idea be be pioneer with plan to position pressurised plastic greenhouse on old landfill zone use the methane emission from the decompose rubbish to heat the greenhouse it aim to grow enough fruit and vegetable to feed royal wootton bassett brinkworth and malmesbury we need more creative project like this elsewhere in wiltshire proposal for massive solar farm on acre of mostly agricultural land have spark debate about how we choose to use our land we need to stop think housing here renewable here and food production here and to look at more creative way to make our land multi layered and multi purpose it be become clear than ever that we need an integrated strategy not least because build more house will increase rainwater run off and increase the burden on an already overload sewage system in my constituency in the last year alone the fairford sewage treatment work pump untreated sewage into the river coln for hour which equate to over four and half month incident that be mean to be exceptional be happen on average over three time week across the constituency sewage be flood into house garden and school it be flood out across field where cattle consume it get sick and die urge thames water to upgrade the fairford sewage work as matter of the utmost urgency and ofwat to make sure that it do for the cleanliness or otherwise of our river be personal and would like to share little background be not from anywhere in particular my father be methodist minister and my parent move house for the first time when be two year old they continue to move house with annoying frequency thereafter my father excuse be that he run out of sermon after certain number of year so we have to move house so that he could recycle they be all in favour of recycling but think he presume high degree of attention and long span of memory than the typical church member have sadly my parent be no long around to see take my seat in this house but know they would have be proud above all else they believe that their job be to serve the community as exemplar of god love and be honour to follow in their footstep but digress since have be old enough to choose where live seem to keep come back to the river thames take my first oar stroke on the thames in oxford and row out of thames row club in putney for several year live in fulham putney brentford kew richmond and windsor before move to the cotswolds the river thames rise in my constituency as little more than trickle just outside cricklade gradually gather tributary include the highly polluted coln to become the magnificent father thames that flow past these houses of parliament the thames have be constant thread throughout much of my adult life so care passionately about water issue and about climate and nature more generally this be passion that lead in my to spend an inordinate amount of time alone in tiny rowboat in the middle of various ocean as row solo across the atlantic pacific and indian use my voyage to raise awareness of environmental issue and our grow ecological crisis along the way gain some really impressive callouse four guinness world record and hopefully some highly transferable skill in navigate shark infest water which may possibly stand in good stead in my new career like many who care about our environment sometimes despair but in close would like to say that what give hope for the future be the public spirit the energy and the goodness that see in action in the south cotswolds when the government be tell we that there be no money and council be struggle see our community come together use their creativity and resourcefulness to work out how to make little go long way share resource look to their neighbour donate time and skill and look out for each other we have fabulous organisation include the cirencester pantry heals of malmesbury and community fridges in purton malmesbury and tetbury it be so inspiring to see people come together in mutual support people of the south cotswolds you inspire

very sorry to lose it have many friend in that constituency and wish she well it be lovely to hear bit of cross party action to start off will try not to spoil that tone today debate be vital one on the future of not only south norfolk food security but that of the uk for too long those who have put food on our table have work our land but sadly be take for grant stand here as the first labour mp for south norfolk in year that should show the house that rural community up and down the country have want change and it be for we to prove that we be ready to take up that mantle in south norfolk we be lucky because we have the innovation of the norwich research park those who be local can see nod from the hon member for mid norfolk george freeman will know that these be the centre of excellence that will drive our agriculture forward in agritech and high end industry the innovation of the john innes centre be second to none as it strive to meet the increase demand and pressure on the national and international food security system the gene edit technique that it have be develop and work on have the potential to transform british agriculture by increase yield and crop resilience and to help we face the climate crisis that we be all head towards welcome the news from the front bench that the government will be take action on precision breeding that be great step forward in what we need to see there be an incredible opportunity in the heart of south norfolk to transform our food security and to support farmer on the frontline who be deal with the consequence of climate change in produce more food with less impact on the environment as we address the challenge face our farmer and the urgent need to secure our food supply it be important to highlight the amazing work of the earlham institute the earlham institute be beacon of life science training and innovation and its contribution be vital to tackle food insecurity and safeguard our future its cutting edge research be develop the late tool and approach to monitor and predict how disease evolve and spread this kind of knowledge be critical for the future of british farming as it will allow we to anticipate and mitigate the risk that threaten our food security the earlham institute contribution go far beyond research it be also hub for train the next generation of scientist and ensure that britain remain at the forefront of life science and agricultural innovation be immensely proud to represent the constituency that be home to such important institution the earlham institute be do the hard work necessary to safeguard our food security and supply face with the challenge of water security sadly note that that be miss from the opposition motion farmer tell when meet they that there be huge barrier in the way of their collect the water that they need and build the reservoir that they want on their land because of action take by the environment agency why on earth should we stand in the way of farmer who want to protect their land from drought while also protect local area from flood risk by capture water to use at low cost than tap into the main water that we all need hope that my front bench colleague will work with to secure planning reform on this issue so that we can build more reservoir on farm land to help with food security farmer have also raise concern with about biodiversity net gain regulation which be currently slow down our progress on food production recently visit fischer farms just over the border and it be great step forward hope that we can adopt these measure call david chadwick to make his maiden speech stand here as the first ever mp for brecon radnor and cwm tawe it be the large constituency in england and wales and therefore have foot in

distance rely on road that be often closed or bus journey that can take whole day people live in rural area should not have to pay rural penalty to access healthcare indeed rural area can help to tackle the healthcare crisis we face let we take obesity for example we can lighten the load on our nhs by better the nation diet if we recognise the true value of good food and local produce we would appreciate the public health and environmental benefit from money spend on the agriculture budget the government must be aware of the agriculture budget massive multipli effect for the rural economy and they should give farmer the stability and funding they need food security be major concern some of farmer be consider give up and the farming workforce be dwindle our farmer and grower produce world class produce battle harsh weather and constantly change market condition these market condition be often set by the retail giant and know that my predecessor roger williams fight to level the relationship between retailer and farmer by strengthen the groceries code adjudicator it be shame that the conservatives do not do more to strengthen that code during their time in office will carry

impassioned maiden speech and wish he the good of luck in his naming battle as they develop have become very fond of say that be the mp for the large constituency in england where be conscious that agricultural and rural community have significant stake they make significant contribution to the local economy if the farm be take out of the constituency it would not just be the economy that be ruin the landscape and tourism would also be ruin and countless community that have exist for century would be undermine unfortunately our rural community be in the midst of crisis include depopulation crisis young people can not find the job and home that allow they to afford to remain where they grow up and therefore we have an age population hospitality business be unable to continue to grow and be force to close their door that be directly link to the crisis in our farming community because they be often the customer for those business over the weekend be privileged to visit goodfellow farming in longwitton on the eastern border of my constituency speak to the owner about the shape of british farming and the very real crisis we have inherit from the conservatives the shadow farming minister the hon member for keighley and ilkley robbie moore be former northumberland county councillor he be very gracious in welcome three new labour members for the area to this place and thank he for his friendliness and candour in do so just compliment he on the beauty of the alnwick ward where look forward to campaign in the local election that be come up the people of the hexham constituency vote for labour for the first time ever at the last election because they recognise the crisis we face say that not to make hackneyed political point but to make real point about the work that intend to do as new member in the house to shine light on the depopulation crisis we face gently remind shadow ministers on the opposition front bench that we know that we have inherit very broken farming system be delighted to welcome my right hon friend the now secretary of state to my constituency during the general election campaign to meet local farmer be confident that this government and this front bench team be listen to they and that we can work to drive up standard in our farming and secure generational farm for the future ultimately department that manage to underspend by million be not one that be function properly under the previous government say that not to be overtly political but simply to emphasise that we need government who work in the interest of community up and down the tyne valley and from the county durham border up to the scottish border it be an honour to follow my constituency neighbour across the border the hon member for hexham joe morris today debate be on topic that interest greatly as the son of farmer and also as proud mp for rural constituency where farmer land manager and worker in the rural economy deliver some of the fine produce anywhere in the united kingdom we have so many outstanding farmer and food producer in the scottish borders it be impossible to name even half of they we should be immensely proud of the food and drink produce here on our doorstep but too often the concern and the need of farmer be take for grant they be overlook by the snp government at holyrood and now they seem to be ignore by the labour government here at westminster politician in those party talk freely of the need for food security but they do not seem to understand who deliver that food security they speak of the need for great and high quality produce without properly recognise the hard work that go into produce it they talk of the benefit of reach net zero target by manage land effectively and reduce the air mile for food but do not give enough credit to the farmer who be achieve that if member wonder what mean they should look no far than this labour government the labour party manifesto for the recent general election make no mention of its plan for funding for farming know that many farmer in my constituency of stone great wyrley and penkridge be deeply worried about some of the talk about change to the tax regime not just to inheritance tax but to capital gain tax and how that will impact the future viability of their business and the ability for farm to be farm by family my right hon friend make an excellent point about both the funding arrangement and the tax change that have be speculate about in the press farmer be in the dark about what come next there may be budget cut and there may be financial pain but they do not really know the government should be listen to nfu scotland which recently submit detailed budget submission to the united kingdom government let put on record what that submission say it underline the need for an increase multi annual ringfenced agriculture and rural economy fund commitment in the budget labour must also pay attention to the warning from nfu scotland that without adequate funding from the uk government the majority of farmer in scotland would cease to be viable this labour government can not do to farmer what they have do to pensioner by cut their winter fuel payment the change they promise in the election be already look hollow to the scottish and british public if they go on to cut farmer funding that will reveal again that labour be not on the side of business and worker it will show that all its priority be wrong do hope that it will see sense listen to our farmer and do the right thing in address food security wish to begin with food insecurity both family and farmer across the uk have see increase food and energy bill because of the chop and change policy of the previous government more than farmer and agri business have be force out of business since due to tory neglect furthermore repeat sell out trade deal we have hear about the botched brexit deal have lumber farming with the low profitability of any sector in the economy it be important to my constituent in bathgate and linlithgow and to all our constituent that we have stable and secure supply of food we need to see earning return to farmer as profit not spend on costly energy bill for household across the country the cost of energy have undermine personal food security farming be expose to skyrocket energy price and the soar cost of animal feed and fertiliser which be up compare with in recent month we have hear from some opposition members that solar energy farm be risk to our food security be very glad that we hear mention of the nfu president whose ear must be burn today because he call for balance when criticism be make of where and when land be take out of production perhaps the conservatives could take note of that constructive approach the farming community have show great initiative and lead on solar energy something that opposition member have fail to recognise nfu scotland have strike new deal with major solar energy company affirm that the land use require for new solar initiative would have marginal impact on farming that deal involve farmer who know the land good in identify site for development and earning from that partnership and believe that the house should welcome such commitment to net zero and to collaborative working as result of cut energy cost and deliver more revenue directly to farmer such working offer the opportunity for positive future between the farming community and renewable energy for farmer it be not just about energy cost but about market access and trade as we have hear and deliver for farmer do not just mean fix the problem of previous botched trade deal welcome the government quick action to ensure that our farmer get fair deal mean lower energy cost and increase renewable

long as can remember have want to fix thing go from build lego as child to rebuild gearbox as teenager attend my local comprehensive school in rural lincolnshire and many of my friend and classmate grow up be involve in the critical work that farmer do to keep food on our table and act as steward for our environment vital task that this debate correctly highlight at school serve as prefect alongside the hon member for keighley and ilkley robbie moore our political path have diverge since we last work together more than year ago arrange the de aston school sixth form leaver ball but be proud that we be part of the large cohort of state educate mps in history my passion for fix thing lead to london and to imperial college where study engineering which lead to many year work in the transport industry around the world but there be so much more that need fix in our country than plane train and automobile raise my family in sutton and cheam with my wonderful wife have see at first hand the break cog and blow fuse across our public service from the nhs and social care to education and policing in today britain the social contract have be break in our politic cynicism and self interest have replace service and duty and many feel that it be simply no long true that if they work hard and play by the rule they will enjoy the security and opportunity that everyone deserve fair deal no long exist between the british state and the people and that be evident across every policy area as an engineer feel confident in say that the very foundation of our country be break it be time that we pick up our tool to fix they as the liberal democrat front bench spokesperson for our capital will hold the government to account for all londoners fix london creak infrastructure and never end housing crisis and push for reform of and proper funding for the met if people have be listen to the lib dems for the last few year they will know exactly what the river thames be full of there be much to be say on all those topic but will finish by highlight one that be dear to and my constituent hospice one of the first email receive after be elect be from our local hospice st raph which be search for help to stop million worth of funding cut that would see staff make redundant and clinical service slash the cut would put sutton gps hospital and district nurse under huge and unmanageable pressure and leave family abandon unsupported and in genuine distress at time when they need kindness and support the most for patient the cut could tragically hasten their passing and deny they their dignity in this parliament we have an opportunity to build well plan so that people have somewhere to spend their final day in the comfort and care that we all deserve as human being look forward to work with member from across the house if they will pick up their tool with this engineer who know thing or two about fix thing together we can fix our country restore trust and deliver hope may start by pay my respect to the resident who die in my constituency during the recent flood be sure that the thought of the whole house be with her family thank the secretary of state for leave the labour conference early to visit northamptonshire and ensure that we have the support that we need over northampton south resident be evacuate from their home thank the hon member for sutton and cheam luke taylor send my commiseration to his father on his election loss but be sure that he be very proud to see his son sit on these green benches unfortunately can not support the opposition motion believe that we should support all possible funding opportunity for our farmer but the motion seek to commit the government to underfunde and in some case imaginary policy propose in may by the previous prime minister those policy have contribute to the billion black hole that the labour party have inherit they be political gesture and not real offer to the uk farming community people see through that of people tell farmers weekly that they trust labour government whereas only trust the conservatives do my hon friend agree that the fact that so many labour mp have farming background as do and that so many rural seat be represent by labour make it clear that we be now the true champion of our farming community it be very clear that labour be on the side of our farming and agricultural sector stand here as the hopeful chair of the all party parliamentary group for food be sure that those who be concerned about food security will join we at our inaugural general meeting very shortly be also member of the nfu food and farming fellowship it be clear that labour member take this issue seriously and we be dedicate time to ensure that unlike the previous government we work with farmer not against they we be also work across industry the motion focus solely on farming but in order to deliver food security there must be cross sector approach as be sure everyone in the house recognise the approach should include food manufacturing logistic retail and the hospitality chain the whole agrifood ecosystem deliver gross value add of billion to our economy include billion through our farming sector and whopping billion through our manufacturing distribution and wholesale sector in food and retail we want to improve food security in the uk which be already classify as broadly stable by defra on the issue of stability remind my hon friend of the opening line of labour food and farming strategy we can carry on just as we be farmer have meet in my constituency would make exactly the same claim now give the record of the last conservative government who scrap labour food plan in do he agree that if we be to invest in food and farming and to bring job and prosperity to rural and urban constituency we must back labour new deal for farmer invest in food and farming job and put real plan for food security back on the table could not agree more and could not have say it well myself however holistic approach must be take across the whole ecosystem to subsidy funding and investment one reason why choose to speak today be that food security be important to and my constituent recent study find that nearly of people in northampton struggle to access food and that get bad in rural northamptonshire as be sure my constituency neighbour the hon member for south northamptonshire sarah bool recognise northamptonshire action with communities in rural england find that of resident in rural northamptonshire worried about food price and in of family with child adult miss meal in order to feed their kid that be simply not good enough commend the opposition for support the government effort to improve food security but the motion be not the way to do that we must work together collaboratively and across party to support the agrifood industry and hope that the opposition will endeavour to do so after their motion be defeat we in this country have the good farmer they produce food to the high animal welfare standard and we should be very proud of they food security be key part of national security and urge the government to look at the efra committee report on food security from the last parliament the previous government take up the recommendation for an annual food security report and urge the government to continue with that they must protect the farming budget not cut it and must protect land not bulldoze it for solar we have to make sure that solar go in the right place on industrial building brownfield land and rooftop not on prime food produce land we must also protect input in the past few year we have lose the ability to produce lot of fertiliser in the united kingdom we need to look at that as matter of resilience biosecurity be key part of national security as we have hear we have lot of case of bluetongue in the south and east of england we know what happen in the past couple of year with avian influenza and we have african swine fever advance up the continent the government must act and they must support the animal and plant health agency which be in urgent need of full redevelopment the efra committee have call for that redevelopment and know that defra want it so urge minister to make the case to the treasury for it to be fund in full my hon friend gueste on the public accounts committee last year when we have full inquiry on this issue there be real need for proper capital investment because the biosecurity of the nation be at risk if we do not have properly biosecure laboratory thank my hon friend the chair of the public accounts committee for that intervention it be so important that the government listen to this request and fund the redevelopment of the apha in full my journey into politic start in with the outbreak of foot and mouth disease know what the implication be see sight then that never want to see again in my lifetime and we have see what happen when biosecurity break down that bring to mental health which have be touch on thank the hon gentleman for give way on the point of farmer mental health as my constituency neighbour will he join in championing yana you be not alone local charity that be now stretch into essex and support the mental health of farmer and rural worker would be happy to champion yana the royal agricultural benevolent institution yellow wellies and all the other institution and charity that support mental health urge the government to look at the efra committee report last year on rural mental health which touch on many of these issue and make key recommendation we need to support our farming community when serious thing happen such as flooding or disease outbreak when something more chronic happen say when farm get positive result during periodic tuberculosis testing we need to make sure that the mental health of farmer vet and everyone else be support that be so important we have talk about flooding people in rural and urban community in flood risk area have not only the trauma of be flood but the anxiety of worry about be flood minister will be call out in their wellie in flood but community need to be support when the water go down and the blue light leave that be another key recommendation of our report we need to protect the farming budget and make sure that the money go out through the farming recovery fund to support flooded community we can help our farming and food produce community we encourage people to buy british and pay tribute to the nfu and to my hon friend the member for hinckley and bosworth dr evans for the buy british campaign that all the british supermarket have sign up to we need to support our local community by eat local and buy local that be so good for local community and it be also good for the animal it reduce distance and time to slaughter and food mile as distinguished vet my hon friend be make powerful case on welfare standard do he agree that one of the great prize of british agriculture be that it set such high welfare standard and that one of the good thing the last government do be pass legislation on transport animal set ever high standard for uk farmer absolutely that be key bill animal welfare unite we in humanity across this house and urge we to work across party on it as have say farmer in this country produce to the high animal welfare standard and we should be proud of that and protect they my understanding be that the conservative party manifesto say when we leave the eu we will be able to encourage the public sector to buy british to support our farmer and reduce environmental cost what go wrong thank the hon member for his intervention finish by say that food security be national security biosecurity be national security and we must protect both my grandad be tenant dairy farmer and rural community such as mine feel let down by the conservative party speak early about close family friend who take his life follow farm inspection many farmer who have be let down and force out of produce food be my client when practise as high street solicitor in north warwickshire they could have do with the million that the conservative party fail to allocate to the support of rural farmer they need well inspection regime that work for they and for consumer be inspire recently when visit aldi which have its national headquarters in my constituency because it be passionate about british food and form good relationship with local farmer the agriculture and food industry sector contribute billion to the economy and provide million job in the uk include many job in my constituency however the conservative party create cost of living crisis that force family to buy less fresh food particularly vegetable because they could not afford it that squeeze our local farmer far because the last government do not prioritise energy or food security farmer be cripple by escalate energy price and animal feed and fertiliser price the last government chop and change approach to roll out environmental land management scheme leave farmer reel with uncertainty and it be no wonder that they and their representative be look to this government for much need reassurance we need to reassure our farmer and give they the confidence to invest for the future we need to make sure that they know that this government have their back rural and freight crime in my constituency like many other have become intolerable the conservative party leave rural criminal to roam free with crime in rural area spiral out of control farmer be lose valuable equipment essential to the running of their business and to add insult to injury they be often the one leave to clear up fly tipping be glad to be part of party and government take rural crime seriously with cross government rural crime strategy that be the first of its kind this strategy will crack down on issue such as fly tipping and antisocial behaviour that affect rural community such as mine be look forward order the time be up be afraid rise to proudly voice my support for the farming family across northern ireland who day in and day out work tirelessly to help feed our nation also stand for the people employ in the agrifood sector directly or indirectly and the million people across the uk who consume northern ireland top quality produce on daily basis we dup member take great pride in the fact that northern ireland set high bar for food quality animal welfare and environmental standard our farm be commit to sustainable practice ensure that food be produce responsibly and with respect for our landscape and ecosystem despite the effort of those who unfairly criticise our farming community and treat they as scapegoat for climate change our farmer should be see as partner not problem they be already work with some of the most rigorous environmental regulation and should be recognise for their role in meet climate target across the uk farmer be and always have be the good custodian of our land they must be enshrine in uk policy give seat at the table in key discussion and support financially so that they can continue their vital work however not all be well in the industry northern ireland be grapple with the daily impact of the protocol and the windsor framework which have create significant uncertainty our agri industry be subject to more than eu law over which we have no democratic say and our agriculture sector face unnecessary trade barrier and supply chain issue that complicate the movement of good between great britain and northern ireland do the hon lady agree that one of the most pernicious impact of the protocol be that in few month the european union will stop the veterinary medicine that be so vital to the health of animal in northern ireland come over from great britain because the eu insist that its veterinary agency should control these matter agree wholeheartedly with the hon member the grow uncertainty over the availability of veterinary medicine in northern ireland because of the protocol pose grave threat to the agri food sector and animal welfare if permanent solution be not reach now northern ireland risk lose access to more than vital veterinary product around of its current medicine portfolio as per the british veterinary association advice that will have devastating consequence not only for farmer and their livestock but for consumer and companion animal such as cat dog and horse without those essential medicine animal health and disease control will be severely compromise leave our agricultural sector and the broad public expose to significant risk this be problem not problem and it need fix we also have the unsatisfactory situation around the transport of second hand farm machinery from great britain to northern ireland due to requirement such as phytosanitary certificate just because there might be soil on the wheel we have the eleventh hour turn on the uk wide not for eu labelling policy which demonstrate no sign of willingness to mitigate the irish sea border an outrageous move on the part of the government but not surprising give the continue bending to the eu and big business this government have demonstrate their complete disregard for northern ireland in that regard we also have ongoing issue around potato and plant come from scotland to northern ireland the list go on those issue be far from resolve and need to be address on top of those difficulty our farming community be deal with the rise cost of living rise energy price and volatile farmgate price call on the government to ensure that funding for agriculture in northern ireland be adjust in line with inflation at around million our farmer need certainty and that mean ring fence support package that extend beyond short term budget cycle ideally for at least year in conclusion the message be clear no farmer no food they need our support rise order will be call the front bench speaker at pm so chris hinchliff be the last voice from the back benches do not doubt the motivation of opposition members but the inescapable fact be that the conservative party be ideologically incapable of put forward real solution to bolster our national food security share some of the concern about the use of high quality farmland for ground mount solar scheme which be an ongoing issue in north east hertfordshire and we need land use framework to give strategic direction to where we generate the solar energy that we need instead of allow chaotic proliferation of profit drive scheme wherever grid capacity which the conservative party fail to sort out allow under the previous government just of house have instal rooftop solar and neither do they take any of the obvious step to mandate solar panel on new build house or car park for year they allow that situation to develop unchecked and it will be this labour government who deliver the land use strategy that we need to provide framework to ensure that we be make the good possible use of our finite land on other challenge it be estimate that one third of uk soil be degrade yet the previous government ditch the plan soil health action plan for england on biodiversity the previous conservative government authorise the use of harmful pesticide despite know that that would have devastating impact on pollinator on new entrant it be well know that the average age of farmer be too high yet when it be in power the conservative party austerity measure lead to the closure of acre of county farm estate which be crucial for get young people into farming career and contribute to national food security call the opposition spokesperson food security be national security and in time of rise global uncertainty we must support the british farmer and the british food and drink sector to deliver high quality domestic food for our economy and our national security that mean provide farmer and grower with the certainty they deserve unfortunately in recent week and over the course of this debate we have see what happen when member for one of the least rural constituency in the country be put in charge of the countryside some million of the farming recovery fund be not yet pay out some million ring fence for internal drainage board have not yet be distribute there be no commitment on the million for farm innovation and productivity grant there be report that the farming budget be about to be slash leave uncertainty and farmer face cliff edge while the first assault of this labour government have be on pensioner right across the country fear that farmer be next on their hit list the secretary of state have have the chance in this debate to stand up for farmer and to confirm that the farming budget and other scheme will be protect instead he seem to have already surrender to the chancellor suggest cut of million fear that it will be much more as we know labour could only bring itself to include word in its manifesto on its plan for farmer which stand in contrast to our conservative government commitment to food security and our rural sector by put food at the centre of policymake we introduce the food security index and an annual food security report and we set out plan to introduce legally bind target to enhance our food security we establish the farm to fork summit hold at downing street bring together key stakeholder from across the food and farming sector that be all to ensure that the government departments be align on this agenda we be willing to look farmer in the eye to engage directly with the whole agricultural sector and to make sure that its priority be hear across the whole of government ask the minister why be the prime minister not guarantee the same level of engagement and reporting congratulate the new member who give their maiden speech the hon member for derbyshire dales john whitby for south cotswolds dr savage and for brecon radnor and cwm tawe david chadwick as well as my friend the hon member for sutton and cheam luke taylor with whom go to our local comprehensive school in lincolnshire look up to the gallery and can see not only his mother but my secondary school teacher look down at welcome mrs taylor to the house be sure she will be proud of her son who have get seat on these benches we have all collectively agree in our speech on the need for certainty right now for our farmer at time when farmer need to plan labour be offer they farming manifesto that could be place on postcard that be exactly why we have have to secure this debate today bring ministers from the department to the chamber all with the good interest of give our new labour government the good chance to stand up for our farmer in the past day in office we have see that the secretary of state be too weak to stand up for our farmer and too weak to even stand up for his own department against the chancellor red pen as have be say we have experience the wet month on record that can not go unanswered and thousand of farmer across the country be be cripple by crop loss and damage to their field in fact farmer be already fear for their second year without any crop at all the million pledge by the last conservative government be design specifically to support farmer hit by flooding and it be ready to go when we leave office farmer on the ground however say that they have not see penny of it where be that money why have it not be deliver to the farmer who desperately need it the previous secretary of state my right hon friend the member for north east cambridgeshire steve barclay and also pledge million for internal drainage board to give they the investment they need to protect the bad hit agricultural land from flooding again some small amount have be release but the vast majority of the fund have not be release by the department why be that we know that the labour party grasp on the public finance be tenuous at good but this be vital money for our farmer with business on the brink of collapse do ministers realise that for every day that go by without that support another farmer get close to shut up shop labour have choice in the debate and in bring forward the budget this month my advice to the secretary of state be to pick up the phone speak to the chancellor back british farming fight for the farming budget in full and deliver for farmer up and down the country be grateful to have the opportunity to close the debate the hon member for keighley and ilkley robbie moore speak for so long that it will not be possible to answer many of the question he pose but be grateful to have the opportunity to show my gratitude and support to farmer work hard to feed the nation and protect our environment up and down the country we have hear some excellent first speech from new member today and want to pay tribute to they from my hon friend the member

northampton south mike reader talk about food hardship we hear powerful intervention about the mental health issue and challenge face our farmer and the challenge of rural crime and we hear from my hon friend the member for north east hertfordshire chris hinchliff on the need for land use framework have to say that from listen to conservative members they do not seem to have grasp the level of their own failure the conservative government fail farmer and rural community we have hear about low level of confidence business go out of business and input cost and energy cost spiral that be why rural community vote they out in their drove it will be very different in the future we have hear the complaint about budget for the future be sure that right hon and hon member on the opposition benches have the experience to know how spending review work they will find out in time where the money be but of course give that they spend the money many time over they know the problem that we be have to clear up what we have hear be the need for stability in the future to overcome the economic problem that we have inherit from their fail government farmer be the backbone of rural community our environment and our economy but they face multiple challenge from flooding and drought to soar input cost and rural crime we need proper long term strategy that work we will do away with the stick plaster approach that we have see for the last few year and replace it with new deal for farmer that genuinely will boost farmer resilience in the face of climate change and wide external shock we will work in partnership with farmer listen to their concern and their idea and tackle the root cause of the long term issue that they continue to face only after those discussion and consideration will it be possible to deliver the change that farmer really want to see in summary that will be long term approach labour approach that approach will be good for farm good for consumer good for the environment and good for nature frankly real change from the short term quick fix operator now deservedly relegate to the opposition benches question put shockat adam jim allister gideon amos stuart

house do now mcmorrin be grateful for the opportunity to debate this important subject thank the minister for be here this evening and thank everyone speak to before the debate particularly the bridlington health forum and representative of local nhs trust and the integrated care board bridlington be not alone in need improve access to health service but will seek to explain today why that have become an extremely acute problem in the town constituent of mine live in and around driffield hornsea market weighton and the remote wolds village will have valid concern about their own public service but hope they will forgive for take this opportunity to speak in depth about bridlington and why it be in so much need of extra support will describe the demographic backdrop against which these issue have arise the challenge over supply of service and lastly the need for robust strategy to tackle the various problem face by local people in the town bridlington be fantastic coastal resort on the edge of the roll hill of the wolds and it welcome million of visitor every year it be world famous for its seabird colony and be the lobster capital of europe however like many seaside town it have significant challenge and the demographic datum be stark it have the old and most deprived population in the east riding of yorkshire and man live in the bridlington south ward have life expectancy year low than those live elsewhere in the county indeed datum show that two of the three ward cover the town be the two most deprive in the county and the other be the fifth high of total of the age profile be equally stark one third of the population be over and that rise to of resident in bridlington north where significant number be over bridlington have the high percentage of people with limit long term illness or disability in the york and scarborough nhs trust catchment area and bridlington resident have the high level of health inequality in that catchment the director of public health for east riding of yorkshire county council have say of the town we have find that the inequality be grow they large and they serious in term of length of life quality of life and the amount of people with long term health condition bridlington have get the bad level in all of the east riding so this be wake up call to do something about it certainly can not disagree with that sentiment as for the supply of health service the house will no doubt be shock to hear that there be entire classroom of child in bridlington who have never see dentist one patient need emergency dental work be send more than mile to doncaster and in january there be people on the waiting list for the only local nhs dentist many people have be force to go private but that be not solution affordable to most will the minister agree to look again at nhs dental contract so that they incentivise dentist to open practice in area where there be such clear and obvious shortage access to primary care have see some recent improvement but the consolidation of gp practice from six to two have not be without its problem local patient still find it challenge to secure appointment at one of the two practice but know that gps operate across the town have work tirelessly to improve service in the wake of the pandemic and the shortage of local healthcare professional the direction of travel for secondary care however be not positive bridlington be bless with fantastic hospital site which open in it recently enjoy an investment of million in solar panel make it one of the green nhs site in the country however the site be chronically underuse be not suggest for second that the bridlington hospital site could be major trauma centre or large infirmary but it can and should be vital community asset for health it have the potential to be health hub for the town bring together wide array of local health service york and scarborough nhs trust might not be the owner of the site but it be the provider of secondary care there many people in the town feel that its focus which be naturally lean towards north yorkshire and not east yorkshire mean that investment and new service be be prioritise in york scarborough and malton out patient appointment be particularly key metric as they make up large bulk of the interaction between the nhs and old people in bridlington the number of out patient appointment at bridlington hospital that be offer to resident in bridlington driffield and the surround area have reduce from in to just over in reduction of more than in just four year ophthalmology appointment be down audiology appointment be down and rheumatology appointment be down instead of recognise that an age population will result in great demand for out patient service locally we be see these service be provide at site away from the town commend the hon gentleman for bring forward this issue he and know each other long before he come to this house as he be one of our adviser for the all party parliamentary group for egg pig and poultry it be real pleasure to see he in this place and we look forward to his contribution the hon gentleman constituency and my constituency be very similar he mention that bridlington be seaside resort and that he represent seaside area as do he also mention the fact that much of the population be over year old again there be similarity with my constituency be the hon gentleman seek new rural strategy that address this issue in coastal area if he be it be something we can all welcome thank the hon member for his contribution will come to that point shortly east riding patient travel an astonishing million nhs mile to attend out patient appointment in and two third of bridlington resident attend out patient appointment away from the town that be not acceptable and will not stand by and let it continue however part of the problem be that local member of parliament have very little if any direct influence over the direction of our health service which be why be appeal to the minister for his support believe that this be particularly timely in his recent report lord darzi describe the nhs as broken and in the case of bridlington he be correct he state that an age population be the most significant driver of increase healthcare need since it be associate with the development of long term condition and that by the time people be age majority will have at least one long term condition and some per cent will have two or more by the time people be age this rise to nearly per cent have two or more and by the time people be age or above out of will have at least one long term condition remind the house that one third of resident in bridlington be over lord darzi make the follow very pertinent observation at the high level the nhs have have the strategic intention to shift spending from reactive care in hospital to more proactive care in the community set but care have in fact move in the other direction that be very much the experience of my constituent the report also make it clear that care should be more join up or more integrated to reflect the fact the people live with long term condition need more support and variety of different physical and mental health professional and often rely on social care too the frequency of their interaction with the health service mean that their care be more complex and therefore require coordination finally on this point lord darzi be right to say that care should be deliver in the community close to where people live and work and that hospital should be reserve for specialist care this be more convenient for patient especially for those with long term condition who will need contact with the nhs more frequently would also like to refer the house to the chief medical officer annual report on health in coastal community in this insightful piece of work sir chris whitty note give the know high rate of preventable illness in these area the lack of available datum on the health of coastal community have be strike whilst research the report coastal community have be long overlook with limited research on their health and wellbeing the focus have tend towards inner city or rural area with too little attention give to the nation periphery he go on to add datum be rarely publish at geographical level granular enough to capture coastal outcome with most datum only available at local authority or clinical commissioning group ccg level as result deprivation and ill health at the coast be hide by relative affluence just inland which be lump together in conclusion he recommend give the health and wellbeing challenge of coastal community have more in common with one another than inland neighbour there should be national strategy to improve the health and wellbeing of coastal community unfortunately and perhaps as result of the health service work its way through the impact of the pandemic the report have be somewhat sideline and the recommendation have yet to be act upon so what should be the solution we need comprehensive strategy bring together all part of the health service that recognise the challenge and put together an immediate action plan the humber and north yorkshire integrate care board be try to address these issue but be concerned about exactly what its role be or should be some icb interpret their population health duty as require they to act upstream of healthcare need on the social determinant of health where the nhs have few direct lever other icb interpret their duty as require they to understand and adjust healthcare service to match the need of the population that they serve in line with the nhs operating framework some interpret they as both and other as neither prefer to focus on what they see as their traditional role of performance manage provider ultimately their role and responsibility need to be clarify so that they can be well hold to account this be not criticism of the performance of my local icb which be work hard to tackle the challenge but think we would all benefit from great clarity of purpose in conclusion we can not escape what be in front of we as one senior local authority figure comment to the health crisis in bridlington be not car crash wait to happen it be happen right now my appeal to the minister today be simple have no doubt that he have the very good of intention when it come to improve the nation health but realistically many of those ambition will take decade if he want to make real difference today will he please focus some of his department collective effort on tackle the enormous health inequality in seaside town such as bridlington and will he please take the recommendation of lord darzi and sir chris whitty and apply they to our town we be happy to be his pilot scheme or his trailblazer know that with the right energy and direction we will not be leave with generation of child who have never see dentist and we will not have elderly people travel long distance for regular routine appointment instead we will have health service to be proud of and happy and healthy local population implore the minister and his department to work with to ensure well future for the brilliant people of bridlington congratulate the hon member for bridlington and the wolds charlie dewhirst on secure the debate and on the constructive tone in which he put his comment forward this government be commit to fix our break health and care system as my right hon friend the secretary of state have say we will be honest about the problem face the nhs and serious about tackle they the hon gentleman be absolutely right to raise the problem in bridlington which sadly will be familiar to colleague right across the house the truth be that we be very far from where we need and want to be as he so rightly set out he talk lot about lord darzi report and be pleased that he have read it and appear to agree with the true extent of the challenge it set out even lord darzi with all his year of experience be shock by what he discover the report be vital because it give we the frank assessment we need to face the problem honestly and properly it will take decade of national renewal last reform and long term plan to save our nhs we have commit to three big shift from hospital to community from analogue to digital and from sickness to prevention our year plan will set out how we will deliver those shift to ensure that we have health and care system that be fit for the future in bridlington and across the united kingdom to develop that plan we must have meaningful conversation with the public and those who work in the health system we will conduct comprehensive range of engagement and consultation activity launch very soon bring in view from the public the health and care workforce national and local stakeholder and system leader importantly give the hon gentleman comment parliamentarian will also have an opportunity to feed into this important national conversation it will be the big national conversation about our health and care system since the nhs foundation in the government be commit to restore our health and care system to its found promise that it will be there for all our constituent when they need it hope that context help the hon gentleman to understand that we be take this very seriously and that we do not want to make policy in the ivory tower of westminster or whitehall this need to be national conversation feed into year plan that will be publish in the spring of next year will now address some of the hon gentleman specific point first share his concern about dentistry access the single big cause of child age between five and nine be admit to hospital be to have their rotten tooth take out which be frankly disgrace as the prime minister say few week ago it be soul destroy for those young people and it can so easily be prevent that be why we will work with the sector to reform the dental contract with focus on prevention and the retention of nhs dentist in the meantime we know that patient can not wait we will not wait to make improvement to increase access in the current system that be why we be work to deliver our rescue plan to provide more urgent dental appointment these will be available across the country include of course for the resident of bridlington be aware that an initial procurement for the additional service in bridlington be unsuccessful the icb have since review the specification and be work to far understand what may work well for the town with preferred option for procurement due to be approve this month unfortunately people across the country will recognise the picture that the hon gentleman describe of gp access in bridlington almost everywhere patient be find it increasingly difficult to see gp when they can not get an appointment the chance be that they will end up in accident and emergency this be unacceptable as it be bad for patient and more expensive for the taxpayer lord darzi be clear that the situation be particularly acute in certain area that speak to the hon gentleman point about health inequality and bridlington be one such area our plan start with recruit over newly qualified gps through an million boost to the additional role reimbursement scheme in the long term we be commit to training thousand more gps guarantee face to face appointment for all those who want one deliver modern appointment booking system to avoid the am scramble and ultimately shift resource from acute care into primary and community care the hon gentleman raise the recent merger of gp practice in bridlington where six practice have be consolidate into two large practice these decision be of course make by local commissioner who determine what service and care pathway well serve the need of patient in the area be pleased that performance have improve in both practice with one demonstrate some of the good access within the integrate care board footprint of course there be still issue and the people of bridlington deserve well which be why we be commit to deliver our plan for primary care the hon gentleman also mention bridlington hospital which currently provide range of service include an urgent treatment centre radiology rehabilitation in patient surgical ward and out patient clinic patient attend those service can and often do come from outside the bridlington area be aware that there be more space at the hospital that can be use and can assure he that we be look carefully at capital requirement as part of the spending review we will know more about that on october hope have address some of the hon gentleman concern absolutely agree with his view about health inequality and it be quite shocking to hear the difference between one ward and another in his constituency those gap have to be narrow and lot of this be about ensure that people be not only live long but live healthy life the increase in complex condition that we be now see at young age be create huge pressure on our health system and it be not good for his constituent either absolutely understand and see the context in which we be operate and that be top priority for the year health plan we be bring forward in conclusion thank the hon gentleman for bring forward the issue and give the opportunity to reiterate from the government dispatch box our promise to fix our break health and care system and deliver for people in bridlington and across yorkshire sadly the situation he describe resonate with the broad finding of lord darzi review the health and care system be in critical condition but assure he that this government be commit to get our healthcare system back on its foot and fit for the future on the particular issue of coastal town bridlington be not unique in the challenge it face will the minister pledge to look at the broad recommendation in sir chris whitty report of the hon gentleman make an important point one of the trend we be see be that an old demographic be move to coastal town those town be often most the challenge because they be under doctored dental desert and lacking in social care facility toxic combination be cause by the additional pressure bring by that demographic and lack of the require facility on the supply side the hon gentleman be right to identify the issue of coastal town know our chief medical officer chris whitty be alive to the issue and it will have to be factor into the year plan the year plan can not just be about the sector we be look at it be also about geography and the live experience of people in particular part of the country question put and agree to house adjourn
