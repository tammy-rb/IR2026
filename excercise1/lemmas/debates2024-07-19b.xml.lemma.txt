inquiry with permission mr speaker would like to make statement on the inquiry yesterday baroness hallett publish her report from the first module of the uk inquiry which examine the resilience and preparedness of the united kingdom between and early my thought and be sure the thought of the whole house be with the family of those who lose love one during the pandemic their grief and the nature of their loss be harrowing with so many loved one lose before their time so many heartbreaking last goodbye say over phone or ipad and in some case there be not even the chance to say goodbye at all so many friend and family member be deny even the chance to go to funeral and many other find their life change by covid forever we can only begin to imagine the anguish and anger that people feel because this report confirm what many have always believe that the country be not as prepare as it should have be and that more could and should have be do baroness hallett be unequivocal the uk be ill prepared for deal with catastrophic emergency let alone the coronavirus pandemic she find that process planning and policy across all four nation fail our citizen there be fundamental failure of state with poorly perform public service as well as health and social inequality contribute to our vulnerability the inquiry find that the uk prepare for the wrong pandemic with focus on influenza to the effective exclusion of other potential pathogen there be lack of leadership lack of appropriate challenge and oversight from ministers and official which allow major gap to open up in the uk resilience in the period lead up to the pandemic baroness hallett find fatal strategic flaw underpin the assessment of the risk and failure to learn sufficiently from past civil emergency exercise and outbreak of disease minister and official take false comfort from positive analysis of the uk preparedness not enough thought be give to how we might seek to prevent the bad effect of pandemic such as with system of test and trace rather than accept the consequence of spread as inevitable in this emergency the crack in our society be expose the inequality be glare and that weaken the response that be why the report finding on the most vulnerable be so important what it say about the elderly ethnic minority and those already subject to exist health inequality particularly in the early month of the pandemic those with high risk of serious illness who be ask to shield for extended period those live in overcrowded house work in the gig economy or on low income those who suffer as result of the appalling increase in domestic abuse during the lockdown and of course disruption to education and the inequality of vastly different access to online learning and it equipment resilience have to be for all of we not just some of we the underlying picture that this report set out be stark before the pandemic begin our public service be already stretch to their limit during what should have be normal time this be especially true of the nhs overstretch even before the pandemic hit and key worker in other service overburden in normal time and then ask to go above and beyond nation can only be as resilient as the foundational strength of its infrastructure and public service as stand here today with million people on nhs waiting list prison overflowing council push to the brink and public service in bad position than they be even in we must ensure that we be prepared baroness hallett say that it be not question of if another pandemic will strike but when resilience be not just about another pandemic but about the full range of risk that we face we be remind of that this morning as report come in about global it outage affect airline gp surgery bank medium and other organisation it be not easy to know what the future hold we can not plan fully for every possible risk but we must do what we can to learn the lesson of this period the government first responsibility be to keep the public safe that be top priority of this government with long term approach to strengthen our national resilience shall lead review of our national resilience against the range of risk that the uk face shall chair dedicated cabinet committee on resilience to oversee that work of course it be not just about central government so we will work with the devolved government regional mayor and local leader as we consider the report recommendation when we have an emergency we should do everything we can to work together locally and nationally the prime minister have already start to reset relationship with critical partner because resilience be too important for division to get in the way instead it have to be about co operative strength some improvement to our operational effectiveness have already be make the previous administration do make effort to improve preparedness these include change in the way that the government access analyse and share datum include with the public they also change the risk assessment process and the way in which the centre of government work to prepare for and respond to crisis as an incoming government in office for just two week we will look at those effort in the come month as we develop our own approach where thing be good they should be keep where they be not good enough they should be change the inquiry report recommend improvement in the way whole system risk be assess and manage across the uk government and the devolved government and improvement to the leadership and oversight provide by ministers the government will carefully consider all the finding and recommendation include any from the grenfell inquiry that also have bearing on resilience planning we will respond in full within six month we will also play our full part in international effort to improve global health and pandemic preparedness from disease surveillance and vaccine development to strengthen health system in the global south and build even great international co operation the united kingdom have huge amount to offer and it be in our national interest to do so because as we have see so powerfully pandemic do not respect international border so global health security be an essential element of national security wish to thank baroness hallett and her team for all their work so far and for put the voice of the bereaved

yesterday be deeply sobering it lay bare failure of the state in respect of planning challenge resourcing and leadership irrespective of government or party in power it be incumbent upon we all to consider it in the spirit in which lady hallett have put forward her recommendation be grateful to the right hon gentleman for his recognition of the work already do since the pandemic to improve resilience in this country and ensure that we be well prepared for the next one we start that work in government have announce the large overhaul of our resilience structure in decade we create the

to increase and improve the training of ministers mps civil servant and all those in civil society who respond to crisis we also announce new national exercise programme to test our system the chancellor of the duchy of lancaster highlight that the focus of previous pandemic preparedness planning be around influenza it be see in the context of operation cygnus which be often point to as the blueprint of how to prepare for these thing the right hon gentleman be right that it focus on influenza for which we have therapeutic in the case of the covid pandemic we do not as country and civil society we need to look completely across the piece at how we can well prepare for whatever eventuality may occur in set out his next step the right hon gentleman adopt exactly the right approach be grateful to he for that and for his candour there will be many more lesson still to learn it be incredibly important for our country this government and any future government that we learn the lesson to ensure that we be ready for future pandemic however painful those lesson be be also grateful for the right hon gentleman commitment to respond swiftly have few question for the right hon gentleman what plan do he have to consult the devolved administrations and local government structure on the detailed change propose to how they would operate in the context of future emergency what step will he and the government be take to ensure that our emergency planning structure be more cohesively join up if our country be to face another pandemic more importantly want to conclude by say that we stand ready to work constructively and openly with the right hon gentleman and the government in the national interest to ensure that as country we learn the lesson from this module and from lady

lancaster look forward to work with he in the national interest and to build resilience for the future thank the right hon gentleman for his response and for the tone in which he speak he set out what the previous government have do and in my statement acknowledge that progress have be make but think it be also right that new government take the opportunity to have fresh look at this with fresh eye and in the right spirit the right hon gentleman ask couple of question on consultation with the devolved administration yes that be essential as be consultation within england with local authority and elect mayor it be important that different part of the country work together when there be national emergency there be also question about how this operate within government and the balance of responsibility between the centre and individual government departments baroness hallett be quite clear that in truly national emergency the centre have to step up and responsibility can not be leave to individual departments the right hon gentleman be right to conclude with the spirit of co operation that we need on this issue this work be in the national interest and in the public interest it be the first duty of any government of any political stripe to do what they can to protect the public the challenge be that the risk we face be more complex and more unpredictable than they have be in the past as say in my statement we can not fully plan for every risk but we have to try to have system in place that give we the well possible chance of planning for the risk we can see in front of we thank my right hon friend for his statement like everyone my thought be with the many victim who tragically lose their life take this opportunity to pay tribute to the hard work staff at st thomas hospital in my constituency who care for so many people in their last dying day and who care for the former prime minister when he catch you will be aware mr speaker that the national covid memorial wall be in my constituency stark reminder of the many life that be lose each heart painstakingly paint by family member and dedicate to their lose one it be reminder of the many life that be lose will my right hon friend visit the covid memorial wall with and meet the family and look at how we can make that wall permanent this be not just about resilience but about remember those victim who tragically lose their life my hon friend be absolutely right to pay tribute to the staff at st thomas and other nhs staff across the country who do so much to care for people during that very difficult period have visit the memorial wall in her constituency and she be right it be an incredibly moving and human experience be very happy to take up her invitation to visit again call the lib dem spokesperson be cover for our spokesperson who sadly can not be here today start by pay tribute to baroness hallett and all those who have painfully give evidence to this inquiry it will not have be easy for they and our heart go out to they this will be painful day the inquiry damn finding confirm in clear term what we unfortunately already know and this must be moment for change the country be badly let down during the pandemic and this new government must ensure that lesson be learn swiftly the liberal democrats call for this inquiry back in and we will continue to demand that the full fact be know about every aspect of this catastrophic failure one area of particular focus be the lack of leadership provide by the then conservative government the inquiry find that proper scrutiny and accountability be often miss by ministers that be why back benchers across this house set up the all party parliamentary group on coronavirus which be privileged to chair over month we hear from frontline worker public health professional and bereaved family and there be deep frustration that they could see what be go wrong but it be fall on deaf ear in whitehall this be moment to change how politic work and hope the chancellor of the duchy of lancaster and the government will work across the aisle what will the government do to ensure that the right voice be in the room for future such health emergency and do they agree that we need commissioner for ageing and old people as the liberal democrats have be advocate care home be another area of critical failure many of those victim die not directly from covid but because of the lack of care do the government agree that patient and care home resident should be give new legal right to maintain contact in all health and care setting the third area that have be under report be long covid many of we will remember stand in the cold in november bang on our drum for frontline worker yet they have not receive compensation for disability that have put they out of their beloved profession will the cabinet office work with the department for work and pensions to progress the compensation scheme that be in train and to gather the right evidence to ensure that we get it right ahem very finally on the memorial will the minister implement the recommendation in the final report of the uk commission on covid commemoration order may just say to the front benchers that we be all learn but we should do so by set the good example you be mean to have two minute not three please can we help each other otherwise will have member complain that they do not get in thank the hon member for her question and the spirit in which she ask they the truth be that it be easy for any of we to say lesson must be learn and whenever anything go wrong people say that the proof be in the practice will it be show in practice that be the ultimate test for we all be happy to confirm to the hon member that just as say to the opposition spokesperson yes we be happy to work across the aisle on this and to consider suggestion my colleague at the department for culture media and sport be consider the recommendation on the memorial the minister speak of resilience he be aware that northwick park hospital in my constituency be the epicentre at the start of the pandemic and the lack of resilience mean that nurse there have to wear bin bag to protect themselves note that he speak of grenfell in his statement that be fundamentally important because this be not simply about resilience in health in that regard ask he to look at the issue of reinforce autoclaved aerate concrete the same raac that cause problem in our school be use in many housing development at the time we need to be resilient to any potential disaster in that respect too echo my hon friend tribute to the work of the nhs staff in his constituency raac in public building be part of the government inheritance just because the problem have slip down the news agenda somewhat that do not mean that it have go away in time we will have to address it to ensure that such building whether housing accommodation or public building be safe for people to live in work in and be treat in congratulate the chancellor of the duchy of lancaster on his new role and welcome the tone of his statement the report be stark reminder if any be need that even the most eminent and public spirited scientist can occasionally be wrong when groupthink affect assumption what can the government do to ensure that ministers and parliamentarian have access to the wide possible range of advice include where appropriate dissent voice across whole range of issue the hon member be right that groupthink be identify in the report so it be important for the government to have access to the wide range of advice but no part of that for or the government will be about engage in anti science rhetoric or anything of that nature diversity of view yes denial of the fact no thank my right hon friend for his statement yesterday evening walk alongside the covid memorial wall and be move by the number of heart each one represent someone who die from covid extend my sympathy to all the bereaved family who lose love one many people of all age continue to suffer the consequence of the lack of resilience and preparedness due to long covid so will my right hon friend reassure members that those child and adult who continue to suffer with long covid such as the young granddaughter of one of my constituent in shipley will not be forget as the inquiry continue its work thank my hon friend for her question again echo her comment on the memorial wall follow the election we have lot of new member in the house if any of they find themselves with spare hour they could do lot bad than go to the memorial wall contemplate and look at the outpouring of grief that be reflect on that wall my hon friend be absolutely right about long covid which mention in my opening remark when we think about the pandemic of course we think about those who be lose and their family but there be also people several year on from the pandemic who be still live with those consequence thank the minister for his statement as the former minister of health in northern ireland who serve during the pandemic my thought and condolence be with those who be lose and those who be bereaved and pay tribute of thank to those who work across health and social care during that try time the minister say that resilience have to be for all of we not just for some ask he to ensure that all the devolved nation be equally involved he talk about there be consultation with the devolved nation and region can ask for it to be more than just consultation and for it actually to be partnership thank the hon member for his comment he be quite right this report cover all part of the united kingdom and it make real effort to do so the new prime minister also make an effort to do so in the day follow the election and one of his first priority be to visit northern ireland agree with the hon member about co operation think it be essential small difference sometimes act to the detriment of the whole effort welcome my right hon friend and near neighbour to his place like so many family my family be affect by the death of love one during the pandemic and small heart on the national memorial wall reflect my auntie for time immemorial do my right hon friend agree that procurement during state of emergency such as the pandemic be important and that any fraud that occur must be pursue ruthlessly thank my hon friend for his question and ask that he accept my condolence on the loss of his auntie during the pandemic he be absolutely right to draw our attention to the procurement issue that have be highlight they be not specifically cover in this report but they will be as he will be aware this government will bring forward proposal for covid fraud commissioner to recover as much as we can of the money that be lose to fraud or waste during that period welcome the statement from the chancellor of the duchy of lancaster and be particularly pleased to hear he talk about the role of local government local government be instrumental in the response and imagine the inquiry will find that have it have great role there would have be well resilience however as we know local government financing be in crisis my own local council be try to save million this year what reassurance can he give we that local council will be give the funding they need to have in place the resilience we need for the future the hon member be right to praise the role of local government my experience in wolverhampton be that the council step up and do fantastic job for local citizen during the pandemic the financial position of local government be difficult the financial position on number of thing be difficult be afraid the truth be that can not stand here and promise to write big cheque for everything we do not say that we would do that during the election and we will have to operate with difficult very difficult economic inheritance everything that we do have to be underpin by economic stability and financial responsibility tough as that is be afraid that we have see the consequence of do otherwise all too clearly in recent year in her report baroness hallett say the uk government pandemic strategy from be outdate and lack adaptability it be virtually abandon on its first encounter with the pandemic can my right hon friend give an assurance that any future strategy will be robust and will be update regularly one of the thing that baroness hallett advise in her report be that every three year there be proper exercise to test any plan and see whether it be fit for purpose that be an important recommendation to take away and consider it be difficult to plan for every possible risk this be not an easy thing to do but it be really important to try to have the good possible system in place between the centre of government between the departments and as we have say between local authority and the devolve administrations too may thank the right hon gentleman for the constructive way in which this have be approach look both at the thing that go well and at the thing we need to learn have external scrutiny from the covid inquiry provide that lens as the government look at the recommendation and begin to put plan in place some of that will build on the work that be already be do and some as he say will be on thing that need to improve suggest that external scrutiny of the government response be equally important will he ask lord norton statutory inquiries committee to monitor the government response to the covid inquiry scrutiny be always good and be sure that what we do will be scrutinise it be really important to have proper dialogue with the public about these thing because it do no harm for we as citizen and as government ministers to have conversation about resilience about what we do in an emergency and about we think about that we do not want to frighten anybody but it be good thing to do and it be proper role for government to have good dialogue with the public about this visit the wall this week and it be stark reminder of my own experience during the pandemic be an operating department practitioner and work in emergency maternity theatre during that time from day one there be next to no strategy staff be fight over inadequate personal protective equipment we try to speak up but we be not hear we be give out of date mask gown that be ill fitting and visor that just fall off our face even when colleague sadly lose their life to the disease the chaos continue sit with new mother hold their hand because their partner be not allow to be with they we stand by the bedside of colleague on life support as they lose their battle with covid even now staff be traumatise all over again when people who have wait so long for treatment can not be help will this government ensure that nhs staff can have an input in future pandemic planning as it be we who know how good to protect our patient be very very grateful to my hon friend for reflect her experience there be nothing that can add to the power of her word she be absolutely right that in planning for future pandemic we have to listen to the voice of the staff who be the people the country will rely on if we face any kind of similar emergency in future member on both side of the house will recognise that child and young people really feel the impact of the pandemic and the lockdown on their mental health their learning and their social and emotional development we all recognise that executive decision have to be take in an emergency to protect child and staff in school but think the public be aghast that pub and zoo open before our school and college will the right hon gentleman committee look at put proper process in place potentially designate school and college as national critical infrastructure with this house take vote on any extended lockdown of our school and college if those ever need to be put in place and with evidence take from the children commissioner and our school and college leader the hon lady be right to draw attention to the pandemic impact on education through lose learning and as say in my statement the great inequality that child suffer as result of differential access to online learning do they have good wi fi connection at home do they have the equipment be the school fully gear up to provide online learning the answer for some child to some of those question be yes but the answer for lot of child be no it be really important in future planning that if we have to make change we ensure that it do not reinforce inequality but help everyone put on record my gratitude for the service of the staff at the hospital of st cross and of other healthcare worker and volunteer across my constituency of rugby do my right hon friend agree that failure of state in the pandemic and in other case have often be due to under investment and an ideological suspicion of the state among some include regrettably some member of the last government do he agree that party that put service first and that believe in invest in our health service and wide government will ensure that this country be far well ready for future crisis my hon friend talk about failure of state and that be the essential finding in baroness hallett report there be failure of state he also mention ideology try in my statement to make it clear that we would not take an ideological approach and that where the last government have do good thing in response to the pandemic we would keep they but also think that change of government after such long period in power be an opportunity for fresh eye not necessarily in partisan way but have different set of people to look at what have be do keep what be good and change thing if need be that be one of the advantage of change of government regardless of political colour after one have be in office for so many year thank my right hon friend for his statement and welcome his announcement of review of national resilience do he agree that the many legacy of the pandemic be still very much with we from the awful personal impact of bereavement and long covid to the terrible public service impact on everything from school readiness to social care system and more do he agree that those impact be bad than they need have be as set out by baroness hallett yesterday in that spirit do he agree that this government work of renewal must necessarily also be work of repair my hon friend talk about the legacy and yes they be very much still here in term of vulnerability and exposure baroness hallett also mention the different impact on different ethnic minority community when say that resilience must be for everyone that be also what be talk about it have to be for everyone young and old and regardless of their ethnic background sometimes there be vulnerability particularly in the early month of the pandemic that expose inequality in that regard and that should give we all pause for thought thank my right hon friend for his statement and welcome he to his place may also thank baroness hallett and her team and associate myself with the comment that everyone here have make to the victim the bereaved family and frontline worker as my right hon friend say the voice of the bereaved be at the heart of this report and that be right can he assure that when the government be reflect on the recommendation that same spirit will be apply so that those insight go into the government response baroness hallett deserve credit for put the voice of the bereaved up front if anyone have look at the actual report they will find that before we even get into the recommendation finding and so on there be quote from the bereaved that bring home exactly what these loss of love one mean to people and the last impact of that here we be some four year on from the beginning of it recognise the conclusion in baroness hallett clear report and thank she for it in cornwall our peripherality make it so much hard our local authority public health test and trace be halt by the government on march when few than half dozen case be in existence in cornwall ppe come very slowly citizen be make mask and some councillor and officer drive up to exeter to pick up some care home and worker in particular be slow to get ppe in many care home in my constituency there be tragic result will we ensure that local authority public health director can be more involved with decision making and set up local solution such as test and trace my hon friend be right to highlight the issue of care home where it be such difficult situation throughout the pandemic we be try to get the right ppe to the staff it be huge problem during the early week of the pandemic remember raise question about that and it just expose what scramble for safety there be particularly in the early month she be right to urge we to learn the lesson from that thank my right hon friend for his statement mr speaker as you will have notice and as other people have refer to the report state that there be failure to engage appropriately with local government in prepare for the pandemic sadly that failure continue throughout the pandemic have the dubious pleasure of be the cabinet member for health and social care in hammersmith and fulham council throughout the pandemic we have to fight to close our care home because the hospital under instruction from the government be discharge resident without testing and would not listen to we and would not stop we have to fight to get vaccination in our local pharmacy and we have to fight to establish local test and trace system which then reach of people when the government be only reach do my right hon friend agree that further stage of the inquiry or what the government now do should identify and learn from the previous government failure to engage appropriately with the local authority not only before but during the pandemic the point that my hon friend make about local government be well make as have say my experience in my local authority area be that think the local council step up sometimes the issue of who be vulnerable and where they be be much easy for local authority to know than central government the spirit of co operation that call for in my opening statement be in the public interest and the national interest and it be what we have to do if we co operate we will be strong thank my right hon friend for an important statement and welcome he to his new role like many of we in this room during the pandemic lose good friend and harlow lose an incredible councillor in councillor frances mason an incredible community champion who serve her community until the very end in my constituency nhs staff at princess alexandra hospital be on the frontline during this terrible period their feedback to be that the government initial response to covid be too slow and fail to recognise the seriousness of the issue do my right hon friend agree let offer my hon friend my condolence on the loss of his colleague frances mason he be right to pay tribute to nhs staff baroness hallett have set out number of failing whether speed leadership or co ordination it be important that we try to learn lesson from this and we intend to do that thank my right hon friend for his statement may associate myself with the comment make today about the bereaved and the integral role of our public sector worker throughout the pandemic local government worker across paisley and renfrewshire south be on the frontline during the pandemic they establish temporary mortuary to bury our dead and they look after the child of key worker so that they could go to work could my right hon friend say little more about how to ensure that local authority will be treat as an integral partner in our resilience planning and the response that be about not just their funding but the respect with which they be treat by government could he assure we that in that spirit of co operation across the four nation barnett consequential give to the scottish government will be pass on to their intended recipient my hon friend be right to draw attention to the important role of local authority as other hon member have hope that have make it clear in my statement and in my response today that this must be an effort by the whole united kingdom central government devolve governments and local authority in every part of the country we be strong together thank my right hon friend for his statement and baroness hallett for her important report on the doorstep of camborne redruth and hayle the anger and grief be still palpable where be the accountability from ministers where be the leadership royal cornwall hospital nhs trust be on high alert before the pandemic hit be it not the case that our nhs be desperately struggle year before through mismanagement from the conservative party and that life be unnecessarily lose because of it careful preparedness planning and management of our nhs and social care service must be top priority for this government my hon friend be right that the nhs be in vulnerable position before the pandemic which be why the long term health of the nhs be so important my right hon friend the secretary of state for health and social care have begin that process have to be honest with the house well long term strength for the nhs will not happen overnight but it should still be an important aim for we welcome my right hon friend to his place on the front bench and thank he for his statement he touch on victim of what have be label the shadow pandemic the surge in domestic violence during lockdown do he agree that any lesson learn must include action to protect those for whom the instruction stay at home be the most dangerous they can receive thank my hon friend for his question he highlight very important issue that speak about in my opening remark it be an important aim of this government to reduce violence against woman and girl can assure he that the minister put in charge of that will champion the cause with passion and determination that think and really hope will lead to result home should be place of safety sadly as he rightly point out during the pandemic that be not the case for some thank my right hon friend for his statement we all have story from the pandemic about how we and our family be affect that be as true for member as it be for constituent right across the country my family be on the other side of the england wales border and my stepfather be diagnose with multiple sclerosis during the pandemic be not able to visit he and provide the support to my mother that our family need will my right hon friend assure that we will create join up national strategy as he rightly note the pandemic do not pay attention to our national border will he assure that we will work very closely with scientist to ensure that there be national strategy move forward thank my hon friend who highlight the difficulty people have in not be able to visit relative and so on be join up across the uk be really important as say there be no place in this kind of planning to let what be sometimes small difference get in the way we have to work together in co operative way we be strong together module of the report find that pandemic planning do not take pre exist health inequality into account in my constituency those inequality be particularly wide as we see at grenfell tower welcome the minister statement that the grenfell inquiry recommendation will be incorporate into the government response do he agree that in that response we must have far well plan for protect the most vulnerable in our society who be often the most disproportionately affected be grateful to my hon friend for his mention of the grenfell inquiry as say it be important to take its finding into account it be also true that pre exist inequality leave people more vulnerable national emergency like this expose weak point and bring they into the glaring public light and they weaken the response of the whole country the truth be that we have strong response as country if we manage to reduce inequality be they on the basis of ethnic minority or of income thank my right hon friend for his statement to build on the previous question bereaved families for justice uk have say that module of the report do not go far enough in look at inequality give the high incidence of diabete and other long term health condition in the south asian community in particular in my constituency and the disproportionately high covid death rate among disabled black and asian people what assessment have he make of the deep structural inequality in the health of the nation after year of conservative inaction that cause we to be less prepared for and that ultimately lead to unnecessary death be grateful to my hon friend for her question she be quite right to point out that the prevalence of particular health condition can be high in one part of the community as have say few time today the inequality expose in the pandemic make the response weak than it might have be if we be to be strong and well able to handle an emergency like this in the future we have to address those inequality that be not just in the interest of those it will help directly but in the interest of all of we because when it come to emergency like this we be all in it together israel and gaza with permission mr speaker shall make statement on the middle east be very disappointed to miss yesterday foreign affair debate due to the european political community summit and welcome this early opportunity to come to the house last weekend visit israel and the occupied palestinian territories meet leader on both side my right hon friend the prime minister have also speak to both prime minister netanyahu and president abbas and have discuss the issue with colleague from the and of course the region this have be priority from day one because of the desperate situation in gaza and the serious risk of escalation in lebanon in particular must be frank britain want an immediate ceasefire the fighting must stop the hostage must be release much much more aid must enter gaza israel promise flood of aid back in april but impose impossible and unacceptable restriction and there must be de escalation on the israeli lebanese border sincerely hope the party will agree ceasefire as matter of urgency have be discuss with partner the need for

signify our commitment to two state solution which be to recognise the palestinian state on border ireland spain and norway do it in may will he consider it if not why not prime minister netanyahu of

be grateful to the hon lady for her remark welcome she the green party representative for north herefordshire to the house as say in my remark this be one of the tough neighbourhood in the world israel be surround by people who would see its annihilation it be be attack by the houthis hezbollah be fire missile and hamas want to wipe it off the map for those reason it would not be right to

welcome my right hon friend to his place and congratulate he on behalf of my constituent in warwick and leamington on give priority to this issue commend he for today announcement the restoration of

ceasefire because only with ceasefire can reconstruction work begin my right hon friend be absolutely right to speak of the need for an immediate ceasefire and the need to restore funding to unrwa welcome both those move he also speak of the government need to make an assessment of israeli compliance with international humanitarian law in gaza but the question then arise after that assessment have be make what be go to happen he say in his statement that the horror must end now and indeed it must but he have just explain to the hon member for north herefordshire ellie chowns that to cease supply arm to israel would cause as he see it great problem what be the leverage that he have if the horror must end now and it must then this government must be able to take some action once they have review and receive the legal assessment that he have call for be prepared to give he time to get that assessment but want to know what he be go to do once he have get it my hon friend be very experienced experience enough to know that the minute any individual describe their leverage that leverage be lose therefore if he will forgive will not share that at the dispatch box at this stage however the passion that lie behind his question be concern that for nine month foreign secretaries have stand at this dispatch box and say that the aid must get in and that we must follow international humanitarian law and now month later there be new foreign secretary at the dispatch box and there be still serious concern about international humanitarian law and the aid have simply

that we will have to work with our international partner to build my hon friend have get off to good start she be right first because we have see so many aid worker lose their life and secondly because her emphasis on the partnership that we have to strike with ally across the world be essential if we be to see the change that we need particularly in gaza but also in the occupied territories it be very welcome to see the secretary of state and his team on the front bench as britain voice in the world that have particular significance for as one of my predecessor in the livingston constituency be robin cook know robin cook time in office and his thinking do much to inform the secretary of state approach to his new role this statement be incredibly welcome although it set out the horrific situation on the ground in gaza do the secretary of state agree that there be no peace without two state solution and that oppose two state solution be wrong for both israelis and the palestinian people be very grateful to have be ask question by the new occupant of robin cook seat he be stalwart and champion of this cause be grateful to come into this house when he be serve as foreign secretary and in an article write recently in foreign affairs pay tribute to his work over many year the vote by the knesset yesterday be hugely disappointing we believe passionately in two state say to those who reject two state if you be proponent of one state you have to explain how everyone enjoy equality under the law and if you be proponent of no state you be effectively suggest that occupation continue that be unacceptable would have think to all member of this house congratulate my right hon friend on become foreign secretary and welcome his statement outline the

and camberwell green would say on point welcome my right hon friend to his position and the restoration of funding to unrwa it be good to see that when we talk about change at the election we also mean in the international approach of the government know that he will share the house revulsion at the ongoing horror face by hostage their family and the innocent civilian in gaza face this endure crisis that revulsion be share by many people in my peterborough constituency it be privilege to be voice for they in call for ceasefire the release of hostage peace and complete solution to recognise palestine what message would he send to constituent of mine who have for too long hear discussion about two state solution to say that this time with new government we have new approach to deal with the immediate crisis and achieve the recognition of palestine my hon friend know that know peterborough very well have spend seven year of my life in that great cathedral city have knock on door with he and know that this be an issue of great concern there we be absolutely committed to the two state solution the global community have for too many year talk about it but not act and recognise that there be now almost tremendous cynicism when that phrase be use but there be no way out of this crisis without plan for afterwards that plan must of course guarantee the security of israel but the palestinian cause be just cause and we must work with arab partner and build up the palestinian authority speak to they at length about what more we can do to assist they with the reform that they need to make so that we can realise that my hon friend be absolutely right to put on record our deep concern for the hostage their family and their plight if they be release we could end this now

with partner in the region talk to they about the future all of they want to be engage want peace and want to move towards process of normalisation but they be all crystal clear that that can not happen by ignore the plight of the palestinian people or without set up road map to two state they be not prepared to reconstruct gaza for this to happen yet again in year time so we have to work with they they play critical role but we must now get that immediate ceasefire welcome the foreign secretary and his team to their place and strongly welcome the decision announce today to restore funding for unrwa which will be recognise by many people in south birmingham as an important step among many other towards end the horror that we see today in gaza the israeli government decision to end the legal route for palestinians to work in israel have play an important role in the entrenchment of poverty and political instability in the west bank alongside the illegal settlement programme will the

see we want to see more local plan and more engagement with local leader so that we can build the house that people want in their area work together with they the hon gentleman talk about the green belt but we have be very clear on the grey belt as well we will not get the housing we need just from brownfield site although brownfield will be first we will work with local leader because the mandate the british people give we at this election be to get the housing that britain need be afraid that the last tory government do not take this issue on but fail people and we have chronic housing shortage everyone should have place to call home and we will legislate to make that happen our renter right bill will give protection and security to tenant as well as responsible landlord level the play field we will plug the gap leave by the last government leasehold and freehold reform act tackle unregulated and unaffordable ground rent and strengthen leaseholder right our planning and infrastructure bill will provide the extra home we need unblock stall development site and unveil the next generation of new town my constituency have vast swathe of high risk flood area zone and and we see flooding every year we see it most notably in but also in january will the right hon lady planning reform protect area at high risk of flooding so that they be not build on make our flooding bad order we have lot of speaker to get through include some maiden speaker so urge front benchers to make short speech and take few intervention otherwise we be not go to get through these maiden speaker thank you mr deputy speaker will take your advice and apologise to member for the fact that will not take more intervention we have to grapple with these issue and work with those in these area obviously flooding have be major issue and the government will look at it it be devastating to people when their home be flood and we have to look at these thing in the round when look at planning we will unveil the next generation of new town and we will learn the lesson of the past to create safe and beautiful home and the sustainable green community of the future this government be fully commit to the target set under the environment act and we will work closely with my right hon friend the environment secretary to ensure that we protect the environment and nature we will work with local leader to ensure that these town meet our gold standard of have genuinely affordable housing with home for social rent priority in some place we will extend urban area and regenerate they so that everyone benefit from well public transport and extra public service we be build not just home but community our first port of call will be brownfield land previously use land will be develop first wherever possible and those site will be fast track but brownfield development alone will not meet the country increase urgent need the green belt be design for england in the middle of the century it be right to keep that principle but make it relevant for today that be why we will release low quality grey belt site disuse car park and garage and ugly wasteland to meet the need of our golden rule will require developer to enhance local nature and public access to green space and provide the local service for community everyday need such as school and gp surgery we will also reverse the damaging change that the previous government make last december while they backtrack in the face of vested interest and scrap mandatory housing target labour will govern in the national interest and take the tough choice to get britain building we will do so under an update national planning policy framework which we will have by the end of this month because the current system just be not work either for housing at local level or for project at national level these be project such as data centre lab and research site which should unleash modern economy not to mention large scale project that help improve the environment onshore wind be the cheap form of electricity go but planning policy have effectively ban it for nearly decade we be start it up again and we will go far as part of our plan for cheap household bill and achieve net zero we be take the brake off the planning system in the first three month of this year just fifth of major application be determine within the week period as for nationally significant infrastructure the average time for consent be now more than four year compare to two and half year as recently as our bill will speed up and streamline the process from start to finish it will modernise plan committee and increase the capacity of our local planning authority by reform compulsory purchase it will support land assembly for development in the public interest we will unblock new grid connection road railway and reservoir game change reform for national renewal the leader of our community be well place to take forward that mission and be delighted to invite our mayor to downing street with the prime minister day into labour government they represent our big city and our most beautiful countryside and know only too well the diverse challenge that our people need to overcome there be now so many labour mayor that have lose count of how many we have also note the positive word from ben houchen about the constructive engagement that local leader have already experience under this new government along with their local citizen we will give they big say on how to transform their neighbourhood and high street we will hand they the power to transform their region so that they become the good place for people to live work and enjoy we be under no illusion about the hard yard need to repair the economic and social damage that the last government leave behind as my right hon friend the chancellor have say we have the bad inheritance since the second world war back then it be labour that rebuild britain from the rubble of war create the nhs the welfare state and council home for our return hero it will be labour government who now rebuild britain once again it be delight to be back at the dispatch box and have be look forward to speak opposite the right hon lady for very long time she and have never really meet and certainly never speak to each other despite be in this house together for seven year we have some thing in common although not much we be both bear in although be old and wise than she be people often think we be both much young than we really be because we have get such great skin and good hair and we be both know as be quite feisty be really pleased to be able to congratulate she on her elevation to secretary of state and deputy prime minister this be phenomenal achievement she will be great inspiration to young people particularly young woman in many community across the country that be wonderful thing that be the sort of britain we be where people from all walk of life can grow up and reach the top it be an extraordinary story dare say it of conservative success because unlike the right hon lady grow up under conservative government with welfare state that provide safety net strong economy and opportunity mostly grow up in nigeria under socialist military government who use lot of the rhetoric that hear she promote when she be sit on the opposition benches she may not credit the conservative for what she have achieve but we will take some of the credit anyway would like to extend very warm welcome to the right hon lady on her first outing as minister in the chamber because it will only be downhill from here the thing be have be secretary of state and after five year as minister one learn thing or two about government that can not be learn in opposition have be there and do it and can tell the right hon lady that she have be stitch up it be quite clear that the bills and policy from the king speech that she just reference be write not by she but by the chancellor and her adviser we all know that because we watch the chancellor announce they in far more detail in her speech last week all the stuff that the secretary of state work on in opposition such as her new deal for worker have be take off she and give to the business secretary be sorry to tell the right hon lady that her colleague the prime minister the chancellor and their many adviser have write manifesto and make promise that be not deliverable and they have hang they around her neck and say ange you go out there and you sell it be sad to see many of her shadow team not sit beside she as ministers they work for free grind in opposition for year only to watch the child of the choose one get the ministerial car and salary before their maiden speech be write wow sue gray be lot nice to when she work in my department think we know who be in charge and it be not the right hon lady she have be stitch up her colleague have make she the fall guy the government have promise million house by the end of this parliament over house per day and we be already two week in as she go on day after day she will realise that backlog be build and there be no way out want she to know that be here for she will be here to hold her hand and walk she through what be likely to be very difficult time may even give she some tip because have work in that department know what need to be do know what we should have do but do not do and know that the labour government will make the same mistake it be not that million home by the end of this parliament be unachievable but it will require the sort of systemic change that labour members be not ready for know that because of how they vote in the last parliament and how they campaign in their own constituency will not read out the long list of all the cabinet member who have be oppose planning in their backyard include the housing minister many of they think that they would get into government and concrete over lot of tory constituency three week ago just of the green belt be in labour constituency now it be they be not tory constituency now they be labour hon member hear hear yes they be labour say to labour members they be now your voter and your electorate and you go to have to tell they that you go to do something that many of you promise locally that you would never do not that long ago however mostly it will not be the problem of the cabinet who will look after themselves it will be the back benchers all those bright shiny face see sit behind the right hon lady who be really excited to be here they have not start get those angry email that we have be reply to for year many of those voter on whom their narrow slim majority now rely will be write to they in the spirit of sisterly support will let the right hon lady know what will happen over the next few week and month labour members be look so nervous right now the right hon lady will have consultation period which will take this long then she will have to respond to that consultation which will take that long assume that nothing go wrong with either of those process we reach december or january six month will have of the parliament and the government will not have build any extra home at this point she will be run home behind the target every single day and they would not have start build properly interruption the minister of state in the ministry of housing communities and local government the hon member for greenwich and woolwich matthew pennycook be chuntere from sedentary position you wait and see we have see we have be there we know you do and as it become clear to their voter what be happen in their new labour constituency for which congratulation in the green belt those mp be go to receive lot more email mean lot more they be go to want lot of public meeting because they will know that the decision she announce be now be take out of local hand and make by central government and the only way that they can register their concern be by appeal to their local mp who will all be appeal to she well this be what be in power be government be about make difficult decision opposition be easy we have be watch labour do it for year and it have spend all that time tell the people of this country that they will do well so here be the record that they be go to have to beat we build million new home in the course of the last parliament while safeguard the green belt and million since despite covid we deliver nearly new affordable home and over of those be for social rent we put in place the billion affordable home programme do the right hon lady even know yet if the chancellor will give she up to billion she be go to need lot more than that if she be go to beat our record and let we not forget what labour do just last year we have majority in this house but not in the other place where they whip labour lords to vote against an amendment on nutrient neutrality use new brexit power to unlock home many new member do not see that happen they be go to find it shocking we legislate for that and they block it destructive opposition be they go to reverse that decision have feeling they will not and that be why be worried about the right hon lady be she go to be able to face down her back benchers or will labour carry on not do the thing that have to be do in order to build home let we look at labour record the right hon lady talk about what happen after the last world war in the year to june when everybody here be alive and they be last in government they only build new home the low level of housebuilding since the and what be they do where they currently be in government in london sadiq khan have fail to hit his own target begin just new home in despite we give he pot and pot of money we be force to intervene on his housebuilding failure why have he not build on all those car park that she be talk about in her speech in wales the labour administration promise to deliver new home for social rent by they have barely deliver quarter the right hon lady may pretend that building home be easy but labour know it be not easy because they fail in london and they fail in wales and they be already make new mistake we all know that immigration increase housing demand just this week we hear that they be go to be fast track illegal immigrant who already land here if they be permit to stay they will require permanent housing we put the rwanda scheme in place to limit illegal immigration they have scrap it with no plan whatsoever to tackle the problem have she get home ready for the people the home secretary be go to be fast track through if not she be already home down on the target the prime minister have set for she so that be why be feel very generous towards the right hon lady because she have be stitch up she be go to need some friend and want she to know that we be all here for she laughter some people think opposition be about throw mud across the chamber or call your opponent scum but often it be about say tell you so want to reassure the right hon lady that will be here to say tell you so when these target be miss we of course will be constructive opposition we want to see home build in the right place with the right infrastructure we be here to help doubt the same can be say of the big local nimbys in the country the liberal democrats there be many more of they now you would know it but there be usually elect on promise not to build anything anywhere in their community in the last parliament watch they oppose plan reform on permit development reform that would have allow we to build on land that be already in use it will be very interesting to see how they square their nimby tendency with their manifesto promise but then again say one thing and do another have never bother the liberal democrats the right hon lady will not get any help from they but we be here for she have hear some of labour plan introduce mandatory target while introduce new regulatory cost will not work without taxpayer funding labour affordable housing target be unviable where be that money go to come from the mandate that labour want to enforce imply consequence for miss the target what will that consequence be for local council be labour go to scrap the neighbourhood plan that community have put together to deliver more home what will those council say when they be force to do thing that they promise they would not do just eight week ago we have hear from labour members that they will introduce mechanism for override local decision make to identify the land for development that be fine but identify land do not mean that home or infrastructure will be build look forward to the second reading of the right hon lady bill when she will have to explain the plan that the chancellor and her spad have write up for she and she can tell we in great technical detail how they will be deliver although suspect that she will leave the tricky stuff to her junior ministers we conservatives may not be as many as we use to be but we still know all the stuff that we learn over year as we deliver million home we know where the difficulty be and we know the technicality the right hon lady be just learn we will be ready and wait to show that she and her party have make promise that they can not keep and in many case have no idea what they be do the labour government have tough act to they do however imitation be the sincere form of flattery and be pleased to see that they have be copy and paste many of the policy that we have in government we introduce metro mayor with substantial power now they be announce that they be go to do more we put billion of level up funding into community back metro mayor such as ben houchen let we see whether labour will follow that for all its new mayor in the last local government finance settlement we make billion pound available to local authority increase in cash term let we see whether labour top that rather than just move money from one part of the country to another we would like to see the labour government get the holocaust memorial bill which we initiate on to the statute book as the prime minister promise and we will support they in that we must do right by our jewish community and we provide record level of funding to protect they from harm and extremism we take decisive action to tackle grow sectarianism so we be disappoint not to see any mention in the king speech of how labour would continue that in the election we see independent mp win seat from labour on the back of sectarianism and integration failure problem whose existence labour continually deny even as we be watch riot in leeds it be time to put away the childish display and fake outrage that labour have be show the right hon lady will need to get very serious very quickly and where she have the right ambition we will do what we can to support she in face down those member sit behind she who still do not get it rise order because we be try to get in as many member as possible shall have to impose seven minute time limit on all back bench speaker urge maiden speaker who will not have formal time limit impose on they to stick to that sort of limit obviously the time limit will not apply to the liberal democrat spokesman but know that she will try to be brief it be pleasure to see my right hon friend the member for ashton under lyne angela rayner in her rightful place as deputy prime minister it be also pleasure to speak in this first king speech under focused and mission lead labour government wish to record my thank to the constituent of southgate and wood green for put their faith in to represent they as the first member of parliament for this newly configure constituency the legislative programme in the king speech show that the government be determined to get crack with the legislation need for long term national renewal and nowhere more so than in housing the shortage of both private and social housing be huge problem across the country family and child often wait for year in temporary accommodation that may no long be suitable and many young people be unable to afford deposit on new home whose price have far outstrip earning in recent year they be force either to stay at home with their parent or to live in precarious shared accommodation another scandal be the high level of no fault eviction which be add to the pressure on local authority to house homeless people it be for those reason that welcome the propose renter reform bill which will abolish section no fault eviction and strengthen tenant protection and right to challenge rent increase among other thing also welcome the propose planning and infrastructure bill as we need to get on with house building so that people do not have their life put on hold because of unaffordability we need to build more house in the right place and ensure that there be no adverse impact on local service and that the design and specification be to high standard the type of house build should conform with the need of the local community with more family sized house need urgently we also need more council house applaud the effort of enfield and haringey council in build more council house in my constituency but more need to be do encourage the government to support council in any way they can so that more council house be build to build more house we need highly skilled local workforce which be why welcome the measure in the propose skills england bill which will identify national and local skill need and ensure that they be be meet turn now to other element of the king speech we all need to ensure that our community be safe which be why welcome the measure in the propose crime and police bill which will give the police and law enforcement new power to tackle antisocial behaviour and retail crime focus on attack on shop worker and low level shoplifting small and medium sized local business which be the lifeblood of our local high street be now seriously impact by even low level crime so we need to make sure that they be support and that law enforcement take seriously all report retail crime knife crime have terrible devastating effect on the life of victim family and friend and find it shocking and sad that the perpetrator be often the same age as the victim that be why be pleased to see that tough sanction will be introduce to ban ninja sword and other lethal blade while tackle the gang who exploit child for criminal purpose it be also good to see that there will be support for teenager at risk of be draw into crime on personal level be delighted to see that the tobacco and vape bill will be reintroduce in this parliament have the privilege of serve on the bill committee early this year and there be cross party support and unity on progressively ban the sale of tobacco product forever it be joy to see the uk become world leader in this area of public health and put on record my thank to my hon friend the member for birmingham edgbaston preet kaur gill and dame andrea leadsom for the excellent bipartisan work that they do to progress the bill before it fall as result of the general election be call sincerely hope that it progress to royal assent this time the final bill wish to comment on be the draft equality race and disability bill which will enshrine in law the full right to equal pay for ethnic minority and disabled people and introduce mandatory ethnicity and disability pay reporting for large company sincerely hope that where there be any disparity employer take the appropriate action to address their failing and close the gap the king speech be an exciting beginning for the labour government who be keen to make real difference to people life include those of my constituent in southgate and wood green the starting gun for national renewal have be fire and we have get off to fly start hope that the pace of change continue and that we see positive long last benefit in housing community safety health and equality for all congratulate the deputy prime minister and welcome she to her place and welcome the shadow secretary of state as well because we be talk about local government today declare my interest as vice president of the local government association the topic of today debate be plan the greenbelt and rural affair we need to talk about planning and housing and will certainly do so but we also need to talk about rural affair and be slightly confused about why none of the speech by front benchers have do that welcome the government focus on house building and the reintroduction of housing target in england the number of people leave languish on the social housing waiting list have reach million and there be million people in this country with some form of unmet housing need last year under the conservative government social home be sell or demolish and few than be build so we all know that we have an unprecedented need for new housing particularly social housing the liberal democrats ambitious commitment on social housing would be to build social home year by the end of this parliament just not in your seat the hon gentleman be mutter from sedentary position he may wish to know that my grandparent live in social housing and have no particular prejudice against it whatsoever we be commit not only to build the home that be so important to ease the crisis throughout the housing market but to ensure that those new home be of high standard that they be zero carbon and that they be build alongside proper infrastructure that provide community with the service and amenity they need integrate public service delivery have to be part of the planning process so in principle we welcome the government plan to streamline the delivery of critical infrastructure include in the housing sector in the forthcoming planning and infrastructure bill but we need to be clear that the current system have benefit developer rather than community the bill must take that into account crude target alone have lead to many development be give permission only for affordable and social housing element to be water down on the basis of viability once permission be grant that must change we know that local authority be well place to make the decision about housing in their area so urge the government to ensure that their mandatory housing target be build from the bottom up by determine the type of housing and infrastructure community need and empower local government to build social home where they be most need we need the necessary infrastructure include gps school bus stop and bus route while also ensure that there be appropriate green space and access to the countryside which be important for health and wellbeing our experience be that resident support good plan with good infrastructure now imagine that we will use the term nimby in this debate and it have already be use about the liberal democrats but it be not appropriate to approve housing in area that be unsuitable for example where there be high risk of flooding it be not be nimby to oppose poor planning it be common sense local authority be under enormous pressure and we know that their planning department be overstretch welcome the deputy prime minister comment on that point they need proper funding to ensure that they make good and consistent decision and that their councillor be well advise the hon member be talk about infrastructure and about decision be make in the good interest of our community so can ask why liberal democrat run rutland county council this week turn down an application for new day care centre for people with special educational need without even take it to the planning committee mean that we now have to rely on the council service rather than provide choice to ensure that anyone with learn disability or other disability in our community get the support they need do not know the detail of that individual case but we need to ensure that planning department be properly fund so that the decision make by planning officer be appropriate without know the detail do now know whether it be good development or poor one but those department need to be empower to make decision correctly some proposal for development be inappropriate and some be downright dangerous we mention the building of house on floodplain early the only insurer to re insure house on floodplain be due to close its operation in year time we can not build house on floodplain it will not be possible for they to be insure or sell homeowner will be trap we should also not be build housing development without additional school or gp surgery most importantly we should not be build housing development where the developer do not prepare the road and green space to an acceptable standard and do not allow they to be adopt by the local authority but set up share management company and leave the homeowner fleece for the rest of their home ownership experience encourage the deputy prime minister to consider that in the forthcoming legislation good councillor approve plan for good development that be why on the day when the conservatives be not accuse we of be nimbys they be tell people that we be go to concrete over their countryside planning be not just about housing we have many demand on our countryside housing renewable energy nature restoration and importantly the grow of food we need to simplify plan so that all those thing can happen housing renewable energy and job creation be incredibly important but urge the government to ensure that when they go ahead it be not at the expense of food production the liberal democrats have call for the development of land use strategy so that these important and compete demand can be balance and so that we use land in the optimal way protect the high grade arable land for food production and put the infrastructure of renewable energy and housing in less prime place therefore hope that the government will consider land use strategy as part of their planning reform that bring to another important area of the countryside our waterway and our beach it be scandal that raw sewage have be allow to be dump into our river and on to our beach while water company executive have take home huge bonus and their often overseas shareholder have take huge dividend the liberal democrats be proud to have lead the campaign to end the sewage crisis we welcome the water special measure bill and will be watch closely to ensure that the water regulator be give the power it need to finally end this sewage outrage will move on to rural affair there be no mention in the king speech of rural community or priority for the countryside which hope mean that the new government will be ensure that every policy be rural proof and that the demand of deliver public service in rural area where the population be spread over large area be be consider also want to mention the english devolution bill the liberal democrats be the proud voice of local community and community lead politic and we absolutely welcome step to devolve power away from westminster but ask the secretary of state to confirm what that will look like for those council without devo deal metro mayor or combine authority mayor it be important that all local council have the power and funding to deliver for their community that funding must reflect the cost of deliver service in rural area rural council have be take for grant for far too long we need to ensure that people who live in rural area who also see increase in their council tax be get the public service that they deserve rurality affect the delivery of all type of service but want to touch on just few key area health be an important issue in my north shropshire constituency where we have see huge problem with gp and dentistry access and crisis in our service while welcome the government plan to tackle the crisis in mental health service provision which be also big problem in rural area we really want to see rural focus policy to deal with the recruitment crisis in rural area and the cost of deliver health service over large distance and to ensure that people who live long way from hospital or diagnostic centre can travel to it more easily that bring to public transport which be quite problematic in shropshire we have lose of our bus mile since which make it difficult for anybody to access work opportunity social opportunity educational opportunity and indeed health service be really pleased that the government will allow local authority to franchise their own bus service the liberal democrats have long call for that but would like to see the detail of how that will work and how we will get the funding to kick start those route and get labour move properly around our countryside order can the hon lady bring her remark to close please of course be briefly go to mention mobile signal but will rush over that because have talk about it reasonable amount in the house want to talk about farming and the rural economy because that be the backbone of our economy and food production be extremely important farmer have face crisis over the last few year with the botched introduction of the environmental land management scheme the input cost they face and the fact that vast tract of farmland be underwater and have be for the last month must encourage the government to look at trade deal to ensure that farmer be work on level playing field and to ensure that the sustainable farming incentive deal with the consistent problem of flooding follow prolonged rainfall give how our farmer be store an enormous amount of water upstream will draw my remark to close because be keen to hear the maiden speech of all these new members who welcome to this place to reinforce the point have make community lead planning be so important and we would love to see land use strategy we need to ensure that the cost of deliver public service in rural area be properly consider and fund and the infrastructure need to be there finally please do not forget about food security which be so important to national renewal call sam rushworth to make his maiden speech thank you mr deputy speaker for allow this opportunity to make my maiden speech during the king speech debate thank my hon friend the member for southgate and wood green bambos charalambous for his excellent contribution as well as the hon member for north shropshire helen morgan like she represent rural constituency and recognise many of the issue she raise in my own community also want to thank my predecessor dehenna davison for her service in her maiden speech she describe bishop auckland as england most beautiful constituency and on that point we agree she be formidable campaigner who do important work to raise awareness of migraine lobular cancer and the danger of one punch assault although she already have the accolade of be the first ever conservative mp for bishop auckland hope that in decade to come her legacy will be even more impressive as the only ever conservative mp for bishop auckland if the house will indulge for moment would like to say little about the place call home the people who live there and what make they so special get my priority in order will start by talk about football have be look forward to sing one general election and one european cup this summer but that be not to be be gutte that our england team do not quite make it but football do come home in when west auckland become the first football team to win the world cup that be true and you can look it up another important footballe moment come in when bishop auckland amateur football club famously provide player to help manchester united fulfil their fixture follow the munich air disaster be really touch when meet barry who volunteer at the local bishops football museum listen to his passion as he share how gentleman with dementia come in and recognise himself in an old black and white photograph they develop friendship as he use football memorabilia to help that gentleman reminisce and reconnect with his past be similarly grateful to other in my constituency who give up their time to run sport club whether it be football rugby cricket or boxing provide opportunity for young people to exercise connect and enjoy themselves secondly have to mention railway it be in shildon in the south east of my constituency where stephenson invent the rocket locomotive make stockton to darlington the world first commercial railway line year ago next year it be inspiring to see the commitment of local volunteer who work together to preserve this heritage care for part of the line and organise bicentenary event likewise it be inspiring to see those who work to save the shildon railway institute which be set up by work people nearly two century ago with library and school room to upskill the local workforce for the new industrial age thirdly we be bless with fabulous art and culture in bishop auckland which be the home of stanley jefferson of laurel and hardy fame it be also believe to be where elgar first play the anthem land of hope and glory and how grateful be to the volunteer who give their time to enable participation in the art daisy arts jack drum the teesdale operatic society the

your eyesight but be also an idyllic place to stroll along the river with your family on sunny easter bank holiday surround as it be by hill sheep farm and moorland that be home to rare wildflower and endanger ground nest bird be full of admiration for those who work on the land and put in the graft to keep this place so lovely and to provide we with food without wish to disappoint the right hon member for north west essex kemi badenoch when recently meet local farmer they be delighted to see that labour be bring in planning reform and lift the ban on onshore wind finally bishop auckland have long connection with the church auckland castle serve for century as home to the prince bishops while the seventh century escomb saxon church be one of the old in england and stand as monument to the devotion of the man and woman who build it more than millennium ago what find equally inspiring be the work do by church in our community today such as woodhouse close church and community centre and shildon alive which recently receive the king award for voluntary service what make bishop auckland so special to be the people live among people who have stand together in hard time people who take pride in their neighbourhood and people who serve without thought for themselves if might make slightly more political point as draw to close we have just accept the decline of northern heartland like bishop auckland for too long live in the town centre where one in three shop be board up our local business be excited to see the power that this government will devolve to local authority to compulsorily purchase some of those building we will hand they over to business and we will get our town centre boom again finally be proud to be member of the most representative parliament in our history with the high percentage of woman minority and state educate member there be also on all benches some exceedingly talented people it be already clear to that while will be bold in speak up for my constituent there will always be someone more gifted in oratory or more learn however hope that if can excel in anything it will be in show kindness and respect to my fellow members to the incredible staff who have do so much to make feel welcome in this rather strange place and to my constituent who hope will always know whatever our disagreement that love and care about they congratulate the hon member for bishop auckland sam rushworth on his maiden speech we be all much more knowledgeable about his constituency now than we be few minute ago so well do for that acknowledge that the planning system be in need of reform we can not have process that take month in many case year for major project crucial to economic growth and associated job to grind through an endless system in my constituency most such project be locate in an area that is and have be for many year mainly industrial although we should not trample on local opinion we have to get those project through the system more quickly than we do at the moment the gracious speech include this my government believe that great devolution of decision making be at the heart of modern dynamic economy and be key driver of economic growth and my ministers will introduce an english devolution bill legislation will be introduce to give new power to metro mayor and combined authority this will support local growth plan that bring economic benefit to community official report july vol of course we need to increase the supply of housing but how do ministers square devolving decision make with strengthen central direction of the planning process and tie the hand of planning authority the labour manifesto say that the government would make full use of intervention power that do not sound like good news for local democracy experience from my constituency show that local community will in most case accept more housing development but they make the justifiable complaint that recent development in all part of my constituency from humberston through new waltham waltham scartho laceby wootton and barton to name just few mean that the already stretch highway infrastructure and public service such as school place gps and the like be now stretch beyond what be acceptable what assurance can minister give that they will ensure new build will run in parallel to the provision of infrastructure and public service another aspect of the planning process that anger people be that many appeal be determine by plan inspector who frequently overrule council decision that have be make after careful consideration of local circumstance in some case such decision have even overturn the local plan that be not acceptable local plan go through various stage of consultation include public hearing all of which pass by the overwhelming majority of the public until an application be lodge that could change the whole character of the neighbourhood clearly the process need to be review as have previously argue include in ten minute rule bill introduce some year ago if devolution and local decision making be to mean anything planning issue should be determine at local level wherever possible the shadow secretary of state mention that there be current ministers who lodge objection to planning application for development in their own area that go under the radar to some extent while they be in opposition but now there be no hiding place for they every labour member who vote for propose planning change to some village or some part of the town will have to justify not support their constituent when they be up in arm about the application as someone who spend their childhood and early adulthood in council house on grimsby estate have always support the ability of local authority to build council house where that be appropriate the one that live in be build in the early when conservative government be in power they be of high quality and have stand the test of time sadly that be not the case for much of the social housing that be impose on new development certainly would support the government if they have programme to encourage and support council in house building but would be interested to know how they would finance it one proposal that be cause considerable concern not just in my brigg and immingham constituency but in many other constituency along the east coast of lincolnshire and through into east anglia be the national grid upgrade on the grimsby to walpole route these proposal could result in network of metre high pylon run through some of the country most beautiful countryside include impact on the lincolnshire wolds area of outstanding natural beauty secure the final adjournment debate on this matter before the election and the then minister say that he be minded to order review of the scheme urge the government to honour that commitment and follow through with that review finally let return to devolution and the policy to create more combined authority the proposal for the greater lincolnshire authority have already pass through all stage of consultation and statutory instrument have be prepare but unfortunately the election intervene say to the deputy prime minister that this be an opportunity for an early win in her wish to create combined authority if she be to put forward that si think most of the lincolnshire mps would give she some support call dr scott arthur for his maiden speech be oblige to you mr deputy speaker for give the opportunity to make my maiden speech would like to start by thank the hon member for brigg and immingham martin vickers for fantastic speech but fear that he have make my job only little more difficult have to say that it be delight to give my maiden speech in debate lead by our fantastic deputy prime minister it be an honour and privilege to stand before this house as the representative for edinburgh south west be deeply grateful to my constituent for place their trust in and also to my church for pray for although know that they pray more after win the election than before it be committed to serve they all with dedication and integrity before address the subject matter of the king speech would like to pay tribute to my immediate predecessor joanna cherry kc who represent the constituency for nine year have many dealing with her office in my role as councillor and away find her team to be utterly professional wish they all well joanna cherry herself be formidable parliamentarian member will recall that during the brexit crisis she work hard to ensure that government decision making remain transparent and subject to parliamentary scrutiny we all owe she huge debt for that must also say that although disagree with she on many issue be happy to stand in complete solidarity with she in the face of the threat that she have face it pain that since come here so many other have speak about threat and intimidation as well this be an issue that we must take seriously must however tell the house that the campaign for edinburgh south west between joanna cherry and myself be conduct entirely on the issue that matter to local people there which be perhaps why be so proud to be here to address the house today must also pay tribute to my predecessor predecessor alistair darling be one of the great public servant of my lifetime he sit here from to like he be councillor in edinburgh and convener of the city transport committee before he go on to serve as mp for edinburgh south west the similarity may end there indeed we must all hope that be never call on as he be to save the bank of england know that alistair be still much miss and be proud to follow in his footstep indeed without his help doubt that would have be elect as councillor in before address myself to the debate would like to take the opportunity to pay tribute to my constituency its institution and its people at this point member may need map edinburgh south west be the good part of the great city in the world it stretch from the west end of princes street to the east cairn hill some km to the south west along its length the constituency move from dense urban community place such as gorgie the home of hearts football club dalry parkhead wester hailes sighthill and oxgangs to suburban settlement such as colinton craiglockhart swanston and baberton mains and to the semi rural water of leith village of currie juniper green and balerno of all those oxgangs be perhaps the place know and love most many people there struggle in temporary and overcrowded accommodation that be why it have be so important today to hear about the deputy prime minister ambition to build affordable home in edinburgh we have work with the whole city and set aside land for new home the land be there and the planning be there but the barrier to build those new home be the lack of funding from the scottish government hope that they can now follow what we be do here and show more ambition on affordable housing in scotland when it come to natural beauty the pentland hill and the water of leith dominate my constituency and the habitat along the union canal should not be forget but of course it be the people who make my constituency so special such as those who volunteer at the water of leith conservation trust or who convert disuse railway tunnel into scotland large historical mural the colinton tunnel please google it later must also mention tiphereth unique charity that deliver residential and day service for people with learn difficulty it really be unique the edinburgh campus of heriot watt university be perhaps the big employer in my constituency it support and develop every day from when start work there in until be elect to this place shall miss my civil engineering colleague and the many student it welcome to scotland from around the world hope to use some of my time here to support high education particularly the wellbeing of student mental health support in scotland be fail its young people and act as barrier to many of they reach their full potential will work with anyone and everyone to address that and the many other challenge face student across the uk other large employer in my constituency include lothian buses bus company own by the people of edinburgh that define the city just as much as the castle should stress that the castle be not in my constituency if some member question municipal ownership of public transport or the importance of collaborative work between trade union and management they should speak to some of the million passenger that lothian buses carry every week without any subsidy big business be also important in my constituency but it be the small one that define it they be at the heart of many of the neighbourhood many have high hope that the uk and scottish governments will now work together to support they more be also proud to say that there be two infantry barrack in my constituency dreghorn and redford both be value by local resident as real asset and they never cause problem as councillor the proposal in the king speech for an armed force commissioner will be support by many in my constituency particularly if it help improve the living quarter for our service personnel and support spouse at the point of relationship breakdown particularly when domestic abuse have be an issue election be reminder that we be all equal in this country but it pain that many constituent feel that they be less equal than other during the election campaign that be why local group in my constituency such as soul food oxgangs best bib tucker and whale arts must be mention in my speech as they all work hard to ensure that people feel include and value that be our job too of course indeed all of we here have duty to keep on listen to voter now that the election be over the first past the post system mean that be elect on just of the vote still can not believe it to be honest and know that some of those voter still want to be reassure that they do the right thing be here only because promise to work with other party where possible and to listen to everybody in my constituency no matter their sex gender background faith age or birthplace will keep listen to people even if they vote for my opponent or do not vote at all we know of course that the people who need our help most do not vote for we among they be the child in my constituency who be live in poverty that number have grow across the whole uk since labour last sit on the government benches and that should shame we all know the cost measure in the king speech be our good chance of change those life measure such as gb energy build more home new deal for work people and our plan for sustainable economic growth will not just get our country back on track and help we to meet our climate target but give parent hope again of well future for their child the child poverty taskforce be an opportunity to maximise the benefit of those policy by integrate their delivery that be the change our country need and vote for and we must now work together across this chamber to deliver it congratulate the hon member for edinburgh south west dr arthur on his maiden speech it be wonderful to hear he champion so many local charity and cause particularly for young people it be great to hear that he care about the mental health and wellbeing of young people also congratulate the new hon member for bishop auckland sam rushworth on his speech and his drive by of the entire constituency and the wonderful thing that people can see and experience in his patch what love about both speech be that both hon member put their constituent first and talk about be local champion will support anyone whatever party or part of the house they be from who want to put their constituent first and be an advocate for they in this house on that subject be here because the people of beaconsfield marlow and the south bucks village send clear message to during the general election that they want to stand up and defend the green belt make promise to they back in and again in that would stand up and defend the green belt will continue to do so for my constituent the green belt be not just special it be vital it act as the lung of london it be vital because for my constituent it be the buffer between the sprawl of london and slough because green space provide much need mental health and wellbee space for my constituent and because it provide the biodiversity and nature conservation area that we need between london and the home county it be essential that we protect nature and want to be champion for that as well once our green belt be lose it be lose forever and we can not get it back want to be clear believe in the right housing in the right place with the right infrastructure it be entirely false prospectus to think that people who defend the green belt be somehow anti growth and anti housing that be not true here be the truth the government seem determined to deny that the green belt be green space but any attempt by the government to use some orwellian twisting of word to make it grey belt will fail in the sunlight of simple truth in marlow in my constituency we fight together with local community group to stop the marlow film studio be build on green belt space we work tirelessly to protect the green belt so that future generation could enjoy that beautiful green area we fight as community and the proposal be rightly reject if the government try to bring it back and the resident will fight it every inch of the way the government establish their intent in their first three day of existence the government know good and community will be ignore the chancellor not funnily enough the deputy prime minister announce that the government be call in an application reject by planner and the planning inspectorate to build data centre in the ivers right up against london it be blatant attack on local opinion and professional planning officer do ministers really believe that there be no well site for data centre than directly on the only green belt that separate we from london say to the government you will soon discover that you be on the wrong side of this debate our green belt in south bucks be not political ideological prize to be win resident will make their voice hear and will be right there by their side it matter to my constituent and the generation to follow who will grow up and live in the beautiful area of beaconsfield marlow and the south bucks village urge the government to think again leave our green belt alone call emma foody to make her maiden speech thank the hon member for beaconsfield joy morrissey who speak passionately about

most gracious speech wide range set of commitment and action that know will deliver not only for my community but across the country and not just in housing and crucially leasehold reform but for our economy our energy security and policing be particularly proud of the measure to support our national health service as former call taker at the north east ambulance service know how my former colleague work tirelessly to serve people often in the most challenging and desperate of circumstance it be an honour to be here and to have their back in this place believe passionately in the measure in this most gracious address which we fight so hard to earn the country support for and can not wait to get to work call harriet cross to make her maiden speech thank you for call to speak mr deputy speaker it be an honour to follow the hon member for cramlington and killingworth emma foody she be clearly very proud of her root and of what she have achieve in the area it be lovely to follow another girl from the north east although in my case it be the north east of scotland it be an incredible honour to be elect to this place to serve the great people of gordon and buchan have move home many time in my lifetime more than can remember from yorkshire to ireland to scotland and many time in between have see my fair share of house but can definitely say that this one will take the most getting use to as member be all aware you be not true scottish mp if you do not proclaim that your constituency be the most beautiful so from the beach of balmedie and newburgh through the fertile farmland of formartine garioch huntly and turriff to the height of the correen hill and the bennachie range gordon and buchan have it all can tell members in all seriousness that it really be the most beautiful constituency and not just in scotland but in the whole of the uk those of we who be bless to live north of the watford gap know that there be direct correlation between how far north you get and be approachable and determine have dry sense of humour and be great company as such be also delighted to say that be the conservative member with the most northerly constituency first must reflect on my predecessor begin with the most recent conservative members from the two former constituency that have now be combine to make gordon and buchan colin clark in gordon and david duguid in banff and buchan both colin and david be embed in our rural community they be unwavere champion for our region in particular be loud constructive and prominent voice for our farmer fisherman and distillery and for the energy sector also want to take the opportunity to wish david duguid and his family all the very good in his ongoing recovery it would be wrong of not to mention malcolm bruce now baron bruce of bennachie who serve gordon for year up until it be show of the mark that he leave on the area that his name be mention to on the doorstep many time during this election campaign always very fondly finally the former snp member for gordon and my immediate predecessor richard thomson have long serve the people of gordon and buchan and of aberdeenshire both in this place and on aberdeenshire council as both leader and opposition leader while he and will not pretend that we see eye to eye on the mean we both agree that we want the very good for our special corner of aberdeenshire now and in the future much be achieve for gordon and buchan and the north east of scotland in the last parliament wish to draw attention to the north east investment zone an million investment in our region make as part of the last conservative government levelling up agenda it be real investment in our area growth development and potential an investment in our future the north east shin with energy in every way indeed the energy sector be what first bring my family to inverurie the large town in gordon and buchan year ago this year my grandfather have be medically discharge from the navy never lose his love of service or the sea so he channel that love into create in aberdeen the international association for safety and survival training whose course be still use today by each and every offshore worker in our oil and gas sector be sure that if he be still here today he could give some sound advice on survive in this place the energy sector power aberdeenshire from direct job and high skilled employment to the associated service and hospitality sector that rely on it to the people of gordon and buchan and the north east of scotland the debate on the future of the oil and gas sector be not really about energy security market or net zero it be about our job and our livelihood it be about know that we have secure employment for the year to come and that our child will not have to move away to start their career or that the bottom will not fall out of our local economy can not imagine that any hon member would sit here and allow their constituency key employment sector to be run down or concede and will not do that either our rural community be the beat heart of gordon and buchan indeed three quarter of the land in the constituency be class as agricultural fifth be forestry and only be think of as build up if someone drop pin on map it be more likely to land in field or forest than on house before be elect work as rural surveyor meet farmer across aberdeenshire many of whom be now proud to call my constituent as intimidate as it might be be on the opposition side look across at the government benches that be nothing compare with sit at farmhouse table try to tell farming client that no their farm be not worth three time what they think it be worth or that their bad for wear heifer will not get top figure at next week sale be delighted that my first contribution in the house be in this rural affair debate know and my constituent know that rural living be unique rewarding and in my opinion far superior to urban life we also know that it be not all about green field welly boot and labrador idyllic as that might sound the reality be local wait in village such as fyvie auchleven and new deer for the only bus of the day which never arrive it be the only healthcare facility for many mile close down it be child have to move away to build their career it be poor quality unsuitable road or it be the lack of housing or house without gas poor broadband and no phone coverage we in the uk quite rightly hold our rural landscape up in light our green and pleasant land which bring ecological benefit as well as much need tourism to remote area but rural community be not there solely to be an escape or playthe for other they be where my constituent make their home and livelihood and where they grow up and grow old we need tailor policy for our rural community that help industry such as farming and food and drink producer and the numerous small and medium sized enterprise across gordon and buchan that bring so much not just to the immediate area but to the region and to the uk as whole yes we be less densely populated and yes understandably we have less choice in service and on where to find work but we have no less aspiration be proud to have be send here by the people of gordon and buchan to represent they to fight for they and always to keep their interest at the top of the agenda it be pleasure to follow the hon member for gordon and buchan harriet cross who make an excellent maiden speech which enjoy also have to mention the excellent maiden speech from my north east colleague my hon friend the member for cramlington and killingworth emma foody she represent new constituency and my hon friend the member for bishop auckland sam rushworth look forward to hear more from they in the week month and year to come have enter the house year ago be honour to have once again be elect to serve my constituent in washington and gateshead south another new constituency name it be fantastic to see so many new face around the estate and my door be always open if new member or indeed old one want to pop in for bit of advice cup of tea or just to see friendly face this king speech usher in new era of government one base on service of the people and focus on build back trust in politic which be greatly need by as state in the king speech adhere to the principle of security fairness and opportunity for all we will start that process by bring in legislation to transform the right of every worker in this country as trade unionist believe that worker must have the right to access trade union representation as well as the repeal of the disastrous minimum service level legislation which fail to protect public service user and worker alike we will ban all exploitative zero hour contract that leave people in uncertain and unstable employment we will definitively ban fire and rehire practice which my hon friend the member for brent west barry gardiner lead the way on tackle with his excellent private member bill which sadly do not make it we will protect worker wellbee by end short notice shift cancellation and we will introduce the right to switch off so that worker can enjoy healthy structured work life balance think we could do with bit of that sometimes as well finally we will establish right such as paternity pay and the right to challenge unfair dismissal as right from day one the basic right of worker be not reward earn after year of service they be right from day one the government have already get the ball rolling build on the excellent work of former labour government to truly deliver devolved power it be excellent to see that just day after move in the prime minister welcome all labour and conservative metro mayor thankfully they be mostly labour to downing street to discuss how to kick start growth in all part of the country nine time out of local knowledge be superior to departmental control so it be only right that we bring power back to community among the mayor invite to meet the prime minister be our excellent new mayor of the north east kim mcguinness who have work with in my long run campaign to reopen the leamside line and extend the metro to washington be sure that member have all hear say this but washington be one of the large town in the uk without direct rail link interruption it be we see waste opportunity with people unable to travel easily for work school or university or even to see love one to quote the former conservative member for sedgefield with whom co chair the leamside line all party parliamentary group without physical mobility there can be no social that he be not here be go to nick that line be pleased that with labour government and labour mayor that project will at long last become reality grow up in council house and my family be totally reliant on social security free school meal be lifeline for we but know that in many way it be more important to have warm safe and secure house that be what save my family more than anything else that be why throughout this general election campaign and when be listen to the king speech be so pleased to see labour commitment to build million new home not just house but social and affordable housing base on five key principle that will enable those house to turn into secure home and those home to turn into stable and thriving community we will also deliver for our child with policy intend to tackle childhood health and obesity head on our plan to deliver free breakfast club in every primary school in england will ensure that kid can start school with meal in their belly ready to learn but we know that child feeding do not start and end with the school day so we will also tackle the crisis of youth nutrition outside school by restrict the advertisement of junk food and the sale of high caffeine energy drink to child both thing long call for when be shadow minister for public health for four year and shadow minister for child and family for four year and as the chair of the all party parliamentary group on school food from could not welcome these development more fervently we can not shy away from protect our child health which be why also welcome our tobacco and vape bill carry on the work of the former government have to say to phase out smoking that will ensure that our child live healthy future as we look to the come year of our government be excited not only to see these policy and more come to fruition and deliver the change that this government be elect to bring but to work with member across the house to deliver these thing together because we need they for the benefit of all our constituent unfortunately because of the pressure on time we have to reduce the maximum time for speech to five minute but that do not apply to those make their maiden speech it be pleasure to be in the chamber today and congratulate all new and return member on their election success it be an honour to be back in this place and to be call to speak in this debate on the king speech start by thank my constituent in aldridge brownhills for return to this place for fourth time thank the resident of pheasey park farm park hall nether hall and orchard hills for return for the first time follow the boundary change there be much to consider in this king speech and rest assure that will welcome those element that benefit my constituent however my job on the opposition benches remain to get the good for my constituency and my constituent where the government legislation and plan harm my constituency will stand up and be my constituent voice and fight for their interest that bring nicely on to the area that wish to raise today start with housing we need home but we need the right home build in the right place and with the right infrastructure to support they and their community and we need local decision making what we do not need to see be swathe of house the wrong home in the wrong mix and in the wrong place drive by top down mandatory target that be not nimbyism but common sense that be why have always advocate for brownfield first approach because the minute the green belt be release that be it when it be go it be go forever take away the integrity of our community and the sense of amenity and belong which we all believe be vital it concern that while government member say they will prioritise brownfield site they have coin this phrase grey belt meet their target they be also tell local authority to identify area with green belt collar to build on that surely be wrong it simply risk nibble away at our green belt until it be go the definition of green belt in case we need reminder be that it be buffer zone between town and between town and countryside it be planning tool to prevent urban sprawl in the case of my constituency it prevent we from be subsume into the suburb of great birmingham the green belt be not nostalgic vision but future vision for future generation the former mayor andy street have vision for it it be thank to he his leadership and his brownfield first approach that we have see new home build and thousand of job create on brownfield land which have benefit many include those in the walsall borough we need to see more of that approach surely we should build out the brownfield site first before we release any green belt with more financial incentive for land remediation fund we also need to understand what the new government mean by grey belt be it simply another grey area for one sincerely hope not one specific area that seek clarity on be the new power for compulsory purchase hope that can unlock some of the brownfield site in my constituency there be some small derelict site often pub in town centre so let we look at work with local community to unlock some of they community also need transport it be inherently link to community and be key to job and opportunity the government have set out that they will get britain move but be deeply concerned to put it mildly that the new labour mayor of the west midlands have say that he will review the decision for train station in aldridge what have happen to the money that the former mayor andy street and secure for that project in the absence of any confirmation that it will be complete on time by within the budget allocate can only assume that the new mayor have no intention of deliver the project it be year since aldridge have passenger train today we have the track freight train and the land for car park various partner be already work on it it might not be big deal to mayor parker but it certainly be to the resident of aldridge and to be conscious of time but want to touch briefly on crime and justice as they matter to my constituent community need police officer and police station will continue my campaign to keep aldridge police station with for sale board appear recently at sutton coldfield it be time for the labour police and crime commissioner to come clean about his intention for aldridge police station we need our police station as base for our local bobby to increase the safety of our resident and to support our community order call luke myer to make his maiden speech have listen carefully to the debate on his majesty gracious speech be grateful for this opportunity to make my first speech in this chamber it be privilege and an honour to represent the community of middlesbrough south and east cleveland where be bear and raise much of this debate have seek to pit rural and suburban against each other but as representative of both know that we can deliver for both and that be precisely what expect this government to do distinguished predecessor have represent my seat in maiden speech politician often say that they stand on the shoulder of giant but rarely be it so true as in my case my predecessor sir simon clarke be giant not only in physical term but within his party particularly in his admirable zeal for planning reform an issue on which he campaign and stand up to his own party it be fitting that today debate place such emphasis on those reform this government be commit to build the home and infrastructure that this country need measure such as the planning and infrastructure bill will start to create the job and growth that we need will push for teesside to be at the heart of that work if the house will permit would like to pay tribute to two other predecessor from my party first tom blenkinsop who some in the house will remember not only serve his party and constituency but serve his country in the royal military police dr ashok kumar who be mention by my hon friend the member for stockton north chris mcdonald in his maiden speech be my mp grow up he be tenacious constituency mp whose model hope to follow ashok once say that our constituency be microcosm of british society he be right it be not particularly leave or right wing but it be full of decent people who want the good for their family our identity be complex officially we be in the north east but we be also proudly in yorkshire as part of the historic north riding we have be call cleveland and langbaurgh and today we be tell that we be in the tees valley whatever we call it our home be an incredible place my constituency sit between wildly different landscape at each point of the compass to the north we find the beach where the north sea fret wash out over the seafront at place like skinningrove to the south we leave the beautiful market town of guisborough and meet the vast wild purple of the north york moor to the east be the rolling field of east cleveland rural north yorkshire at its good there be proud village and town from loftus to lingdale skelton to stanghow and brotton where grow up be proud to be our constituency first mp from the village and hope to serve they well to the west we find suburban south middlesbrough home to many work family and in marton to the birthplace of one of this country great explorer captain james cook if we venture far those community give way to the tower chimney and snake pipe of industrial teesside once the beat heart of britain economy the infant hercules as gladstone call it it be home to year economic relay race from one major industry to another first fishing and agriculture then coal then iron and steel and then chemical the saying on teesside be we build the world steel forge in teesside furnace find its way into the sydney harbour bridge and span the victoria fall when churchill war cabinet meet in their underground bunker not far from here or when the ball hit the net at wembley it all happen under structure of teesside steel today we be perfectly positioned for the green job of the future we already produce around half the country hydrogen with the right industrial strategy we can create job in hydrogen carbon capture and storage and clean power wind nuclear and solar and in our port if our engineering capability be harness we can lead the world again legislation such as the great british energy bill the crown estate bill and the planning and infrastructure bill can deliver that teesside be more than just place it be the people like steel teesside be an alloy meld of the different community that shape we from the miner and the methodists to the labourer who come from ireland ironworker from wales sailor from japan jewish refugee from the pogrom of europe trade unionist chemical worker and so on these be the small and disparate atom that teesside take on and blend into our culture strengthen it into

of our country lincolnshire and rutland alone produce of the uk vegetable of our poultry of our turkey and of all english wheat we be the agriculture super producer of our country yet the king speech offer very little for we it continue in the same vein as the labour party manifesto which do not mention the word rural even once by ignore the concern of rural community and ignore farmer it have put forward different approach to development set out centralised power for westminster to impose project on the countryside and strip away the voice of local people the consequence of that approach be apparent last week when the secretary of state for energy security and net zero impose three mega solar plant on community two of which sit within lincolnshire and rutland during the last parliament consistently oppose the mallard pass solar plant and be dismay to see the secretary of state wave it through after only three work day in the job yesterday he refer to himself as super nerd would never question his self classification but do question how somebody could read over page of quasi judicial documentation in just that time while also get to grip with new department that perhaps explain why he miss or ignore the fact that even the planning inspectorate tell he to turn down one of those application there be well document link between uyghur force labour and the primary developer behind mallard pass labour have say it want renewal in public life and focus on public service but ask where the sense of duty be to responsible and consider governance when decision be make frankly for propaganda announcement to say what the government have do in their first seven day decision that solely affect conservative vote community together these three solar plant will remove acre of good quality agricultural land the land that feed our country and power our nation want to delve more into the issue of slave labour for year have speak out against what be take place in xinjiang this house include the new secretary of state for energy security and net zero vote to declare what be take place genocide in opposition labour promise that should they become the party of government they would not only declare it formally genocide but would take the chinese government to court look forward to update on that activity but in government they have decide to carpet our countryside with solar panel produce by the blood of uyghur slave labourer the company behind the mallard pass canadian solar be find by our foreign office to have the high complicity in uyghur force labour it have be sanction by the united states government for its ongoing campaign of repression against muslim minority group this be company whose representative ring my office and ask what want to drop my opposition be that company that we want operate on our land congratulate my hon friend on her speech do she agree that there would be full support on the conservative benches for measure to ensure that the supply chain for solar panel do not include slave labour agree entirely with my right hon friend who have an incredible history as one of the great parliamentary advocate for tackle slave labour will the minister apologise on behalf of the secretary of state for energy security and net zero to the anti slave labour non governmental organisation that oppose the mallard pass development will he apologise to the british people for sign over thousand of acre of prime agricultural land to such company and will he apologise to the people whose petition present in the chamber with the high number of wet signature ever present in this parliament do he accept that the loud statement make last week be not that we stand four square behind renewable in this place but that we be give the green light to all company complicit in uyghur slave labour to flood our country with bloody solar panel this government be happy to go green on blood labour and will not stand for it very briefly in respect of rural economy want to express my absolute opposition to the government intention to charge vat on independent school there be in my community that employ more than people and be attend by well over child with special educational need furthermore one in five of my constituent who be military personnel or veteran send their child to those school this be ideology and dogma and there be also no plan to support our comprehensive school my hon friend be again make very fine speech she be talk not only about pressure on those family but about any other family who will then see those child go to the state school in the area my right hon friend be as usual on point in rutland alone there be only three place for new child in year where be these child go to go why be the

recognise that this be wrong for our country wrong for our local education system wrong for our military family and wrong for those who rely on employment in our local school it be dogma once again and expect well the government have show degree of good grace and maturity in adopt some of the previous government bills for their agenda it be sign of political strength for government to acknowledge that other party have good idea and to adopt they during their time in power may suggest that in order to fill the blank in their rural policy the government should look at our they should announce billion increase in the farming budget over the course of this parliament there should be reform planning rule to support farming infrastructure the introduction of legally bind food security target should be at the heart of what the government do and they should recognise how much rural community contribute to our community we provide the food that we eat we offer an escape and access to

skilled job be to community like our alongside our large manufacturing base my constituency have thrive small and craft brewery scene be delighted to take break from the campaign trail to attend the corbridge beer festival which be all about raise money for good cause and charity although there be lot of beauty in the constituency there be huge challenge as well we have great local health service but every single week see the need for long term solution to the social care crisis elderly resident in isolated rural community be doubly disadvantaged as they be hit by the rural cost of live premium and by poor public transport and they be reliant on carer who be themselves struggle to make end meet we also face an acute transport challenge think be the third member to cite george

town like barrasford and humshaugh as well as for large town such as ponteland this be generational challenge it be huge concern for parent and grandparent and it come up time and again on the doorstep during the general election crime and antisocial behaviour also impact community from west newcastle and the town and village to the small and most isolated community look forward to work with susan dungworth our police and crime commissioner on these matter the cross departmental rural crime strategy be so important have speak to sheep farmer out in west woodburn who have be strike by the attempt robbery of their quad bike the north east be famous for its river and the tyne be one of the most important river in the country history it be the very artery of our industry wherever go constituent demand that we clean up our river and be pleased to see that the government have already get to work on deliver on that promise look forward to support that work as much as can at every door knock on during the election campaign get the message for change know it be incredibly important to get on with that change by support the king speech so that we become the confident outward look nation that we so evidently can be be conscious that we can not work miracle in this place and as the first ever labour mp for my constituency know that be not send to this place with an expectation of overnight success be send here to get on with work with colleague across the house to deliver genuine outcome and genuine change for my constituent look forward to continue that service it be pleasure to follow the hon member for hexham joe morris thank he for his full tribute to his predecessor guy opperman who be love on both side of the house very early in my political career in when be first elect as councillor my dad tell that nothing in politic be quite as vex as the politic of the southern area planning committee of test valley borough council he be right but reassure the secretary of state for environment food and rural affairs who be respond to this debate that the council have already modernise its planning committee it have already take great stride and until the nitrate issue in the solent hit we it be one of the council deliver the high number of house in the country but it have face challenge welcome the announcement on compulsory purchase order and the change that might come but we need detail seek reassurance that the detail will come and will give real power to local authority because test valley borough council have face challenge since when the romsey brewery start its last brew be at school at the local primary school and remember the smell well that brewery site have an extant planning permission that have not be build out in the last year it be phenomenal shame to the town that every time the local council have try to put place in successful compulsory purchase order the developer have simply start work on one more unit of accommodation to delay that from happen give the part of the country that you be from mr deputy speaker you may be familiar with stanborough developments the company that bring that curse to romsey its action mean that we have brownfield site in the middle of the town with extant planning permission for project that have never be finish and that could be provide home for local people vividly remember westminster hall debate on this subject back in bring forward by my former right hon friend the member for guildford the great anne milton that be the first occasion on which have the dubious honour of try to both chair and speak in debate alex cunningham the former member for stockton north say that the labour party would bring forward penalty for this sort of developer appreciate that it will require retrospective legislation but seek reassurance that the labour government will make good on the promise make by mr cunningham about extant planning permission and that we will see developer like stanborough suitably punish reassure colleague that will not bang on about green belt this afternoon for the good reason that there be no green belt in hampshire save for tiny corner in the very south west design as you will know mr deputy speaker to prevent the spread of the urban conurbation of bournemouth which be in an entirely different county we would love some green belt but we simply do not have any what we do have be an area that be under extreme water stress we can not take our foot off the brake on building without also consider where the drinking water will come from the abbotswood development in my constituency frequently have to have water deliver by tanker because southern water repeatedly fail in its duty to provide water it be not exclusively to blame because although water company can be consult on development they have no right to say no to it they have no ability to say we simply can not deliver water to this development in area like the solent the situation will become increasingly challenging see in the page of the daily mail that the expectation be that southern hampshire will take an enormous amount of development under this government plan it can not do that if those home can not have water supply my right hon friend talk about the need for proper infrastructure alongside development in my basildon and billericay constituency around burstead billericay and laindon there be lot of concern about huge infrastructure go in without local consent do her constituent face that issue as well absolutely infrastructure be key to make new development work but we need to take community along with we and to work hand in hand with they in the debate we have hear about village up and down the country they be the heart of our rural community many village in romsey and southampton north have work incredibly hard to get their neighbourhood development plan in place and hold local referendum to confirm they but now they be scared that that work will go to waste yet again seek reassurance from the minister that that work will be uphold and cherish because it will give we the scale and type of community that we wish to see when local people have be involve in the process the government should not turn around and tell they that their view be now irrelevant and that development will be impose on they anyway in the minute have leave wish to make couple of further point over the last hour number of issue have pop into my inbox first and foremost there be still problem with the quality of new build when house be throw up at speed people be sometimes leave with significant build quality problem one gentleman email yesterday say that he have to spend fortunately he have insurance cover that amount to rectify the developer problem in my constituency we have sometimes see house tear down because the build quality be not good enough let we ensure that we do not see repeat of that while we be talk about new build estate can we solve the issue of estate management company rip off homeowner and not bring estate up to the quality need if the estate be to be adopt interruption can see that the under secretary of state for environment food and rural affairs the hon member for kingston upon hull west and haltemprice emma hardy be take that on her shoulder she should believe will be beat path to her door because there be much that still need to be do to ensure that the housing that be deliver be of good enough quality for people to live in call elsie blundell to make her maiden speech thank you mr deputy speaker for allow to make my maiden speech during this debate be so proud to represent heywood and middleton north it be new constituency comprise part of rochdale and most of the former heywood and middleton seat both in greater manchester people from my constituency have long shape our parliamentary democracy heywood be the birthplace of peter heywood famous for apprehend guy fawkes in the cellar beneath parliament in middleton too have famous son in sam bamford the radical social reformer who lead contingent of weaver from middleton into manchester in their peaceful protest for political representation end in massacre at st peter field spotland in the rochdale part of my constituency be home to stone road widely know as cotton famine road it be monument to the cotton worker who live there in the and who bravely side with the union cause during the american civil war it be selfless act especially as the union side at that time be prevent good from leave confederate port this result in shortage of cotton supply cotton famine and cause unemployment poverty and hardship across lancashire but support for president lincoln and his pledge to end the slave trade hold firm the worker campaign be support by rochdale statesman and radical john bright of whom sculpture can be find in the lower waiting hall of westminster palace bright be lifelong campaigner against slavery and be especially well know for his role in abolish the corn law alongside another great parliamentarian richard cobden who with apology to my hon friend the member for rochdale paul waugh will claim as predecessor as large part of what be his constituency now fall under heywood and middleton north boundary the history of the area represent then be strongly link to many political and social reform in this country and around the world and to ideal and value that we hold close to this day that there be no place for violence in our politic that the circumstance person be bear into must not prevent they from participate in our democracy and that as those cotton worker know in the we should be compassionate to all people regardless of race class or any other distinction alongside heywood middleton and spotland have the privilege of represent the former mill town of castleton with its proud history of manufacturing and engineering and the fantastic village of bamford and norden my constituency be also home to renowned architect edgar wood who be widely recognise as the most advanced english architect of his time more recently heywood be the birthplace of ian simpson one half of simpsonhaugh partners whose building such as beetham tower and one blackfriars compel people to look up to the skyline in both manchester and london to this day it be the people of heywood and middleton north who continue to make the place great and would like to use this speech to pay tribute to some of they they include retail worker such as robert and brenda bell from heywood who be also proud trade unionist for whom the employment right bill set out in the king speech will create extra right to work flexibly and make parental leave sick pay and protection from unfair dismissal day one right this government will also ban zero hour contract and fire and rehire then there be the many volunteer include the pullen family who run the heywood scouts group howard bowden and simon bennett who do excellent work through the friends of jubilee park group and st edmund church and pete knowles and his group of volunteer at stoney hill community wildlife area who protect and promote our beautiful meadow and woodland and make sure that child in relatively urban area can access nature too people like these make my constituency great and will do everything that can to support they would like to pay tribute to my predecessor chris clarkson have represent the people of heywood and middleton for the past four and half year know that many member of this house value his good humour and enjoy work alongside he include on the science innovation and technology committee liz mcinnes be the mp for heywood and middleton between and and serve in two shadow ministerial role liz work incredibly hard in both of those position and be fierce advocate for her constituent on many issue include the nhs in which she have previously work for the past seven year have enjoy career in transport planning be incredibly pleased by the measure set out in the king speech to accelerate infrastructure delivery and to improve our transport network unfortunately many people in my constituency do not have access to the opportunity and job they need as heywood and middleton despite their location in the great modern city region of greater manchester be two of the large town in the north west of england not to be serve by rail station or metrolink tram stop as one former shadow chancellor ed balls argue in recent paper there have be too little transport investment in low productivity area such as mine we need to improve transport connectivity throughout city region like greater manchester because good transport infrastructure allow for more frequent interaction between people and create large pool of worker for business early this month we receive promise news from the greater manchester combine authority of re commitment to the linking of middleton into greater manchester metrolink network and of progress on plan for heywood tram train connection in future that will form part of the city region integrate transport network which greater manchester must carry on deliver at pace to boost productivity pay job and living standard in heywood and middleton north finally when it come to devolution for our city region the job be well under way but we must be mindful of the fact that it be not yet finish look forward to support our new government because know that through the english devolution bill and other measure they will put power back into the hand of work people and money back into their pocket they will strive to ensure that powerful force be not able to disenfranchise those people again throughout history my constituent have have too much experience of that thank right hon and hon member for their attention and thank you mr deputy speaker for allow to make my first contribution welcome the hon member for heywood and middleton north mrs blundell who give wonderful speech it be interesting to hear about her constituency confess that do not know much about it before but certainly know lot about it now it be generous of the hon lady to pay rightful compliment to her predecessor chris clarkson who be much miss on this side of the house couple of week ago the labour party win mandate for the manifesto that it put before the british electorate we respect that it be part of the british parliamentary system and we respect the peaceful transfer of power however say gently to the labour government that it be concern that the king speech and subsequent comment from ministers have reject the notion that local community should be at the heart of development in their area one particular issue affect my constituency of south leicestershire the propose hinckley national rail freight interchange on july the new chancellor state that she would ask the secretary of state for transport who will make the decision on the interchange and the secretary of state for energy security and net zero to prioritise decision on infrastructure project that have be sit unresolved for far too long she do not of course explain what she mean by sit unresolved for far too long but let help the new chancellor and government sit unresolved for far too long be perhaps an unfortunate euphemism what should actually be say be that in our system of law we respect and listen to local community we listen to stakeholder group and neighbourhood group of course in most instance local authority elect councillor be in most planning instance the one whose remit it be to make these decision on the issue of the hinckley national rail freight interchange should say that south leicestershire already have its fair share of development it have one of the large housing development in leicestershire with new lubbesthorpe and magna park one of the large logistic park in europe be to be double in size it have bruntingthorpe aerodrome which play host to many industrial activity and it have the prospect of new village whetstone gorse or whetstone pastures it be not nimbyism in south leicestershire that have lead to the objection to the hinckley national rail freight interchange it be the fact that there be five other rail freight interchange within radius of mile of south leicestershire be glad the new deputy prime minster have take seat to listen to my speech about this matter but it be important that the labour government listen not just to and my constituent but to leicestershire county council to warwickshire county council and even to labour lead rugby council all of which have raise issue with the planning process for this unwelcome proposal can my hon friend confirm that that decision be now with labour minister to make at national level override those local concern my hon friend be quite right the decision now rest with the new labour government to make be afraid that labour councillor and other labour activist who might have oppose the hinckley national rail freight interchange should look now to their party colleague in government who will be make this decision within matter of few week urge the government to listen to the people of south leicestershire and the stakeholder have mention urge they to listen to the people of elmesthorpe sapcote sharnford aston flamville and stoney stanton and to the constituent of my hon friend the member for hinckley and bosworth dr evans who himself have make some valuable comment against the propose rail freight interchange it be deeply

congratulate the secretary of state and the ministerial team on their appointment and wish they well also pay tribute to the hon member for chesterfield mr perkins and for newport west and islwyn ruth jones who do lot of the hard yard in opposition and miss out on ministerial role this time pay tribute to the excellent maiden speech we have hear on both side of the house today we start with the hon member for bishop auckland sam rushworth who be delighted to hear have significant rural area in his constituency and have an interest in this sector we hear from the hon member for edinburgh south west dr arthur who give the house an informed tour of his constituency we have fantastic speech from my hon friend the member for gordon and buchan harriet cross who bring real practical and professional experience to rural affair and rightly focus on the need to tailor policy to the need of rural community we hear from the new hon member for middlesbrough south and east cleveland luke myer who be very generous in his tribute to his much respect predecessor we have brilliant speech from my hon friend the member for bognor regis and littlehampton alison griffiths who highlight the importance of the rural economy and water quality what an asset she will be in the house we also hear from the hon member for hexham joe morris who talk about farming as the beat heart of his constituency while the hon member for heywood and middleton north mrs blundell speak about the radicalism of former figure from middleton hope that will inform her relationship with the government whips office move forward we have two outstanding closing speech my hon friend the member for broxbourne lewis cocking speak about the importance of infrastructure in the rural economy and focus particularly on planning we also witness the huge experience which be respect across the house that the hon member for bury st edmunds and stowmarket peter prinsley bring as surgeon know he will be an important voice in health debate among other be delighted that all those new member choose to make their maiden speech on the issue of rural affair in the king speech labour campaign on slogan of change but they be offer only uncertainty to farming and fishing community it be no surprise that just last night the president of the national farmers union say that farmer be face cliff edge and be be keep up at night by the uncertainty that uncertainty be not because the labour government have not have time to prepare their policy for farming and fishing it be because the issue be not priority for labour government that be why the labour manifesto have just word on farming and nothing at all on fishing it be why this king speech have nothing for the farming and fishing community it be why the government have not even give any date for when this uncertainty will end we should be clear in this house that that be an active choice it be point that the government have choose to prioritise in contrast to the prioritisation we be willing to make with the additional funding that we commit be it not all the more ironic that just few year ago the now prime minister go to the nfu and admit that farming and rural affair have for too long be an afterthought for the labour party and promise to change that that be an early example of promise change that be not then deliver we can see that uncertainty in the farming budget the government have make no commitment to what the budget will be or whether they be continue it or increase it we be willing to make decision to prioritise billion of additional funding over this parliament there be nothing from labour on that leave farmer uncertain can the secretary of state confirm what his budget will be do he even know have the chancellor tell he can he even tell the house when he might know we do not even know when the spending review will be he be probably as much in the dark as the rest of we what about the uncertainty on food security we make commitment with the food security index the annual farm to fork summit the food security duty the big ever grant payment and the additional funding to deal with the wet weather that farmer have recently face what be the commitment from the labour government on food security there be nothing in the king speech about legislate for that can the secretary of state confirm whether they intend to legislate and it be just an omission that they do not get around to or be it something that he be now rule out what about the uncertainty about just how much farmland will be lose as result of this government we know what their environmental target be to triple solar to increase onshore wind and to increase the pylon connect to offshore wind so can the secretary of state confirm to the house that he will publish before the summer recess an impact assessment on how much farmland will be lose as result of deliver his environmental target do he even know one cornerstone of the conservative manifesto be for an underground first approach to new electricity pylon that be an important matter for my constituent in basildon and billericay will my right hon friend also highlight to the government exactly how important that be and try to seek an answer on what their proposal be in this space my right hon friend get to the nub of the issue because if government be promise change they need to be able to say what the timeline be they need to say what the budget be and what legislation they will pass to deliver that on all those thing there be silence in this king speech the labour manifesto have lot of high sound thing that be hard to disagree with labour want more food security and say that food security be national security and we on the opposition benches agree labour say it want to raise animal welfare and we have do huge amount to do so that be fine however if the government say they want to end the badger cull when will they do that there be nothing in the king speech on that so what be the timeline dairy farmer would like to know will the secretary of state publish the analysis from the chief veterinary officer on what the impact of end the cull would be on the trajectory we know that the current approach have see tb case come down in england from in to below certainly the advice that have be that vaccination would not be ready for some time will he publish the trajectory and tell we when the cull will end you need to respect the science of course we respect the science the hon gentleman chunter from sedentary position but presume he will get the same science brief in way he make my point that get from the chief vet which be that the vaccination be not ready and the cull be be effective in fact we only need to look at labour policy in wales where the opposite be happen to see that hope that as he represent cambridge he will follow the science because the government make commitment that do not perhaps that be the sort of change they mean change from what they commit to in the manifesto it do not take long speak of thing at high level that no one can disagree with the government talk about make more use of public sector procurement again the conservatives not only agree with that but we have help the government with it the former member for colchester do fantastic review the quince review look at how that will be do but the government be silent on the funding for that will it be fund out of the budget of the department for health and social care the department for education the ministry of defence local government or will it come out of the secretary of state budget it be difficult for he to say because he do not even know what his budget will be the reality be that we have empty slogan from party that do not care about the rural economy the government be not give clarity to farming and fishing they barely mention farming in their manifesto and they do not even mention fishing this king speech do nothing for the farming and fishing community the decision that we have see so far take vast amount of farmland out of food production in order to prioritise the eco zealotry that we have hear so often in this house hope the secretary of state will give the clarity that be sadly lack in the king speech on what the government will do and when on the budget on food procurement and on dairy farmer and the badger cull and will end the uncertainty that the president of the nfu and so many other in the farming and fishing community currently face it be huge honour on my first opportunity to speak from the dispatch box as the secretary of state to close today debate on his majesty gracious speech welcome my predecessor now the shadow secretary of state to his place and thank he for the way he have work constructively with look forward to that continue although prefer it this way around it have be an honour to be present for maiden speech from across the house unfortunately do not have the time to go through their excellent comment in much detail but would like to mention my hon friend the members for bishop auckland sam rushworth for edinburgh south west dr arthur for cramlington and killingworth emma foody for middlesbrough south and east cleveland luke myer for hexham joe morris for heywood and middleton north mrs blundell and for bury st edmunds and stowmarket peter prinsley many of they represent rural constituency and they all show what great asset they will be to this house and to the community they represent can not respond to everyone who have speak be sorry about that but will do my good to cover what can in the limited time available will start with the subject of planning this government be elect on mandate to get britain build again as the deputy prime minister say reform the planning system be the key to unlock our country economic growth the exist planning system be too restrictive slow and uncertain which undermine investor confidence and mean that the home that we desperately need do not get build we will overhaul the planning system to tackle the chronic shortage of home and power up the economy alongside that we be elect on platform to deliver for nature and will take urgent action to meet the environment act target that the previous government miss we will protect create and improve space that increase climate resilience and promote nature recovery on land and at sea recognise that ensure positive outcome for nature be fundamental to unlock the housing and infrastructure that this country so urgently need we must take tough action to tackle the housing emergency and build the million home that we need over this parliament but we remain committed to preserve the green belt our brownfield first approach mean that that authority should prioritise brownfield site however brownfield development alone will not be enough so we will also transform low quality grey belt land such as wasteland or old car park into housing include affordable home for those most in need rise be sorry there be not enough time for to give way interruption member should have speak for less time rural community have be severely undermine by the previous conservative government for party that once claim to be the party of the countryside their track record be one of abject and absolute neglect voter in the countryside reject their failure and embrace labour positive vision that be evident from the huge increase in labour mps represent rural constituency and the collapse in rural support for the conservatives thank to the conservative party transport link in many rural area be now close to non existent there be more pothole in england road than crater on the moon school can not recruit enough teacher gp surgery be full family can not find an nhs dentist thousand of rural business have collapse and rural crime go unpunished this be an abandonment of the countryside on historic scale if we solve the problem of social care we will not need to build ever big hospital but be optimistic for our nhs britain lead the world in scientific advance right in my own region of east anglia we have
