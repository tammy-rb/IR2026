time as he well know the new administration will recognise that this important deal protect our security and that of the united states as well as the unimpeded operation of the base on diego garcia which have be our primary objective throughout this process drone high security prisons urgent question to ask the secretary of state for justice if she will make statement on the national security risk of drone be use to deliver weapon to high security prison this be not new issue effective prison security be fundamental to the rehabilitative nature of prison and ensure public confidence in the criminal justice system the availability of illicit item in our jail include drug and mobile phone undermine prison officer ability to do their job drone sighting around prison in england and wales be matter of great concern and pose major threat to prison security the government inherit prison system in crisis with violence and drug use on the rise we be work hard to deter detect and disrupt the use of drone it be not possible to talk in detail of the tactic we use to disrupt drone give the obvious security implication what can say be that his majesty prison and probation service invest in target countermeasure such as improvement to window netting and grille to stop drone from successfully deliver cargo such as drug and weapon in january restrict fly zone be introduce around all closed prison and young offender institution support police and prison staff to disrupt illegal drone use ultimately it be crucial that we tackle demand almost half of people enter prison have drug problem so we must get they into the right treatment to tackle the drug misuse that be so often driver of their reoffending contraband supply and the illicit economy drive violence self harm and instability and prevent offender from engage in rehabilitative activity we be work to crack down on the level of violence and drug in our prison the illicit economy be unfortunately highly profitable with price for drug and other commodity between and time their street value an sheet of paper lace with drug can be worth so we must tackle the organise crime gang behind it that be why we have invest in dedicated serious and organised crime unit who will work with law enforcement agency to disrupt these sophisticated criminal network we will continue to take multifaceted approach to drone and the disruption that they cause to our prison system give that this be question of national security find it astonish that the lord chancellor can not be bother to turn up to the house today order we do not need any more of that thank you mr speaker yesterday the chief inspector of prison warn that the police and prison service have cede the airspace above two high security prison to organise crime group the result be that organise crime gang can deliver drug phone and weapon such as zombie knife to inmate with impunity due to the absence of basic security measure such as functional cctv protective netting and window repair across two visit in september and october he describe damn picture of thrive illicit economy that jeopardise the safety of dedicated prison staff in hmp manchester almost four in prisoner have test positive in mandatory drug test and in hmp long lartin the figure be nearly three in those two prison hold some of the most dangerous man in our country include murderer and terrorist if organised crime gang can deliver phone and drug to inmate cell they could be deliver serious weapon and explosive as well the chief inspector say that the potential for escape or hostage taking be of enormous concern this could not be more serious the situation have become in his word threat to national security do not pretend that these problem be entirely new but they have deteriorate and they need urgent action will the minister provide the timeframe for fix the most basic security measure what visit have the lord chancellor make to hmp manchester and hmp long lartin if she have not visit when do she intend to go little else could be more pressing what discussion have she hold with the prison governor will the minister assure the house that the government have confidence in the senior management to restore order do he agree with the chief inspector that the failure to grip the situation be serious indictment of the department who have year to grip this situation at least this government be take order this government be take action in the first six month the right hon member will know that drone sighting around prison increase by over between and on his government watch much like everything in our prison his government have leave it to we to fix the broken system and clean up their mess it be bit rich for he to come here and lecture we when he have year to put this right we be instal new cctv system netting and other countermeasure to combat drone we have clamp down on the contraband that fuel violence behind bar we be tackle drone through cross government approach as well as learn from our international counterpart to support our effort we be work with our five eyes partner they face the same issue across their prison estate because this be not uk problem but global problem along with the home office and the ministry of defence we have ray body scanner in prison provide full coverage of the closed adult male estate to prevent the internal smuggling of illicit contraband we be take action while the opposition just spout call the chair of the justice committee the minister will no doubt be pleased that the justice committee have just announce an inquiry into drug in prison with an emphasis on the use of drone by organise crime gang to supply inmate what make it easy for drone to access prison be the appalling state of prison maintenance there be billion backlog which do not accrue in the past six month the shadow secretary of state surprise be in itself surprising what be the timetable for repair the problem in prison and get to grip with that maintenance backlog my hon friend be completely right that the prison maintenance programme that we inherit be in state that be why the chancellor announce in the budget million boost to the prison maintenance budget over the next couple of year that be important he be right also to say that we need to grip this which be why the prisons minister in the other place have visit manchester and be regularly update on the situation there call the liberal democrat spokesperson the word that be miss from the shadow justice secretary question just now be sorry national audit office report say of the then conservative treasury investment in prison maintenance and security that capital budget allocation for prison have be well below the level need who be treasury minister at that time none other than the shadow justice secretary today report be the late chapter in catalogue of tory prison failure that scupper their mission to reduce reoffende and therefore let down victim of crime will the minister tell we about new approach to well empower governor with the investment and the autonomy need to properly invest in prison maintenance and security what investment will he make in prison officer recruitment through programme such as unlocked graduates which be critical to help drive security in our prison the hon member be right about the failure miss in the shadow minister question he be also right to ask what the government be do to support prison officer and prison governor we be invest in that and we will announce new programme for training and develop new governor very shortly thank the minister for his statement the conservatives be do another faux outrage as they be the one who cede the airspace after year of colossal failure in our justice system what lesson can we learn from that failure so that we tackle the problem of drug in prison which be big driver of drone drop the lesson be that we need to work with prison governor and the police and invest in action to deal with the problem that be exactly what we be do we be work with everybody in the system to sort this mess out apart from the serious security concern that this activity raise it show that prison bring resource pressure for local police force in west suffolk where highpoint prison be due to grow significantly in the year ahead the police have ask to ask the minister to ensure they receive additional funding to reflect that pressure will he do so the hon member be right that it be important that local police force work strongly with hm prison and probation service on this issue that be what be happen he will know that funding both locally and nationally be deal with in an appropriate way the prison officers association have be say for the past five year that the threat of drone destabilise our prison and pose massive security risk let draw the minister attention to the anti drone system at hmp guernsey which very effectively prevent that threat can we expect this new system to be implement in all prison in england and wales anything that work will be build upon that be part of it drone technology have be accelerate through the ukraine war we know that we need to work very hard to keep ahead of the felon on this we all appreciate the destructive impact of drug in our prison in stone great wyrley and penkridge we have the large cluster of prison in the united kingdom with hmp featherstone hmp oakwood and brinsford young offender institution prison officer do an amazing job try to tackle this issue but what specific measure can the minister bring forward to support their work to try to ensure that prisoner ultimately get on to the path of rehabilitation and kick the habit of drug the right hon member be right that prison officer do an outstanding job want to take the opportunity to commend the work of prison officer up and down this country eighty prison now have incentivise substance free living unit provide supportive environment for prisoner who commit to live drug free with regular drug test and incentive that project appear to be work there have be long stand issue at wandsworth prison in my constituency which have multiple drone drop every single week give the lack of cctv no netting and high staff vacancy little can be do to combat they follow the announcement of million investment into the prison will the minister please ensure that all these issue be address and ameliorate my hon friend be absolutely right that we need to work hard to address these issue but if there be simple solution the previous administration would have wave that magic wand and we would not be sit here today it be important that the ongoing work of prison governor support by hmpps across the country and by ministers get to the bottom of this and sort thing out which be what we be try to do livelink aerospace in my constituency be surveillance company that have create technology that be be use on royal navy ship in airport and on private yacht this technology could be crucial to maintain the no fly zone above prison which be introduce in january last year will the minister explore this technology will he come to my constituency to visit livelink aerospace and see what the technology can do it be important that we take advantage of what intelligence be out there if the hon lady write to will be happy to follow that up appropriately with she and the business involve do the minister agree that the conservative party leave our prison in crisis with drug and drone use rife will he outline the urgent step that his government be take to ensure that such colossal failure can never happen again my hon friend be absolutely right we inherit prison estate that be full the police and the court be in danger of not be able to lock people up that be an abrogation of duty by the conservative party we have roll up our sleeve and tackle that and we will tackle this problem as well thank the minister for very positive recent meeting on an unrelated subject be the main problem here the detection of the incoming drone or the ability to impede the delivery once they have be detect thank the right hon gentleman for the positive meeting have recently with he official and the local business the answer to his question be that both those thing be issue on visit the three prison in the sheppey prison cluster in my constituency it be clear to see how the prison estate have be degrade over the past year have talk to prison officer who be my constituent as well as work in the constituency about the problem they face day in day out it take more than few sign say no drone to stop those drone what be the minister do to listen to prison officer and the prison officers association and to support they in tackle this those officer face threat and pressure from organised crime will he meet to discuss this far would be happy to meet my hon friend if he could drop note to remind will do that this week the prisons minister be meet official from the prison officers association whenever visit prison as do regularly meet the prison officers association representative in that prison they be key partner in tackle the problem that we have inherit from the previous government high security prison ensure that our national security be not compromise because they house some of the most dangerous threat to our society in government the conservatives introduce legislation to make it an automatic offence to fly drone within metre of any closed prison what assurance can the minister give this house that those who commit such offence will feel the full force of the law that important action take by the previous government be quite correctly support by labour in opposition when anybody be find guilty of fly detect drone the appropriate prosecution will follow the welsh affairs committee recently visit parc prison in wales where we see the type of contraband be smuggle into prison by drone one of the big problem report to we be multiple drone come in at the same time it be difficult for the security team to then bring they down even though they be use cctv what be the minister do to outlaw the use of those drone to keep our prisoner safe and secure the security and safety of prisoner and prison officer be very important the prisons minister and the under secretary of state for justice my hon friend the member for pontypridd alex davies jones sit to my right recently visit parc prison and be well aware of the issue they be work with the prison authority to address they two month ago in the house raise concern that hmp garth have be liken to an airport because of the number of drone illegally fly drug into the prison in response the lord chancellor tell that the prisons minister be meet the governor and think about how to deal with those report november vol what precise action have the department take since then and what action will the minister take today to deal with the problem at hmp manchester action be be take and thing be be do have mention the issue around window and netting and bar but frankly this be security issue we be up against organised crime we will not talk publicly about the measure that we be consider because that would not be the good way of tackle the issue recognise that this issue be very much relate to drug have previously work for homeless charity have see the huge amount of damage that drug can cause to people life and to their family what be the government do about the wide issue of drug supply both in and out of prison as have already say it be very important that we tackle drug dependency in prison the fact that we now have little bit more space in prison allow more work to go on there to tackle drug dependency we know that education and employment also help to reduce reoffende which be why we have commit to improve prisoner access to not only drug support programme but purposeful activity and employment the government have say time and again that they want to smash the criminal gang that illegally smuggle illegal migrant into the uk yet the government can not even smash the gang that smuggle drug and phone into our prison how can my resident trust the government to smash these gang the resident of broxbourne will be well aware that for year the government that the hon gentleman support fail to tackle this problem this government be roll up our sleeve and get on with it this be long stand problem and the previous government do not do anywhere near enough to deal with it what they do do when former prime minister liz truss be lord chancellor be arrange for more dog to bark at drone around prison which they assure we would work have the ministry of justice do an assessment on how effective that policy be think everybody agree that that policy be bark thank the minister for his answer today and for his clear commitment to make change that will make difference in northern ireland prison contraband have be difficult issue to get on top of give the news today that drone be be so successfully use in the uk there be obvious cause for concern that their use may become more prevalent how will the minister ensure that the step take apply equally across this great united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland and that any additional funding that be require will be allocate any lesson learn need to be apply across the united kingdom and that will happen we need to work with our five eyes partner to ensure that the very good action be take northern ireland need to get the good of that as well uk china economic and financial dialogue growth be the no mission of this labour government to grow the economy we need to help great british business to export around the world include to china the second big economy in the world and our fourth large trading partner not engage be simply not an option that be why lead delegation include the governor of the bank of england the chief executive of the financial conduct authority and representative of some of britain large financial service firm include hsbc standard chartered and schroders to the uk china economic and financial dialogue the first of its kind since this dialogue have deliver set of tangible benefit to ensure that british firm have great access to the chinese market while

programme to make substantive progress on improve arrangement for uk exporter and investor as reflect in new agreement on vaccine approval fertiliser whisky labelling legal service automotive and accountancy which have set we on course for this dialogue to unlock billion of value for the uk economy these outcome agree with my counterpart vice premier he lifeng represent pragmatic co operation in action and support secure and resilient economic growth because security and economic growth go hand in hand that mean find the right way to build stable and balanced relationship with china that be in our national interest one that recognise the importance of co operation in address the global issue that we face of compete where our interest differ and of challenge robustly whenever that be require in beijing and shanghai be clear that while we must co operate on area of mutual interest we will confidently challenge on area where we disagree express our country real economic and trade concern to the chinese include about trade imbalance and economic security and raise concern about russia illegal war in ukraine human right and restriction on right and freedom in hong kong include the case of jimmy lai and the completely unjustified sanction against british parliamentarian key outcome of this dialogue be that we have secure china commitment to improve exist channel so that we can openly discuss sensitive issue and the way in which they impact our economy because if we do not engage with china we can not raise our real concern this dialogue be just one part of our engagement with trading partner across the world since become chancellor have be to new york washington toronto and brussels to build our global economic relationship while my right hon friend the business secretary have travel to the gulf to boost trade and investment and my right hon friend the foreign secretary be engage with partner all over the world to deliver growth that benefit people across the united kingdom we must continue to go far fast in drive economic growth to make work people well off that be why the prime minister launch our artificial intelligence opportunity action plan yesterday it throw the full weight of government behind ai in the uk to revolutionise our public service and make our economy more productive it be why next week will talk to business leader investor and entrepreneur at the world economic forum meeting in davos to make the case that the uk be one of the good place in the world in which to invest in the come week will set out further detail of our plan to kick start growth in the economy after year of failure from the conservative party call the shadow chancellor of the exchequer it be good to see the chancellor in her place and thank she for advance sight of her statement know that she have be away so let update she on the mess that she leave behind the pound have hit month low government borrowing cost be at year high growth have be kill stone dead inflation be rise impact million interest rate be stay higher for long and business confidence have fall through the floor the labour party talk down the economy and crippled business with colossal taxis break all their promise this be crisis make in downing street it should hardly surprise the chancellor that international market be uneasy the uk long term borrowing cost have rise to their high in almost year but while the government be lose control of the economy where be the chancellor her trip to china have not even begin when my urgent question be take in the house last week she be still in the country but she send the chief secretary to the treasury rather than face up to her failure may ask she why she choose not to respond herself the chancellor of course duck the difficult question by jet off to beijing believe that in labour circle they be call it the peking duck but whatever be on the menu in china be it really worth the unedifye sight of an increasingly desperate politician scamper halfway around the world with begging bowl the chancellor deal pale in comparison to labour black hole which open up in the public finance while the right hon lady be absent from her station let give the house sense of scale the deal that the chancellor have announce amount to million year the rise in our borrowing cost due to her disastrous budget have add about billion to our annual spending on debt interest alone literally time what she say she have bring back from beijing that be money that can not now be spend on the public priority that billion be enough to pay for nurse or to cover labour pernicious winter fuel payment cut for eight and half year and of course even before this late market reaction the budget mean spend ten of billion more on service our debt accord to the office for budget responsibility forecast two third of the money raise from the chancellor job tax will be swallow up by additional debt interest forget those billion go towards well public service they be go on pay the price of labour mismanagement we on this side of the house know how this sorry story go we have see it all before socialist government who think that they can tax and spend their way to prosperity labour government who simply do not understand that if you tax the living daylight out of business you will get stagnation they do not understand because there be barely shred of business experience on the government front bench may ask the right hon lady which of her promise she will break if the obr judge in march that she be now in breach of her own fiscal rule will she cancel promise spending will she ramp up borrowing or will she raise taxis yet again this whole sorry tale be nothing short of shakespearean tragedy be play out before our eye this be the hamlet of our time labour promise the electorate much while pour the poison into their ear and the end you can feel the end the chancellor flailing estranged it seem from those close to she those about she fall the drum beat ever close to go or not to go that be now question the prime minister will be damn if he do but he will surely be damn if he do not the british people deserve well the shadow chancellor be simply not serious be on the opposition side of the house for year and think that after statement one usually ask some question we hear great deal from the right hon gentleman about what he would not do but we hear absolutely nothing about what he would do now we can see what happen when the leader of the opposition tell the shadow cabinet that it should not have any policy as far as can tell the conservative party economic strategy be to say that the uk should not engage with the second large economy in the world or indeed with our near neighbour and our big trading partner in the european union the right hon gentleman economic strategy be to support high spending but none of the right decision that be require to deliver sound public finance and his economic strategy be to ignore the mistake of the past with no apology to the british people for his part in liz truss mini budget that crash the economy appreciate that have say that may now receive cease and desist letter from her later one question that the shadow chancellor do ask be why do go to china go to secure tangible benefit for british business trade overseas the right hon gentleman say that it be not worth it let he say that to the representative of hsbc standard chartered prudential schroders and the london stock exchange who attend those meeting with last week all of whom have speak of the difference that it will make have be under no illusion about the scale of challenge that we face after year of stagnant economic growth high debt and economic uncertainty and we have see global economic uncertainty play out in the last week but leadership be not about duck these challenge it be about rise to they the economic headwind we face be reminder that we should indeed we must go far and fast in our plan to kick start economic growth which plunge under the last government by bring stability to the public finance after year of instability under the conservative party unlock investment that plummet under the previous government and push ahead with essential reform to our economy and public service that be my message to the house today because if we get it right the prize on offer to we to the british people be immense the opportunity to make work people well off by make britain well off that be the mandate this government have and that be what we will deliver call the chair of the treasury committee welcome my right hon friend commitment to growth in this country and to encourage investment in the uk listen to the shadow chancellor the right hon member for central devon mel stride we would think the country be go to hell in handcart do my right hon friend agree that this be no time for panic that it be perfectly possible to manage any pressure on the budget through astute management of public spending and that we be very long way from the approach take during the year of austerity under the conservative party thank the chair of the select committee for that question set out this government fiscal rule at the budget in october we will pay for day to day spending through tax receipt and we will get debt down as share of the economy we remain committed to those fiscal rule and will meet they at all time call the liberal democrat spokesperson thank the chancellor for advance sight of her statement let we be blunt the budget have not work the chancellor say that the government no mission be growth but to date there be no sign that the government be go to deliver it the national insurance contribution rise be self defeat it undermine growth it do not unleash it and it pile pressure on to struggle small business and high street nor do it raise anything like the sum of money for the nhs that the government initially suggest it would now we have this much laud visit to china which the government themselves say be only worth million to the uk over the next five year that be equivalent to just five and half hour of nhs spending hour over the five year period all growth be welcome but this really be small beer what be we to make of the chancellor pledge to improve exist channel with china it be nothing short of warm word and mixed message the chancellor should not have go to china unless there be commitment that jimmy lai be go to be release do the chancellor now accept that the national insurance increase will damage growth do she accept that there be and still be much fairer way to raise the necessary revenue without hold back our economy and our high street the international market jitter we have see in the last few day be largely cause by the threat of tariff by the new trump administration so will the chancellor guard against the risk of trump presidency by rebuild our trading relationship with our european neighbour after the economic vandalism of the previous conservative government and their mini budget our nhs and care service be still on their knee do the chancellor accept that wealth and health be two side of the same coin and that scale back any investment in the nhs will be not only devastating for local community but damage for economic growth be slightly confuse by the hon lady response the liberal democrats oppose every decision we make to get the public finance under control at the budget and now they say that we need to spend more on public service well be afraid they can not have it both way the only way there be more money for our public service be by raise it as we do in the budget decision that the liberal democrats apparently oppose the hon lady say that million be not worth it that be million of tangible benefit for british business trade overseas would have think she would welcome enhance trade and investment as way to create more good job pay decent wage in st albans and indeed in all our constituency the hon lady say that we should not go to china because we need to raise difficult issue be not sure how she think we be go to raise difficult issue unless we engage with the second big economy in the world because go to china be able to raise issue around human right force labour hong kong and jimmy lai and the sanctioning of parliamentarian we can not raise those issue unless we be in the room be in the room and therefore able to do just that labour be the party that put billion into the national health service at the budget in october we be able to do that because of the difficult decision we take include on taxation the hon lady seem to want the additional money for public service but without find any way to pay for they that be the way the conservative party get into its trouble be afraid the liberal democrats be go down exactly the same path may thank the chancellor for raise the case of my constituent jimmy lai know it will mean lot to he and his family do she agree that it be because of the profound difference that it be vital we maintain this strategic engagement thank my hon friend for what she have just say on behalf of the whole house want to send our good wish to the family of jimmy lai at this difficult time have the opportunity to raise this as well as other issue during my time in china and it be incredibly important that at every opportunity we have we raise some of the difficult issue and challenge the chinese authority in way that be appropriate and consistent with our british value the economic and financial dialogue be stay because of the brutal imposition of the national security law in hong kong when the chancellor and the government go back to engage and reopen that dialogue they do so on the back of thing get bad not well the reality put to she be that while she be away shein refuse point blank at select committee hearing to answer the question of whether it have slave labour in its supply chain but the government want it to list here in london we have solar array be import by the government into the uk that demonstrably involve slave labour can the chancellor be clear with the house about the government position on slave labour can she explain whether this government will allow any product or service or allow company to align themselves here or import good here that contain any slave labour no matter how important that import be thank the right hon gentleman for that question know how seriously he take this issue like so many other member on both side of the house list of company in the uk be decision for the financial conduct authority but any company list on the london stock exchange have to live up to the responsibility set out by the united nations and the oecd on force labour this government be commit to work with international partner and business to ensure that global supply chain be free from human and labour right abuse as the right hon gentleman know under section of the modern slavery act commercial business that operate in the uk and have turnover of more than million be require to report annually on the step they have take and rightly so because modern slavery be abhorrent and this government continue to take step to deal with it first may remind conservative member that uk bond yield be rise for the same reason that german and french bond yield be because they be track the us rate they never be very good at number the chancellor have set out her economic philosophy that our prosperity be build upon secure foundation in more uncertain world will she set out how she be build that economic security here particularly with reference to have domestic energy rather than be dependent on foreign fossil fuel dictator my hon friend be absolutely right to say that economic growth have to be build on strong foundation which be the approach of this government our mission to make britain clean energy superpower be consistent with that if we can ween ourselves off fossil fuel and the oil of dictator we will be more secure in our economy because we will not have to import so much from overseas it be good to see the chancellor back from china and to hear her reiterate that growth be her no mission because we have not have any growth since her budget give that accept responsibility be the first step in solve problem will she accept that last october budget have cause business confidence and growth prospect in this country economy to plunge think for moment that the hon lady be go to apologise for liz truss mini budget maybe she will do so on another occasion thank the chancellor for raise the case of jimmy lai hope that the government will in future press the case of pension owe to british national overseas constituent in earley and woodley and across the uk who have move here from hong kong be surprised to hear the shadow chancellor advocate knee jerk response to inter day movement in market price would argue that such short termism lead to the conservative party have five chancellor in only four year will the chancellor reassure we that she will not be mislead by short termism and that she will instead keep her focus on our government long term ambition to raise living standard and growth my hon friend be absolutely right there have be movement in international market in the past week or so and they have be global in nature in the uk we must do what we can which be why have reiterate today my commitment to the fiscal rule that set out in the budget in october reiterate that growth be the no mission of this government growth build on stability which will come through secure the public finance through investment include through the national wealth fund and gb energy and through reform of our planning system to make it easy to build in britain get people back to work and of our pension system this government be crack on after year of failure from the conservative party do the communist party of china tell the chancellor that she be do good job or bad job of run the uk economy when she be there be not seek assurance from any foreign government on the performance of this government what be seek achieve this in china be tangible output for british business trade overseas help to create more good job that pay decent wage here in britain the conservative party absolutely fail to do that in year thank the chancellor for her statement particularly welcome the fact that she raise the issue of jimmy lai and human right in beijing which be really important after year of the conservative party inconsistency on china do she agree that we need cross whitehall strategy and pragmatic approach what be really important be that we take decision in britain national interest take decision in the national interest mean engage with our trading partner all around the world which be why since be appoint as chancellor have be to brussels to reset our relation with the european union as well as to washington and new york to welcome investment from overseas have secure million worth of benefit for uk business do business in china will the chancellor of the exchequer do what the prime minister refuse to do yesterday and rule out future spending cut be not go to write five year worth of budgets in the first six month of labour government but be absolutely committed to meet the fiscal rule that set out in the budget in october we know what happen when government lose control of the public finance they crash the economy and end up on the opposition benches the chancellor may be able to learn bit about emergency spending cut from the scottish government in holyrood who have have three year of emergency spending cut do the chancellor agree that it be essential to engage with large economy like china so that we can export our brilliant financial service sector and whisky from scotland in the real world we have to trade with large economy like china many of the benefit that we secure last week be for the financial service sector and both edinburgh and glasgow be important hub of financial service in the uk business such as abrdn and standard chartered which be on the delegation with have welcome the tangible benefit which will result in more job and more economic prosperity in scotland and across the united kingdom it have be report that the chancellor be go to meet the owner of british steel in china many of my constituent

engagement my right hon friend the business secretary have meet mr li from jingye on number of occasion talk be ongoing but be not able to provide an update on that today the chancellor have only my admiration and support for the tough decision that she be take to fix the fundamental while conservative members be carp about the chancellor whereabouts this week she be have serious discussion with the world second large economy and secure access for uk firm be it not clear that only labour member be serious about growth will always stand up for britain national and economic interest which be why be help some of our good business to export around the world that be what do in china at the weekend and it be what will continue to do will always stand up for our economic interest have the chancellor of the exchequer speak to the governor of the bank of england about what action need to be take to bring about stability in our bond market regularly speak to the governor of the bank of england indeed he be with on the delegation to china this weekend we work closely together to ensure that the british economy remain competitive in global market be quite surprised at the audaciousness of those on the opposition benches the conservatives oversee rise in debt level over the last year and it be shame that they do not turn their mind to the issue early do the chancellor agree that serious discussion such as the one with china can deliver not just on our economic aim but on our wide climate and international objective unless we engage and work with our partner around the world we will miss out on the opportunity that other country secure for their business and economy if we miss out on those investment and trade opportunity we can be sure that other country will take advantage of they that be why be in china and it be why will work with counterpart around the world to secure good outcome for british business and job here in the united kingdom the chancellor raise the issue of human right abuse in china but do she get the opportunity to raise with her interlocutor the extrajudicial work of the united front work department particularly in relation to uk institution especially university raise number of issue around human right abuse labour and indeed right and freedom in hong kong include the case of jimmy lai raise that with all the ministers meet in china and will always stand up for our value and interest unlike the bickering in the conservative party we be cut deal in the national interest and put britain at the million just over the weekend and an ai opportunity plan just this week do the chancellor agree that we be the party of action and the conservatives be the party of rhetoric we on the government benches be not go to apologise for get good deal for british business and the people work for they be determined to leave no stone unturned in ensure that british business have the right and freedom to export and trade around the world help to create good job here in britain uk export to china currently represent less than of the uk total export whereas our export to the eu represent over demonstrate the great opportunity that trade with the eu make available to our small and medium enterprise will the chancellor commit to talk four time as much to our european partner about our trading opportunity than she have to china this be not either or we can not write off one country and say that we be go to put all our egg in different basket china be our fourth big trading partner and we can not miss out on opportunity in country that be grow quickly with an expand middle class where there be huge export opportunity as the hon lady know be in brussels in december to reset our relation the first british chancellor to go to eurogroup meeting since we leave the european union be leave no stone unturned in exploit export opportunity for british business thank the chancellor for her statement can she set out in more detail how the government intend to help reinvigorate the uk china stock connect so that uk company and investor can access chinese capital market and vice versa the stock connect be an initiative first set up by the former conservative chancellor philip hammond to improve link between the shanghai and london stock exchange and to help chinese business to access capital on uk financial market that be good for financial service firm operate in london and the enhancement of that stock connect scheme at the weekend offer new opportunity for british business in financial service in the uk as the chancellor fly east the pound plummet south and government debt rocket north why the market do not believe her plan for growth that be the fundamental issue to pick up the question from my right hon friend the member for stone great wyrley and penkridge sir gavin williamson what be she go to say to the market to make they believe she really do understand how to deliver growth in the uk there have be global volatility in market it be not reasonable to suggest that bond yield in the united states germany and france have rise because of decision make by this government think the hon member should just get real thank the chancellor for her statement in regard to raise money for public service an annual wealth tax on the multimillionaire and billionaire class would certainly achieve that however that be conversation for another day on to china my right hon friend and have have discussion regard the closure of the grangemouth refinery in which petrochina part of the chinese state own china national petroleum corporation be heavily involved if the refinery close thousand of job will be lose this be not just constituency issue for it will impact all of scotland as our fuel and national security will be severely weaken do the chancellor speak about the issue with her chinese counterpart and if not will she do so we be work closely with the scottish government to ensure that there be bright future for the people of grangemouth because deindustrialisation should not be the future for community include in scotland the datum in september and october show that the economy be fall it be go down and the currency market and bond market be sell off and express their clear concern that there be no growth and that the economy continue to fall if the chancellor be so confident will she confirm to the house when the economy will start grow again growth be the no mission of this labour government but the truth be that it be not possible to turn thing around quickly after year of lacklustre growth and decline living standard under the conservatives we be leave no stone unturned which be why last week in china we secure million worth of tangible benefit for the uk economy help great british business export overseas do the chancellor agree that develop our economic and trading relationship with other nation be one of many important lever and that alongside that approach public investment plan reform and an industrial strategy whose absence under the conservative government be problematic will be return under this government so that we can see economic growth the good way to grow an economy be to boost investment in an economy the truth be that under the conservatives we be the only economy where investment stand at less than of gdp that be the inheritance that our party be bequeath by the conservatives but we be begin to turn that around through the creation of national wealth fund to leverage in private sector investment through plan reform to get britain build again and through pension reform to unlock billion of investment to help small and start up business to grow we be turn thing around after year of failure from the conservative party while the chancellor be in china secure she measly million borrowing rate reach the high they have be since in she say that her budget would be budget with real ambition budget to fix the foundation budget to rebuild britain how be that go give that her mess have cause borrowing to be the high it have be since make real work people in this country suffer be not sure whether the hon gentleman follow global financial market but borrowing cost have increase for country around the world what we see under liz truss mini budget be unique to the united kingdom because it be only uk market that be affect by the decision of the conservatives it be great to see our chancellor of the exchequer work with international business and win investment for the uk do she agree that while the conservatives be happy to sell out our heavy industry to china lead to the end of steelmaking in teesside after year our industrial strategy be deliver investment in steel chemical and life science in stockton north in teesside and across the uk the national wealth fund create by this government will get investment into industry such as carbon capture and storage green hydrogen port and indeed steel we be really pleased at the end of last year to be able to announce investment in carbon capture and storage in merseyside and teesside secure billion of pound of investment into those economy and secure many thousand of job thank the chancellor for her statement think it be worth remind the house that under the previous government business investment fall to out of oecd country which be low than latvia slovenia and hungary could the chancellor set out how our industrial strategy will overcome that terrible legacy on business investment leave by the conservatives one of the reason for such poor investment the low of all the economy be that our planning system make it so hard to get anything do in this country that be why the planning and infrastructure bill which be be bring forward by my right hon friend the deputy prime minister will turn that around make it easy to invest in transport in digital in housing and in so much more that be the way to get our economy grow after year of failure thank the chancellor for her statement she go to china new york washington toronto and brussels to build economic relationship yet she will not take the time to speak with the ulster farmers union the nfu the farmers union of wales or nfu scotland to hear at first hand about the devastating impact that her death tax will have on family farm and small business when will she realise that no matter what deal she do around the world and welcome they rome be burn around she agriculture be the backbone of our economy so will she commit to meet as representative of the thousand of farmer whose farm be go to be decimate by her death tax have have the opportunity on couple of occasion to meet the first minister and deputy first minister of northern ireland and be sure that the secretary of state for environment food and rural affairs my right hon friend the member for streatham and croydon north steve reed would be happy to meet colleague from northern ireland the truth be that we inherit billion black hole in the public finance from the conservatives and in order to stabilise our public finance we have to make difficult decision on taxis at the moment we hear from the opposition that they do not like the increase in taxis but they want increase in public spending well they can not have it both way welcome my right hon friend statement could she elaborate far on how this visit and the discussion she have start be not only consistent with the government approach to china but vital part of it co operate where we can compete where we need to and challenge where we must this be the first economic and financial dialogue between our two country since since then other country around the world have continue to engage with china secure tangible benefit for their economy do not want uk business and the people work in our country to miss out which be why this weekend we secure million worth of tangible benefit for business that export to china thereby help to create more good job pay decent wage in our country be slightly worried that investor will be watch this statement and wonder what planet the chancellor be on she just say that she be invest in transport infrastructure but she be actually cut transport capital budget she have previously say that she want only one budget year and the march statement be bill only as fiscal forecast can she rule out any new tax rise or departmental spending cut in the march statement or will the fiscal forecast become an emergency budget we have commit to have just one budget year to provide business with the certainty they need to invest so we will have an update from the office for budget responsibility in march also give the commitment that as have already say the fiscal rule mean we will balance day to day spending with tax receipt and we will get debt down as share of gdp within the forecast period we will continue at all time to meet those fiscal rule congratulate the chancellor on unlock billion of value for the uk economy that would not have be unlocked if she have not go to china however do she agree that the government much need decision to thaw uk china relation be now reap dividend while also allow we to press china on difficult issue include human right and labour standard my hon friend be exactly right we manage to secure tangible benefit for the uk economy and british exporter at the same time we be able to raise difficult issue that we would not have be able to raise if we be not engaged that be the benefit of engagement we get the economic gain and we can raise those tricky issue it be beyond parody that his majesty chancellor would throw herself at the mercy of the chinese government and come back with million in revenue over five year be she aware that million in revenue be less than one ninetieth of hsbc annual profit this be what she be hold up as major achievement of the treasury trade mission my right hon friend the member for aberdeen south stephen flynn very reasonably ask what the chancellor will do when not if her fiscal rule be breach will she increase borrowing raise taxis or cut spending not over five year but this year be sure the hon gentleman be an expert in hsbc but would rather take the word of the chairman of hsbc who welcome the tangible investment and indeed lead the financial forum that we hold in china last week have be really clear that we will meet the fiscal rule that set out in the budget and we will do that at all time that be the commitment make and it be the commitment continue to make will the chancellor confirm that for she growth must always go hand in hand with economic security that be lesson that the previous conservative government refuse to learn when they leave of we dependent on expensive foreign gas to heat our home this winter this government clean energy mission will mean that we be less reliant on foreign dictator for our basic energy need that be why we be invest in carbon capture and storage and float offshore wind and it be why we be get rid of the previous government absurd ban on onshore wind the chancellor refer in her statement to safeguard national security which welcome but this must include energy security yet her change to the energy profit levy remove investment allowance and not permit new licence at time when we be still reliant on oil and gas not only undermine our energy security but dwarf the million that she have bring back from china with the billion of tax revenue that will be lose from the sector why rather than support our energy security be the chancellor turn she back on the sector turn she back on these tax revenue and risk sell our energy security to china if the hon lady have brief look at the document from the office for budget responsibility she will see that the change to the energy profit levy take the tax rate up from to the same rate as in norway raise money it do not lose money commend the chancellor for her visit to advocate for our country good interest but do she agree that chinese company must not provide any support to putin illegal war in ukraine absolutely agree with my hon friend and raise such issue with my counterpart in china at the weekend it be really important that whenever we engage with foreign government we also raise issue consistent with our value include chinese company supply the russian government with material use in russia illegal invasion of ukraine do the chancellor raise any concern or indeed do she have any concern about the confucius institute the chinese government back operation we see across the united kingdom and what answer do she get with respect to jimmy lai when our prime minister meet president xi jinping in rio last year they agree that one of the point of re engagement be that we be able to make clear our concern on range of issue in private way be not go to go into the detail of that conversation but raise these issue with all the chinese official meet at the weekend interruption the problem be that conservative members for all their chuntering do not raise these issue because they do not even engage my constituent many of whom work in financial service will have be amazed just as be when the shadow chancellor in fit of pique demand that the chancellor should come home from china to talk to he in this house rather than stay to promote growth increase access to the world second large market and win new licence and quota allocation for financial service business as anybody who have take the trouble to listen carefully to the chancellor would recognise there be more on the way what do she think the city and the bank that accompany she would have prefer in the long term interest of this country stay in china to win for this country or come home to satisfy the shadow chancellor fit of pique we just have to look at what the business have already say about the deal we manage to secure last week there be tangible benefit for british business export to china help to create more good job pay decent wage here in britain it have be welcome by business it be shame that the conservative party no long stand up for british business we have an embargo on russian oil and gas china continue to import it and apparently russia will be china no supplier this year do the chancellor raise this with her counterpart on her trip to china and what assessment have she make so that her deal do not inadvertently support the russian war effort as have already say in the house today raise the issue of chinese company supply the russian government indeed the hon gentleman will know that last week alongside the united states we increase sanction on russian oil and gas to make it hard for putin to continue to conduct his illegal war will the chancellor outline how the visit be an example of ongoing dialogue with the international community which will benefit business and resident in my constituency of harlow also while we be quote shakespeare do she agree that there be something rotten in the state of the conservative party or perhaps that the conservative party be in rotten state be glad that my hon friend have use the minute of the statement to come up with such good line he be right that many people work in harlow work in the financial service sector and will very much welcome the enhance licence and quota which incidentally many other country and their bank already have because their government have engage with china those be opportunity that we have miss out on in britain for far too long because of the six year during which we fail to be involve in an economic and financial dialogue while other government crack on and make sure they support and stand up for their national interest notwithstanding the importance of china as trading partner will the chancellor please explain what step the government be take to address the issue of force labour link with uyghur worker in supply chain at fast fashion company such as shein will the minister provide datum on the extent of force labour in uk supply chain especially in the garment sector will she also outline any action to strengthen due diligence requirement for company source from area with known human right abuse such as xinjiang as have already set out one of the issue be able to raise with my counterpart in china be force labour particularly in xinjiang as say in answer to the question from the right hon member for chingford and woodford green sir iain duncan smith have also be really clear that any company seek to list in london have to meet stringent requirement as set out by the united nations and the oecd on labour supply and the treatment of worker for the final question call jim shannon while welcome the uk china economic and financial dialogue as the chancellor will know as chair of the all party parliamentary group for international freedom of religion or belief have repeatedly highlight in this house human right abuse in china with regard to uyghur muslims tibetan buddhists and christians in hong kong and china how will the government and the chancellor make sure that safeguard for british money and good be put in place to ensure that economic engagement do not directly support those violation human right concern force labour denial of religious freedom and ongoing suppression in xinjiang tibet hong kong and taiwan must be remember at all cost and in all deal with china thank the hon gentleman for that thoughtful question it be important that when we engage with china we co operate where we can we compete where necessary but we challenge whenever our value do not align like the hon gentleman care deeply about issue of religious freedom and force labour but that be the whole point of engage we have to engage in the world as it be not in the world as we would like it to be it be through those engagement that we be able to raise even some of the most difficult issue and be very clear about the value of our great country community energy review motion for leave to bring in bill standing order no beg to move that leave be give to bring in bill to require the secretary of state to conduct review of the contribution of community energy to the government clean power mission the clean power mission and climate policy more generally be what bring into politic ensure that we have world that be economically ecologically and environmentally viable for future generation be one of the reason that be privileged to stand in this house today and that many people across the hexham constituency put their faith in thank local climate group such as the hexham climate café the north tyne climate action group and sustainable haltwhistle for their engagement and feedback on climate issue have always commit to work with local charity and organisation throughout my constituency as we strive to protect our climate and our planet also want to pay tribute to the co operative party for constantly raise the issue on national level the country be on vital mission to achieve net zero and to combat the immediate and very real threat of climate change it be mission that we can and must achieve the british people deserve low cost and secure power with good job and government that protect they from the long term threat pose by climate change be therefore glad the government have commit to clean power mission by that will achieve energy security protect bill payer create good job and help to protect future generation from the cost of climate breakdown to ensure that this country be on the right path to become clean energy superpower it be essential that we unlock the full extent of renewable energy and conduct necessary review of the contribution of community energy to the clean power mission for decade energy have be produce and crucially own far away from this country many constituent pay their energy bill to company base mile and an ocean away we know our energy system be break but for too long it have be too distant to fix the labour government will do thing differently great british energy own by the british people will invest in clean energy and ensure that our community reap the benefit not just through cheap bill that family can afford but through new job for our young people bring growth that will revitalise local economy the local power plan to be develop by great british energy have the potential to facilitate that necessary drive towards community energy project ensure funding be available to support local project that could be transformational community energy offer crucial opportunity of agency and empowerment within local community to develop practical and long term energy solution it will not only deliver key element that be essential for reach our net zero target but encourage local generation at household and community level reduce the need for electricity to be import into community it be necessary for individual house to change their energy usage to make our net zero target achievable there be opportunity for community own power throughout the country indeed we know what can happen when community as whole come together we see the mutual support and care that constituent hold for each other when community have be leave behind time and again as be the case with many in the north east we know how to pull together community energy and engagement be essential for achieve the net zero transition individual household throughout the country can engage through both centralised generation and storage house can be power locally reduce demand for import from the distribution network and cut energy bill as leader in offshore wind power and research the north east be already frontrunner in energy production support more than gw of offshore production with further gw of potential production my region can display leadership not only in production but through infrastructure and we can supply more than gw of offshore power through the north east local supply chain across all four of our nation support the green energy transition can start in the north east not only be the region strongly place to deliver offshore wind in the north sea but we be in strong position to install and maintain the grow pipeline of heat network project that would support the supply chain in the north east and foster highly skilled job that be vital to the region and necessary in ensure that young people in the north east can remain there and secure high pay work it be essential that the resource the country have at its disposal be properly recognise through community engagement and energy effective solution can be tailor specifically to region and locality community own energy project be however not new they already exist and thrive across the country thank to the innovation and drive of individual in that regard want to acknowledge and highlight the phenomenal work of humshaugh net zero its founder herbie newell and david still thank they for their support and their commitment to deliver net zero emission by one of my first meeting as hexham mp be in the room above the crown inn in

humshaugh net zero have already instal number of low carbon technology include solar heat pump battery storage electric vehicle and biomass its effort to launch this year one of the first community base solar farm in the north east capture my constituent community spirit and drive its aim be to successfully deliver half of the parish electricity demand believe that the work of humshaugh net zero would be of valuable interest to review of community energy inform how to unlock community energy at scale and how to support the development of other project throughout the region and the country it provide strong example of community engagement and model for how that can be achieve launch review will assist the secretary of state to understand how good to support the thriving community energy scheme that already exist as well as to set up new project that benefit new community review could consider how to expand the availability of funding for local project and examine how good to support community energy project specifically those in rural area to facilitate strong working relation with landlord and ensure that planning process receive local support and consultation supply company could be mandate to ensure that economic power be contractually negotiate on appropriate term review could also identify how good to successfully expand and transform small project into large scale project that respect local community and interest small community project face far high financial challenge possible guarantee scheme could make considerable headway to successfully minimise the risk through conduct review solution can be consider to tackle the two major challenge for community energy project first ensure that funding be available on competitive term and secondly ensure that there be support for electricity to be sell to the community to maximise project revenue launch this vital review into community energy will support our mission to achieve net zero emission by be proud that throughout the hexham constituency local resident be already engage in effort to reduce their emission and commit to green energy to achieve that mission in prudhoe the friend of eastwoods park and the miners lamp cafe have introduce solar panel and battery storage this have receive vital funding from northern powergrid and the drive of local resident have make sure that the building can still be heat meal can be cook and ingredient can be preserve through the local green energy supply the stocksfield community association have similarly transform the local community centre into crisis centre by achieve self sufficient energy source the community centre can operate as support service for local resident during emergency not only be this valuable asset to the local community but it

or the nature of the intend work be such that such tenancy be not practicable government amendment to to and it be pleasure to bring this important bill back to the house this afternoon let begin by thank hon member on both side of the chamber for their engagement with it over recent month in particular thank the shadow minister the hon member for ruislip northwood and pinner david simmonds and other member of the committee for the diligent and thoughtful line by line scrutiny of the bill that they undertake over the course of many sitting late last year this labour government promise to succeed where their predecessor have fail by quickly and decisively act to transform the experience of private renting in england today we make further tangible progress towards deliver on that commitment our renters rights bill will modernise the regulation of our country insecure and unjust private rent sector level decisively the play field between landlord and tenant it will empower renter by provide they with great security right and protection so that they can stay in their home for long build life in their community and avoid the risk of homelessness it will ensure that we can drive up the quality of privately rent housing so that renter have access to good quality and safe home as matter of course it will also allow we to crack down on the minority of unscrupulous landlord who exploit mistreat or discriminate against renter the bill will also provide tangible benefit for responsible landlord who provide high quality home and good service to their tenant not only will its provision see the reputation of the sector as whole improve as we clamp down on those landlord whose behaviour currently tarnish it but the bill will also ensure that good landlord enjoy simple regulation and clear and expand possession ground so that they can regain their property quickly when necessary although we have eschew the previous government habit of shoehorn swathe of new clause into legislation follow second reading we need to make modest number of improvement to the bill in committee many of the amendment in question be minor and technical or consequential in nature but shall briefly explain to the house some of the more substantive change to increase fairness for tenant be evict because their landlord be at fault we choose to make an amendment connect to ground as hon member will be aware this mandatory ground allow landlord to remove their tenant when eviction be necessary for they to comply not only with enforcement action but as result of separate change that we make to the bill with planning enforcement action as well the amendment allow the court to require landlord to pay compensation to the tenant when they be force to vacate their home under such circumstance to provide great flexibility for social landlord in meet the demand of local housing market we widen ground for rent to buy tenancy ensure that register provider can take possession in all necessary circumstance we also exempt assure tenancy from the day rule which protect housing supply in london and benefit permanent resident by prevent the conversion of family home into short term let should tenant give notice early in their tenancy mean that they leave before consecutive night have pass these change mean that the landlord will not automatically be find to have inadvertently provide temporary sleeping accommodation lastly we make change to ensure that the introduction of decent home standard in the private rent sector work as intend last week ask the government to ensure that all service family accommodation meet the minimum standard of social housing as set out in the decent home standard the minister for veterans confirm that this be already do so will the government support amend the renters right bill officially to extend the decent home standard to ministry of defence service family accommodation thank the hon lady for her question and agree with the objective that she have in mind but as we discuss fairly extensively in committee we do not think that the renters rights bill and the way that the decent home standard will apply to assure tenancy in this sector be right for mod accommodation the mod be undertake its own review and shall touch on that issue later in the debate as be say the change around the decent home standard will guarantee that the appropriate person can always be subject to enforcement action and they close potential gap that may have be exploit by clarify the type of accommodation that will be require to meet the standard today we be propose small number of further improvement most of which be again minor and technical in nature as have make clear repeatedly the government have long recognise that demand for extortionate amount of rent in advance put undue financial strain on tenant and can exclude certain group from rent altogether be sure that many of we in the chamber will have hear powerful story from our constituent about the impact of such demand the typical story be all too familiar tenant find and view property which as advertise match their budget only to find that on application they be suddenly ask to pay several month rent up front to secure it tenant in such circumstance often confront an almost impossible choice do they find way to make large rent in advance payment thereby stretch their finance to breaking point or do they walk away and risk homelessness if they be unable to find an alternative thank the minister for the work he have be do he highlight the issue of tenant be ask to pay up front in my constituency and many other london constituency that up front cost amount in some case to deposit to purchase home do he agree that we need to look into that issue and into estate agent effectively get tenant to bid against each other for private rent accommodation my hon friend the chair of the select committee be absolutely right and as will detail that be precisely why the government be move to prohibit that practice as she will know the government have already move to ban bidding war through the bill where desperate tenant be often pit against each other so that landlord can extract the high possible rental payment demand for large rent in advance payment in many part of the country they can be six nine or even month rent in advance can have similar effect with tenant encourage to offer ever large sum up front to outdo the competition and secure home that may or may not be of good standard or risk be lock out of rent altogether as state previously the interaction of the new rent period in clause which can not be long than month and the exist provision of the tenant fees act relate to prohibit payment arguably provide measure of protection against request for large amount of advance rent as make clear in committee however there be strong case for put the matter beyond doubt and that be what we intend to do as the minister will know before come to this place work for homelessness charity in harlow call part of our role be to support homeless people both rough sleeper and the hide homeless to get into rented accommodation and often we provide deposit for that do he agree that the legislation will help charity like provide more support to more people in need it absolutely will will detail some of the other change that we be make to ensure that the bill achieve our objective have listen to the concern raise by numerous stakeholder the view express on second reading and in committee and the representative make to by individual hon member include my hon friend the members for darlington lola mcevoy for sheffield central abtisam mohamed and for leeds central and headingley alex sobel we have table new clause and new clause would limit the amount of rent that landlord can require to maximum of one month it would prevent unscrupulous landlord from use rent in advance to either set tenant against each other in de facto bidding war or to exclude all together certain type of renter who be otherwise perfectly able to afford the monthly rent on property it do so by amend schedule to the tenant fees act so that any payment of rent make before tenancy agreement be sign will be prohibit payment if landlord or let agent invite encourage or accept such payment they could face local authority enforcement action and fine of up to new clause would amend the housing act to ensure that tenant continue to be protect from unreasonable request for rent to be pay early once tenancy have commence landlords will no long be able to include any term in the tenancy agreement that have the effect of require rent to be pay prior to the rent due date tenant will retain the flexibility to make payment of rent in advance within tenancy agreement should they wish to do so the effect of the new clause will be that tenant can be certain that the financial outlay to secure tenancy will not exceed the cost of tenancy deposit and the first month rent and that they will not be require to pay their rent early than agree the new clause will thereby reduce the barrier that stop tenant move from substandard or insecure housing and commend they to the house hon member with large student population in their constituency will know that the dynamic of the general student rental market in many part of the country see student compel to make important decision about accommodation long before they have form stable friendship group or have have time to properly judge property condition or location and to consequently pay substantial deposit at point in time when they be already cop with significant additional cost this arm race in which student be pressure ever early in the year to enter into contract for the subsequent academic year clearly be not benefit they and it be arguable whether it benefit the student landlord engage in it the government have therefore table amendment and which will prevent the use of possession ground in instance where student tenancy be agree more than six month in advance of the date of occupation thereby help to reduce the prevalence of the practice want to be clear that the amendment will not lead to an outright ban on contract be agree more than six month in advance instead make the use of ground conditional on not do so will act as strong disincentive against landlord who wish to use it to pressure student into early sign up as many do now thank all those who have advocate for this change include the former member for sheffield central paul blomfield during his time in parliament my hon friend the member for leeds central and headingley and organisation such as unipol have take up the cause of family in her constituency who be force by let agent to continue to pay as guarantor for property that have be rent by their son before he tragically take his own life my hon friend the member for dulwich and west norwood helen hayes have be campaign for many year to protect bereaved family by prohibit the practice pay tribute to she for her tireless effort to secure change in this area she be unable to persuade the previous government to make the necessary change to the renters reform bill but this government be determined to act to end the abhorrent practice where guarantor be hold liable for unpaid rent owe solely as result of the death of tenant who be family member we have table new clause which will limit the liability of guarantor of tenancy agreement for rent in circumstance where tenant have die should make it clear that if in joint tenancy the guarantor be not family member their liability for rent will be maintain we consider that fair because we do not think it be reasonable to remove the guarantor liability and therefore expose landlord to additional financial risk where the guarantor be not relate to the deceased our new clause strike the right balance guarantor will be protect from be hold liable for rent when they be grieve landlord will be able to reclaim cost owe prior to tenant death and guarantor liability for other cost incur under the tenancy will not be affect turn to amendment and which will amend exist power to charge fee for the private rent sector database the amendment will expand the definition of relevant cost that can be consider when calculate such fee and would enable fee revenue to include prs enforcement cost incur by local housing authority hon member should be assure that database fee will be calculate and agree at later date with further detail set out in secondary legislation and develop on the basis that fee must be reasonable and proportionate the amendment do not alter that position in set the fee range of factor will be consider include the cost incur by landlord however we need to ensure that when calculate fee we can take into account all relevant cost and the amendment will ensure that that be the case enable fee revenue to include prs enforcement cost be also important for the reform to have the impact we all want effective enforcement will be crucial and that point be debate at length in committee as we have touch on frequently throughout our consideration of the bill local housing authority capacity and resourcing be real problem the amendment provide an additional lever to help ensure that every local housing authority have the tool and resource it need to carry out its enforcement role so that good tenant and landlord benefit from well regulated and enforce prs amendment to will expand the scope of what can be cover by the compulsory fee that private landlord will be require to pay to fund the new prs landlord ombudsman they will ensure that the fee can cover the set up cost of the ombudsman and activity specify in the regulation beyond those strictly necessary for mandatory aspect of landlord redress that will allow the ombudsman to set up the core redress service and to provide additional member benefit such as landlord initiate mediation or voluntary member redress without the cost have to be bear by the taxpayer turn to amendment to rent repayment order be an important and effective tenant lead enforcement tool they deter landlord from non compliance and empower tenant to take action against unscrupulous landlord the bill will significantly strengthen rent repayment order include their extension to superior landlord in rent to rent arrangement but we intend to go far and ensure that those sort of arrangement can not be use to evade responsibility and escape enforcement action we be also make it clear that tenant and local authority can seek rent repayment order against any landlord in the chain regardless of who they pay the rent to amendment and will limit the circumstance in which landlord can use ground to obtain possession from person who have inherit tenancy follow the death of tenant they will provide great security for bereaved tenant by prevent they from lose their home and acknowledge the role that marie curie have play in advocate for change in respect of the matter landlords will still be able to use ground if the original tenant have inherit it by will or intestacy or if the inheriting individual do not live in the property before the tenant pass away landlords will also be able to use ground for specialist tenancy such as support and temporary accommodation that be in recognition of the critical role such tenancy play in supply housing to those with specialist need private register provider be currently restrict from use the possession ground for redevelopment ground apart from where they have superior landlord who want to redevelop the property other possession ground such as the suitable alternative accommodation ground ground can be use to move tenant but only if clear condition be meet although we expect prp to work closely with tenant to facilitate move to enable redevelopment work the government accept that in limited case it be increasingly hard to meet those condition prevent prp from progress with crucial redevelopment work thank the national housing federation for raise concern about that matter with welcome what the minister just say be he aware that lot of landlord be use unreasonable argument to terminate tenancy or raise rent ahead of this legislation come into force and be there anything he or his department can do to protect tenant during this stressful period for they there be lot of bad practice out there that be the very reason why the government have act so quickly to introduce these reform and we be confident that once they be in place they will provide tenant with the protection that they deserve in the interim be afraid that there will continue to be bad practice of the kind that the bill will stamp out for the reason that have just allude to we have table amendment and to give private register provider an alternative route for obtain possession for redevelopment and for decant accommodation where the landlord seek possession on ground or grind because they intend to carry out redevelopment work or want to move tenant on from decant accommodation they will need to provide alternative accommodation that meet specific requirement that include the accommodation be affordable in suitable location and not overcrowded the accommodation must also be let as an assured tenancy or equivalent unless it be be let for temporary period pende the tenant be move to an assured tenancy or equivalent to use ground landlord must give tenant prior notice to ensure that they be fully aware that the accommodation be provide for temporary decant use if the landlord do not do that they be liable for fine of up to where landlord wish to accommodate tenant temporarily in property that be earmark for redevelopment social landlord must give prior notice and set out in write statement the intention to redevelop the accommodation and the timeframe for redevelopment under those circumstance alternative accommodation will not need to be provide social landlord will also be require to pay removal expense for social tenant when use ground and grind we do not expect that the need to use those ground will arise often in practice through the engagement of prp with tenant but where need the amendment will ensure that significant redevelopment work be not unduly delay government amendment to and be related and consequential provision to reflect the new ability for landlord to gain possession for redevelopment and for decant accommodation we think that this group of amendment get the balance right enable prp to progress redevelopment and use temporary decant accommodation during redevelopment work while ensure that tenant be provide with appropriate alternative accommodation and removal expense let turn finally to amendment clause ensure that long lease can continue to function by exclude lease over seven year from the assured regime those lease be typically use in purchase of leasehold and share ownership property be grateful to stakeholder for raise concern about the possibility of some unscrupulous landlord use clause to circumnavigate the new assured regime by issue lease of over seven year with break or early termination clause that be operable in the first few year tenant must not be cheat out of the protection of the assure tenancy regime the amendment will therefore exclude all lease over year from the assured regime that will act as much strong deterrent to landlord who seek to avoid the assure tenancy regime the amendment also exclude exist lease of between seven and year to ensure that they can continue to operate as currently intend it also ensure that regulate home purchase plan can continue to enable consumer to purchase property use the principle of islamic finance by add they to the list of exclude tenancy in schedule to the housing act the amendment that the government have table for consideration today be series of target change design to ensure that the bill work as intend and commend they all to the house thank hon member for their effort to improve the bill and for the scrutiny and challenge that the bill have receive so far look forward to listen to the remainder of the debate call the shadow minister may echo the minister comment and extend my thank to he and his team the other member who serve on the committee and the many witness who come in to share their view it be clear that lot of the discussion have be on the real world impact that the legislation will have rather than on political point and in that spirit will set out my response and the rationale behind number of the amendment that we have table which will be the subject of debate and vote this afternoon clearly legislation be about strike the right balance this afternoon we will recognise as we have do in our contribution to debate on this issue the impact that the bill will have on tenant landlord and the stakeholder whom our amendment seek to protect highlight in particular the impact on student on financially vulnerable tenant such as those with low credit score on tenant who have pet on small landlord who be themselves vulnerable to financial shock and of course on other group such as agricultural worker and those with work relate accommodation include nhs worker military family and school staff all of whom be mention in committee and will be sure be cover again later all our amendment have seek to address practical issue such as ensure that when work be require on property and tenant be reluctant to allow the landlord in to carry out that work for whatever reason there be sufficient freedom and flexibility in the legislation to ensure that the work can take place the shadow minister talk about situation in which tenant must leave property constituent of mine have terrible ordeal she move into new rental property but after three month it become uninhabitable and she spend further week go in and out of eight airbnbs she be leave thousand of pound out of pocket because the landlord insurance cover his loss of rent but do not cover the accommodation cost that she incur as tenant will the shadow minister support my new clause which would require landlord to hold appropriate insurance for the purpose of pay any cost relate to alternative accommodation in such situation there be number of way to address that issue the minister have talk compensation and we have table amendment on insurance but clearly there need to be an effective dispute resolution mechanism in place so that such situation can be resolve when they arise we be focus in particular on ensure that there be sufficient flexibility when for example work must be carry out to improve energy efficiency or to address health and safety concern such as mould and tenant need to leave because the work will render the property uninhabitable although there have be substantial area of agreement on the bill much of which take forward work that start under the previous government in their renters reform bill we have concern that it create significant new problem for the availability and affordability of accommodation in the private rent sector that sector we must not forget enjoy the high tenant satisfaction of any private tenure of private renter say that they be satisfied with their accommodation the backdrop be challenging and have become lot more so recently the chancellor budget have set inflation rise and borrowing cost be soar market be respond to the chaos in no and that be cause great deal of uncertainty for tenant and landlord alike her decision be stoke inflation and that be push up rent and housing cost of all kind the black hole in local government funding which be unveil just before christmas mean that council face the twin existential threat of wholesale reorganisation and grow funding shortfall lack certainty from the government about the funding to deliver this enormous increase in workload know that the shadow minister care passionately about this area especially in the light of his local government experience give that financial pressure on local authority be add to by the need to provide temporary accommodation to family face eviction do he agree that we should have abolish section no fault eviction soon say gently to the hon lady that have labour run lambeth council not recently rush to put of its own people on the street use section because it be concerned about the impact that the bill will have on its housing situation that would have more credibility it be clear that this be difficult situation in all part of the country there be significant shortfall in emergency accommodation in london in particular and rise cost attach to it there just as other area of the country have surplus of accommodation that be all part of complex picture we need to make sure that everything work efficiently and effectively together and it be absolutely right that we set out our concern about whether the bill go far enough in all area towards address those issue and about whether in some case it go too far touch on the impact of the black hole in local government funding another area that be drive significant pressure be the government approach to asylum they be grant refugee status fast so people be be push out of the door of home office asylum dispersal accommodation and on to local housing waiting list be sure that many hon member in this chamber will have be lobby by their local authority about the impact of that additional pressure those additional people who under our law be perfectly entitle to that housing on supply in their area all those thing have huge collective impact on the pool of available housing of course as we have see in the news the decline confidence abroad in our economy be reduce the number of overseas student that make it more important than ever to support thrive student accommodation through tenancy that address student need properly especially the need of student who be old have family or be study for high degree and have fix commitment to location all those requirement need to be address effectively in this legislation do the bill in its new form rise to those challenge it be clear that it fail to ensure that landlord can recover their property quickly when they need to that reduce their incentive to rent it out especially for small landlord if the hon member for hampstead and highgate tulip siddiq need to recover some of her property portfolio to return it to another owner will she have the assurance under this bill that due process be available to she the bill fail to ensure flexibility and freedom of contract that allow tenant and landlord to agree deal that suit they both student want to book accommodation for guarantee period of two year or short or long and those move to new location for fix term work contract require opportunity and flexibility that be take away by this legislation the bill take away landlord opportunity to make allowance for financially risky tenant such as those with poor credit record through rent in advance or other safeguarding arrangement that give the landlord confidence that they will not lose out that lock financially vulnerable people out of the rental market the bill also put enormous obligation on local council one of the big additional set of burden and expectation in generation and there be no real clarity yet on how it will be resource at time when all the wide uncertainty that have describe add up to great deal of additional cost the bill also fail to provide the necessary assurance that tenant who have pet and need to access insurance as part of their tenancy condition will be able to find affordable insurance that be deal with in our new clause more concern still the bill be miss opportunity to provide this house with proper impact assessment or the assurance of future review that would give we really good evidence on which to base our decision our new clause would address that shortcoming and the house will have the opportunity to vote for it shortly let give an example of where there be significant uncertainty in some of the political knockabout the government have seek to blame their predecessor for court delay while claim that there be no delay worthy of regard in the passage of this bill which load more regulation on to the sector both of those thing can not be true simultaneously so let we properly assess the impact of the bill before we legislate there be lot of good will for example on the point about tenant with pet be able to access the accommodation that they need we do not want to find ourselves return to this issue in the house because the legislation fail to achieve what we have hop clearly it be the role of this chamber to scrutinise and question and it be the role of the opposition to oppose when we can not see that the legislation before we will result in an improvement in the lot of the people of this country pattern be emerge the government come after the farmer they come after the pub they come after the small business they come after the private school they come after our local councillor now this bill in its new form come after our tenant and our landlord it be very clear from the number of government amendment which the minister refer to that the point we make in committee about the many shortcoming of the bill that need to be address be not lose on the government return to the point that even labour council bastion such as lambeth lead by the labour chair of london councils be rush to use section to evict its own tenant in advance of this bill because of the impact it will have labour council and labour government be put their own people out of their home know that the minister be no corbynista we have certainly learn that in the debate in fact even discover that he have name his dog after clement attlee who assume be great political hero but government new clause and will make this bill so much bad for prospective tenant many of we will have have constituent come to our surgery who be turn their life around they have get job an income and some saving but they do not have good credit record and they face be lock out of the housing market because the necessary flexibility and measure that would address that credit score concern be effectively prohibit foreign worker come to the uk need to access accommodation and provide sufficient guarantee foreign student people who be retire and look to downsize to rental property and people who for family reason can not access guarantor will all find themselves significantly disadvantage by government new clause and which increase the risk to landlord by take away mitigation and take away people freedom to reach contract and an agreement that suit they know that labour member be very keen on ask conservative members for apology so be go to conclude with one apologise promise the hon member that that be exactly what be go to do be go to make an apology to all those in the private rent sector interruption the minister say from sedentary position that have only four hour be afraid that will not be able to go through all the private tenant individually but the apology will be fulsome say to those in the private rented sector of whom be very satisfied with their accommodation that be sorry that they will be face with the mess that this bill will create whether they be seek to rent their first home or need to move to new one will the hon gentleman give way will not give way because be conclude we on the conservative benches give those people the undertaking that while they may have to endure that situation until the next election we will put it right for the benefit of landlord and tenant alike call the liberal democrat spokesperson thank the minister for his constructive work with the liberal democrats and other party in committee for generation cut off from the dream of home ownership who find that after half century of flog off social house and council house over million have be lose since there be now basically none leave it be vital that we restore hope to million who aspire to decent home as such the liberal democrats support the key principle of this bill which be to bring an end to no fault eviction after the continual stop start of the previous government give tenant the security they deserve be long overdue it be time to end once and for all the fear that any complaint from any tenant could be meet with an instant eviction notice at any moment of course landlord do not generally act in such cavalier fashion most be good landlord and we value they and what they bring to the market as such to sustain healthy private rent sector we have table amendment which would extend to off street student rental landlord the same possession law that apply to purpose build student accommodation give that fully of property on the accommodation for student website be one or two bedroom property rather than house in multiple occupancy as unipol and the higher education policy institute have point out that be big chunk of the market and one that need to be address the need for more home be why we have table amendment which would particularly incentivise more build to rent accommodation in taunton and wellington our lib dem council have support the delivery of ten of thousand of new home our population increase by up to our manifesto call for social home per year refer the house to my entry in the register of members financial interests regard my experience as social landlord we clearly set out the borrowing of billion per year that would make that happen unlike the labour and conservative manifesto which include no number whatsoever for social housing we need lot of that build to rent accommodation also to be rent to own so renter can accrue ownership of their own home it be time to give whole generation of young people who have be exclude that elusive first step on the housing ladder amendment would therefore give developer of build to rent housing the security of fix term of month for the first tenancy since that be table have hear from the british property federation and other and they have suggest that an initial fix term of six month would enable they to secure the investment they need to build more and to get build that would not undermine the general principle of move to periodic tenancy as build to rent be only of the housing stock we will not press amendment but genuinely urge the government to take up the idea run with it and generate more investment in new home let turn to the interest of tenant which have be so overlook for so long my constituent and friend mike godleman who be disabled die while recover from major surgery and under the threat of no fault eviction notice for no reason he could possibly work out in part in his memory our new clause would ensure that landlord of both private and social tenancy must give permission for home adaptation when home assessment have be carry out if rental bidding be to be outlaw as the minister say it must not be replace by bid up rent in advance so our new clause would limit rent in advance to two month rent in that respect welcome government new clause in tenancy rent increase also need to be limit to protect tenant from exorbitant increase the most sensible way to do this be set out in our amendment which would peg increase to the bank of england base rate property be financial and investment asset and landlord cost be more directly influence by mortgage rate rather than by the general inflation and the cost of living new clause in the name of my hon friend the member for st albans daisy cooper would require landlord to pay for alternative accommodation when dwelling be unfit for human habitation turn to the amendment propose by other hon member we support the propose new clause in the name of the hon member for dulwich and west norwood helen hayes which will prevent the guarantor from be liable on the death of tenant and we recognise that the government have table new clause to limit that liability rather than end it altogether we also support amendment on the content that must be submit for inclusion in the database the database could be very powerful instrument for tenant if it provide information as speak about at some length in committee we also support new clause which would give care leaver support through funding for deposit when they move out of care both those amendment be in the name of the hon member for liverpool wavertree paula barker one of the big concern to landlord tenant and local community in taunton and wellington as it be in cornwall the lake and other place be that there be no control over the number of home be turn into holiday let and airbnbs this have prompt significant increase to about holiday home in somerset increase in short term rental in the south west since visitor of course bring welcome investment but in some area second home be price local out of local market my hon friend be talk about second home which can particularly affect rural community schedule provide mandatory ground to recover possession in order to house an agricultural worker but do he agree that the definition of agricultural worker be limited and do not reflect rural worker for example those who work in the horse training industry in the village of lambourn in my constituency where local housing be key to that industry give the nature and the hour of the work of stable staff my hon friend be absolutely right that definition need to cover the breadth of agricultural worker and be sure the minister have hear his point liberal democrats have long argue for licensing system and tough planning control for second home with new use class to cover second home and short term let both this and previous government have say that they would create new use class so urge the minister to say in today debate whether that will really happen without control there be serious risk of second home proliferate if landlord do not wish to be part of more regulated private rent sector follow the enactment of this bill our new clause would therefore require the government to assess properly the growth in short term let and urge the minister to do so in fact be not sure why anyone would oppose that amendment finally our amendment would apply the bill propose decent home standard to military service family accommodation be grateful to the minister for take the time to write to on this but the argument that standard would not be suitable for service family accommodation do not stand up because clause allow the secretary of state to establish whatever version of the decent home standard they feel be appropriate do not think anyone across the house would understand why that should be different for service family we will no doubt hear the ministry of defence say that or more of service family accommodation already meet the decent home standard so it be all okay but in that case why not make that claim evident by subject that accommodation to the decent home standard in the bill to say that the recently publish service accommodation report from the defence committee under the chairmanship of the hon member for slough mr dhesi say something different from the official report would be massive understatement the select committee report evidence from one service family who say it be impossible to challenge the decent homes standard without pay for survey yourself it be widely accept that each house have not be check but either guess or it be assume that the standard of one house be the same as all in one area therefore ask how sure we can be of the self declare statistic from the defence infrastructure organisation or be they from annington home as another witness before the select committee say it be disingenuous for dio to present glossy brochure about be decent home plus when they be anything but and it be clear that the dio property frequently do not meet the standard crucially the witness add moreover there be no local authority or anyone else to hold they to account as would be the case for private and other local landlord that be exactly what amendment would provide in the kerslake report commission before the election by the now secretary of state for defence former housing minister report of damp mould and in other service accommodation rat infestation abound if all the witness and all these report be wrong and the official figure be right show that over of property meet the decent home standard there be nothing for the mod to fear in subject service accommodation to that assessment just as social and private landlord will have to do under the bill the hard work of my hon friend the member for north shropshire helen morgan get even the previous government to come round to the idea and the then minister the former member for redcar say in this chamber on april last year that the government intend to ensure that service accommodation meet the decent home report april vol service family such as those of commando royal marines part of our taunton and wellington family community make massive sacrifice for our country and sometimes make the ultimate sacrifice they deserve decent home and the mod should be require to meet the standard just as the government be require that of other landlord be grateful to see support for amendment from across the house we will be vote for it this evening to support our service family and urge member across the house to vote for it too call the chair of the housing communities and local government committee start by pay tribute to member from across the house who have table an amendment at this stage and to the minister who have engage constructively with member between second reading and report as we debate this bill today it be important to remember why it be so badly need the dire situation that many tenant across all our constituency be face through no fault of their own we have to ask ourselves how we get to position where tenant have the threat of eviction hold over their head for no good reason how do we get to position where tenant can be give only couple of month to raise thousand of pound for rent in advance on top of move cost and the deposit how do we get to position where the average rent go up by last year for far too long tenant have be the innocent victim of an unjust power balance in the rental market as result many of they have be unable to keep roof over their head and sadly have fall into homelessness this can not continue any long we need fair deal for renter have the hon member notice as have an increase in the number of threaten eviction at the present time as well as no fault eviction excessive rent rise and harassment by landlord of private sector tenant do she believe that there be any immediate and urgent protection that we can give those tenant as fellow london mp the right hon member will see what see in my inbox with many tenant face that threat on an almost daily basis they be the same tenant who come to our advice surgery and be turn away from overstretched council department and who can not apply to social housing waiting list because those list be already full it be important that we get guarantee and protection for those tenant as outline in the bill and hopefully help my constituent and his and people up and down the country this situation can not be allow to continue be proud that the bill will be strengthen by some of the welcome amendment that member have table extend my support to new clause table by my hon friend the member for leeds central and headingley alex sobel on limit rent payable in advance that be big issue in my constituency of vauxhall and camberwell green and have speak to many tenant who be be ask to stump up six to month rent in advance that leave many people price out of the rental market end in race to the bottom where landlord can charge more and more for less in return how can someone finally find place that they want to call home only to be tell that they need to pay out thousand upon thousand of pound up front in some case because of the rent charge in my constituency and many other the money that people be ask to stump up in advance would amount to deposit if they take it to purchase home in another part of the country we be talk in excess of if someone be ask to stump up with an average rent of per calendar month in my constituency the result be that those who do not have significant saving or family wealth end up need to borrow money just to have somewhere to live that cycle of exploitation be push thousand of people into debt impact they for the rest of their life research from stepchange show that one in six private renter be rely on credit to make end meet something must change because the system be break we must lower immediate financial pressure on tenant and make private renting fairer for everyone that be why welcome the amendment table by the secretary of state and urge the house to support measure that will reduce up front cost for all renter my constituency be home to thousand of university student from great university across london student often have the most insecure housing because landlord know that they can charge new group high rent every year therefore welcome measure that restrict the time that landlord can agree new tenancy prior to the end of the current tenancy in student housing many of we will remember the time when we go to university and look for accommodation we sign up to live with friend or someone we know perhaps by christmas we have all fall out and there be that frantic search when someone leave the property and we have to find new flatmate many social medium post be put on or facebook and university student need time to bed into their new accommodation the new clause will help to give student that breathe space and avoid the problem they face as result of early sign up accommodation new clause address vital issue and pay tribute to my constituency neighbour my hon friend the member for dulwich and west norwood helen hayes for table it and for her tireless campaign the death of love one be difficult and challenging time for anybody and the one thing people need be the time and space to grieve under current rule guarantor can end up face huge bill for the remainder of their love one rent none of we would want to be place in that situation it be right that the government have act to prevent guarantor from be face with that unacceptable scenario and urge the house to support the new clause also wish briefly to touch on some other amendment which hope the government will consider during the bill passage in the other place although the bill introduce rent tribunal for unfair rent rise there be concern from group such as the renters reform coalition that measure in the bill do not go far enough to prevent landlord from evict tenant under the guise of large rent increase be particularly concerned that market rent may not be an appropriate benchmark when market datum be poor renter at the bottom end of the market could end up be tell that an unaffordable rent rise be acceptable under this system we need guarantee that the use of tribunal will resolve that and that it be available and accessible to tenant in scotland only handful of rent increase case year go through the tribunal system to the rent officer and it would severely undermine the bill if tenant who be be exploit do not take up the option available to they would be grateful if the minister could explain how the government will encourage the take up of such provision and whether he will support the alternative measure and safeguard in the bill such as amendment table by my hon friend the member for liverpool wavertree paula barker finally number of amendment have touch on the vital issue of home adaptation in the private rental sector it be not fair that disabled tenant end up with reduce access to their own home the government be rightly look at make it easy for disabled people to thrive in the workplace but what be the point of someone thrive if they do not even have an adequate home or housing we can not expect someone to go out and work and contribute to the economy if they have not have good night sleep can any of we imagine be unable to have shower in our own flat because the landlord refuse to make the necessary adaptation or try to cook in kitchen when we can not even reach the worktop none of we would want to live in such condition yet that be the reality for many disabled people in the private rent sector in in the uk people face such issue on daily basis with more challenge and blockage when try to get private landlord to address they urge the government to ensure that disabled people do not face private rent sector that be far too often completely inaccessible to they look forward to the government respond to the report by my committee predecessor on disabled people in the housing sector the house must continue to look at how we fight for rental sector that work for everyone regardless of their background be privileged to serve on the bill committee and it be good to see many fellow member of the committee in the house this afternoon before start wish to pay tribute to the many excellent landlord across our country the bill have be design to tackle the bad offender but it be worth put on the record that thousand upon thousand of landlord do good job of provide long term accommodation for many people in the private rent sector on second reading and in committee we speak about the unintended consequence that exist in the bill some of which still remain that be allude to by my hon friend the member for ruislip northwood and pinner david simmonds my hon friend raise an important point about unintended consequence do she agree that it be important we consider our key worker such as nhs staff and police who rely on accommodation tie to their employment with the abolition of assured shorthold tenancy it be important to ensure that provision be there to support such tenancy so that they can continue and we can retain and attract much need police officer and nhs staff absolutely agree with my hon friend and that be perfect example of one of the unintended consequence that do not believe have be put in deliberately but be something that we might see as result of the bill other issue include accidental landlord those who do not intend to be landlord and be not large portfolio holder and small landlord and we have already hear from my hon friend the member for ruislip northwood and pinner about the challenge they face regard economic driver and the risk of the market shrink we talk lot about that on second reading but ultimately landlord be leave the market and if there be few home for people to rent we be in bad situation support new clause which stand in the name of my hon friend the member for ruislip northwood and pinner believe review of the bill impact on the housing market after year be important to ensure that we make it even well than it already be and to address those unintended consequence we can all agree that be important give the challenge we have already hear about regard the long housing waiting list and the homelessness rife across our country it be also important to listen to landlord in particular draw attention to some of the reason why new clause be so important plymouth access to housing know as path be key player in tackle homelessness in my constituency and it work especially with those who be hard to place into accommodation it have rightly say that it support the bill in principle as we have hear the opposition support large part of it too but in buoyant private rental market it be concerned that it be not buoyant so there be already challenge that be why review would be important path also say that it have receive funding in the past to support landlord to stay in the private rent sector what plan do the minister have perhaps outside of this bill to ensure that such organisation in which some member present today have work might be able to mitigate the impact of some of those future challenge the south west landlords association which have mention would benefit from new clause because it would allow for an assessment of provision that essentially amount to doubling of the amount of rent arrear that can be accrue and of the notice require for possession before landlord can get somebody out of their property landlord be particularly concerned about that for the financial reason we have already set out if they have to wait for three month of arrear and then another month notice before they can remove someone from their property when they have not be pay rent that have massive impact on small landlord and on those accidental landlord in particular that be nearly half year of income they would lose ultimately it be the luck of the draw we do not know in advance how good tenant will be if someone have an excellent tenant it be not problem but with bad tenant it be not so good my hon friend be make powerful speech do she agree that fundamentally the only way to secure the right of tenant be to ensure the buoyant rental market that she be talk about where landlord want to enter and invest in it they be then compete for tenant in the market which be the big and most powerful force of all that will drive decent behaviour towards tenant and without that landlord can not gain and retain tenant appreciate the point that my right hon friend make agree that the market be important but also appreciate that there be some whom the market have fail we have to find situation where those who be not look after by their landlord can receive support but as have already say my concern be that the bill go too far in the opposite direction with the freedom of be on the back benches can say that the last conservative government get this wrong when they stop landlord be able to offset the interest payment on the mortgage for that commercial asset against their income it be one step among many that reduce the number of landlord come into the market each step along the way instead of seek to strengthen the market successive government conservative then and the process be bind to be complete by labour now move against landlord to make it less and less investable asset ultimately those who lose out most be tenant agree with my right hon friend that ultimately tenant be at risk of lose out if there be no property leave in the market that lead on to my next point and one of the other reason why an assessment would be useful in the light of new clause we hear in committee that rural landlord be particularly concerned accord to the country land and business association of landlord be plan to sell in the next two year and only be plan to build new property when of those plan to leave cite reform to the private rent sector as reason we need an opportunity to reflect and to see the impact assessment have set out some of my reason for support new clause will turn briefly to new clause which have be mention many time already appreciate why it have be table in the tragic circumstance that have be lay out in the light of some conversation we have in committee be interested to see who be in scope to be consider family for the purpose of that guarantor system the new clause list child grandchild parent grandparent sibling niece or nephew aunt or uncle or cousin that be wide but think we would all agree highly realistic view of what family be however in schedule to the bill landlord can only evict an exist tenant to house parent grandparent sibling child or grandchild raise this matter with the minister in committee and know that he think tenant right would be inhibit if we extend the definition of family but find it puzzle that wide extended family be justify in new clause but not in the determination of who live in property under schedule often those family member may be vulnerable themselves and need somewhere to live it be niche point but for the government to say that someone can not house their niece or nephew or in the light of new clause their aunt uncle or cousin feel like an overreach of the state we be slightly test ownership right and restrict trust and freedom in society as result briefly be not big fan of amendment it list some excessive detail for what have to be provide in the landlord register in particular the landlord name and address we all know how worried we be about our name and address be in the public domain and expect landlord who be ultimately business people to do the same be one step too far we also need to look at when conviction for be bad landlord be spend if landlord be reform at some point we have to give they the opportunity to show that and ultimately provide home as result finally support new clause table by the hon member for liverpool wavertree paula barker on look after child this issue come up in last week debate on the children wellbeing and schools bill and speak to it then we need to do more to ensure that as corporate parent which ultimately every single local authority be we act like parent and that wide family if young person need deposit or rent guarantee to enable they to get into the private rent sector when other option for housing be not available we should look at that be not sure whether that measure will be vote on today but in principle the hon lady have my support and hope we will be able to work together on that be pleased to serve on the public bill committee for this legislation which be concrete example of the positive difference that this labour government be make to people life fundamentally believe that everyone should have somewhere they can call home and that they should feel secure in that home the bill will deliver massive improvement for the million of tenant in the private rent sector who for too long have be force to pay over the odd for housing that be often inadequate and insecure it finally address the clear imbalance of power between landlord and tenant by level the play field through the delivery of once in generation boost to tenant right move away from expensive precarious poor quality accommodation and end status quo that have leave tenant under the constant threat of lose their home on the bill committee we hear evidence of landlord demand multiple month of rent up front at the start of tenancy that highly exclusionary practice shut low income renter out of the market by require they to hand over thousand of pound on top of their deposit at the start of tenancy the spread of this practice would have devastating impact on the choice available to many tenant so warmly welcome new clause and in the name of my right hon friend the member for ashton under lyne angela rayner which address the issue turn to section eviction one of the absolute privilege of be an mp be go to visit local school to answer question from pupil those question can be about anything but they normally relate to the interest and experience of the child such as what can you do about the traffic how can you make my park and playground well and even this be real really like tree do you like tree on recent visit to st andrew primary school in eccles be give poignant reminder of why we be here and why this bill be so important one of the pupil ask what be you do to stop people be kick out of their home for no reason it be shocking question to hear from someone so young and it serve as an appalling illustration of how wide the fear of no fault eviction be no child should even know what section eviction be and no child should live in fear of lose their home we can not allow these eviction to continue for that be the most critical part of the bill it be beyond time to end the spectre of homelessness that hang over these tenant and end section eviction give people steady strong secure foundation to build their life around unfortunately no fault eviction be just one of the many challenge face tenant action to tackle unaffordable rent be badly need which be why the measure in the bill to end rental bidding war and stop the use of unreasonable rent increase design to drive out tenant be so important never end rent increase be bad for tenant and bad for the economy absorb money that could be spend more productively elsewhere welcome the measure in the bill to drive up standard across the sector such as the application of the decent home standard and the establishment of private rent sector database all of those reform be entirely necessary in market where year after year tenant be expect to pay more for less it be hard to overstate the impact that housing have on people life or the detrimental effect cause by the sector current flaw the bill reform decisively rebalance broken sector end the scandal of no fault eviction and encourage the market to provide affordable high quality accommodation with security of tenure the bill represent real and meaningful action which we all should welcome many of we be describe as either dog person or cat person have have my dog for over five year now and as result definitely feel like dog person joke aside it be quite clear that we as country be in love with our pet so many of we be define by they the law that govern we should reflect how we live and how we choose to live but our lack of respect for people ability to bring pet into their home be shocking that be why be pleased with the bill sadly there be gap for pet owner in the rental market in particular which not only create an uneven playing field for people choose new home but fill animal shelter with much love pet that should be in their stable home many pet be in animal shelter because of landlord unfair rule introduce over the year accord to research conduct by battersea dogs and cats home only of private landlord list their property as pet friendly do not just want to talk about statistic as the number have real life consequence for family and animal in my constituency of woking woman along with her family be evict after year of tenancy because the landlord decide to sell the property the council try to find alternative housing for the family but repeatedly come up against obstacle include no pet policy which would have force she and her family to give up their three cat include one that her autistic son be emotionally bond to his emotional support pet letter from the gp state how important the cat be to her child wellbee but it do not help the cat reduce her son anxiety level and help he with his day to day functioning it have huge impact housing officer note that they could have consider the family for place in some new flat that the council have build but the housing provider do not accept pet sadly that case which be not unique perfectly illustrate the emotional toll that the rule can have on family particularly those with additional need pet ownership might seem like small issue in the face of homelessness eviction and the heart wrench issue that we have hear about but it be clear that sometimes because there be no protection for family with pet people be force into horrible situation it be fair to say that the culture of country should be reflect in the law that govern it and most of we have pet so let we ensure that we be allow to keep they be pleased to hear my hon friend the member for taunton and wellington gideon amos pursue my party amendment and be pleased to hear from the chair of my select committee the hon member for vauxhall and camberwell green florence eshalomi there have be much cross party support for the bill while we push the government to go far still as supportive as be of the bill it could be well and help reduce our casework of heart wrench story of vulnerable tenant push out and treat badly by landlord the bill will help we but through the amendment table and other that know will be propose in the other place it could be well declare an interest like one in three household in my constituency rent my home as renter and an mp who represent large number of renter it will come as no surprise that rise to speak in favour of the bill which will bring in some important long overdue reform to provide private renter with decent and secure home crucially be pleased to see the abolition of section eviction which be promise by the conservative party include in its manifesto but never deliver close to million people face no fault eviction notice in the last parliament because of that failure which add to the homelessness crisis that we now face be happy to see measure in the bill that focus on affordability in my borough of lambeth rent one bedroom home now cost the average person more than half their take home pay when teacher rail staff nurse and other key worker go on strike to call for inflation match pay rise the last government attack they and reject their demand call they greedy but that government shrug their shoulder as private landlord collect above inflation rent hike from some of those same key worker year after year in recent year the situation have be particularly pronounce in march the office for national statistics report that monthly rent rise by the high annual increase since record begin in be glad that the bill bring some common sense to the situation ensure that rent increase can no long be write into contract and that landlord will be able to legally increase rent only once year and protect tenant from egregious rent hike also highly positive be the new measure to strengthen enforcement against slum private landlord to extend the decent home standard to the private rental sector and to widen council enforcement power while extend the range of financial penalty available to local authority to fund enforcement activity be pleased that the bill legislate for consultation on improve energy efficiency standard in rent home the uk have some of the most energy inefficient home in europe with million private rent home fall below minimum energy efficiency standard in england and wales alone almost quarter of renter live in fuel poverty the high rate of any tenure the bill contain important measure to provide renter with some basic security and to place some basic responsibility on landlord however so much more could be do to strengthen it be pleased to see that the government be support the amendment table by my hon friend the member for leeds central and headingley alex sobel and be pleased to support amendment and table by my hon friend the member for liverpool wavertree paula barker which would well protect sit tenant from unaffordable rent increase in its current form the bill cap rent increase only at market rate the price that landlord set the amendment would instead cap they at the rate of the consumer price index or wage growth whichever be the low have yet to hear compelling reason why landlord should see their income grow fast than people who actually work for living place on record my support for the renters reform coalition call for national rental affordability commission to investigate method to bring down rent relative to income although there be not many member on the opposition benches the few speech that they have make have talk about home almost entirely as asset forget that people need to live in they welcome the amendment that remember that people with variety of different circumstance be live in those home and they should be view with compassion welcome and support new clause table by my hon friend the member for dulwich and west norwood helen hayes as well as new clause table by the hon member for bristol central carla denyer on adaptation for disabled people it be welcome that the legislation would make it illegal to discriminate against benefit claimant and family for exactly the same reason would like further change to prevent discrimination such as scrap right to rent check and reform the law around guarantor more generally would like the legislation to go far on prevent illegal and back door eviction as the london renters union have point out for the many family struggle with housing cost rent hike be simply no fault eviction under different name during my time as an mp have see too many unscrupulous attempt to remove tenant to be unconcerned about likely increase in illegal eviction in response to scrap section welcome new enforcement power but we have to acknowledge the financial difficulty that local authority face after year of massive cut the government must ensure that local authority have the resource to use these enforcement power finally on disrepair tenant should have the right to withhold rent when repair be not carry out within appropriate timescale that happen far too often too many renter be pay for shoddy service and to live in awful condition too many renter young people in particular face despairing future of spend lifetime as private renter and be leave live in dire condition of extreme disrepair while continue to have to pay their full rental amount each month lest they face eviction the bill should provide that they have the right to withhold rent in such circumstance thereby support its state intention of ensure that the decent home standard apply to the private rent sector more generally renter have be neglect across different piece of legislation over the year if this landmark bill be truly to reform the rental sector and shift the balance of power to create more equal relationship between renter and landlord more need to be do urge the government to agree to the amendment broadly welcome the bill and the strength and protection that it will provide private tenant associate myself with the comment of my hon friend the member for taunton and wellington gideon amos and the amendment that he and my hon friend the member for st albans daisy cooper have table wish to focus on one aspect of the bill to see if can encourage some last minute reconsideration by the minister the government recently repurchase more than ministry of defence property from the private sector this move be step in the right direction yet many property include those in my constituency of bicester and woodstock have fall into disrepair have fail to be manage properly and be now substandard or unsafe service personnel and their family live in ministry of defence accommodation in ambrosden and in caversfield in my constituency have express frustration with the current management and maintenance company liberal democrats be clear that our service personnel and their family deserve the same decent standard that the government be propose for the rest of the private rent sector be proud to support amendment table by my hon friend the member for taunton and wellington will the government now commit to use the bill to ensure that the recently reacquire ministry of defence accommodation will be cover by the decent home standard so that those live in service family accommodation in my constituency can access safe weathertight and warm accommodation in response to my hon friend the member for epsom and ewell helen maguire the minister argue that it would not be appropriate to extend the decent home standard to service family accommodation will he therefore clarify so that can inform my constituent whether they should expect to live in service family accommodation that meet that standard and if they should how and to whom they can appeal if the accommodation continue to fall below that standard there be concern that military accommodation which have in my constituency be not include in the bill but one of my main concern be the immense cut in funding to that accommodation the property be in such state of disrepair that the government have have to go back and re buy they do the hon gentleman agree that there be large issue which we need to deal with when look at the armed forces commissioner role wholeheartedly agree the ministry of defence service family accommodation estate be in disrepair because of significant lack of investment by the last government which fail to maintain the standard that should be enjoy by our hard work and dedicated service personnel and their family however the fact that this government have make the welcome step to purchase that estate mean that it be now their obligation to uphold standard as we be talk about legislation that be intend to set the standard that all renter should expect include those who be pay rent now to the ministry of defence for their accommodation why be the government resist the opportunity to set that high standard for service personnel finally in the note to the bill the government emphasise that the concern that lead to awaab law will now be extend to the private rent sector give how serious those concern be and give that the death occur as result of failure to maintain property in the social rent sector will the minister tell how can go back to my constituent who be tenant of the ministry of defence and tell they they will enjoy the same protection as other private renter under awaab law stability for million renter and indeed for million landlord be necessary to build our well britain for the tenant endure the least affordable poor quality housing disregarded renter right have have profound impact on people life britain deserve more than dodgy landlord back door eviction and dismal living standard the british people deserve to feel secure in their own home some of my constituent be force to live in terrible accommodation face damp and mould this treatment be fundamentally unacceptable the defence committee recent report describe service accommodation as shocking say that two third require massive investment to bring it up to standard and that damp and mould be legion the hon gentleman talk of dodgy landlord would he characterise the ministry of defence as one should we be bring those home up to the decent home standard that everyone else in the country will benefit from if the bill be pass in his opening remark the minister address the fact that there be issue in the space but they go beyond the scope of the bill we need to continue have these conversation as we move forward the hon gentleman raise very important point conservative failure have lead to more than household with child be force to live in privately rent damp and squalid home accord to the guardian each year child age four and under be admit to hospital because of damp and mould relate issue strongly believe that this simply can not be allow to continue shelter have recently find that quarter of renter be afraid to ask their landlord for basic repair for fear of be evict and that household be at risk of be make homeless from the no fault eviction we have be discuss today we need to change and fast the abolition of section will end these no fault eviction for good this be vital part of this legislation which will ensure peace of mind for tenant in their own home to which they devote sizeable portion of their income pressure on local authority to provide temporary accommodation have become totally unsustainable crisis estimate that billion of council fund in england be spend on temporary accommodation for household between and an increase from in my good colleague at erewash borough council tell that they spend three time more on alternative accommodation in than in these temporary measure be incredibly costly and ultimately untenable with accommodation include bed and breakfast and hotel alternative housing be an inadequate long term solution the bill will make an excellent start to save council taxpayer money and protect tenant welfare from unsuitable temporary accommodation the vital extension of awaab law to include private rental property will prevent unsafe living condition landlord discrimination and bidding on rental property prospective tenant in the housing crisis simply can not afford bidding war aim at price they out discrimination base on receipt of benefit and have child will be prevent ensure an inclusive and impartial rental market hazardous property will require prompt and efficient landlord response and tenant will be protect from unjustifiable rent inflation today while we have be debate the bill have receive communication from constituent whose rental price recently go up by which be disgusting the measure be essential for the efficient operation of rental market in the uk and for the protection of tenant right the much need introduction of the decent home standard will far empower tenant to leave poor quality home and provide well value housing for all accord to the english housing survey one in five privately rent home be consider substandard the enforcement of the decent home standard will put an end to this appalling practice with the introduction of penalty for non compliance landlord will finally be properly incentivise to maintain the necessary high standard that renter deserve new legal protection will secure quick impartial bind resolution to protect both renter and landlord give the new private rent sector landlord ombudsman and the strengthen council enforcement for which the bill provide tenant and adult will feel assured that their concern be respect and will be handle with compassion and certainty the bill will allow we to end backdoor eviction and extortionate rent design to force renter out periodic tenancy ensure that rent increase be make per the market rate once year will protect renter from unreasonable increase and unexpected eviction access to private rented sector database will help landlord to understand their legal obligation and demonstrate compliance with the new regulation these measure will allow for certainty in the law for both landlord and tenant understand that landlord be concerned about invest and enter the market for fear of payment insecurity but the current system be design around uncertainty the serious lack of clear legislation have cause decade of chaos for both landlord and tenant with unsafe home and unsuitable dispute resolution transparent and fair system be need so that all party can make informed decision as for student accommodation the change propose in the bill be necessary for the protection of landlord and student alike student deserve security as much as everyone else in society the assured continuance of annual short term student tenancy will still provide certainty in respect of landlord income with the ability to evict tenant at the end of the academic year and to increase rent for new tenant as require accord to the national union of students the average student loan leave student with just week to live off after rent despite those extortionate cost cold damp unsuitable housing have become the norm in student accommodation student be at risk of be unable to pay for basic essential so it be vital that they be protect from live in poor condition under unfair term the bill will extend vital safety and reassurance to thousand of people in erewash my constituent can not continue to endure poor housing at the hand of inadequate renter legislation they deserve security in their own home the renters rights bill be our way forward and urge all member to support it as amend today by the government it be pleasure to be call to speak in today debate on such an important topic the bill have many laudable aim and represent once in generation opportunity to finally fix the private rent sector for the million people in england include who rent privately know that about private renter in tiverton and minehead will be watch this debate with interest particularly owein and his family whom it take six month to rehome early this year in the hope and expectation that the house can finally do what it promise to do under the last government and pass meaningful rental sector reform that conservative government neglect renter and be pleased that this government be introduce meaningful legislation now tiverton and minehead sit at out of constituency in england on the barrier to housing and service index of deprivation will think closely about anything that the government can do to improve that to ensure that it represent fair deal for renter particularly those in my constituency let start by state the obvious this be good bill on the whole it take strong step to protect tenant especially when landlord be not maintain their property provision such as awaab law should and must be extend to the private rented sector so that landlord have duty to fix hazardous living condition like those that cost that precious toddler his life within set timeframe shelter be basic need not just want be very pleased that the bill seek to apply the decent home standard to the private rent sector for the first time such an extension be overdue and very welcome as pet owner be happy to see in the legislation the right for tenant to request pet pet be often an integral part of the family as they have be for my party former spokesperson on this issue my hon friend the member for north shropshire helen morgan welcome the inclusion of this measure in previous iteration of the bill and echo that welcome the bill should be commend for its ambition in many sector for example it create national private rent sector database so that tenant know about their landlord it also look to stop bid war and to ban in tenancy rent increase be write into the contract those be all fantastic reason to support the bill today understand that the government want the bill to support cheap and quick resolution where there be dispute about lease arrangement that be laudable aim but worry about the effect on rural landlord welcome the removal of section no fault eviction from the rental market but rural landlord say that issue will arise from the implementation date of the measure not be know it will come into effect on royal assent everyone renter and landlord be very keen to hear firm news on that while respect the fact that the bill will have to pass through the other place there be also nuance to be iron out regard the status of agricultural landlord would welcome any reflection from the minister on how the bill can suitably reflect the concern of the of rural business that provide accommodation as part of their offer to attract staff the bill do make some great stride but we have the chance to go far fast and well and hope that member across the house agree as represent tiverton and minehead where more household include veteran than the national average explicitly echo the point make by my hon friend the member for taunton and wellington gideon amos about amendment which call for an extension of the decent home standard to ministry of defence service family accommodation that should be welcome across the whole house but if it be not vote on today or support would still urge the secretary of state to look at the proposal and seriously consider enact it for those who spend their life serve our country and for their family we have all see the inflationary pressure on the cost of energy in recent year especially in rural area where people often pay rural premium for thing the bill need to push for improved energy efficiency standard in rent housing join my liberal democrat colleague in ask the government to reintroduce the requirement on landlord to upgrade the energy efficiency of their home to an energy performance certificate rating of or above by too many tenant live in subpar housing which make they ill and cost the nhs money the government might not want to listen on the impact of the winter fuel allowance cut but hope they will proactively take step to insulate against fuel poverty how can we check that the bill be work there be no point in seek to improve the lot of those who rent property if it just mean that landlord shift how they categorise their property so that they can keep go about their business as they do before therefore add my public support to new clause in the name of my hon friend the member for taunton and wellington which call on the secretary of state to review whether the prohibition on fix term contract have increase the number of landlord choose to offer short term let instead of let in the private rent sector simply ask the government what they have to lose by accept the new clause my liberal democrat colleague and welcome the new government bring forward legislation to improve the situation for renter we have be scrutinise it carefully to ensure that renter really do get the fair deal that they deserve it be step forward and will support it but urge the government to go far and take up the challenge of improve the bill so that it truly represent the seizing of this once in generation opportunity join colleague from across the house in say that be proud to serve on the public bill committee for too long tenant in my constituency of gillingham and rainham have be at the mercy of break rental market the system have go unchecked for the last few decade and leave renter with lack of security limited right and too often no choice but to live in unacceptable condition the previous government promise change minister stand at the dispatch box and assure the public that they would deliver fair reform in the rental sector yet they fail they kick the can down the road while tenant face soar rent substandard housing and the ever present threat of lose their home at moment notice the failure to address the housing crisis be perhaps one of the most glaring legacy of the last government the number of people rent privately have explode many be rent not from choice but because it be the only option in gillingham and rainham of household now live in the private rented sector and rent have rise sharply over the last decade family young people and old resident alike feel trap they be lock out of home ownership and housing security and lock into pay for home that be too often cold damp or unsafe recently my inbox have be full of story of constituent who have be evict through section eviction pat cooper for example be tell just before christmas that she would have to leave her home of year it have leave she feeling incredibly distressed face real uncertainty about what the future hold for she with limited choice that she can afford there be countless similar story of people who have be plunge into uncertainty and the risk of homelessness because of no fault eviction the previous government have every opportunity to end this injustice but they choose delay and inaction over the wellbeing of often vulnerable family my constituent know that this government be different within their first day they have bring forward this landmark legislation which know will deliver the security dignity and fairness that renter in my constituency deserve welcome the fact that the bill will end the scourge of no fault eviction once and for all welcome the decent home standard be extend to the private rented sector that will guarantee that tenant no long have to put up with mould disrepair or unsafe condition crucially welcome the introduction of an ombudsman to hold accountable those who do not uphold the law and to give tenant clear route to justice thank the minister for consider representation from member of different party and the amendment in front of we which introduce new rule to cap advance rent payment and provide safeguard for bereaved family something that have be speak about powerfully today this bill send clear message it be the end of the era of unchecked power for landlord who do not want to follow the rule for far too long too many tenant have be treat as second class citizen in their own home and be glad to see that this government be put an end to that it be high time that renter across the country be treat with the fairness dignity and respect that they deserve and be proud to support this bill as it progress through this place and the other place it will give my constituent their basic right rise before call the next speaker who be sure will speak to her amendment remind member that on report we should consider the amendment and new clause to the bill the debate be neither rehash of second reading nor precursor to third reading should declare that be member of the association of community organisations for reform now which campaign on renter right thank it for its important work on this bill include alongside the bill be hugely welcome but it can and should go far to fix the grave and urgent housing crisis therefore rise to speak to my new clause on rent control and affordability new clause on home adaptation for disabled people and new clause and on selective licencing scheme also want to put on the record my strong support for number of amendment table by other include the hon member for leeds central and headingley alex sobel and for liverpool wavertree paula barker we have people live on the street and in temporary accommodation because they can not afford their rent new clause propose live rent body which would set the rule that apply to the calculation of rent between tenancy that would control rent and make they fair consider factor such as the home property type condition and size average local income and so on local flexibility will be important the measure be need the bill give renter once in generation set of new right that they have long be deny but rent control be still need because it be no help to anyone if they have right to something that they can not afford or access once the bill do away with section we will need rent control to prevent rogue landlord from instead hike rent to kick people out the government change to the tribunal system do not go far enough to protect renter from that first most tenant do not have the time or energy to navigate the system secondly tribunal panel judge only judge whether rent rise be fair compare with market rate and the market rate be too high we have generation of people who will never be able to earn enough to have mortgage and who can not even afford their rent now if year old in my home city of bristol rent single room today at the average rate they will have put into their landlord bank account by their birthday no wonder that third of private renter struggle with their housing cost new clause address the plain fact that the market be fail with terrible cost for people who be struggle and make homeless there be huge economic cost too the government be set to pay private landlord billion of taxpayer money in the five year from to that be multiple time the spend on new affordable home surely that be the wrong way round we can add to that the huge annual spend on temporary accommodation which cost council at least billion in rent rise be far outstrip inflation the deposit protection service rental index find that rent outstrip inflation by one third in rightmove report show that ask rent outside london have rise since and assume that do not have to tell the house that income have not grow by the same amount as set out in committee discussion be vital if we be to avoid unintended consequence and do not dismiss the importance of that detailed work at the same time we can not ignore the acute affordability crisis for renter key worker be be force out of city and people be be force out of community that they have make their home the average rent in my constituency of bristol central have hit nearly month know what the criticism will be but let remind the house that rent control be an established part of private renting in european country where they be completely normal part of housing policy it be interesting that private renter in england spend high proportion of their income on rent than those in any european country apart from luxembourg and norway our home be in bad condition too rent control be of course not panacea they be need alongside suite of housing policy and increase social housing supply be really important however the private rented sector be in an affordability crisis now and it will take huge amount of effort and time even with the good will in the world to increase the social housing supply on scale that will impact private rent modelling from generation rent and other economist predict that build million home over this parliament will decrease the private rent burden by just over move on to new clause there be million disabled people in the uk more than fifth of the population and of they live in the private rent sector the equality and human rights commission estimate that shocking one in three disabled people in the private rent sector live in unsuitable accommodation and government survey reveal that an appalling of private landlord have say that they will not rent to someone who require home adaptation my amendment seek to ensure that if all tenant can put up shelf disabled tenant should be allow to put up grab rail if all tenant can replace showerhead disabled tenant should be allow to put in accessible washing facility it be not acceptable that disabled tenant must get permission for these most basic adaptation in committee the minister be sympathetic to my concern but argue that the equality act already cover this issue however it clearly be not do the job disabled people be explain this very clearly and patiently as do the chair of the housing communities and local government committee the hon member for vauxhall and camberwell green florence eshalomi whom thank the equality act be underuse in housing law for several reason first what amount to reasonable request be poorly define secondly the law refer to change in physical feature but the charity disability rights uk tell we that some landlord still refuse and thirdly the hassle and delay in appeal an adaptation refusal give the major backlog in the court make it prohibitive for many and unfairly put the onus on the tenant sincerely hope the minister will take another look at this issue which be so important to so many people and hope that member will vote with on my amendment later today new clause and would remove unnecessary barrier to the use of licensing scheme to improve housing standard this matter because private renter often face terrible condition constituent tell about mould and damp short fire alarm and electric rat infestation and recently student renter be leave without working boiler for whole month could go on licensing scheme be vital because they enable local authority to target regulation where it be need most on tackle the bad landlord and support the most vulnerable tenant new clause would enable local authority operate selective licensing scheme to use the condition of those licensing scheme to improve housing quality directly there be currently strange disconnect in the housing act highlight by the chartered institute of environmental health where local authority can introduce selective licensing scheme to address poor housing but can not include condition in the licence require the physical state of the licensed property to be improve by contrast additional licensing scheme for house in multiple occupation can include such condition my new clause simply seek to close this hole by amend section of the housing act to enable local authority to use licensing condition to improve housing standard the complementary new clause would increase the maximum duration of hmo licensing scheme and selective licensing scheme from five to year give that these scheme cost fair bit to set up in the first place it do not make sense for local authority to be limit to only five year of operation the extension would allow local authority to advertise long term staff post include training for new staff and would allow more time for local partnership to be set up unfortunately the lack of time today mean that we will not be able to vote on all four of my amendment but would like to test the will of the house on new clause on adaptation for disabled people this be not party political and it be surely not controversial so we should be able to agree on this today turn to my other amendment sincerely hope that the minister will consider the need for bold move to create system that really tackle the affordability crisis that private renter now face so that all citizen in this country can access safe stable and affordable home must declare an interest my husband work for an organisation that fund the renters reform coalition which have be refer to today it be privilege to speak in this debate after serve on the bill committee which take thorough approach to each element of the bill this topic be of great importance to have work in housing for my entire work life and represent private renter in the cities of london and westminster speak today think of those constituent and their experience one landlord revoke promise to provide free heating for their tenant home lead to it become infest with mould the landlord later refuse to respond to repeat report of pest in the property before subsequently charge that tenant to fumigate the house also bear in mind my constituent who be evict under section notice be now live in temporary accommodation with three child and have be on the social housing waiting list for nearly year after be let down by dither and delay from the member on the conservative benches when they be in government renter such as my constituent have be deny the crucial power to hold their landlord to account in even the most basic fashion if those member have deliver on their promise and tackle the dissenter in their midst renter would already have the protection that we be introduce in this legislation yet the opposition have the audacity to claim that the legislation and principle that they have try to introduce when they be in power will mysteriously not work now on the amendment the opposition claim that the legislation will lead to landlord exit the market but they repeatedly fail to suggest where the home own by landlord would go even in his case for new clause the shadow minister start talk about where the home might go so take the opportunity to ask he directly whether he think the home would disappear would he have rather let home lie vacant than let it out or sell it if it be unprofitable and if sale take place would the mysterious buyer not live there will happily give way if he want to answer okay he do not to continue on to my main point want to focus on the part of the bill that consider local authority enforcement and the new clause that address that current regulation in the private rent sector have suffer from lack of enforcement by local authority due to lack of knowledge about private rent stock limited enforcement capacity and the range and complexity of law relevant to enforcement the legislation go long way towards address those issue the bill put local authority clearly in the drive seat in enforce regulation clean up the confusion of the past regime it expand the range of civil penalty that can be use by local authority to crack down on poor behaviour importantly it introduce mandatory reporting for local authority enforcement activity ensure that council be accountable to their constituent and to central government the introduction of the private rent sector database will also fill key gap in the exist regime lack of knowledge of the location and nature of private rent property the remain gap in the regime will be fund and it be essential that fee for the private rent sector database be sufficient to fund the enforcement measure in the bill it be therefore encouraging to see that recognise by government amendment which be happy to support support what the hon member say about resource for local government do she also accept that there be real problem particularly in london where there be simply lack of advice available for tenant because the advice agency be completely overwhelmed and underfunded we therefore need to fund independent advice agency as well will come on to some of the incredible work that advice agency do in my constituency funding will need to be meet with an active approach by local authority to recruit the right individual with the appropriate skill to act as inspector for the regime additional funding may be need for the immediate recruitment and upskilling of inspector and to deal with backlog of case relate to enforce exist regulation most importantly landlord must have as many point of potential accountability as possible that mean that report on enforcement activity should be publish publicly with the naming and shaming of poor perform landlord the bill mark not just an era of right for the million of private renter across the country but step change in the necessary enforcement activity by council and by renter themselves the campaign group and advice agency that have stand up for renter for year include generation rent and also which operate in my constituency deserve mountain of praise for their work in keep this issue on the agenda of party and actor across the political spectrum and pay tribute to they for their work the scale of support that this bill have from member on the government benches demonstrate the significance of this issue it be important that we work together across government and civil society to enforce this new right framework and provide renter with their long overdue protection be sure that all member have plenty of example in their inboxe of why this bill be so needed recent case in my inbox have range from someone who have to wait two year for boiler to be fix to someone who have home so damp that they can not walk through it without shoe on as the carpet be permanently wet they have have numerous electrical appliance fail and have lose their property to mould bad of all they be permanently ill even the ombudsman find in their favour have not produce decisive action to address the problem it be an outrage that people be live in such condition in the century and after the inaction of the previous government welcome the approach set out in this bill to fix hazard such as mould also welcome the security of tenancy so often when people approach their mp about homelessness issue they talk about the importance of be in particular location they say it be because their child be settle in their school because they need to care for relative who live there and because they need the support of family and friend repeatedly move around robs people of vital community link and stability it also affect the life chance of child and young people it be not only no fault eviction that lead to people move around so too do rent rise so welcome the amendment of my hon friend the member for taunton and wellington gideon amos to limit the maximum rent increase far too many people be force out of their rental property by exorbitant rent rise and this bill do not go far enough to prevent that situation the hon member for cities of london and westminster rachel blake ask where the property will go in some case as our new clause set out they will go to people on short term contract we therefore need to consider the impact on the market as whole wish to raise one small concern of landlord about the impact that the change will have both on they and on their tenant they own single upper floor leasehold flat they own only the inside of the flat not the exterior the wall gap or the loft the bill provision on energy efficiency and so forth be of concern to they obviously we want people to have home that they can afford to heat and that meet climate change obligation but not all small landlord be scrupulous and rely on they to be so be not appropriate protection for tenant as the bill progress ask the minister to consider how the government will support small landlord who want to do the right thing so that the private rental sector do not become the sole preserve of well heel large landlord wonder whether might provide some helpful clarification this bill have no provision in it that deal with minimum energy efficiency standard in the private rent sector the department for energy security and net zero will shortly go out to consultation on those mee standard for the prs but it be not within the scope of this bill thank the minister for that clarification in conclusion welcome the bill and the protection it provide but urge ministers to accept the liberal democrat amendment put forward by my hon friend the members for taunton and wellington and for st albans daisy cooper this be groundbreake legislation and pay tribute to the minister and the deputy prime minister for the excellent work that they have do so far in october say in this place that my hon friend the minister for housing and planning under the leadership of our deputy prime minister will get this job do and they be do exactly that this government be get on with the job the previous government make empty promise after empty promise ultimately cave in to the landlord lobby on their own benches perhaps that be why the opposition benches be so empty today the bill go long way towards redress the power imbalance between those who own asset and those who need to use such asset for the basic human need of housing and shelter it will finally see an end to section eviction to boot the bill ensure protect period at the beginning of tenancy the end of discrimination face by those in receipt of social security an end to bidding war and the rolling out of the decent home standard across the private rent sector indeed the government have indicate their intention to strengthen the bill far by limit the amount of rent payable in advance at the start of tenancy have table several amendment and be grateful to the minister for the constructive dialogue we have have to date even if we do not agree on all of they new clause be about deposit reform new clause would provide help to care leaver by place duty on local authority to help they pay or to guarantee any required deposit to enable they to agree tenancy in the private rent sector amendment would introduce specific requirement for landlord and dwelling entry on the private rent sector database amendment would apply the decent home standard to all temporary accommodation amendment relate to landlord pass on the cost of grant scheme for energy efficiency improvement to tenant acknowledge that the minister have say that the department for energy security and net zero would probably be the most appropriate department to have dialogue with on that issue of course my amendment and look at rent stabilisation be also pleased to support amendment table by my hon friend the members for dulwich and west norwood helen hayes and for leeds central and headingley alex sobel minister in this department know all too well that as with any legislation believe that we should look to go far hope that we can continue our constructive dialogue on these specific point in the month ahead thank shelter the renter reform coalition and generation rent for their engagement on the content of the bill wholeheartedly agree with their assessment that affordability in the private rent sector must be tackle head on specifically on amendment and it be all well and good the government say that they do not support rent stabilisation but as country we have to come back to this issue that may not happen tomorrow or next month but inevitably at some point we will have to because the private rented sector have lose all sense of proportion and on that nothing will change the problem of affordability will continue to get bad like many right hon and hon member across the house be fortunate to be homeowner as representative however we should be acutely aware of the unaffordability of rent in south london greater manchester and of course my home city of liverpool and my constituency of liverpool wavertree sadly aside from those right hon and hon member with adult child there be an ignorance among the homeowner in this place who simply do not understand what it be to face life at the sharp end of the private rent sector our city have pull for this generation of young adult and in those city we be leave they to the mercy of landlord and let agent some let agent play sinister role often drive large scale increase in rent for their own end we hear all the time about struggle landlord who run business but how many property do not have mortgage next to their name would suggest it be considerable amount yet rent continue to rise again and again the reason we have the bill in the first place be that as society we have lose faith in the ability of the landlord class to regulate themselves yet we continue to trust they on the rent they charge for tenant to break free of hand gargantuan proportion of their income to fund the passive income of the landlord class the death of grandparent or an early advance on their inheritance might help they out if they be so lucky this country have utterly fail generation the millennial if you will who be now not so young and be the first generation not to be well off than their parent by many metric in nothing be that more true than housing this housing crisis be what happen when we commodify very basic human need forty year on we still live with the consequence of the thatcherite settlement that lay the foundation of the modern day housing crisis high rent cost the taxpayer considerably they keep the homeless stuck in temporary accommodation which cost our council billion and have put they on the verge of bankruptcy and they considerably burden the department for work and pensions whose local housing allowance routinely fail to keep pace with rent increase labour government of the past have generally have radical history on renting and the bill keep that tradition alive it be tony crosland not exactly from my wing of the party who remark in the the landlord often look on house property simply as an investment to give they perpetual return with the minimum of expenditure worse still they wield degree of personal power over their tenant which can be offensive and intolerable what tony say in the remain true in be disappointed that the bill will not address affordability head on but give it my wholehearted and enthusiastic support in the name of progress be grateful for the opportunity to speak in this debate which be important to my constituent and to personally as grow up in rent accommodation new clause would limit the maximum rent that landlord can request or receive in advance to no more than two month worth of the tenancy excessive deposit mean that far too many people face exclusion from the housing market altogether for family on low income young tenant or those receive benefit that practice can make find home almost impossible landlord increasingly use method such require rent in advance to exclude those they deem undesirable tenant accord to the charity shelter of private landlord refuse to let to tenant receive housing benefit by cap rent in advance the new clause would help to level the play field and reduce the financial burden on those who be look for somewhere decent to live but can not get in the door because they be live pay cheque to pay cheque amendment would ensure that any rent increase be cap at maximum rate in line with the bank of england base rate unchecked rent increase be drive family in eastleigh and across the country into financial hardship in the current system unscrupulous landlord can impose excessive hike that effectively force tenant out one couple in my constituency who be already work two job to provide home for their young child be force out of their rent accommodation when their landlord hike their rent to an unaffordable level they have no choice but to move to small property that do not cater as well to their family need allow that practice to continue undermine the stability and security that the bill seek to provide link rent increase to the bank of england base rate be both logical and fair it would create predictability for tenant while allow landlord to adjust rent reasonably in response to economic condition office for national statistics figure show that private rent in eastleigh rise by in the amendment would provide more protection for people who be struggle because of the cost of live crisis and can not pay extremely high rent new clause would ensure that landlord approve necessary home adaptation for disabled tenant where professional home assessment have be carry out one in three disabled people in private rent property live in unsuitable accommodation the failure to secure appropriate housing can be life limit and make regular activity such as access bathroom or move between room very difficult in england of disabled people rely on the private rent sector because of the chronic shortage of social housing yet private rented property be rarely accessible or adaptable and only of disabled facility grant be use to make such home suitable for disabled renter unsuitable housing not only hinder independence but increase reliance on social care lead to high hospital admission and reduce participation in work and community life the amendment would ensure that disabled tenant have the autonomy and dignity to live independently in home suit to their need finally express my support for amendment which would extend protection to student in hmo property student be some of the most vulnerable renter often deal with insecure housing high rent and landlord who fail to maintain property this amendment would ensure that landlord of student hmo be hold to the same standard as other landlord provide great security and accountability also express my support for new clause all young people deserve somewhere safe to call home and as much support as possible to help they find it welcome this bill as an opportunity to reset the balance of power in the rental market my constituent in eastleigh and renter across the country deserve rental market that work for they not against they urge member to support the amendment to which have speak to ensure that the bill deliver the fair deal that renter have be wait for note for the record my interest in this area because be landlord as the member of parliament for northampton south come to the chamber today to speak strongly in support of the bill and many of the amendment the private and social rent sector account for around third of all household in my constituency that be people who will directly benefit from this legislation my constituent work hard northampton south have high economic activity rate than the uk average yet despite work hard many people still face incredibly high level of housing insecurity high rent and low housing standard housing remain the no issue in my inbox and the renters rights bill will help to address the insecurity and unfairness that my constituent have face when rent this government be take the decisive action that people in northampton have long ask for will speak to the amendment but have to start by address section end no fault eviction will protect my constituent right now million of renter across the country live with that sword hang over their head that they could be force to leave their home through no fault of their own that mean parent lie awake at night worry that they will have to move their child mid term it mean nurse and teacher be force out of the community that they work in and it mean family be unable to put root down or plan for their future because they can be uproot at any moment the number impact by this insecurity be shocking and it be really positive that the government have not only recognise this but include further protection through their amendment to strengthen protection for renter be particularly pleased by the amendment that limit rent to be pay in advance we have hear some shocking story today my mouth drop when hear some of the rent be ask for in advance in certain part of the uk protect renter in this way be definitely the right thing to do welcome the provision that expand the decent home standard have hear from people in my constituency who live in property plague by damp mould and electrical hazard have spend nearly year work in the construction industry and have work with some great private and social landlord can say that it be not that difficult for people to maintain and look after the property that they run the fact that of private rent home in this country fail to meet basic standard be simply unacceptable landlord who do not properly maintain safe property be irresponsible and deserve to be hold to account and this legislation will make sure that that happen be particularly pleased that the bill will recognise the impact on guarantor in the awful situation where tenant who they support pass away the new clause that have be table will mean that guarantor be protect while also provide fair recourse and support for landlord in that awful situation encourage member to support those amendment be encourage by the provision relate to the landlord redress scheme which provide clear route for tenant to resolve issue without costly court proceeding however have have extensive conversation with student in northampton and the northampton landlords association and with number of my constituent who be part of the hmo action group and they tell that while they support the aim of the scheme and they have be follow the stage of the bill up to report in detail they have concern that the court system or the justice system just will not be up to scale be encourage by the minister statement that this be be look at but it be critical for professional hmo landlord in my constituency who will need quick resolution to dispute and measure to deal with antisocial tenant and tenant who negatively impact on their co habitee will finish by pick up some of the comment make in his opening statement by the shadow minister the hon member for ruislip northwood and pinner david simmonds and some other speech not everyone in this house be of the same mind and some have express concern that reform may restrict market supply but can tell hon member that in my experience evidence from across the world show that similar regulation have not prevent growth in the private rent sector to take ireland for example it introduce protect tenancy way back in but that sector have double and it continue to grow and thrive with those control in place look at germany australia sweden and across the developed world we see that rebalancing between landlord and tenant have mean that private rented sector have flourish the reality be that country with strong regulation on rental standard have see fast growth than those that do not have it let clear this bill be pro market not anti landlord it will help create more stable rental sector in which good landlord can thrive and bad landlord be hold to account this be good for tenant it be good for responsible landlord and it be good for our economy rise to speak on new clause in my name and government new clause but before do so would like to make some brief remark about other aspect of the bill in my constituency of dulwich and west norwood housing be overwhelmingly the big challenge that my constituent face housing cost have spiral and the previous government waste more than decade fail to build the home we need the effect of this have be that more and more of my constituent be live in privately rent home in which they be currently systematically deny the basic stability and security that most of we would agree be essential to be able to function properly in the rest of life private tenant live with the constant fear that their landlord can at any time without reference to the term of their tenancy agreement decide that they want their property back and serve an eviction notice have see this happen time and again it stop people put down root in their community because they know that they be likely not to be able to stay it mean that parent live with the constant anxiety that they may have to move far away from their child school it mean that old people be deny security of tenure in their retirement in return for extortionate rent tenant all too often face appalling standard and find it far too difficult to get basic health and safety issue address therefore welcome this bill which deliver the big package of reform to private renting for year redress the current imbalance between landlord and tenant strengthen tenant right and provide much need additional security particularly welcome the scrapping of section eviction have be speak on they in this place since the strengthening of local authority enforcement power and the creation of new private rent sector ombudsman and the application of awaab law to the private rent sector there be very great challenge about the affordability of private renting particularly in london and my constituent experience that every day hope the minister will keep under review the measure in this bill that be design to limit the rate of rent increase to ensure they be as effective as they need to be to create function rental market trust that the minister will do that and will not hesitate to take further action in future if it be need now turn to my own new clause and government new clause which would ban the use of guarantor agreement in the event of the death of tenant in this place all of we know that there be sometimes email that stop we in our track so it be for when in receive an email from constituent that read as follow late last year become guarantor for my son so that he could secure accommodation with some friend for his second year at university without do so he would have lose the house have no real concern about my son pay the rent as he have show he be hard worker in variety of job he engage with to supplement his student loan which would have cover the rent anyway the tenancy be due to start at the beginning of july tragically two week ago he take his own life leave myself my wife and his sister utterly devastate on top of everything now find myself liable to pay the rent for his room for the entire length of his tenancy if replacement tenant can not be find wonder if there might be scope to look into the practice of expect bereaved parent to continue in role of guarantor to love one after they have die do not think anyone could read that email and think that what happen to my constituent who be face the bad kind of pain be remotely acceptable contact the let agent who refuse to budge simply state that they be follow the contract that have be sign thank my hon friend and neighbour for make such powerful speech and read out what must have be difficult email to receive on behalf of her constituent do she agree that sadly many other tenant up and down the country might have have to go through that and suffer in silence because they be grieve agree with my hon friend and will speak in moment about evidence have receive that this issue be more widespread than any of we might have imagine raise the issue at prime minister question and after that be contact by many people include family who have experience exactly that as well as let agent who tell that they explicitly do not use such clause and that such clause be not necessary because the loss of rental income in the event of the death of tenant be an insurable risk for landlord be grateful to member across the house who have support my campaign include member who sign new clause and those who sign my amendment to the renters reform bill in the last parliament engage extensively with two different housing ministers in the previous government both of whom say that they be sympathetic but decline to take action in that bill or support my amendment be therefore grateful to the minister for housing and planning for his compassionate and rigorous engagement on this issue he have listen and more importantly he have act where his predecessor do not government new clause table this week ban the use of guarantor agreement in the event of the death of tenant who be family member that be what my constituent ask of and be proud that that be what we will achieve today hope my constituent will take some small comfort from know that by speak out and contact their mp other family face with the heartbreak of lose love one will not be pursue by greedy landlord or let agent add financial stress and hardship to an already unbearable situation new clause do not go as far as new clause extend protection only to bereaved guarantor who be relate to the tenant while that protection would have help my constituent and while agree that institutional guarantor should not automatically be release from their responsibility on the death of tenant the limitation of the new clause mean that there could still be hard case in future for example close friend who be bereaved therefore trust that the minister will keep the situation under review to ensure that new clause be as effective as he intend as consequence of the minister engagement on this matter be content to withdraw new clause and support government new clause urge all right hon and hon member to do the same and to support this bill which will deliver the step change in regulation of the private rent sector that we have all be need for far too long it be pleasure to follow the hon member for dulwich and west norwood helen hayes and pay tribute to she for the work she have do in try to alleviate the pain cause when someone die and all the demand then descend unexpectedly on those who be rent guarantor she have do very good job on that and welcome government new clause my constituency like other constituency in london and most of our big city have huge number of people live in the private rented sector with probably more than one third of the electorate live in private rent accommodation collectively they face insecurity collectively they be often stress collectively they be often pay high and excessive level of rent it be heartbreaking to see the number of people who make their home in the area become active in the community and make huge contribution to our community life in lot of way but then the rent go up and up and they simply can no long afford to stay anyone look for private rent accommodation within the local housing allowance in most inner london constituency would search for long time and be unlikely to find anywhere remotely near that allowance see my friend the hon member for bristol central carla denyer nodding and the same situation exist in many other city across the country people on average earning and working class community be simply be drive out by the greed of the private rent sector and the market that go with it with rent go up by and sometimes that be why intervene on the minister early and be grateful that he give way and acknowledge the real crisis happen day in day out across the country long term private sector tenant be at threat because their landlord know this bill be come and that there will be great restriction perhaps there should be more on their raising of rent and do no fault eviction so they be presently try to evict large number of tenant meet many constituent who be go through incredible level of stress about that realise that the bill be not yet law and have to go through the house of lords and be not clear what date it will be finally enact just hope it be soon urge the minister to consider any kind of urgent action and advice he can give to protect exist tenant in the run up to the introduction of this legislation pay tribute to the hon member for liverpool wavertree paula barker for the amendment she have table on rent level while there be much in the bill that welcome it be sadly bit of miss opportunity although it restrict the ability of landlord to raise rent in the future it do not protect those rent be at reasonable level her amendment which be good step forward would link all rent increase to combination of wage level and cpi and give local authority the power to enforce that we surely should return to that hope that the government will accept one or other of the many amendment that talk about the ability to review this legislation year on and two year on to see its effect on rent level and above all on security of tenure and whether way have be find to get around it new clause table by the hon member for bristol central concern the protection of tenant with disability to ensure that they be not discriminate against and it be important it have be widely support across the house and hope the government will agree it or at least introduce something similar on report in the lords if necessary the hon member be represent an important and genuine need across the country lastly we have housing crisis in britain that be utterly beyond belief and utterly unnecessary talk to people every day where live who be rough sleeper they be walk around spend the whole day try to sell the big issue to raise or to pay for bed in night shelter that they can only access in the evening and have to leave in the morning it be not accommodation it be literally just that night shelter their life be search for in order just to survive be not say that the local authority do not do all it can to help it do be not say there be not lot of housing charity that do the same there be but we have well know number of people live in destitution in our society grotesque overcrowding in many council and housing association home and insecurity in the private rent sector the bill go long way in reduce insecurity in the private rented sector but it must be wake up call for our society to invest far more in council housing and in sustainable affordable social housing understand all the demand for build housing but owner occupation right to buy and all that will not necessarily solve the housing crisis that so many face it be up to we in parliament and the government to do great deal more to try to alleviate the massive level of housing stress the bill go some way towards that but we could go far on rent control and protection of tenant and we could do much more on the empowerment of tenant conclude by say thank you to the often underfunde voluntary sector agency that do so much to give advice they be essentially part of the housing community thank in particular acorn which have do so much to empower tenant in the private rent sector to realise that they be not alone in face irrational decision by landlord who should know well than to pursue no fault eviction which will thankfully be end by the bill express my gratitude to the minister and the secretary of state for table amendment on regulate the student letting season and on rent in advance both be issue that have be campaign on over year ago go to leeds university union cost of living event where those issue and other be bring home to starkly they be also bring home to by the national union of students cost of live inquiry and the all party parliamentary group on student which be lead by our former colleague paul blomfield and on which serve really thank the government for table amendment and on regulate the student let season build on the work of paul blomfield who spearhead work on this in his constituency of sheffield central will not press my new clause and urge member to support those government amendment if there be no regulation of the let season student be pressure and intimidate by the rental market into sign tenancy with people they hardly know sometimes nine month before they be due to move in student of all background be fork out deposit to hold property care leaver estranged student and student from low economic background be leave to either spend money that they do not have or risk housing insecurity for the next academic year the government decision to limit the let season to six month give student the space and time to create healthy social relationship and save money for deposit for the next academic year drastically improve their mental wellbeing government new clause and be landmark measure that ensure that student be not subject to excessive and exploitative up front cost by limit rent in advance that create fair more accessible rental market for example my constituent olivia be once require to pay six month rent up front to move into four bed share property she be move to leeds to begin her master leave she without saving for move to new city be not how we should treat any person vulnerable to the rental market or look to be an asset to the community the government new clause will help prevent such unreasonable demand and alleviate financial pressure on tenant so be withdraw my new clause on limit rent and urge support for the government new clause my constituent olivia up front cost be so high because she could not get guarantor now that we have set limit on rent in advance we must deal with the other side of the issue the requirement for tenant to provide guarantor the practice can exclude individual who can not meet those demand or limit their access to secure housing adult who earn their own income can be exclude from sign up to rent basic accommodation in share house simply because they be not relate to someone who own uk property my new clause would place tight restriction on the requirement for tenant to provide guarantor especially when tenant rental history or income offer sufficient security by refine those provision we can balance the legitimate interest of landlord with the right and need of tenant my new clause suggest that the need for guarantor should be restrict when the follow circumstance apply when reasonable assessment show that personal income include state benefit receive and any other lawful source of income be sufficient for the tenant to pay the full rent due under the tenancy when arrangement be make for housing benefit or the housing element of universal credit to be pay directly to the landlord when the landlord have enter into contract of insurance through which they be insure against non payment of rent that have be cover by other amendment and in such other circumstance as may be prescribe in regulation by the secretary of state that give the government wide avenue for implement my new clause the expectation that tenant despite enter into legally bind rental agreement must secure third party guarantor undermine the very purpose of their rental contract for many student particularly those who can not rely on family support such as care leaver and estranged individual that requirement can make rent nearly impossible the bill provide generational opportunity to raise standard of live in the uk to where they should be as will not push my new clause to vote would welcome further discussion and engagement with the minister as the bill progress on how we can change the reliance on guarantor in our rental market know that he be open to that discussion in my constituency of constituent live in private rental compare with national average of leed be home to population of over non home student the bill be imperative to my constituent through its measure be hopeful that we can establish rental market that promote fairness reduce inequality and strengthen community across the uk be very happy to support the government amendment thank the minister for introduce the bill and all hon member on the bill committee who give their time to consider with gravity this long overdue reform which will provide great security and stability for million of renter across the country the bill be particularly important to my constituency where more than of household be in the private rental sector that figure be as high as in some ward such as bournemouth central and up to in the ward of winton westbourne and west cliff the private rental sector should provide people with flexibility and be stepping stone to home ownership and it should support our local economy but for too many as we have hear from many hon member it exacerbate instability and add financial stress lock people out of build the saving that they need to get on the housing ladder as well as add to mental health issue that be particularly salient in my constituency where the cost of housing be disproportionately expensive give the wage that people can command the average rent and property price be above the national average in bournemouth but average wage be low than the national average the bill be timely because in recent month have be deeply concerned about the grow number of resident who have be in touch to raise issue about housing to the point that we be host three additional housing super surgery aim at provide constituent with the opportunity to share specific issue and at give they advice and guidance from many local organisation that specialise in these issue want to raise few issue relate to the amendment that many hon member will find apply in their constituency the first be poor quality accommodation in my constituency one young woman and her daughter have be bounce from mouldy bedsit to mouldy bedsit while they wait for an appropriate social home in the process the woman daughter have develop asthma welcome the reform relate to the decent home standard and awaab law lot of people have be in touch who be be force into homelessness by eye water rental increase or section notice the average increase last year for one bed flat in my constituency be another young woman and her daughter be make homeless by section notice follow an unaffordable rent increase she have be unable to find anything that meet her physical and mental health need but in any case she can not meet the up front cost of much private rental sector accommodation in our constituency welcome the amendment to address up front cost her situation be compound by long social housing waiting list welcome the wide housing reform that the government be bring forward include the increase target for social housing and the wide house building programme there be almost student live in my constituency recently meet student union representative from bournemouth university and the arts university bournemouth who tell about the struggle their student face from the stress of find an appropriate place to live to the timetable for find accommodation and the struggle to rent many student be force to couch surf because they can not afford the deposit money or do not have guarantor who meet the requirement bournemouth be one of the top most expensive place to be student in the uk some of the maintenance loan be eat up by housing cost leave many student with about week afterwards that be not sustainable situation therefore welcome the measure to protect student tenancy and address the up front cost for student it be my hope that in the long run many student will benefit from these reform will fall in love with bournemouth and want to stay and will be able to find appropriate and affordable place to live as we have hear good and responsible landlord have nothing to fear from these reform welcome the measure to give landlord more clarity and well understanding of their legal obligation and to address repossession right the abolition of section awaab law and the up front cost provision will allow my constituent and many across the country to breathe sigh of relief therefore welcome the bill and new clause for year renter have face instability insecurity and in many case exploitation today we be take decisive step towards confront these injustice it be pleasure to serve on the bill committee believe that we will look back on the bill as one of the proud achievement of this labour government be proud to support the government new clause which limit the security deposit that landlord can demand from tenant to just one month rent this change address one of the most significant barrier for renter in my constituency the crippling up front cost of high security deposit previously landlord be able to demand deposit of up to six month rent practice that have often price out renter and leave many unable to secure home by cap deposit at just one month rent we be make it far easy for tenant to move into their home without face financial burden that have long be barrier to entry to the rental market new clause be vital step in make the rental market more accessible and affordable particularly to those who have be exclude from the market due to high cost this change will ensure that renter be treat fairly and can more easily get the stability that they need without face financial hardship the bill be just one part of package of measure that support renter and tackle the housing crisis in this country those measure include get on with build those million new home through planning reform an industrial strategy that give we the tool to build those home and the technical excellence college that will deliver skilled people this government recognise that the housing crisis be not problem that can be solve in isolation as one of the young member of this house be part of generation that feel that we have be trap in renting recent datum show that be spend more than of their income on rent which be more than any other group the people who tell we to stop eat avocado and cancel netflix be not serious about confront the gravity of the situation they fail my generation it be this government who be take action today the previous conservative government have ample opportunity to enact meaningful reform and note that conservative continue to fail to stand up for renter despite their promise to abolish section no fault eviction lead cause of homelessness they fail to deliver instead under their watch parliament be clock off early while the problem in the country mount up they retreat from their housing commitment and prioritise the appeasement of powerful landlord interest over the welfare of million of renter on second reading the leader of the opposition say that resolve the housing crisis hinge solely on increase housing supply and reduce immigration need remind she that her government do the exact opposite in response to comment from the shadow minister the hon member for ruislip northwood and pinner david simmonds let note that the government have already increase housing target and act decisively to address illegal migration however reject the premise that renter right should be contingent on these factor alone the protection and empowerment of renter be entirely independent of such matter as we hear from shelter and generation rent in the bill committee we need to rebalance the power between landlord and tenant in recent year the balance have favour landlord over tenant but the bill and the government amendment introduce several key reform design to rebalance that relationship for renter in my constituency the bill present transformative change family will no long face the fear of sudden arbitrary eviction and can truly make their rent property their home the tragic death of awaab ishak cause by mould exposure in his social housing highlight an issue that we must address extend awaab law to the private rent sector be crucial step towards ensure safe and healthy living condition for all key to this will be enforcement of the law and know that the government be fully aware of that follow the minister commitment in committee which he have repeat today one of the bill most significant but often overlook reform be the creation of national landlord database which will empower tenant to make informed choice and protect they from rogue landlord remarkably we often have more information about the available takeaway option than about those whom we trust with our home and our income this measure raise market standard while also recognise the responsible landlord who maintain quality home have introduce similar system as community officer in the university of nottingham student union be aware of the positive impact such transparency bring and be proud to see that vision realise here today in contrast must express my concern about the opposition new clause which propose that the secretary of state consult the insurance industry to ensure that specific insurance product be available to landlord who be let property to tenant who be on benefit or will be keep pet on the surface that may appear to be constructive solution but in practice it risk perpetuate harmful stereotype and create further barrier for tenant the implication that tenant on benefit or pet owner inherently represent great risk be both unfair and unhelpful it reinforce outdated prejudice at time when we should be focus on inclusivity and reduce discrimination in the rental market which be exactly what the bill be about as we hear from the hon member for tiverton and minehead rachel gilmour pet be part of our family and be glad to see the provision that support that moreover introduce specialised insurance product may have the unintended consequence of discourage landlord from let to those specific group such product be unlikely to make rent more attractive instead they may result in high premium or more complex term that landlord will interpret as reason to avoid let property to tenant altogether we must not jeopardise the gain in the bill by introduce measure that risk create an unequal and discriminatory rental system the future of the rental market should be one in which responsible landlord and renter co exist on an equal footing support by policy that prioritise fairness and dignity these reform be not mere administrative change they represent profound shift toward justice and equity in our housing system they acknowledge that while many landlord operate ethically there exist minority whose practice undermine the integrity of the rental market and the wellbeing of tenant to they we be send clear message your time of exploit loophole and avoid accountability be over ultimately what our constituent want be simple they want the security of roof over their head for they and their family job that pay the bill and healthcare that work for they when they need it this government be get on with deliver all those thing and the bill be key part of that it be pivotal step towards fair more just housing system it reflect labour unwavering commitment to protect renter support good landlord and rectify the systemic issue that have plague our rental market for far too long be proud to be support the bill and the government amendment tonight third of people in my constituency live in private rent accommodation that be already pretty high and well above the national average of but in some ward such as southall green it rise to almost of people live in rent home eale borough be what be know as super diverse with people from all over the world have make it their home for many of my constituent in southall english be second third or even fourth language that they sometimes struggle with that leave they wide open to abuse by rogue landlord and under the previous government there be nothing they could do about it the conservatives make promise after promise to renter but never deliver in hock to vest interest they renege on every pledge they make to renter and some of the amendment table by the opposition today continue to prioritise the need of bad landlord over those of renter in generation rent produce report into renting by the british indian community use datum from renter in southall the report find that over third have not receive any of the six important document they be entitle to from their landlord third state that their landlord have threaten they with an unaffordable rent increase over half say that their rent have increase in the previous six month with the average increase be per month and many be live in damp overcrowded condition the renters rights bill will ensure that vulnerable tenant such as those in ealing southall be able to go to the housing ombudsman for help they will also be able to challenge arbitrary eviction and unfair rent rise welcome the government amendment today which strengthen the bill even far particularly new clause which will end the astronomical deposit often demand from tenant in advance that be very important change particularly in ealing southall because where people face low pay and massive rent cost it will reduce barrier to they get into good quality safe housing and ensure that we do not continue to see people sleep on the street the previous government sit back while renter in my constituency be condemn to mouldy flat huge rent rise and the threat of no fault eviction but ealing labour council take action it introduce new selective licensing scheme for private landlord and these scheme be discuss in committee selective landlord licensing scheme require private landlord to have licence to rent out property in designate area of high deprivation or poor housing condition they have to meet certain condition to obtain the licence such as provide safe and suitable accommodation comply with fire safety regulation and manage their property in responsible manner in the absence of action from the previous government these scheme have allow council such as ealing to enforce high standard for renter as the licensing fee and any fine raise from irresponsible landlord be ringfence for enforce standard in ealing it have also increase awareness for vulnerable tenant of the minimum standard to be expect in rent accommodation the previous government be not big supporter of licensing landlord in this way they prefer stand up for landlord rather than stand up for renter in fact they change the law to give the secretary of state veto on selective licensing scheme that cover more than of council area it look like the conservatives still be not big supporter of these scheme as one of the amendment they table in committee would have remove selective landlord license altogether that would be massive backwards move and be glad the minister agree with in fact before christmas the minister announce that he would be remove the conservatives veto and council will now be able to expand scheme such as the one in ealing to the whole borough if they want to be delighted that the government have take fast action on this without wait for the bill to pass and look forward to more council with poor housing and high deprivation level be able to bring in successful licensing scheme such as the one in ealing also welcome the government amendment which will give more power to local authority to enforce renter right and to pay for enforcement and investigation the conservatives have prove today that they do not care about renter and most of the point that they have raise be about protect bad landlord although so few of the party member have turn up that wonder whether they care about anything by contrast labour believe that it be time we rebalance the power relationship between landlord and tenant so that constituent such as mine know their right and can enforce they include the right to fair rent to safe home and to secure tenancy welcome the real difference that this bill and the government amendment will make to the life of family in ealing southall the reform outline in this bill and the amendment be of course long overdue when stand for election last year promise that would deliver on five mission for mansfield one of which be to fix our break housing market and ensure that people have affordable home to rent sadly that mission be necessary because many of my constituent face the constant risk of eviction they live in fear of massive rent hike or endure substandard and even dangerous condition in their home will discuss two key aspect of the amendment first support government new clause particularly in respect of rent and deposit in advance will read few line from recent casework email that receive from one of my constituent see house list for rent and pay deposit and rent in advance to secure the property there be few thing that need doing which the agency say they would let the landlord know about and get fix receive the key and be shock that the damp and mould be still there the radiator in one of the bedroom be leave on the floor and the bathtub be still out of place the agent tell that the gas engineer tell they that the pipe in the house be all botched winter be around the corner and if the heater be to stop work have to stay in the house freezing nurse and it would not be ideal for to be off work sick my constituent far write try every day to get an update and find out if the landlord have sort out the problem every time have to leave in disappointment expect to move into the new house vacate my previous occupancy be so mentally emotionally physically and financially drain that go to the agency and give they the key back do not feel comfortable live in house where the landlord be neglect tenant if be to move in and something be to go wrong he would never come out or get it fix on time those be really powerful word from my constituent follow that my constituent be deny any kind of refund for period of month they be only able to secure refund due to last minute intervention by my office after have suggest that would name the let agent in my speech the let agent be kind enough to get back to my constituent and have provide they with full refund today that outline the importance of government new clause and why be pleased to support it and it emphasise why the reform set out in the bill and the amendment be need understand that the decent home standard outline in the bill will force landlord in the private rent sector to make their home safe and secure and to give tenant more avenue for financial redress when thing go wrong as in the case of my constituent my second point be that we have see rent increase at dramatic rate year after year and it be time that people in the private rent sector get well deal there be usually many application from prospective tenant when new property come to market in my constituency which often lead to bidding war drive up the price that be pay to rent the property pit tenant against tenant this leave only one winner be pleased that the government have also set the target of build million new home in england over five year which will make huge difference recognise and welcome those measure finally by abolish section no fault eviction and fix term the bill will remove the threat of arbitrary eviction from my constituent and increase tenant security constituent recently come to follow disagreement with her landlord about propose increase in her rent and repair need to the property understand that halfway through the repair process the landlord suspend the work and serve she with section notice this be particularly difficult give the tenant medical issue and her son special educational need no reason at all be give for serve the notice this bill and the amendment will outlaw such practice and give tenant in my constituency security in their home for the reason have outline and indeed for the many more reason that have be outline by my colleague in the chamber today this bill and the amendment will have significant impact on the quality of life of the people in mansfield who elect to this place by support this legislation be deliver on one of my mission to help fix the broken housing market for local people in my constituency would like to echo the comment of my neighbour my hon friend the member for bournemouth west jessica toale and the reference that she make to the housing problem in our area today mark once in generation moment with the big change to private renting since the conservatives housing act the thatcher reform aim to rejuvenate private renting by make it more attractive to landlord but instead they help to sow the seed of the housing crisis we see today england million private renter face some of the bad quality housing in the developed world with shocking level of damp and mould and low rate of insulation result in health problem and unaffordable energy bill instead of produce competitive and affordable housing decade of tip the scale towards landlord have result in home that be insecure eye wateringly expensive and often short term in nature while renter in country such as germany enjoy secure long last tenancy with right to redress when thing go wrong tenant in england can be put out on the street by no fault eviction if they complain about leaky roof or broken boiler rise to speak in support of new clause which would limit rent in advance of tenancy new clause which would limit propose rent level and new clause which cover the right to have home adaptation make to property we know that this legislation will end the exploitative bidding war that drive up rental price stamp out discrimination on renting to family with child or those on benefit and give renter the right to request pet in their home with section finally consign to history tenant will also benefit from long notice period give they more security in their home and we will hold landlord accountable for health hazard in their property no long should tenant and their family suffer damage to their health because landlord refuse to act however to truly deliver more secure future for renter in england the bill need to close loophole that would allow no fault eviction to continue via rent hike amendment table by my hon friend the member for liverpool wavertree paula barker would cap in tenancy rent rise it would introduce cap on the amount landlord can raise the rent of sit tenant so that no one have to face rent hike high than wage growth or inflation everyone deserve to have basic security in their home whether they rent or own people with mortgage tend to have relatively predictable cost tenant have no such peace of mind today there be nothing to protect tenant from extortionate unjust rent hike the renters rights bill do not do enough to change that last year government survey of landlord find that rent increase of or more when renew or extend contract be common despite the bill passage renter who can not afford extortionate rent hike will continue to have no alternative but to move fall into debt or face eviction there be real danger that landlord will continue to evict tenant or threaten they with eviction at will with unfair rent increase take the place of section eviction the bill provision to allow renter the right to appeal to tribunal that can determine market rate increase be insufficient by definition market rate be already unaffordable for many renter only cap rent increase will give renter genuine security in their home and stop landlord threaten vulnerable people with unaffordable rent hike or homelessness beyond security the big issue most renter face be the fast grow cost of have home to live in the amount of income that family in this country be lose to rent be rapidly become unsustainable nearly two third of work renter in england struggle to afford their rent accord to recent research by shelter rent produce almost zero social benefit it take money away from working class people who could otherwise spend it in their community and it pass that money to property owner what simple more effective way could there be to ease the cost of live crisis for million of people and put money back in their pocket than by limit their large outgoing rent stabilisation measure be common across europe in france the annual increase be limit to meanwhile in england rent have be rise fast than wage for well over year and the average annual increase report in december be cap on rent increase have the support of housing charity renter organisation and major union it also have strong public support when it come to the housing crisis we must keep all option on the table and hope the government will back these change to the bill ultimately we need to increase the supply of council housing at affordable rent in my constituency of poole we have some of the high rent relative to wage in the country change therefore can not come soon enough for those renter and this bill be welcome first step will address new clause to and amendment and which deal with rent control before do so should say that take particular interest in new clause table by the hon member for bristol central carla denyer which have sign chair an unpaid carer group and there be real concern that even where renter have an assessment do for aid and adaptation they can not enforce it on their landlord which leave they vulnerable they then have no choice but to move with all the disruption that involve particularly if they be care for someone with significant disability do not think that this be contentious issue and hope the minister will assure the hon member for bristol central that there can be further dialogue as the bill go to the house of lords if we have that dialogue think we can find something that will satisfy all concerned to give strength to those with disability and those care for they while satisfy the government about the ramification of an amendment of this nature if we can get that form of word would urge the hon member not to press her amendment to vote if it be vote down it would send message to the lords that the commons do not support it whereas think there be support in this house but not necessarily for this form of word sometimes it be good not to snatch defeat from the jaw of victory think we might have something here but will leave that to the hon member judgment briefly on rent control my hon friend the member for ealing southall deirdre costigan mention her constituency mine be next door and represent working class multicultural community where we have be go through housing crisis for at least the last decade have live there for year and the crisis be on scale that we have never see before cause as other have say by the selling off of our council house the irony here be that the same council house that have be put into the hand of private landlord be now be rent back at very high rent to house the homeless people the council be place in they with the government policy of increase housing supply and the million new home we be about to build hope that large number of those home will be social or council housing as result we can start to tackle the housing crisis in my constituency in the meantime however we will be dependent on the private rent sector the only reason be speak be the representation have have from constituent know that the bill be come up have also work with acorn the renters reform coalition and various other agency those constituent have say can you try to at least get across the plight we be face at the moment that plight be dependent to be honest on landlord who be rip they off the concept of price gouging be emerge in all our discussion about the economy well here be an element of price gouging with private rent landlord particularly in london we have see profit ratio of anything between and the argument be make that we can have tribunal system people can go to the tribunal which will determine thing on the basis of the market rent in fact the market rent be determine by what be almost an oligopoly of landlord in particular area who maintain high rent because they want to maximise profit the housing condition in the private rent sector in my constituency be in some instance absolutely appalling if tenant complain that be when the section come in indeed tenant be terrify of complain because if they get evict they probably face high rent elsewhere that be why we need comprehensive system of rent control do not see any other solution and hope that although the government will not accept the amendment today we can have dialogue that way maybe between now and the bill passage through the lords or in future legislation we can address the issue of rent control the argument be very simple we just want system where rent be link to wage or inflation that way people can not be rip off by high rent increase that be not rocket science be old enough to remember when we have rent control with local rent officer who the local authority would send round they would determine fair rent and also what be fair in term of wage and income for any future rental level rent control operate across europe and it have not have an impact on the supply of private rent housing elsewhere it be system that could be readily introduce worry that if we do not do that now we will be back here in couple of year time with the same problem although we want to build new home at speed we will still be dependent on the private rent sector and on some but not all landlord we have good landlord as well who be basically profiteer at the expense of homeless people turn to my final point the issue of develop tribunal system be raise by the right hon member for islington north jeremy corbyn the tribunal system need to ensure that people be properly represent and have time to take on the system most of we with trade union background will have deal with employment tribunal over the year they can be effective but the only reason for that be that we have the might and organisation of the trade union movement we do not have that in the rental sector to represent tenant although welcome the idea that we will have thorough tribunal system that be effective in deal with hard case it be not realistic to expect tenant in my constituency to utilise that without the resource to do so particularly as we have lose lot of our advice agency as result of austerity that be why we will need to come back and discuss again the solution of rent control which my hon friend the member for liverpool wavertree paula barker bring forward good quality secure and decent rental should not be too much to ask and thank those landlord who do provide that in my city and beyond welcome the government amendment to this detailed bill which will help resident in portsmouth north to rent home that be both secure and decent this new fair system include an end to excessive up front cost huge deposit and advance rent it will also prevent student from feel pressured to sign up to an agreement very early in their term and protect bereaved family by limit guarantee liability in the event of the death of family member or tenant the change along with the expansion to the decent home standard be necessary and part of significant package of reform behind each one of these issue be human face and heartbreaking story the reform will reverse the environment of uncertainty and fear in the past tenant fear of raise issue have destabilise family and community and contribute to the broad housing crisis this be no more starkly see that in section no fault eviction which be mention my hon friend the member for worsley and eccles michael wheeler as teacher too have see distraught kid who have be evict from their home as result of section notice wish to share the story of two of my constituent sally and rachel sally be student nurse in receipt of universal credit with child with special educational need and disability she have privately rent her home for year the landlord have neglect the property significantly during this time and the house have have extensive issue with mould leak and water damage despite that sally want to stay her landlord decide that it would be easy simply to evict she through section notice in order to carry out the extensive repair that need to be do to the house leave she and her son homeless the callous use of section notice to displace family in order to more conveniently perform repair that should have already be do shock rachel be mum in portsmouth north with four child two of whom have send she be give section notice by her private landlord before christmas and ask to leave on january no fault eviction with no reason the cruelty of the timing be shocking have the previous government enact their manifesto rachel would not be in this situation she have since be inform by the council that she could be wait for five or six year for property that meet her need and she be now face live in costly temporary accommodation that will not meet her child need in addition the housing team at the council have warn she that as too few house have be build in the city over the past decade she may be house in different area away from her child school away from her support network and away from her job the bill finally remove section no fault eviction and today amendment will strengthen the fairness of the market for wide set of tenant on behalf of all the sallys and rachels wish to acknowledge the work of this government in their commitment to rebalance the relationship between landlord and tenant and to produce change that be pro market pro tenant and pro community the abolition of section notice and the fair change that we need can not come soon enough it be too late for some people but this bill and its provision will ensure that people in portsmouth and across the country have access to good quality and fair housing system there can be few place in our country that need this bill more than bournemouth east total of of household in my constituency be in private rent accommodation which be considerably more than the national average of in boscombe west ward be private renting and in east cliff where live it be rent go up in bournemouth christchurch and poole by in the year to october which be high than the national average some of respondent to shelter dorset survey in bcp say that they be struggle to pay their rent as somebody who use to lead mental health charity know the link between health outcome poor mental health and poor rented accommodation for everybody live in poor rented accommodation in bournemouth east know there will be significant effect on health outcome want to talk briefly about the abolition of no fault eviction and bring my constituent into the debate my constituent carolaine from boscombe have live in overcrowded private rent housing with her two child with special educational need and disability for year before be give section be force to move at short notice have significantly negatively affect her mental health the labour government abolition of so call no fault eviction in the bill will go long way to give tenant like carolaine great security also welcome decent home standard now be apply to the private rent sector my constituent naomi from boscombe recently contact about the repeat incidence of mould in her one bedroom rent flat which she share with her partner and their week old baby the flat also have dangerous loose floorboard leak shower and fire door that do not close her landlord continue to ignore her email the provision in the bill that apply the decent home standard to the private rent sector will give renter like naomi safe well value home and remove the blight of poor quality home from our community my hon friend be make an excellent speech may raise the case of one of my constituent he be dad with young daughter and he have chronic illness not only do he have many unfair deduction to his deposit at the end of his tenancy but the landlord refuse to fix the shower because they claim it be some other sort of device what disgrace do my hon friend agree that we need to get through that division lobby fight for our constituent and reform renter right once and for all never disagree with my hon friend and his point show why we need the bill welcome the bill protection against unreasonable rent rise and rental bidding my disabled constituent tracey also from boscombe get in contact with about how substantial hike in her rent act as an effective eviction as she be unable to pay despite look to use her personal independence payment towards her rent she be force to look for alternative accommodation and we all know how difficult that be in the private rent sector for people with disability welcome the protection in the bill against unreasonable rent rise because they will provide much need security for renter like tracey who struggle to find appropriate accommodation in the rented sector to meet their need also welcome the introduction of new ombudsman service which will provide quick fair impartial and bind resolution for tenant complaint about their landlord bring tenant landlord complaint resolution on par with establish redress practice for tenant in social housing or consumer of property agent service welcome the move to make it illegal for landlord to discriminate against tenant in receipt of housing benefit or other benefit or with child when choose to let their property that particularly affect james in my constituency who be homeless and can not secure private rent housing because he be in receipt of benefit all of we who hold constituency surgery week in week out will know these story all of we have campaign for well renter right because we have hear those story on the doorstep and commend the government for bring forward the bill at such an early stage in this parliament we must of course make the point that not all landlord be bad but the bill be important because it weed out those bad landlord so that the good landlord those who care about their tenant and who provide an important duty to the housing market can continue to have good reputation and so the overall market continue to have that good reputation commend the bill and the ministerial team for bring it forward be thrilled that renter in bournemouth and across britain will finally after many year of delay get the renter right they deserve no that they be entitle to let begin by thank all hon member for their contribution it have be thoughtful and good natured debate and while there be many genuine point of difference and emphasis there be consensus across the house that reform of the private rent sector be long overdue and must be take forward in the time have available to will respond to number of the amendment and key argument in his contribution the shadow minister the hon member for ruislip northwood and pinner david simmonds suggest that government new clause and risk lock out of the rental market those renter who be on the financial margin and fetter landlord and tenant come to fair agreement on tenancy in the assured regime that we be introduce gently say to he that he seriously downplay the imbalance between landlord and tenant and the fact that require multiple month of rent from tenant in advance when agree tenancy be unfair place considerable strain on tenant and can exclude some people and family from rent altogether landlords will continue to be able to take hold deposit of up to one week tenancy deposit of five or six week rent and up to one month rent in advance before tenancy have begin they will also be free to undertake the necessary referencing and affordability check to give they confidence that tenancy be sustainable for all party if and when they be not satisfied by the outcome of pre tenancy check option be available to tenant and landlord to ensure that rent in advance need not be use request guarantor or engage in landlord insurance for example hope that provide the shadow minister with degree of reassurance on that point the shadow minister table number of amendment several of which we debate in detail in committee with regard to amendment and restate the argument that make in committee fix term mean that tenant be lock into tenancy agreement without the freedom to move should their personal circumstance change and compel tenant to pay rent regardless of whether property be fit to live in reduce the incentive for unscrupulous landlord to complete repair for that reason the government remain firmly of the view that there be no place whatsoever for fix term of any kind in the new tenancy regime that the bill introduce number of hon member refer to problem with short term let the government be cognisant of the impact that excessive concentration of short term let can have on the affordability and availability of local housing and the sustainability of local community we be committed to monitor that issue and as the liberal democrat spokesperson the hon member for taunton and wellington gideon amos know we be explore what further power local authority need to bear down on it however put an arbitrary deadline in law as new clause would do be not the way to proceed be grateful to the minister for his response on that issue will he comment on the question of use class order for second home the hon gentleman tempt to engage in an entirely different debate be more than happy to update he at the appropriate time with all the measure that the government will take forward in response to that issue he can be assure however that we be give it serious attention and this will not be case of the government kick something into the long grass the government be clear that we will not delay on give renter the long term security right and protection that they deserve by make the necessary and long overdue transformation of the sector contingent on broad and undefined assessment of the possession process as new clause and amendment propose the shadow minister know that fully agree with he that court readiness be essential to the successful operation of the new system that be why my official and be work closely with the minister for courts and legal services and her team to ensure that the courts and tribunals service be ready when the new tenancy system be bring into force the shadow minister also press the government to place in the bill legal requirement to publish an annual review of its impact on the availability of home he will know that the government have publish green rat impact assessment we will of course closely monitor the impact of the bill on the housing market but set an arbitrary deadline in law for do so would we believe detract from that work although do not begrudge he for table new clause to make that point he will know that no government could accept such an amendment the liberal democrat spokesperson the hon member for taunton and wellington and several member of his party raise the issue of military accommodation and table amendment there be no dispute about that amendment objective namely to ensure that all service accommodation equal or exceed the decent home standard the government have make that commitment where we do disagree be on whether the approach that we be take in the bill be appropriate for the unique circumstance surround ministry of defence accommodation we do not believe that it be for various reason that we discuss at length in committee include the problem that local authority have in inspect accommodation that be behind the wire on sensitive mod basis as the hon gentleman be aware the ministry of defence be commit to review its decent home plus standard for accommodation with the aim of improve the standard of sfa across the estate where it need improvement as part of its long term strategy for service accommodation that review will be inform by my department work on housing standard include our review of the content of the dhs which ministers in the ministry of defence be commit to align with the ministry of defence will provide further information on the review of its target early in the minister be generous in give way on the question of accommodation behind the wire to clarify amendment deal with service family accommodation service family accommodation be generally not behind the wire it be on the street where council can access it that be only one of the issue as the hon gentleman know we debate many other in committee appreciate that there be principled disagreement on this point we share his objective but we think that there be different and more sensible way to go about meet it address service accommodation through this bill be not the way to proceed will the minister give way will happily and then will make some progress be very grateful to the minister appreciate the time constraint that he face the critical question be when those in our community who live in service accommodation can expect it to reach the standard that he and his colleague intend to set out appreciate the co operation with defence ministers but can the minister give we date by which that standard will be in place be sympathetic to the hon gentleman question and his desire for that information but it be not for to give date from the dispatch box today my colleague in the ministry of defence will provide further information on the review of that target standard early this year the liberal democrat spokesman the hon member for taunton and wellington along with my hon friend the member for liverpool wavertree paula barker and the hon member for bristol central carla denyer speak in support of their respective amendment to introduce form of rent control assure each of those member that entirely understand their concern about the affordability of rent generally and specifically the potential for retaliatory no fault economic eviction once section eviction be do away with unscrupulous landlord will no doubt attempt to evict tenant who assert their right by mean of extortionate rent rise however as we debate extensively in committee the government sincerely believe that the introduction of rent control in the private rented sector could harm tenant as well as landlord by reduce supply and discourage investment while fully appreciate that there be broad spectrum of regulation that fall under the title of rent control there be as we debate at length in committee sufficient international evidence from country such as sweden and germany city such as san francisco and ontario and the scottish experience since to attest to the potential detrimental impact of rent control for that reason we believe that we should proceed on the basis of the protection that the bill provide against unreasonable within tenancy rent rise as well as wide action to improve affordability not least support for the growth of the build to rent sector my hon friend the member for liverpool wavertree also table new clause which would place duty on the secretary of state to conduct review of the tenancy deposit protection scheme and requirement the contract govern those scheme be due to end next year and their re procurement provide an opportunity for the department to review their objective and how they operate be more than happy to engage with my hon friend on that process on that basis ask she to not divide the house on her new clause be also more than happy to ensure that she be closely involve in the development of the prs database we believe that there be good reason for the detail relate to that database to be lay out in secondary legislation rather than put in the bill as her amendment stipulate however it be our clear expectation that the database will capture key information about landlord and we recognise that there may be clear benefit in use it to collect wide range of information as her amendment suggest my hon friend also table new clause which would require local authority if request to pay or guarantee the tenancy deposit of care leaver seek to access the private rent sector be of the view that local authority rather than central government be well place to assess the good way of support care leaver in their area reassure my hon friend that while local authority maintain their ability to support care leaver in their area the government be commit to put in place the support that local government need to do so effectively my hon friend the member for leeds central and headingley alex sobel make strong case for new clause on act to limit guarantor appreciate fully that obtain guarantor can be difficult for some prospective tenant and understand the reasoning behind his amendment however be also mindful that in some instance the use of guarantor can provide good landlord with the assurance necessary to let their property to tenant who may otherwise find it difficult to access private rent accommodation for example there be those with poor credit history the kind of tenant who the shadow minister worry our rent in advance amendment will harm have consider this issue in great detail ultimately conclude that limit guarantor could inadvertently make life more difficult for certain type of renter that say will keep the matter under review and be more than happy to engage in dialogue with my hon friend about this in the week and month to come several opposition members mention new clause in the name of the hon member for st albans daisy cooper the government be clear that all landlord must keep their property in fit state and that there need to be robust route of redress when they do not however tenant can already take their landlord to court if their home be unfit for human habitation and if the court find that landlord have not meet their obligation they can award compensation as well as require landlord to carry out repair for that reason while agree entirely with the objective believe that the hon lady amendment be unnecessary will briefly refer to two amendment on the amendment paper that be not speak to by the members who table they my hon friend the member for nottingham east nadia whittome rightly call for protection from discrimination for renter who require home adaptation the rental discrimination provision in the bill be specifically design to protect victim of discrimination who may not be eligible to make case under the equality act such as those who have child or be in receipt of benefit people with disability be already afford protection from discrimination relate to the provision of housing or service under the act for that reason we do not believe her new clause be warrant but be more than happy to discuss the matter with she outside the chamber my hon friend the member for warrington north charlotte nichols table amendment to make rent repayment order available for initial failure to be member of the prs landlord ombudsman or to register with the prs database she will recognise that we have significantly strengthen the rro provision in the previous government renters reform bill however take the view that it would be inappropriate to extend rent repayment order to non criminal breach of the kind that her amendment cover instead local authority will be able to issue civil penalty for the initial failure in question with the possibility of high financial penalty and rro if landlord fail to sign up have be fin finally will mention the amendment relate to home adaptation both new clause in the name of the hon member for bristol central and new clause in the name of the hon member for taunton and wellington both amendment seek to require prs landlord to permit home disability adaptation for assured tenant when these have be recommend in local authority home assessment the hon member for bristol central table the same amendment in committee and as we discuss then the equality act already provide that landlord can not unreasonably refuse request for reasonable adjustment to disabled person home as say in committee measure already in this bill will improve the situation for disabled renter who request home adaptation the abolition of section notice will remove the threat of retaliatory eviction empower tenant to request the home adaptation they need and to complain if their request be unreasonably refuse in addition we be establish the new prs ombudsman which will have strong power to put thing right for tenant where their landlord have fail to resolve legitimate complaint must say candidly to the hon lady that remain somewhat unconvinced that these amendment be the way to address this absolutely legitimate issue recognise the problem she identify and for that reason the government will not be able to accept they however can give she the assurance that we will commit to continue to consider what more we may need to do to ensure that request for reasonable adjustment can not be unreasonably refuse include those recommend by local authority home assessment be more happy to engage with member across the house and to meet she the hon member for taunton and wellington and other member who have concern on the subject to discuss her amendment and the problem generally in more detail hope that on that basis she will consider not press her new clause to vote if the minister can confirm that the cross party meeting will include the chair of the housing communities and local government committee and that it will take place before the bill go to the lords will be happy to withdraw my new clause will happily give the hon member that assurance and be more than happy to ensure that my hon friend the chair of the committee attend as well as any other member with an interest in this issue it be important and understand the problem that the hon member outline there be reason why we do not think the new clause be necessarily the good way to approach the issue but be more than happy to have dialogue on that point in conclusion today we be make target amendment that aim to ensure that the bill operate as intend in many case we think that the amendment push by hon member be unnecessary because we think that the bill strike the right balance between the interest of landlord and those of tenant on that basis hope the whole house can get behind the bill this evening question put and agree to new clause accordingly read second time and add to the bill new clause prohibition of rent in advance before lease enter into schedule to the

state of affair be why renter have be demand change for many year and be extremely proud that this government have act so early in the parliament to deliver it the renters rights bill will deliver on

have secure this debate on this important topic for my constituent and to the minister for her attendance be also delighted to see the hon member for slough mr dhesi in his place as constituency neighbour albeit from different party we have come together to work closely on this issue for the good of our constituent want to talk about the lack of secondary school educational provision available to my constituent in south buckinghamshire particularly in the beautiful village of burnham and the surround area burnham be grow and thriving village that be part of both buckinghamshire and slough it be unique place which be why the debate will focus on this topic burnham be place where family like to settle for its beauty community and wonderful transport link it be also place where child must travel long distance at huge cost to their family to attend comprehensive secondary school burnham be the only community in buckinghamshire that lack nearby secondary school alongside its grammar school that situation be become increasingly intolerable and hope the minister will join and the hon member for slough in our joint effort to bring about change let start with short history of the lack of school provision in before become the member of parliament for beaconsfield the department for education close the burnham act academy co educational non selective school for to year old that follow several change and challenge ofsted report at one time the school have serve more than pupil as the school be fail parent be force to find alternative for the sake of their child and roll number begin to fall make the school potentially unviable instead of serious effort be make to turn the school around it be allow to fail that closure be serious mistake congratulate the hon member on secure this debate and thank she for her kind word it be pleasure to join she recently at burnham grammar school to meet activist campaign for new school as she have explain it be mistake for the government and buckinghamshire council in to close the non selective co educational secondary school obviously the number must stack up but do she agree that it be vital to recognise the importance of child receive good quality local school education be it not unfair for my slough constituent and her to have to travel great distance at great expense just to get that education due consideration should be give to that when determine whether new school be require in burnham the way that the hon member and have be work cross party be an example of how to move forward past council boundary just point out to the minister that burnham be large town that historically be its own entity but uniquely be now part of two local authority the number be often look at through the lens of one local authority or the other but we need to combine those two work together and submit joint local authority bid to the department for education that be the way to demonstrate the number and get the secondary school provision we need commend the hon lady on bring forward this debate do she not agree that by put secondary school out of reach of local population we close the door to character building to skill learning and to socially imperative after school programme that must all be weigh when consider educational provision because if you close school you lose generation of young people thank the hon member for always make such excellent contribution to every adjournment debate he be true champion for back benchers the people who lose out in the school closure be the young people of burnham and the surround area move forward we want to see that problem rectify since the young people of burnham who be not in selective education find themselves catch in excessively long journey to school in maidenhead and other part of buckinghamshire and slough as my friend the hon member for slough so eloquently point out it be unfair for our resident and it be have significant effect on their mental health physical wellbeing and finance the situation be absurd and almost intolerable we have site that house secondary school up until and it be now host the occasional netflix filming meanwhile young people waste hour travel to school the situation need to change be equally robust in challenge our previous schools minister and spend much time speak to nick gibb in the tea room be sure that the hon member for slough can follow in my footstep and find the current minister in the tea room to continue to press the point formally and informally will she consider meet and he jointly after the debate so that we can take this issue forward pay tribute to the campaign group for burnham secondary school since my election in december have be pleased to work alongside the group and local family to try to right this wrong they be at the epicentre of what make community campaign group so inspiring they be totally dedicated to make their community well thank the local councillor parish councillor and the hon member for work together to put the need of our resident first let set out why the case for secondary school in burnham be clear compelling and urgent we know that education be the single silver bullet that can determine the life chance of young people but we be place an enormous barrier in the way of the young people of burnham and south buckinghamshire long journey be impact their mental and physical health and place they at high risk of educational disengagement we also know that south buckinghamshire be significantly underserve in special educational need and disability provision just before the election be delighted by the department for education announcement of new send school for buckinghamshire hope that the minister will recommit to that school tonight and support my call for it to be place in south buckinghamshire it would be for the whole county but would love to see it in south buckinghamshire reopened burnham secondary school would represent perfect opportunity to provide not only to year old with non selective education but increase send provision and thriving sixth form my hon friend be make an excellent speech about educational need in her constituency do she know of the work do by the london borough of hillingdon in the village of harefield in my constituency where as part of multi academy trust an under utilise secondary school have slightly reduce in size and the site be now dual use with both secondary mainstream comprehensive education and brand new send school at the same location thank my hon friend for that excellent intervention that example be the gold standard of what we would like to do to ensure that there be send provision and comprehensive school provision in our area as we move forward find dual use for those facility really be the way forward with volunteer we be try to look at every option work across party and across local authority to ensure that we find solution that work for all of our resident hopefully follow in the footstep of hillingdon one of the frustration that and the campaign group have face be the loop of accountability avoidance we be on the border of many local authority and we border london the provision for our student be different from london but because we be just outside london that endless accountability loop be often difficult to close the department say that it be for local authority to make the case but oftentime it seem that they be not work together for the collective demand because of their individual legal accountability that be despite the practical reality that slough and burnham and all of buckinghamshire border each other and the two local primary school be in close proximity to the site at burnham grammar school this be prove by the fact that half the pupil be from slough our campaign group receive reply from freedom of information request which say any project to try to evidence demand to reopen new school on the burnham site should not include pupil attend in slough regardless of how close the school may be to buckinghamshire that be bureaucracy triumph over common sense the campaign group and have take it upon ourselves to look at the datum and make the case because it seem that no one else will thank the hon member for slough for join we in that and try to work together proactively to bring forth evidence from both local authority of the demand and need of pupil for the secondary school even before turn to housing expansion they can make the case for minimum of five form of entry from the local primary school we also know that beech learning and development trust which deliver burnham grammar school could take on burnham secondary school within its umbrella trust we have site for school we have demand across both local authority boundary and we have trust able to take on the school all we lack be the will of the educational establishment in south buckinghamshire we now have significant housing target on our way as separate point if something be to be build on the green belt be in no doubt that will oppose it tooth and nail but support the case for more housing in the right location and with the right infrastructure burnham and the surround area be grow as be slough many people want to move to both area because of their excellent transport link and the ability to come into london our area population be grow and the housing demand mean that the population will continue to increase buckinghamshire have one of the high housing demand put on it more so than any other local authority so to make the case we will need more provision of place for student because central government demand mean that we will be build more house in the county that simply strengthen our argument for increase educational provision we will not have the infrastructure in place to support the new housing that central government will ask we to build we also have the elizabeth line which be attract commuter family to the area we face more housing coming but without the infrastructure of new school to support the area it be time to make sure that the secondary school be there and ready to support demand from our resident it be time for the education system to come together to solve this problem in the same way that the hon member for slough and have put aside party political difference in order to work together for the good of our community so the education system need to put aside artificial boundary and work together it need leadership from ministers and the department for education to bring local authority together to support the proper analysis of datum across local authority boundary urge the minister to join the hon member for slough and the local community to help make new secondary school for burnham south buckinghamshire and slough reality congratulate the hon member for beaconsfield joy morrissey on secure this important debate she have be champion for child in south buckinghamshire and for every child to secure school place that allow they to achieve and thrive this government recognise how important it be that every child get great education at good school in their area we work closely with our local authority colleague to achieve that include in buckinghamshire local authority include in buckinghamshire have statutory duty to ensure that there be sufficient school place for child in their area as the hon lady reference to support local authority to deliver on that statutory duty the department provide capital funding through the basic need grant for mainstream school place funding be base on local authority own pupil forecast and school capacity datum they also receive the high need provision capital allocation to invest in place for child and young people with special educational need or who require alternative provision the hon lady mention that specifically and will come to it shortly the department engage with local authority on regular basis to review their plan for create additional primary and secondary school place and to consider alternative where necessary when local authority experience difficulty the department offer support and advice include through the pupil place planning adviser hope the hon lady find it reassure that all that support be in place at local authority level buckinghamshire be forecast to have an increase surplus of primary place especially in the year of entry reception and in key stage there be however some area of primary place pressure include at gerrards cross and the chalfonts in the south of the county at secondary phase buckinghamshire be forecast to have small slightly decline surplus however in common with the primary phase underlie the local authority wide picture there be variation in place pressure the academically selective element of secondary education in buckinghamshire add an additional element of complexity in place planning as do cross border movement into school in neighbour local authority which the hon lady and my hon friend the member for slough mr dhesi reference nearly billion have be announce to support local authority to create the mainstream school place need over the current and next two academic year up to and include the academic year begin september the funding be not ringfence subject to the condition set out in the publish grant determination letter and nor be it time bind mean that local authority be free to use it to well meet their local priority they can use it to fund place in new school or through expansion of exist school and they can work with any school in their local area include academy and free school we have hugely increase population in slough and south bucks as well as high need for send provision just want to ascertain whether the minister and her department will factor those consideration into their determination over new school in burnham on the boundary of slough and south bucks to ensure that the right decision be reach for new school my hon friend raise some important point both of which be factor that the buckinghamshire and slough local authority where relevant will have to take into consideration when determine how to use their allocation buckinghamshire council have be allocate just below million to support the provision of the new mainstream school place that it feel it will need over the current and next two academic year up to and include september we have also announce million in high need capital for to support child and young people with special educational need and disability or who require alternative provision and we will confirm the specific local authority allocation later in the spring the important point be that this new funding can be use to adapt classroom to make they more accessible for child with special educational need it can be use to create specialist facility within mainstream school that could deliver more intensive support to adapt they to meet pupil need alongside continue to provide place to support the pupil in special school with the most complex need will the minister commit to work with colleague in the ministry of housing communities and local government to review the impact of home to school transport rule on the situation in hillingdon there be around vacancy rate due to fall pupil number all london borough contribute to transport for london and therefore transport to school on london public transport be free however if buckinghamshire wish to take advantage of those vacancy bring those child to school in hillingdon would be general fund cost to council tax payer clearly in efficiently provide those place it may well be that by look at those cross border transport issue we could produce beneficial outcome for my constituency neighbour my hon friend the member for beaconsfield joy morrissey and for the school that would thereby benefit from additional pupil the hon gentleman raise an import point which be something the department be very focused on indeed we need to work with local authority to deliver on that the aim of the department home to school travel policy be to ensure that no child be prevent from access education because of lack of transport local authority be require to arrange free travel for child of compulsory school age who attend their near school but can not walk there because of the distance or because of special educational need disability or mobility problem or because the route be not safe there be also additional right to free travel for low income household to ensure that they can exercise school choice however recognise the challenge that the hon gentleman raise it relate to the investment that we would like to see in mainstream provision indeed it be why he jump up as be talk about this to make it more suitable and to adapt it where necessary in order to have much great inclusion of child with special educational need and disability so that they can be educate in their local area wherever possible with their peer that will ensure well outcome for those child but it will also tackle some of the grow challenge that he quite rightly identify with school transport the hon member for beaconsfield mention specific request for confirmation on local special school application she tempt to get ahead of announcement that will be make in due course they be under consideration where child have highly complex need it be obviously important that we have those specialist school place available in the right place for the child who need they we be committed to ensure that all school co operate with their local authority on school admission and place plan to ensure there be sufficient school place where they be need school and academy trust be expect to work collaboratively and constructively with local authority and other key partner on place planning we recently reinforce that expectation through the revised make significant change to an academy guidance to strengthen it far we be legislate to require all school and local authority to co operate on admission and place planning this new duty will aim to foster great co operation between school and local authority in these important area as well as provide backstop for address serious failure when co operation be simply not happen we be also legislate to make change to the legal framework for open new school we will end the legal presumption that they should be academy in favour of prioritise any local offer that meet the need of child and family allow proposal for other type of school to be put forward where new school be need include proposal from local authority themselves these change well align local authority responsibility to secure sufficient school place with their ability to open new school the government be entirely focused on the quality of education and experience that child be receive at school rather than the name above the door all school have an important role to play in drive high and rise standard so that every child can thrive and indeed that will help local authority to make the decision that be right for the child in their area we want all child to be able to attend high quality school of their parent choice whenever possible in of child in buckinghamshire be offer place at one of their parent or carer top three preferred primary school and just over nine out of an offer of their first preference at the secondary phase of pupil in buckinghamshire receive an offer at one of their parent or carer top three preferred school with about three an offer of their first preference thank the hon member for beaconsfield for bring this matter to the house attention and thank the other member who contribute to the debate it be obviously important for child to be able to gain access to school place ideally in their local community that will enable they to achieve and thrive appreciate the case that the hon lady have make but it be clearly to buckinghamshire council that the case must be make the government will continue to work with our local authority colleague who have statutory duty to ensure that enough mainstream school place be available that include provide fund through the basic need grant and continue support through our pupil place planning adviser and introduce new legislation require all school and local authority to co operate on admission and place planning so that every child in every community can have good local school question put and agree to house adjourn
