of these clause to include scotland will be interpret what conversation have take place between my hon friend scotland lord advocate and the scottish government have take legal advice from government official to ensure that devolution be respect at every stage in proceeding where legislation that affect other jurisdiction need to be amend those conversation have already start and will continue will the hon lady give way no be go to make some progress if that be okay the substance that would be use would not be new substance as we know assist dying be available in many other jurisdiction and there be substance that have be use safely and in some case for many year their safety and efficacy have be prove around the world but they do need to be treat differently which be the purpose of new clause will the hon lady give way will the hon lady give way be go to make some progress however it be most likely that these product be already license for other purpose they could well be regulate through the medicines and healthcare product regulatory agency and within the human medicines regulations for the purpose of the bill but it be important that time be give will my hon friend give way will as an operating department practitioner with more than year of experience emphasise that control and administer drug be already key part of every healthcare professional practice medicine management be at the front and centre of everything we do when handle drug do my hon friend agree that the safeguard add to this bill along with the exist framework be more than adequate to deal with this thank my hon friend for share her expertise along with other colleague with medical background who have work with on this amendment rise give what you have say mr speaker will make some progress interruption lot of members wish to speak today now turn to new clause and amendment the new clause impose duty to make regulation prohibit advertising of service relate to voluntary assist dying this issue be discuss in committee follow an amendment table by the hon member for west worcestershire dame harriett baldwin it be propose that there should be no advertising of assist die service agree and there be consensus on that in the committee there be some issue with the previous amendment workability so give commitment to return to the matter on report hence the inclusion of this new clause amendment provide that regulation under new clause would be subject to the affirmative procedure provide parliamentary oversight on the evidential basis on page of today edition of the times there be story about gentleman who be bear in south africa and live in australia he have come to london this week for this particular bill in order to give his story he be diagnose with pancreatic cancer and tell he have only two week to live he live for three year and one month and he be still live there be grow evidential basis he say that he be never afraid to die but he say that he be afraid of the process of die and the hon lady be the initiator of that will she acknowledge the evidential basis and the importance of this subject do she realise that the evidential basis against this bill be grow thank the hon gentleman for the intervention although be not sure that it be relevant to the banning of advertising for assisted die service which will try to stay focused on will the hon lady give way be afraid that be go to have to make some progress base on the number of member who wish to speak today thank the hon member for west worcestershire and the hon member for reigate rebecca paul for work with on amendment and be very pleased that they support it will the hon lady give way will not sorry new clause and amendment make change to the coroners and justice act that the bill would necessitate they would insert new clause into the act to provide that death that occur in accordance with the bill will be certify by an attend practitioner and medical examiner and will not be subject to coronial investigation will the hon lady give way be afraid not coroner investigate suspicious or violent death or situation in which the cause of death be unknown assisted death would not fall into these category and there would therefore be no need for default coronial investigation this will ensure that any unnecessary delay and distress for bereaved family be avoid these be not unexpected death sadly they be inevitable will my hon friend give way will not be afraid it be the manner and timing of their death about which the patient will make legal inform choice have be thoroughly assess as professor aneez esmail have say can not think of any death that would be the subject of great scrutiny in advance of the person die than an assisted death the process far exceed the level of safeguarding that be in place for many of the death that be at present routinely review by medical examiner and not refer to coroner of course anyone can report death include an assisted death to the coroner or indeed to the police if they have any concern that it be not carry out in accordance with the act and if any offence have be commit they will be investigate subsection of new clause require that the medical certificate of cause of death must state the death as an assisted death but it must also record the illness or disease that cause the person to be terminally ill and enable they to receive assistance under the act this be really important for datum collection and monitoring in jurisdiction with similar legislation around of patient have some form of cancer and the new clause would ensure that datum be collect not only in relation to how many people access assisted dying but in relation to the terminal illness that make they eligible now turn to new clause which relate to the guidance about the operation of the act include with respect to devolution put simply new clause ensure that the right rule and responsibility sit with the right people first it place the obligation to issue guidance with the secretary of state secondly it enable welsh ministers to issue guidance on devolve matter the secretary of state must consult the chief medical officer in order to have the benefit of their expertise which be also really important new clause also add provision that ensure that the secretary of state must consult people with learn disability and people with protect characteristic which include disability race religion and belief will my hon friend give way be go to make some progress be afraid the secretary of state must also consult provider of health and care service include palliative and end of life care be really pleased that hospice uk be support this amendment it be very important that those voice be hear the secretary of state can also consult anyone else they feel to be appropriate create flexible and holistic approach turn to devolution this long overdue reform would apply to england and wales which share criminal justice system health be devolved matter of course and have recognise from the outset that the legislation must respect devolution be fully commit to observe the same convention that the government would if this be government bill have work with uk government official to ensure that the right step be take at the right time by the right people have engage with colleague in the welsh government meet the welsh health minister in cardiff and there have be ongoing detailed discussion between the two team of government official to ensure the workability of the legislation in both jurisdiction in line with the devolution settlement amendment to also ensure that the devolution settlement be respect and adhere to thank the right hon member for dwyfor meirionnydd liz saville roberts and the hon member for chesham and amersham sarah green not only for their diligent work on the bill committee but for work with on the amendment in relation to wales and thank the welsh government for their guidance and support hope that colleague across the house can support these new clause and amendment now turn to new clause which make specific provision about the use of the welsh language the conversation that happen at the end of person life be extremely personal and should be handle with the utmost sensitivity it be very important that they be conduct in the good interest of the patient and big part of that be use clear communication in this respect language matter so if patient in wales have welsh as their first or preferred language all effort should be make to ensure they can communicate with voluntary assist die service in welsh commit to this in committee and have make good on that commitment turn to amendment and as with any bill it be important that the amend legislation secure overall coherence with the statute book as such the clause relate to medicine advertising and employment protection amend or confer power to amend other legislation that currently extend to part of the uk of course this do not mean the provision of assist dying but for example they extend the prohibition on advertising to the whole of the uk and apply the employment protection in the bill to scotland that be in line with the guidance have receive from legal expert and as such hope all colleague can support these amendment if the bill pass will if necessary work with other devolved administration in the same way as have work with the welsh government to ensure that devolution be respect that conclude the explanation of the amendment table in my name many colleague be keen to speak so be not go to comment on all the amendment in the group will just make two comment about amendment that be not in my name and allow other people plenty of time to speak amendment table by my hon friend the member for newcastle under lyme adam jogee would not only try to remove the backstop for the provision of assist dying in england but create number of other issue in relation to commencement if parliament choose to give this choice to terminally ill people there can not be clause in the bill that would prevent that from be available as soon as it be safe and practicable but the amendment would remove the four year backstop it would also prevent the appointment of the voluntary assist die commissioner and create potential commencement gap between england and wales give that have be strongly advise that the amendment would create serious workability issue urge colleague who want an operable bill to join in reject the amendment to finish be pleased to support amendment table by the hon member for twickenham munira wilson thank she for her engagement with the bill and the amendment which would require the secretary of state to prepare and publish an assessment of the availability quality and distribution of palliative and end of life care as part of the first report on the implementation of the act mirror the assessment already require as part of the five year review although the bill seek to address what in some respect be very specific issue in term of the failing of the current law it have become part of much need broad conversation about death die and end of life care we all have our own experience of death loss and grief and we do not talk about they enough be really pleased that the bill have lead to many conversation up and down the country whatever our view that have to be positive thing will the hon lady give way have nearly finish have have many such conversation over recent month with those who support the amendment include with palliative care doctor nurse hospice staff gps hospice uk and marie curie thank they all for their constructive engagement with the bill can not imagine that anyone in this place be not truly grateful for the outstanding work do every day by the wonderful people work in palliative and end of life care in every one of our constituency many of we if not most of we will have personal experience of the kindness and compassion that those people have show to our own family and friend but this be not an either or conversation palliative and end of life care and assist dying can and do work side by side to give terminally ill patient the care and choice that they deserve in their final day just as there should not be an either or for die people there should also not be an either or for we as legislator in have to choose between support assist dying or other end of life choice that be why be support amendment to ensure that in this place we channel our energy into support all option available to terminally ill people something that have always commit to do it be privilege to be call at this stage in the debate my principal reason for vote against the bill on second reading be my concern that vulnerable people would be put at risk agree to serve on the bill committee to do what could to allay my concern about that issue and address some of the issue raise by other do not think that the revised version of the bill properly or completely reflect the concern express on multitude of different occasion consequently it do not fully mitigate the risk to vulnerable group we all recognise that decision making of any kind do not take place in vacuum and that in all part of life we live in particular context the equality act recognise that many people face discrimination or unfair treatment as result of particular characteristic and that reasonable step should be take to eliminate that it be very clear from the oral evidence session that particular care have to be take to assess the context within which people be make the decision to seek an assisted death if they suffer from mental illness or eat disorder if they be from low income or ethnic minority background if they suffer from disability or if they be in an abusive relationship those factor be likely to lead to an increase risk that someone will seek an assisted death that they would not have seek if those factor be not present in committee and other make the point that it would have be desirable to have receive an equality impact assessment before the detailed work of committee scrutiny have begin so that committee member have sense of how the propose legislation would impact group that we know can suffer disproportionate level of disadvantage will the hon lady give way will not if that be okay we be tell that it be not practical to produce such an assessment until after committee stage as it would be necessary to assess the impact of amendment make in committee the equality impact assessment be finally publish five week ago have to say that be pretty astounded it do not recognise that certain group in this country may have their life prematurely shorten as result of this legislation instead it concern itself with the barrier that vulnerable people may face when try to access assist dying find that astonishing do the people who draft the assessment not hear the speech of the hon member for vauxhall and camberwell green florence eshalomi on second reading she speak with passion about how the underlie inequality in access to healthcare experience by those from black and minority ethnic background would be exacerbate if the bill pass unamended do they not listen to the oral evidence that dr jamilla hussain give to the bill committee she talk about her experience of work with racialise community in bradford and their fear of be push disproportionately towards an assist die pathway do they not listen to the testimony of dr miro griffiths on the experience and concern of disabled people testimony that have be echo by baroness tanni grey thompson and the actress liz carr find it inexplicable that the framing of the impact on vulnerable people should be the removal of barrier to access assist dying and not as it should be the increase risk to their health and wellbee that the bill present be concerned that we be think about the impact on vulnerable people solely with reference to those who be suffer terminal illness with less than six month to live we be not think about the impact on wide society of introduce concept of life not be worth live and how that might disproportionately affect our more vulnerable community my new clause and consequential new schedule and amendment seek to ensure that comprehensive range of statistic be collect about those who seek and receive an assisted death so that proper and complete monitoring of request can be carry out it be imperative that we get the most detailed possible picture of who be request an assisted death so that any pattern of disproportionality can be properly detect and address what assurance do the bill give to the family of people with disability or those with mental health issue and those who be anorexic do not see any do the hon lady see any assurance for those who want to end their life but suffer from those ailment welcome that intervention speak extensively about the bill impact on anorexic people and be not satisfied that those concern have be address be pleased to support amendment table by my good friend colleague and constituency neighbour my hon friend the member for twickenham munira wilson which have attract support from across the house it would require the secretary of state to report on the impact that the act have have on the healthcare available to those with palliative and end of life care need be really pleased that the hon member for spen valley kim leadbeater have agree to accept the amendment be also pleased to support amendment and in the name of my other constituency neighbour my hon friend the member for wimbledon mr kohler they seek to make all statutory instrument make under the act subject to the affirmative procedure rather than the negative procedure as it stand the act will come into force in four year time with no further scrutiny by mp yet whole host of issue that have be delegate to the secretary of state or have not even be consider will need to be legislate for after royal assent as the bill stand the only way for parliament to scrutinise those power will be to call for minute debate on motion that can not be amend and will be vote on only if the leader of the opposition call for vote make statutory instrument subject to the affirmative procedure rather than the negative procedure would mean that the secretary of state whoever that be can exercise the power delegate to they only with the approval of parliament for an issue as sensitive and profound as assist die believe that to be an appropriate level of scrutiny will the hon lady give way be sorry but will make some progress in similar vein plan to support the amendment in the name of the right hon member for tonbridge tom tugendhat which seek to remove all henry viii power from the bill and from the amendment introduce by the hon member for spen valley will support the right hon member amendment if they be select for vote as do not believe that the use of henry viii power be appropriate or necessary want to speak against amendment in the name of the hon member for spen valley it appear to be innocuous but in reality it would reverse the effect of an amendment that have accept in committee the bill as originally draft would create an enormous constitutional minefield it seek to amend the criminal law of england and wales which be reserved matter for the uk parliament and simultaneously to make provision for healthcare which be matter devolve to the senedd in wales the senedd debate motion call on the welsh government to support the principle of assist dying but it be defeat by vote to the motion be non binding but the bill give the uk parliament the power to impose on the senedd in wales measure that it have expressly say it do not want the bill as amend in committee would give the senedd the power to decide for itself when it be ready to bring the bill into force amendment would reverse that provision and deprive the senedd of the right to exercise its legitimate power it be not just that the amendment would restore the constitutional loophole that the committee have close it threaten to create real problem and risk for welsh citizen if the senedd be force to implement the bill before its devolve healthcare system be ready urge fellow member to have regard to the committee decision and vote against amendment will briefly speak in favour of couple of other amendment remain highly concerned at the idea of future secretary of state have the power to change the national health service act specifically section which set out the purpose for which the nhs exist by use regulation instead of an act parliament once that power exist it can be use not once but at any time to make fundamental change to what our nhs be for be dismay to see change of this magnitude make to the bill in committee and will vote for amendment in the name of the hon member for mitcham and morden dame siobhain mcdonagh to reverse it amendment in the name of the hon member for newcastle under lyme adam jogee seek to remove the automatic commencement of this bill after four year for the vast majority of act of parliament the secretary of state decide when to bring the key provision into force rather than it happen automatically the effect of the provision of this bill be that even if we have covid pandemic or the secretary of state realise that the adequate training have not yet be complete it will still come into force come what may after four year that be not safe it be unusual and reckless and for that reason support amendment amendment in the name of the hon member for glasgow west patricia ferguson would require the appointment of the new voluntary assisted die commissioner to be approve by the health and social care committee the commissioner role create from scratch will be high profile influential and important position add second layer of approval would add more rigour to the appointment process and provide transparency in the event of any problem that arise it be vital that member of this house have the opportunity to scrutinise and debate that new role which be not include in the bill on second reading thank you mr speaker for allow to rise to speak to new clause which propose special representative for ethnic minority be not white as some member may have notice the fact that my presence in this house be unremarkable be in and of itself remarkable that do not happen by chance it happen because of those who come before the mother of the house my right hon friend the member for hackney north and stoke newington ms abbott have spoke powerfully in this debate and know that my unremarkable presence here be due to her remarkable achievement we may not always hold the same opinion but we have always share the same labour value she will never know how grateful we all be to she may be part of the last generation of mp who can say this to she while she be in the house thank you my hon friend the member for vauxhall and camberwell green florence eshalomi have speak powerfully in this debate and my right hon friend the member for walsall and bloxwich valerie vaz have table new clause know stand on their shoulder too and do not doubt their good intention but this bill have nothing to do with the colour of my skin new clause propose special representative for ethnic minority disagree with the new clause because the colour of my skin have no bearing here and no special place in this debate equality datum will be report through the equality and human rights commission as set out in clause and the secretary of state can already consult community representative for every person of every skin colour this bill give those already die choice to end their suffering order we need to make sure that contribution be tie to the amendment we be not debate the general point of the bill we have go past that the hon gentleman be make more of third reading speech which he might want to save it be to the point of where we be order will make that decision please do not challenge the chair do apologise mr speaker what mean to say be that new clause would introduce special representative for ethnic minority and be try to explore why we do not need one duty to consult be already include in clause this be very sensitive issue there be datum to support the fact that people from minoritise ethnic group be less likely to trust their health professional the figure be among the general public but as high as among those group do my hon friend not think it be necessary to make sure there be additional protection for those who face additional barrier such as people from minoritise ethnic group my hon friend make powerful point and other hon member have also speak powerfully about the impact that the bill could have on ethnic minority do any hon member know how many ethnic minority access assist dying in other nation will give way on this point the hon member for richmond park sarah olney raise it early the hon member call to speak if we do not know it be probably because those other nation be not collect the datum my position be that we should be collect the datum which be why hon member should vote for my new clause we do know ethnic minority be less likely to access assist dying in jurisdiction where it be in place in oregon of those access assist die be ethnic minority but they make up of the population in california ethnic minority make up of people access the option but of the population however that be not the point the point of the bill be to give people the choice to end their life regardless of the colour of their skin there be no special quality about the colour of my skin that affect my access or the need for special representative in this case which be cover by the echr and by the secretary of state be quite perplexed by my hon friend speech but would like to understand whether he have datum relate to the demographic of those jurisdiction compare with the uk if he do could he present it to the house to support his argument have spend lot of time around datum but be not sure that understand the question will the hon member give way will make bit more progress this have be heated debate and hon member on both side of the house feel strongly about it be grateful to members who come before who make my place here possible and who have speak so powerfully and movingly in this debate but believe and the evidence show that the colour of my skin do not belong in discussion of the bill rise to speak to amendment to new clause table in my name which hope hon member will support although it may seem technical it be in fact simple amendment with significant impact it will ensure that there be genuine protection against abuse proper detection of coercion and effective scrutiny of how the law work in practice simply put it will ensure that death from assist dying under the bill will still fall within the coroner duty to investigate death under section of the coroners and justice act will explain why that be important like many hon member have be deeply concerned from the outset about how the bill be draft its workability and its impact on the nhs and on the life of vulnerable people up and down the country to be clear my view be that one unintended death as result of the bill become law be one too many humbly ask hon member who be still consider their position or who be minded to support the bill to consider this point about my amendment carefully what be an acceptable error rate base on the figure in the government impact assessment which think underestimate the impact even error rate would see minimum of wrongful death in year with per year by year error rate would see death in year and in year error rate would see death in year and in year as say think those be low ball estimate but they be nevertheless chilling if this law be pass it will be exceptionally difficult to say whether there have be error or instance of abuse or at the very least any error pick up will be but fraction of the true picture as tragically those who would testify to the fact will already be dead my amendment to new clause directly address that issue in england and wales coroner will investigate death when certain legal condition be meet this duty be primarily govern by section of the coroners and justice act judge thomas teague kc who serve until as the chief coroner of england and wales note any death arise as consequence of the ingestion or administration of lethal substance constitute an unnatural death which the local coroner be under statutory duty to investigate clearly assist die meet that definition and it be right that such death be afford the well possible posthumous judicial scrutiny do the hon lady not feel that the provision in the bill already have safeguard also and most importantly do she not feel that put family through coronial process when the death be expect be unfair unjust and completely beyond the bound of what coroner be mean to do on the first point do not believe that the bill be strong enough as it stand on the second point we be already deal with the fact that family be not even guarantee knowledge of their love one have an assisted death so do not think the hon lady point be entirely to be consider as it stand the bill would disapply the duty of the coroner to investigate in the case of an assist death that have be carry out in accordance with the bill provision new clause specifically would amend the coroners and justice act to clarify that assist death do not constitute unnatural death for the purpose of the act think it take an extraordinary leap of imagination not to conceive of deliberately self administer lethal drug as anything but an unnatural death be grateful to the hon lady for give way want to support she in what she be say we be go through process as we consider the appalling situation of coercive control in domestic abuse case where person who be victim may not realise they have be victim until year later obviously person who have go through an assisted death will have no year later be the amendment not way of make sure that we guard against the evil of coercive control thank the hon member for his intervention and completely agree with he these be the sort of safeguard that even the promoter of the bill be say should be there do not think that they be in the bill and my amendment to new clause would make they much strong my hon friend be right in what she say those of we who be oppose to the death penalty for example be against it because we do not believe in the infallibility of the state the state can get thing wrong professional can get thing wrong and when they do there should be proven clear path as to how that wrongdoing can be identify to try to ensure that it do not occur again thank my hon friend the statistic quote early be pretty clear on the point he make let make some progress the work undertake by the coroner be not box tick exercise or bureaucratic hurdle in the context of assist dying it be an extremely powerful deterrent against abuse and malpractice again to quote judge thomas teague kc in letter to the times on may this year he say that the removal of any realistic prospect of an effective inquest would magnify rather than diminish the obvious risk of deception and undue influence thank the hon member she be make very powerful speech do she share my concern about the removal of the coroner as state clearly by the royal college of pathologists which speak to her amendment thank the hon member and will come to that point very soon will now make some progress will not take any further intervention struggle to see how remove automatic oversight of assist death square with commitment to enact legislation with the strong safeguard in the world by do so the bill set low bar for scrutiny and review and create an information deficit put another way we simply do not know what we do not know implement novel piece of legislation such as this without ensure the most robust possible scrutiny of death take place under the act be astonishing under the bill assist death would be the outlier as any other intentionally procure death would automatically be review by coroner why should death under this legislation be any different require automatic scrutiny from coroner for assisted death should not be view as an add on at the end of the process or perhaps just safety net although it be that will the hon lady give way no have already say that be not go take any further intervention have be very generous with my time it be imperative to consider the whole picture particularly regard malpractice or coercion whether that be on the part of medical professional family or third party in write evidence to the committee dr rees johnson legal expert from essex law school highlight that in some culture decision making be collective process involve family and community member this approach combine with the bill provision for sign by proxy in clause potentially create opportunity for coercion or abuse particularly where family member have conflict financial social or emotional burden without coroner inquest dr johnson note that we would lose the ability to fully and properly investigate the possibility of where coercion or abuse take place in such culturally sensitive situation investigation of assist death by coroner be not luxury it be vital safeguard without which people will fall through the crack will the hon lady give way no beyond coercion automatic inquest provide vital opportunity to identify other critical issue that may not otherwise be pick up without coroner inquest there would be no post mortem examination this be not merely an academic point study have show that autopsy reveal that one in four case have be misdiagnose without this oversight as his honour judge thomas teague kc the former chief coroner note there be no certain mean of know whether the approve substance have lead to quick and painless death or linger and distress one or even whether it have fail to cause death altogether and the deceased have be dispatch by manual asphyxiation or some other unlawful mean be not sure whether that could be more clear the view of expert in this area both the royal college of pathologists and the former chief coroner of england and wales be that this bill proposal as draft be not fit for purpose strongly urge hon member to support my amendment to new clause rise may informally suggest that we aim for speech of around six minute call paul waugh to provide good example rise to speak in support of the amendment in my name which seek to strengthen new clause table by my hon friend the member for spen valley kim leadbeater why do we want to restrict advertising about assist die it be not just because such advert could appear crass or insensitive or because we worry that private company could profiteer from death but because advertiser know that they influence choice the issue of choice whether it be inform choice skewed choice self coercion or coercive control as have already be mention be in many way at the heart of the bill and whether its safeguard be sufficient my brother work in advertising and he know its power it be why company spend billion of pound on it why google be the giant that it be why we see lot of advert at westminster tube station try to influence every single one of we and why be full of ad advertising work because we human being be suggestible and prone to message visual cue and hint old people be bombard with advert for everything from stairlift to care home one person advert though be another person public information campaign it be not impossible to imagine future secretary of state who passionately believe in the merit of assist dying authorise such campaign it could be government approve plotline in soap opera or an ad read out by podcaster that ever so subtly sound like news item or even their own opinion many in this house rightly try to protect teenager from online harm but the online harm of an ad for website about assist dying share on tiktok could be reality without the tight safeguard in my amendment thank my hon friend for speak so clearly about the issue of advertising do he recognise that this country have ban pharmaceutical advertising because we do not want to have the situation that exist in america where people be pop pill all the time there be reason that we be protect patient and we need to do the same with assisted dying completely agree with my hon friend the danger of what be happen in america provide real lesson for we here as the hon member for reigate rebecca paul put it conversation about assist dying should happen in person between the relevant doctor and the patient they should not be prompt by tv ad or something see on bus my hon friend the member for bexleyheath and crayford daniel francis speak very movingly about the way that ivf service have be commercialise leave people who be as he say already on their knee vulnerable to exploitation so that someone else can profit be certain that nobody in this house believe that pass this bill into law should mean the rise of similarly aggressive market for assisted death but it be our role indeed our responsibility to deal not only in intend consequence but in unintended one too the real risk in the drafting of new clause be that it allow exception that be not specify in the bill future secretary of state will be empower not only to make the necessary regulation but to amend they at any time and future secretary of state who do not share the concern of this house would have the ability to draw the exception so widely as to make the ban worthless there be number of similar advertising ban already in place on tobacco product surrogacy and the late cancer drug be market to the public in every case the legislation set out the exception leave no room for doubt as to how parliament intend to protect the public why should the service that this bill would legalise not be subject to that same legal clarity do people who have less time to live not deserve all the protection we have the power to give they from death they do not truly want can not believe that this parliament would be content to have that power take out of its hand and the right of our most vulnerable constituent leave for someone else to decide on some other day my amendment therefore set out that exception to the advertising ban should be limit to case where person have request information and where the material be intend for health professional and not for their patient new clause would allow future secretary of state to make provision that would usually have to go through the house in legislation it be not at all clear to why that power be need to introduce ban on advertising be very grateful to the hon gentleman and entirely support his argument and his amendment this be the difference between in his estimation accept request and promote service advertising be about the promotion of service to doubtful fearful and vulnerable people and that be precisely what his amendment address agree with the right hon gentleman and there be wide point here about the henry viii power in the bill this would be the third such power add to the bill since second reading at that stage it have none the attorney general lord hermer have say that excessive reliance on henry viii power upset the proper balance between parliament and the executive and he be right away from matter of constitutional principle be especially concerned about the practical impact of such power which would allow future secretary of state to change the law as set out in the suicide act this be the act that contain the offence of encourage or assist suicide minister have confirm that the bill leave the offence in place in all case except where medical practitioner assist person to die under its provision we must surely therefore not hand the power to future secretary of state to weaken or even abolish that offence without the need for primary legislation my amendment specify that the suicide act can not be amend in that way hope that my hon friend the member for spen valley recognise that my amendment do not seek to undo or undermine her new clause but rather to build on it and to ensure that the ban she intend to deliver do not collapse around the loophole at its heart my hon friend be make powerful point and there be consensus across the house about ban the advertising of assist die service his amendment though would be slightly limit in that it make just two exception there would probably need to be broad piece of work on that but commit to work with he if he be interested the point of my amendment be to make sure that future secretary of state would have to come before the house with primary legislation report stage be not about the principle of the bill it be not about whether member may in principle support the idea of assist dying as mr speaker will point out to everybody who stray from the amendment it be about the individual bill before we today we have to ask what will it mean in the real world for our very real constituent will the hon gentleman give way will not be short of time just how strong be the bill safeguard we be not commentator we be legislator our job be to scrutinise to test and to test again the bills that come to this place spend year up there in the press gallery write about politic but the big difference between they and we be that we have vote in this place with that vote particularly free vote come responsibility and there be no great responsibility than protect the vulnerable from feel they have to end their life that be why table the amendment be not drive by religion though do not believe that those with religious faith should be denigrate or patronise as they have be during the passage of the bill it be worth say that some of those who passionately support assist dying have faith devout faith that their world view be the right one be drive instead by my duty as legislator to get this bill right and by what see as my moral duty to protect the most vulnerable in society believe that my duty be to protect those who do not have celebrity name or campaign group behind they the people who do not get hear who do not want to be bother who do not want to make fuss and who feel at the end of their life that they be burden on their family but may never say so worry about the unheard the unseen the ignore and the marginalised most of all worry about the heartbreaking modesty of that phrase we often hear from old people do want to be any trouble love we need for their sake to make sure that the safeguard in the bill be the strong they can possibly be intend to speak only briefly we have to be really honest about where we be and the current situation under the legal status quo be not work it be fail terminally ill people who want choice compassion and control at the end of their life right now those with the mean be travel abroad to die often alone away from their love one without medical support and when they can physically make it rather than at time of their choosing those without the mean face suffer they do not want or try to take matter into their own hand here in the uk unsafely and illegally it be not humane it be not fair and it be not sustainable spend two year as minister in the department of health with palliative care and end of life care as part of my portfolio so this matter come across my desk on regular basis have have lot of time to think about it it be not easy to find an answer and solution but we owe it to people to try to do that that be why support the bill it bring the issue out of the shadow and into framework of regulation with safety and dignity do not know whether the hon member have yet have time to read the report from the independent commission on palliative and end of life care which go into how pain and symptom can be palliate ultimately the problem at the moment be poor care and poor provision of specialist commission palliative care service will she read that report to understand the difference that palliative medicine can make for all the example of poor care we have hear about in these debate certainly will read that report the hon member make an excellent point palliative care be really important and need to be improve in many case it make such difference but it be not the solution for everybody there be the most heartbreaking case have meet people in these situation in my constituency where that form of palliative care would not have make the difference that be why support the bill and that begin with new clause on point of order madam deputy speaker wonder if you can assist as be at loss as to what amendment we be discuss have no doubt that if the right hon member give the hon member for gosport dame caroline dinenage moment she will address it quickly because even member who be contribute do not have long thank you madam deputy speaker be address new clause which provide the strict regulation of life end substance and self administer device that mean there will be transparency about what substance be use and how they be store prescribe and deliver we owe it to patient clinician and the public to ensure that every part of the process be govern by clinical standard and ethical safeguard for those physically unable to swallow or self ingest the new clause ensure that device to support self administration can be safely use without that we risk create system that exclude some of the very people it be mean to support while we must regulate the system properly we must also reject amendment that would undermine or stall the bill delivery amendment propose add suicide prevention the mental health act and deprivation of liberty safeguard to the code of practice as the minister who put much of that legislation through those be really important topic for but this be not the legislation to address they let we keep the code focus on the bill core function of ensure safe consistent and compassionate assisted dying process amendment would allow non adherence to the code to be use in civil or criminal proceeding that be not appropriate guidance be mean to help professional navigate difficult decision not become legal trap if clinician act negligently exist law already apply we should not be create new liability for those act in good faith in very difficult condition also oppose amendment and which would require the mhra to license drug specifically for assisted dying and the national institute for health and care excellence to recommend they that would make the bill unworkable do the hon member share my concern that the impact assessment associate with the bill say the safety and efficacy of those substance use for assist dying be currently difficult to assess be not entirely sure that agree with that however want to talk about the mhra which be just not set up to license drug for end life clinical trial to support such licence and mhra requirement would be impossible however the substance likely to be use be already try and test in other jurisdiction and be mhra approve for other purpose new clause already provide we with the strict regulation that we need without put prohibitive hurdle along the path to compassionate and painless death amendment would remove the backstop date for implementation give the government indefinite discretion over when or whether to put this law into effect that can not be right if parliament pass the bill there must be clear and reasonable timeframe for implementation the four year backstop already give government more than enough time to get this right remove it simply invite delay this be moment to show that we can be both compassionate and competent and that we can bring an end to the quiet suffering cause by an unjust status quo and replace it with system that be safe fair and accountable let we support new clause let we reject amendment that would add red tape or stall the bill progress and let we show die people that we be ready to treat they with the dignity and trust that they deserve before enter this place last july as the member for north somerset have be pharmacist for nearly year pharmacist have unique role in our healthcare system as the group of health professional who specialise in drug usage and safety that be where wish to focus my thought today and on which offer the house my expertise throughout the passage of the bill we have have the great benefit of learn from number of international example in australia we have see carefully design countrywide pharmacy system that have deliver self administer assisted dying safely and with dignity the evidence from that experience be greatly reassuring even in case where the drug be not fully ingest every patient who make use of the service die peacefully and without complication with not single complaint yet receive from any of the family involve from switzerland we have learn from decade of practice over which they have refine the substance and process involve to the point where complication be now nearly unheard of their approach demonstrate that with care and rigorous regulation drug can offer an effective and compassionate route to end one life that bring to new clause introduce by my hon friend the member for spen valley kim leadbeater the clause outline comprehensive framework for the oversight and safety of substance involve in assisted dying as be only right for life end drug the public expect the high standard of transparency and the high standard from manufacture to dispense as someone who have be involve in every facet of pharmacy for the past year believe that the clause meet all our expectation by strengthen safeguard and enhance the workability of the bill new clause ensure that healthcare professional can act with clarity and confidence amendment be similarly important and believe it will provide much assurance to those in this place who be uncertain about whether they can support the bill by ensure that all regulation make by the secretary of state under new clause be subject to the draft affirmative procedure it will ensure that this place continue to play central role in oversee the safe and effective implementation of this legislation for year to come and through our collective and continued scrutiny it offer the opportunity for many million of constituent who have contact we on this issue to continue to have their voice hear and their concern answer rise to speak to new clause and amendment and to that new clause be honour to speak after the hon member for rochdale paul waugh also thank the hon member for spen valley kim leadbeater for work closely with we on the issue of ban advertising whatever our view on assist terminally ill adult to end their life and remain implacably against the potential harm that arise when our society and our imperfect state be give permission to help people kill themselves have to acknowledge that there be majority on second reading in favour of the bill and majority for close down debate in the last sitting on report think ahead to the possibility that this bill might get on to the statute book hope that everyone participate in the debate will recognise that we should not allow the service of the organisation that will arise from the legislation to advertise on television online on poster on tiktok or on any platform that our constituent may see we can all imagine scenario where if the bill pass without the house agree to new clause independent contractor and not for profit firm and perhaps even the nhs will be able to advertise to potential customer for instance on afternoon television can you imagine situation madam deputy speaker where while watch repeat episode of one foot in the grave an advert run for funeral plan company and be then follow by an advert for an organisation offer service to make it easy to have an assisted death member may think the situation be paint be merely hypothetical but in belgium in fact the government themselves be run online advert feature young healthy woman at yoga class talk about how they be worried about granny situation and discuss whether they have consider tell she about the option of assist dying be grateful to the hon member for spen valley for table new clause it be not perfect but she and have have lot of discussion about the wording also support the intention behind amendment and to new clause it be important that ministers confirm as we have hear before and as hope we will again today that encourage assist die under the bill remain crime under section of the suicide act however this require show intent to encourage and advert might be frame so that they be not so intended so specific provision on advertising be need in this legislation be also concerned about the scope of some of the exception in unamended new clause be grateful that the example set out in subsection do not refer to potential service user but there be nothing prevent the secretary of state from exercise henry viii power to exempt they and do so would negate the point of the prohibition would be grateful if the minister would confirm that the power will not be exercise to create exception for advert target at potential service user it be the case as the hon member for rochdale mention that number of advert ban already exist on the face of legislation such as the cancer act the surrogacy act and the tobacco advertising and promotion act such ban be set out clearly on the face of those act hope the matter can be resolve hope the house today will at minimum support new clause hope that the house will also support the strengthen amendment which endorse hope that ministers will confirm that these power will never be use to create an exemption to section of the suicide act in order to partially allow encouragement of assist dying as think it would defeat the whole point of the provision rise to speak in favour of new clause which clarify that an assisted death would not be classify as an unnatural death and that full coroner inquest would not normally be require my constituent anthony shackleton live with motor neurone disease for six long year as his condition worsen his option narrow until there be only one choice that preserve his dignity autonomy and peace to travel to dignitas in switzerland and end his suffering on his own term louise as his wife of year and someone who have know he since the age of do what any love partner would do she stand by he she help he on to that plane and hold his hand through the most difficult decision of their life and now for that act of love she be under police investigation that be precisely why we need new clause if the bill be pass assist dying would be legal strictly regulate and monitor choice make by the individual concern recognise that the situation face my hon friend constituent be awful but we be here today to balance such situation with the choice of people who may not be love as dearly as he our concern would be about the fact that many of these killing could be mercy killing and if there be no recourse to the coroner some people may be take their own life under coercion and pressure that may never be discover because the full law will not be apply new clause particularly address the role of coroner coroner investigate death in which there be reasonable suspicion that the deceased have die violent or unnatural death where the cause of death be unknown or if the decease die while in custody or state detention this be not the case with an assisted death and there would already be strong safeguard in place include multiple layer of oversight and assessment the process be cautious thorough and heavily safeguard there be no need to investigate an assisted death as it be not unnatural in this country it be still crime to help someone die peacefully and with dignity even when they be suffer unbearably from terminal illness will my hon friend give way will make some progress thank you it be still crime even when the person be of sound mind and even when it be their deeply consider wish anthony want good death he want to die peacefully and with grace without pain and without profound suffering he get that in foreign country far from home and far from family because our law force people like he to make that desperate journey abroad that be why support this bill and in particular new clause as there be no need for coroner to investigate an assisted death one of my constituent tell of her mother pain in her last few month of suffering it be so painful that she could not bear to be touch by my constituent or her brother now both my constituent and her brother be face post traumatic stress disorder because of the difficult situation they witness while their mum be die do my hon friend agree that if they have help she to die in the way that this bill allow they should not then be subject to coroner investigation it be not go to help they and it be not go to help their mother my hon friend make powerful case on behalf of her constituent new clause be compassionate and practical clause ensure that the bill work not only for the individual make the choice but for the family they leave behind let we not turn our back on people like anthony and louise let we not make criminal out of the compassionate the death of love one be always difficult when someone have go through the legal and safeguarded process of assist dying it be not right that their family should face an unnecessary potentially lengthy and distressing coroner investigation will my hon friend give way be come to my conclusion new clause will protect bereaved family such as that of my constituent anthony and therefore urge hon member to support it as mr speaker have already mention in order for everybody to get in well in order for most to get in we need speech to be shy of six minute and intervention to be short call gregory stafford thank you madam deputy speaker be conscious of those comment and will try to limit my remark to new clause and some of the amendment to it the royal college of physicians the royal college of psychiatrists the royal college of pathologists the association for palliative medicine and the british geriatrics society have all say that there be problem with this bill and have hear nothing from its sponsor the hon member for spen valley kim leadbeater despite try to intervene on she number of time about what she have do to ensure that their concern have be address this bring we directly to fundamental concern namely the mean by which assist death would be carry out under new clause the impact assessment for the bill recognise that the safety and efficacy of those substance use for assist dying be currently difficult to assess do the hon member agree that the barbiturate that we be consider be conventional agent they have be use in anaesthesia to cause loss of consciousness and suppression of respiration for generation these be not novel substance obviously respect the hon gentleman give his medical background but as far as be aware those substance have not yet be use for murder people which be what we be go to do here that lead neatly on will my hon friend give way will make little progress before take another intervention no safeguard can prevent complication from take medicine as be sure the hon member for bury st edmunds and stowmarket peter prinsley know there can always be complication in this case those could include regurgitation of the drug regain consciousness and seizure will the hon gentleman give way can just finish this point during the year that the law in oregon have be in place datum be available for only about of case however within that incident of regurgitation be know to have occur and nine people be know to have regain consciousness different drug protocol have be use in those year but the efficacy and safety of the drug be unknown with time range between ingest the drug and death range from one minute to nearly six day the lack of define protocol for the regulation supply and administration of life end substance be precisely why have table my amendment to new clause table by the hon member for spen valley kim leadbeater my hon friend be right to table his amendment which certainly support do he agree that the medicines and healthcare product regulatory agency would insist that barbiturate or any other substance use in medicine should be approve for specific cause we can not translate that to completely different cause or reason for use it would he also agree that the way to deal with the issue be for it to be properly regulate through the mhra entirely agree some of the amendment table by my hon friend the member for gosport dame caroline dinenage may address that will the hon gentleman give way will make little progress but will give way to the hon gentleman in moment my amendment would require the secretary of state to prohibit the use of medical device design to induce death by the administration of gas such as the sarco suicide pod which have be in the press recently that device bypass medical oversight entirely and present an ethical rupture in our current framework if the bill proceed without safeguard against such method we risk open the door to deeply troubling precedent one that would erode professional accountability and compromise the integrity of end of life care would like to share my expertise as pharmacist with the hon member drug can be use for many indication and be quite commonly use in unlicensed situation where there would be less evidence to support they than in the situation that we be discuss today with new clause an idea that be incredibly well research practise and evidence in multiple country thank the hon gentleman for his intervention do not disagree that drug be use for different thing that be not the thrust of the argument that be make what be say relatively clearly hope be that when the drug we would potentially use in these situation have be use there have be unintended consequence and side effect we must ensure that the drug we use if the bill pass be absolutely effective in what they be intend to carry out namely the end of the life of the individual will my hon friend give way this be the last intervention that will take as must make progress the reason why what my hon friend have say be so important be that it be yet another important safeguard particularly give that as we learn from analysis in the impact assessment much of this be outsource to private organisation those organisation need to be regulate in precisely the way he have describe my right hon friend be entirely correct the royal college of physicians have say medicine prescribe and administer in assist dying must be regulate for safety and efficacy for this use if that be requirement of the royal college of physicians we in the house should take it seriously and put it into the bill will now draw my remark to close but should say that also support amendment which would require report on the drug effect before parliament approve the regulation as well as number of the other amendment which hopefully would remove the wide range henry viii power currently in the bill in the light of all that have say remain deeply sceptical as to whether the bill in its current state provide the robust protective and operationally sound framework that such profound societal change deserve be grateful to you madam deputy speaker for give my first opportunity to speak in the chamber on this most important of issue as do so think of all those who be kill in the horrendous plane crash in india yesterday think of their family their friend and the life they have leave behind may their collective and individual memory be blessing rise to speak to amendment table in my name and those of more than colleague from the majority of party in the house represent constituency in all four nation of our united kingdom it would remove the automatic commencement of the bill provision in england it be safeguard good and proper as it stand the entire assisted dying process will commence automatically in england four year after the bill be pass notwithstanding some of the comment we have hear that will happen regardless of how far along the plan and preparation be plan for the manufacturing and supply of the drug that will be use to end the life of anyone who choose this step for the identification and training of those on the panel for the impact on the national health service in england and wales and its budget and all the rest colleague will know that as the bill be originally draft the process would have commence two year after it be pass welcome the fact that my hon friend the member for spen valley kim leadbeater amend that period from two year to four that be genuinely welcome acknowledgment that such serious and consequential change to every aspect of our country from our healthcare system to our legal system should not must not and can not be rush therein lie the basis of my amendment if this change be go to happen let we do it properly let we not impose timeframe that put we in bind one that mean we be drive by time over purpose and the pressure that come with tick clock rather than by the need to do it properly people live in newcastle under lyme and york outer in buckingham and bletchley and pembrokeshire be count on us parliamentarian those of we who be concerned about assist dying and those who passionately support it the bill supporter have win every single vote apart from on this issue in committee our people be count on we to make sure if the bill pass that it be success that it will be consistent and most importantly that it will be safe if the bill pass it will introduce assisted dying in the big jurisdiction yet by population these be uncharted water this will not be like anything else the last thing we should do be rush this process in committee the hon member for richmond park sarah olney who speak excellently early today table an amendment to remove the automatic commencement deadline for wales it provide that assist dying could be roll out only once welsh ministers deem that everything be ready for safe roll out the committee vote by majority to give that extra safeguard to the people of wales if it be good enough for the people of wales in committee it be good enough for the people of england today we face situation in which assist dying may proceed in england month or even year before it do in wales the provision and system may look different the process of organise the english system to meet the arbitrary four year deadline would almost certainly lead to rush decision making my hon friend the member for spen valley have seek to remedy the disparity but her solution be not to extend to my constituent in england the safeguard that the member of the bill committee member that she appoint vote for no her remedy be to allow for automatic commencement to happen in wales as well remove the safeguard that the committee vote for the answer be not to fast track the roll out of assist dying in both england and wales potentially put the life of some of the most vulnerable at even great risk due to rush decision that be not fully think through have not be on these benches for very long but know that argue for the automatic commencement of legislation be generally in the kind interpretation unusual for legislation of this magnitude it be be afraid to say reckless and reinstate automatic roll out in wales when the committee explicitly vote against it border on the undemocratic visit the isle of man and meet the sponsor of the bill there the house of keys which have only member take three year to get to this point and the sponsor of the bill think it will take at least five year to implement the bill in that much small jurisdiction my hon friend make very good point will the hon gentleman give way will take one intervention from the other side of the house and then will continue the hon gentleman be fast become one of my favourite on the government benches among many competitor the point that he make be fundamental if we be go to do this right we have to do it thoroughly and with independent analysis have the hon member for spen valley kim leadbeater engage in pre legislative scrutiny and thorough analysis before introduce the bill we may have iron these matter out in the first place thank the right hon gentleman for his intervention it teach not to take they also thank he for help my street cre this morning he raise an important point member of this house have be tell that this bill it be this bill we be vote on not the principle be rigorously test and refine in committee however we be now see effort to undermine the decision of that same committee amendment and serve the singular purpose of undo amendment introduce in committee to improve the bill and make it safe and more conventional piece of legislation but their implication go beyond just that they challenge the basic tenet of our democracy one of the key role at the heart of our democratic system be the role of the or minister of the crown it be our ministers who prepare the groundwork for legislation to be enact successfully and amendment and would completely do away with that core ministerial function they would see the responsibility for ensure the roll out of assist dying in wales the power that we the people entrust to our ministers and democracy take away from they interruption conscious of your cough madam deputy speaker shall quickly move towards the end of my remark have take half of they out already in my view ministers should be able to lead the roll out of assist dying in wales just as they should in england it be ministers not the supporter of the bill who will be responsible for deliver these seismic change to our health and legal system so it be only right that they decide when the provision become law amendment would put england back on an even footing with wales get this right be literally matter of life and death it make sense to avoid any possible pressure on decision making and decision maker and at the very least allow ministers to enact legislation with the usual constitutional power one death because of rush decision would be one too many and should give we all food for thought do not want it on my conscience that our collective sticking to an arbitrary deadline lead to death or death that may otherwise have not take place we must recognise that we can prevent any such situation and we can prevent that with our vote today to do so we must remove the deadline for automatic commencement in england and uphold it in wales urge member to support my amendment and to vote against amendment and rise to speak to amendment in my name which would do the exact opposite of the amendment of the hon member for newcastle under lyme adam jogee in fact it would see the commencement period reduce from four year to three year as member of the bill committee when we have the initial conversation about increase the commencement period from two year to four year be the only person to speak against it and push it to vote what frustrate about the situation we be in be that in effect we be acknowledge that the reason we be here and debate this bill be that the status quo be not acceptable people be push to take decision that they should not be and have to go to foreign country to have opportunity overseas those of we who support the bill be broadly in agreement on those principle number of thing frustrate about the four year period principally that the people in office the government of the day will not necessarily be here to implement it be really hesitant about support bill when we do not know who would see through those detail amendment would reduce the threshold back down to three year which would still be more than most jurisdiction around the world country have implement assist die legislation after as short time as six month month or month so three year would still be substantial increase compare with other country we be not innovator or leader in this field there be no reason why we can not take good practice and learn from and speak to colleague around the world believe that this bill have the strong safeguard of any which be why think an implementation period of three year would more than meet the requirement want to put on record my sincere thank to my hon friend the member for spen valley kim leadbeater for the way that she have approach this bill her willingness to listen to concern from across the house have be evident not least in new clause bring forward in the name of the hon member for reigate rebecca paul and for west worcestershire dame harriett baldwin that be testament to how we can work together on these deeply sensitive issue rise to speak in favour of new clause and against amendment to new clause absolutely understand the intent behind the amendment in the name of my hon friend the member for rochdale paul waugh nobody in this house want to see voluntary assist die service be advertise in way that be insensitive inappropriate or exploitative we all want to protect individual particularly those who may be vulnerable or more easily influence so fully share that concern although respect the principle behind the amendment however do not believe it offer the right solution new clause rightly prohibit advertising voluntary assist die service to the public while give ministers tightly define power to create appropriate exception through regulation that be important because in healthcare system as complex as ours we must be able to draw the line between unethical promotion and responsible professional communication think the new clause get that balance right the amendment do two thing that be in my view both problematic first it try to define in the bill narrow list of exception just two to the advertising ban which be reply to individual request and professional communication that patient be unlikely to see share the view of the legal expert who we have hear from that writing such exception into primary legislation would remove essential flexibility and may even hamper the implementation of the measure minister would not be able to respond to future development or clarify borderline scenario without come back to the house with further primary legislation the amendment could also limit future minister ability to clarify how the system should work in real world and evolve situation good regulation should be responsive and proportionate not fix to point in time will my hon and learn friend give way will press on secondly the amendment attempt to limit the scope of future regulation by bar any change to the suicide act but that be already cover by new clause which prevent other change to this bill should it become an act the amendment be not only duplicative but close off avenue for future clarity that might be need in the suicide act such as to ensure that offence around coercion or fraudulent practice be properly deal with in short the amendment do not add clarity it risk confusion it do not strengthen the advertising ban it introduce constraint that could make it hard to enforce with evolve practice thank my hon and learn friend for give way give the time constraint have simple but key question do an advertisement include leaflet on gp surgery table or on door go into the gp it seem unclear to what be information and what it advertisement that will have to be work out do not have the answer at my fingertip but other might be pleased to hear my hon friend the member for spen valley say early that she be open to work with my hon friend the member for rochdale and other in the lords to find workable way forward on all these issue hope that he will take she up on that offer this be obviously an area where constructive cross party work could ensure that strong safeguard be achieve without unintended consequence rise be essentially finish urge hon member to reject amendment to new clause in its current form not because we oppose its aim but because we can and must find well way to achieve it be grateful to have my first opportunity to contribute on this bill it would not be appropriate to dilate on my profound anxiety about it but approach these amendment in the spirit of constructive engagement rise to speak to link amendment to which would strengthen the panel by give it some of the feature of the high court safeguard that be regrettably remove we hear from the hon member for spen valley kim leadbeater that the panel will now be strong because it include broad range of expertise the argument against that of course be that the high court be strong safeguard because it have the power of court and the independence of the judiciary my amendment would mean that we do not have to choose between the two the panel be part of the bill but we can have well panel if we give it some of the feature of the high court namely its independence the calibre of its judge and its power as court amendment would require all panel member to be appoint by the judicial appointments commission which nominate judge in england and wales currently the selection of panel member be wholly down to the voluntary assist die commissioner schedule say the commissioner must make appointment to list of person eligible to sit as member of panel have absolutely no doubt that the commissioner will be someone of great integrity and experience but he or she will certainly be strong advocate of assist dying as will those who put themselves forward for the panel that may create an impression that the vad commission be self select group with particular set of institutional view if the system be to command public confidence believe that appointment would be well administer by an external body and the judicial appointments commission be the obvious choice we in this country trust the judiciary partly because we know that they represent no set of opinion be grateful to my right hon friend for his amendment he be absolutely right to say that this country trust the judge which be why this house be so enthusiastic about the inclusion of the high court in the original bill do he agree that by reintroduce proper judicial scrutiny at this stage we would be revert to the bill that the house vote for on second reading it will not surprise my hon friend to hear that agree wholeheartedly recognise that that be major reason that many colleague give at early point in our discussion and deliberation thank the right hon gentleman for his constructive engagement but he do not vote for the bill when it include high court judge and now he be try to reintroduce high court judge be there version of the bill that he would vote for if it have some sort of judicial oversight other than commissioner who be judge or retired judge deputy commissioner who be judge or retired judge and someone on the panel who be legal expert have be very clear that have table my amendment in constructive way to reflect the will that the hon lady have express but to recognise the meaningful dilution in the authority of the process and what can reasonably be amend to invigorate it base on the principle that think be intend at the outset will revert to the point be make about the judiciary they have commitment to uphold the law and that should be the standard we be look for when it come to matter of life and death the judicial appointments commission already conduct appointment for all tribunal include lie member the government impact assessment compare the panel to the mental health tribunal all appointment to the mental health tribunal include the non legal member be make by the judicial appointments commission so this would not be novel function for it let move on to amendment which would ensure that all member of the panel have to take the judicial oath if they have not do so already if other amendment pass amendment would be necessary only for the non legal member and it be crucial for public confidence that the judicial oath be take amendment and seek to preserve an important element of the bill as originally present to the house they would ensure that the most senior decision make figure the chair of the panel be high court judge with all the experience responsibility and professionalism that that imply under these amendment all high court judge would be automatically eligible they would need to be currently serve or at least be below retirement age and would have to be judge of the high authority and not deputy judge member of this house and the public be originally tell that this would be safe bill precisely because it would have high court judge that be persuasive promise and think there be way to honour it even in the new version of the bill will briefly mention the retirement age because it be important it use to be but judge can now continue until they be however there be no age limit for member of the panel if we be say that an year old retired judge be still with it and be able to decide on matter of life and death why be they too old to help clear the backlog of criminal case that seem to be meaningful anomaly have be very clear about the purpose of my amendment have table they in the spirit of try to strengthen the bill and return it to what be intend so that it can meet the expectation of so many member who support it at an early point rise to support number of new clause and amendment to the bill the common thread run through all of they be need to address some of the gap in the safeguard and oversight should the bill pass at least want to ensure that we improve its protection and remove some of the risk that it contain new clause require the chief medical officer to monitor the operation of the legislation rather than depend solely on the assist die commissioner alongside the requirement for high court judge oversight by the cmo be remove during the committee stage this mean that essentially the assist die commissioner would mark their own homework new clause return the safeguard of independent oversight which be sensible give the significant concern express by many expert and organisation which be often neutral on the principle but concerned about the bill they include the royal college of psychiatrists the association for palliative medicine the british geriatrics society the royal college of physicians and many expert such as professor jane monckton smith lead criminologist baroness finlay parliament lead expert on palliative care sir david haslam former head of the british medical association and of the national institute for health and care excellence my previous employer and many more all have express concern even when neutral on the principle of the adequacy of the bill hence new clause require an annual report to include information about the application of the act in relation to person who have protect characteristic and any other description of person specify in regulation make by the secretary of state fervently hope that that include domestic violence victim amendment very sensibly add the requirement that the commissioner appointment be not the sole remit of the prime minister at the time by require the consent of the health and social care committee this provide safeguard against ideological and politically motivated appointment and would be very critical of anyone who would want to prevent that amendment address the significant concern about the involvement of private for profit provider of assist dying there be concern that when there be commercial relationship between provider there will be gaming of the system that risk compromise the relationship between the co ordinating doctor and the independent doctor likewise the existence of such provider do not allay concern about doctor shopping as be raise in the previous debate hence amendment will require private provider to be transparent and provide report on service member service number cost and revenue in previous debate and in the public discourse have find it very disconcert that in response to legitimate concern all that we have be offer as we have see today be some promise unspecified future regulation that will fix the member hear hear my hon friend be make powerful point do she share my concern that most of our discussion today be thrash out in committee and now we be be tell that we have to leave they to the lords because we can not fix the issue here that be really flawed process entirely agree with my hon friend to expect mp to improve the bill without clarity as to what the regulation be or what they will be and how the service will be deliver without rigorous regulatory oversight be fundamentally wrong furthermore the fact that the implementation of the bill will be automatic in general election year incidentally be not realistic when reflect on the many area that still lack detail hence support amendment propose by my hon friend the member for newcastle under lyme adam jogee which allow the secretary of state to determine the appropriate date for the bill to be implement this would allow time to make the nhs fit for purpose to strengthen palliative care and for parliament to draft and scrutinise adequate regulation without be rush similarly but fundamental to the society in which we live amendment protect the status of our most dear institution the nhs the bill before we provide henry viii power to amend the national health service act without limit which could include specification of charge if as labour mps we be commit to the nhs remain free at the point of use then amendment be vital as it will require any change to the act to be make by an act of parliament the future be uncertain we must build safeguard in the bill to protect we from measure that fundamentally alter the fabric of our society briefly amendment require the mhra to license the drug use for assisted dying research have show that painful and protract death via assisted die drug be not uncommon with death range from three minute to hour nearly week with up to eight hour to lose consciousness furthermore serious side effect disproportionately affect young people amendment will help to ensure the safety and efficacy of these substance will close by quote sir david haslam on how we balance some of the individual story use on both side of the debate with the good of society as we know nice have to make the difficult decision to approve or not approve medication and treatment base on cost and clinical effectiveness model it be experience in weigh up societal will be quick madam deputy speaker versus the need and wish of individual sir david state from individual perspective assist dying might appear logical development but from the perspective of society it be likely to have profoundly different impact with legion of unintended consequence once we blur that boundary there be no go back and the elasticity with which assist die law have be apply in other country should serve as warning that such legislation be inherently unstable in closing even if we apply all the safeguarding amendment put forward the bill will still not be fit for purpose the renters rights bill contain page this bill consist of just but should it pass let we at least try to ensure that we have insert some level of safeguarding and oversight as such no matter how they stand on principle urge hon member to support the new clause and amendment have address and those have not have time to address in particular new clause and amendment and let begin by lay my card on the table be of course liberal and have always support the right of individual to choose freely when they want to end their life have no religious or philosophical objection to assist dying and when the debate on the bill begin assume would vote in favour of it however as the debate in this chamber on second reading progress and in particular as result of the compelling speech by the hon member for vauxhall and camberwell green florence eshalomi and for city of durham mary kelly foy and in particular from the mother of the house the right hon member for hackney north and stoke newington ms abbott come to the reluctant decision that the state of palliative care in this country and the safeguard against coercion in all its form be not sufficient to vote in favour of the bill despite the change in committee my mind have not change will again be vote against the bill however let be equally clear that amendment and in my name and to which will now speak be not wreck amendment but critical to ensure proper parliamentary scrutiny if the bill become law the issue of palliative care have be raise across the house we have be repeatedly tell that this be not an either or choice but do the hon member agree that without world class palliative care that will force some patient down the assist dying route where otherwise they would have choose well care agree entirely with the hon member it would not be free choice if we make that choice now give the standard of palliative care will my hon friend give way this be the last one will thank my hon friend for give way share with he concern about the level and quality of palliative care in this country however do not agree that give people the choice to end their life if they be terminally ill and have be diagnose as die shortly in any way undermine our ability as house to insist on an improvement in palliative care what be more statistic from other jurisdiction show that once give that choice people often turn to palliative care thank my hon friend for her intervention give people choice when they look on the internet and see how awful their death might be because of the shocking state of palliative care be not free choice this be an extraordinary bill it have clause and regulation make power of which five be henry viii power in other word power to modify primary legislation as ruth fox of the non partisan hansard society which be absolutely neutral on assist dying make clear there be lot of power in the bill confer on ministers why be that problem lord hermer kc the attorney general in his bingham lecture last year put the point as follow henry viii clause upset the proper balance between parliament and the executive this not only strike at the rule of law but also at the cardinal principle of accessibility and legal certainty be afraid the bill be an example of such excessive reliance that be major problem because in large part the safeguard be leave to be decide by regulation what level of qualification and training will doctor need to have how will mental capacity be assess who can be proxy what happen if the self administration of drug go wrong and person suffer complication but do not die when press on the key safeguard and key issue supporter of the bill say that they be problem that can be approve later the same go for how the bill will actually be deliver will it be deliver by the nhs and if so how will private provider be commission and if so how by who and on what term will for profit provider be allow all those question go unanswered by the bill have hop that they would be answer in committee but they be not and instead we get even more reliance on delegate power first that mean that mps can not make judgment about assist dying and how it will work in practice on training for example mp might assume that the training provide will be robust two week course on assess coercive control but there be no such requirement in the bill indeed the impact assessment suggest that it would be short course secondly regulation can not override statute and be ultimately bind by it while it might be reassure that code of practice must be issue to take into account how depression can impair person decision making as the royal college of psychiatrists recently remind we that do not change the fact that impaired judgment do not mean that someone lack capacity thirdly leave all those matter to be consider by guidance and regulation place they outside the democratic control of mps with limited exception we will not get vote on those regulation and will have no input directly or indirectly in formulate they the case for the defence might be that reliance on such guidance and regulation be inevitable with bill of this complexity but the experience of other common law jurisdiction suggest that that be not the case in victoria the first australian state to legalise assist die there be only page of regulation and much more have be include in the act which be necessarily long than the bill before we that be good thing as it mean more parliamentary scrutiny wholly understand why it be not possible for the hon member for spen valley kim leadbeater to draft bill as detail as the australian act before second reading but have hop that with the help of government resource those gap would have be fill in committee and on report sadly that be not the case interruption have much more to speak about but heed your cough madam deputy speaker let say clearly that will vote against the bill but even if member disagree with they should please vote for my amendment begin by thank my hon friend the member for spen valley kim leadbeater who have exemplify the integrity and transparency that we need in public service will speak about amendment to which be introduce by the right hon member for salisbury john glen early because as former lawyer they concern in committee the minister of state ministry of justice my hon and learn friend the member for finchley and golders green sarah sackman be clear that the panel decision will be subject to public law principle that will include procedural propriety and an absence of bias include the appearance of bias my concern be that the panel be deliberately design to be inquisitorial it be intend to collect information it be not mean to be adversarial like court will the hon lady give way on that point no will make some progress require judicial oath would be inappropriate because the panel be not perform judicial function it be specialist administrative panel whose first priority must be focus on safeguarding and the review of evidence will my hon friend give way on that point no will make some progress and expand on my point disqualifying retired and deputy judge would only shrink the pool of experienced candidate and do not believe that those change would make the process safe more effective or well instead they would make it more difficult to appoint expert to allow the panel to function as the necessary safeguard that it need to be finally turn to the most important aspect of the bill which be those who be affect directly opponent present hypothetical but have hear real story from my constituent who support the bill one constituent tell about her husband who die of metastatic prostate cancer he want to die at home and despite the effort of dedicated palliative care team his final month be mark by excruciate pain our constituent deserve well they deserve the choice to say goodbye in peace surround by love one without unbearable pain for this debate be about whether the status quo be acceptable after hear these story and listen to lawyer and doctor know that it be not if we vote in favour of the bill our constituent must be able to expect that it will be bring into law quickly therefore oppose amendment the british public overwhelmingly support the bill they be look to this house for courage and leadership that be why will vote for the bill with the amendment that strengthen it let we bring dignity peace and choice to those face the end of their life in difficulty and pain before come to the substantive part of my speech would like to pick up on the comment of the hon member for north warwickshire and bedworth rachel taylor have sign the amendment table by my right hon friend the member for salisbury john glen support they because think the panel need strengthen it be not the case that court have to be adversarial tribunal be set up to be inquisitive in fact the mental health tribunal be set up to be inquisitive that be why in committee table amendment to use tribunal panel as the mechanism for scrutinise decision making it have be real pleasure to listen to the debate particularly in relation to the prohibition of advertising because the debate start to move to focus on the issue of suicide promotion and prevention have be quite concerned from the beginning that that have not be part of what we have be talk about duty to prevent suicide whether they be doctor duty under article of the european convention on human right the nhs clinical duty around suicide prevention or duty relate to the mental health act be blind spot in the bill the reason why the issue have not be focus on until now be that the bill have be frame as the assist die bill as oppose to the assist suicide bill blame myself in part for that because start by call it physician assist suicide but then start use the term assist dying because it be in common parlance and it be what everyone be use the problem be that it frame it as something else it frame it as reduce the die process as oppose to what it be which be an act to end somebody life that be why the bill amend the suicide act and it be why have table similar amendment on how it be conceptualise take issue with some of the language be use we have hear the word murder kill and suicide twenty three year ago next week my husband die of terminal cancer he be in extreme pain and be give morphine to relieve it as the pain get bad he be give more morphine so that he could die gently and not in complete agony this be about help people die in civilised way and help their family to not go through the horrendous experience of watch love one die in agony to call it murder and killing be so wrong and we have duty to mind our language with this bill it be about help people die quickly and with dignity it be assist die order before dr spencer resume note that this have be well temper debate let we keep it so we know our constituent be watch thank the hon member for her intervention of course there be situation in which decision to end one life be perfectly understandable indeed rational spend my career look after people many of whom present to and to medical service with thought about want to end their life many of they have mental illness some have terminal illness the fundamental problem with the bill be that it have complete blind spot for those people who be highly vulnerable it be scandalous that we have get to this point and be still have debate about the core concept the bill should have be deal with properly from the start with royal commission or review so that we do not get to the point where we be still debate core principle on report over the past month have table amendment that think would help get the bill if it become law to point of ensure that the most vulnerable be protect my amendment and would work to edit the code of practice for the bill to ensure that there be clear guidance with regard to doctor duty suicide prevention article on the protection of human life and interaction with the mental health act the bill be currently blind on what to do with people detain in hospital and patient present with suicidal thought have great concern that many people who be quite unwell psychologically will start present to service seek an assist death rather than present with suicidal ideation will not be the only person in this place who have lose someone they love to suicide in listen to what have be say recently by the royal college of psychiatrists which be not oppose to the bill in principle the penny drop for many of we that many people give terminal diagnosis will have mental health issue that come with that how do the hon member think we can distinguish between person who choose to end their own life because of mental health issue cause by despair from have terminal illness and somebody who want to end their life because of despair cause by something else do that not blur our approach to the importance and sanctity of life and to prevent suicide in every circumstance thank the hon member for his intervention of course these be difficult thing to disentangle people will say you would say this would you ben but we should get the person in front of psychiatrist or clinical nurse specialist work in psychiatry this be what psychiatry do this be what it be about that be why table amendment to ensure that the person be put in front of psychiatrist as part of the process to deal with the blind spot interruption apology madam deputy speaker will finish now my amendment would ensure that the code of practice clarify the interaction with service will the hon member give way think be push it try to intervene on the hon member for spen valley kim leadbeater to ask what she think about that she be welcome to intervene on now if she have further point to add otherwise ask the minister to address those point rise to speak to amendment which would require the dos and type of lethal drug to be properly license by the mhra it be important that put it on the record that do not think the bill be safe it do not provide adequate safeguard most importantly it will deepen and exacerbate inequality on that know that speak for ten of thousand of disabled people who rightly say we need assistance to live not to die throughout the passage of the bill hon member across the house have receive many letter and briefing from lead expert include this week letter from over doctor across all area of medical practice express their clear view that the bill do not provide answer on how we can improve management of the end of people life they say that the drug expect to be use in assist death should undergo rigorous testing and approval as would be require for any other prescribed medication those requirement be miss from the bill indeed there be nothing in the bill require lethal drug to be regulate by the medicines and healthcare product regulatory agency that be contrary to good medical practice many of we will have hear that in oregon complication with drug use for assist dying occur in about of death and include vomiting seizure and prolonged death of up to hour where be the requirement in the bill to inform patient about how those risk include prolong dying might be manage where be the plan to identify the most acceptable medication if they have not already do so urge hon member to consider this letter sign by many lead expert if we do not listen to they the very people who would have to implement the bill who will we listen to on that point will my hon friend give way will not take any intervention it be clear that the bill do not protect vulnerable patient from coercion in the un human right expert raise concern that even if assist die be restrict to those with terminal illness disabled and old people may feel subtly pressure to end their life due to social attitude and lack of appropriate service and support across the house we know that support for disabled and old people be inadequate we know that disabled people continue to face disproportionate level of poverty isolation and hardship until that change urge every member to think and not vote for the bill rise to speak in support of new clause to table by the hon member for spen valley kim leadbeater to support amendment and and to oppose amendment pay tribute to the hon member for spen valley for her compassionate leadership and immense hard work to the member of all view who serve on the bill committee for their thoughtful and hard work and to those who have work behind the scene to scrutinise the bill and contribute to the debate thank all the constituent who have be in touch with all of we be sure that like hon member have carefully reflect on those contribution and take they into account it be clear that the status quo be not acceptable that be why it be right that we have this legislation before we and that we be scrutinise it so carefully and look at it in such immense detail turn to new clause regard the regulation of substance for use in assisted dying those substance obviously have to be properly regulate although it be equally obvious that they can not be subject to conventional clinical trial in the same way as other medicine which be why the proposal to make that process go through the mhra be inappropriate the regulation provide for in new clause will ensure that that critical part of the process be carry out with the high possible level of scrutiny and harm prevention it be essential that there be transparency and assurance of the process from manufacture all the way through to administration which be what new clause do be interested in what the hon lady say about the safety of those drug do any adverse event datum exist globally to quantify how much harm and suffering could be cause while induce the die process thank the hon member for raise that issue and give the opportunity to speak about the detailed evidence give by my constituent emeritus professor sam ahmedzai with whom speak at length yesterday about precisely this detail have review number of table of datum about this any substance have side effect but as the comment make today have indicate in reality those substance be be hold to far high standard than substance routinely use in palliative care we have to recognise that there be huge amount of evidence about the efficacy of the substance that be talk about in relation to assisted dying there be huge amount of publish peer review evidence about the effectiveness of those substance and people like professor ahmedzai who have year of experience and be global expert in this area point out that we know how to assist people to have peaceful compassionate death effectively and that be what the bill be about help people who be terminally ill to die with dignity and to face those final moment with the support love and care of their family around they not in agony but in whatever degree of peace be possible when face death as the hon member for west worcestershire dame harriett baldwin say new clause which relate to advertising have be develop in consultation as result of concern raise by opponent to the bill to try to ensure the crucial fact that assist dying be not an advertised service there be crucial distinction between advertising and information and this new clause will ensure that assisted die remain careful clinical process and not something that would be promote commercially it be balanced cross party safeguard support by people on all side of this debate will the hon lady give way be very short of time so think have well continue turn to new clause which relate to the role of coroner if the bill be pass assist dying would be very strictly regulate process the choice of an individual not death cause by other but by the individual themselves as aneez esmail have point out this would be the most scrutinise type of death in the country and it therefore make no sense to require another legal process at the end when there have already be multiple layer of scrutiny before the death will the hon lady give way be so sorry but we be very short of time new clause be compassionate and practical clause there be strong safeguard already in place and require coroner inquest would go against the spirit of compassion that should be drive we all will briefly turn to amendment table by the hon member for newcastle under lyme adam jogee which would remove the backstop commencement essentially the amendment would leave it in the hand of the secretary of state to decide when or if the bill come into effect that would go against the will of the house if the house pass this bill it be perfectly reasonable and workable for the detail of it to be work out within the next four year we have already double the length of time allow for that to happen amendment be effectively wreck amendment that seek to kick the bill into the long grass interruption that would be its effect to conclude will briefly address the misconception that seem to have inform some of the comment have hear in today debate which be the assumption that family would want to pressure family member to die quick my mum be specialist palliative care social worker and she have tell that in all her year of practice she have never experience that happen it be the other way around rise be sorry but be conclude we be each speak from our own experience and from the heart rise order the hon lady have make it clear that she be not take intervention at this time the evidence show that it be die people themselves face the end of life who wish to have the choice only small number of they will take up that choice but it be crucial humane and compassionate for we to offer they the choice assisted dying be complementary to palliative care not contradictory and this bill have be through huge amount of scrutiny far more than any other bill in this session therefore deeply hope that the house will pass this compassionate humane clearly draft and tightly structured bill to offer dignified death to those who be face death rise to speak to my amendment which concern the appointment of the voluntary assist die commissioner in committee it be decide that the prime minister would appoint the voluntary assist die commissioner and that the appointee would serve for five year and be responsible for appoint the assist die review panel the commissioner would also oversee the training of panel member give they guidance on the procedure to be use and crucially decide when case that panel have refuse should be refer to another panel for reconsideration accord to the bill the commissioner will not be act as judge but they must be current or former senior judge of the supreme court court of appeal or high court however they be not require to have any expertise in medicine or healthcare importantly follow our consideration in committee the bill no long require that the chief medical officer be responsible for monitor whether or not the assisted die regime complie with the law that responsibility have now be transfer to the voluntary assist die commissioner so the person in charge of oversee the process and set up the panel will also be the person decide whether the act be be administer correctly give the scandal we have see in healthcare over many year from infected blood and medicine that should not have be prescribe to what happen at mid staffs hospital it be clear that have that independent robust oversight from the chief medical officer be good way forward if people be go to be able to trust this legislation if it come into law my hon friend make valid point the point of my amendment as will come on to be that we need to ensure as much scrutiny as possible in this regard from what have outline this be clearly an exceptionally important post which carry great responsibility and significant power indeed it seem the postholder will require the judgment of solomon to be able to fulfil their role it be therefore surprising that as the bill stand there be no requirement for pre appointment scrutiny by the relevant select committee despite the profile of the post and the controversy it will inevitably attract consider that such pre appointment scrutiny be require for the chair of the competition and markets authority the chair of the bbc the chair of the charity commission the information commissioner the chair of the care quality commission the health service commissioner for england the chair of the judicial appointments commission and the chair of the uk statistics authority the omission of such scrutiny in this case be clearly serious oversight which my amendment seek to remedy by ensure that the correct select committee have the power of scrutiny in my view we need to guard the right and privilege of parliament jealously we must ensure that parliament be involve in the scrutiny of this legislation go forward as much as we possibly can the bill itself require this to be as rigorous and transparent as be possible no matter what side of the debate we be on it be important to ensure that the bill be as strong and as good as it possibly can be we owe it to the people who send we here the people who have be write to we in such great number my amendment seek to strengthen the bill in respect of the voluntary assist die commissioner refer right hon and hon member to my entry on the register of members financial interests be an nhs consultant paediatrician the debate so far have focus primarily on ethical consideration legal framework and who will be eligible the who the when and the why but want to focus my remark on the how as doctor know that various drug in different combination can be fatal in other word there be more than one way to kill people which would be the good drug if that be what we wish to do which would be the most comfortable and how do we know some form of assist die use neuromuscular blockade which in common parlance mean that they paralyse the body imagine situation where someone in lot of pain be give such drug from the outside they would look relaxed and peaceful as their muscle relax but inside they would be in lot of pain and unable to express that to anybody else do we want people to be comfortable and to know that they be comfortable or only to appear comfortable to we clearly we want they to be comfortable inside as well we therefore need to have drug that be properly understand and regulate for this purpose assisted dying be often portray as safe peaceful and controlled but the reality in comparable country where it have be legalise so far be more complicated technical difficulty frequently arise lead to complication cause great suffering require intervention and potentially lead to prolonged and painful death report in the bmj by dr suzy lishman former president of the royal college of pathologists who should say work at the same trust as show that there be lack of reliable datum on the effectiveness and safety of the drug use largely due to inconsistent reporting in jurisdiction where such dying be legal in belgium it be estimate that only of euthanasia case be report to the federal commission for the control and evaluation of euthanasia during select committee visit in the last parliament to oregon to discuss assist dying which and two other hon member from the labour benches go on we hear about the complication be unknown in of case no healthcare professional be present when the drug be give so we could not really know and we do not even know if the drug have be take in some case where we do we find history of seizure vomiting and prolong death on have be give the drug patient in nine case in oregon in have reawaken later how they feel in the intervene time be difficult for we to know in washington report find that of patient take more than minute to die also remind hon member that an absence of evidence that thing be not go well be not evidence of an absence of thing go wrong thank the hon lady for so eloquently describe some of the variation in the use of drug in the case of assist dying in normal practice we have yellow card scheme which allow for any adverse event from ingestion of prescribe medication to be report be it her understanding that under the current proposal that would not happen for assist dying be she also aware of review that show great variation in the range and dosage of drug use think one of the key problem with this form of intervention compare with other be that we can not ask the patient afterwards how that feel we can not get their feedback because they be dead if we be go to give they thing such as neuromuscular blocker or sedative we may not be able to tell what they feel there be physiological way in which we can monitor patient and get some idea perhaps in their heart rate or blood pressure but we will not be do that that is therefore one of the reason for my table the amendment to ensure that the drug be properly regulate by the mhra so that we know that they have be properly test on the purpose for which they be to be use will the hon lady give way will the hon lady give way do not have much time and do not want madam deputy speaker cough to return laughter if one examine the litany of drug involve in other jurisdiction where assist dying be legal it make for troubling reading it be often an ad hoc cocktail of lethal substance include sedative analgesic cardiotoxic agent neuromuscular blocker and antiemetic there be no internationally agree drug regime jurisdiction such as oregon canada and the netherlands use vary combination of barbiturate sedative opioid and antiemetic in the official oregon report state that compare with single barbiturate all drug combination have show long median time until death as the bill currently stand doctor will have to consider prescribe untested drug or drug combination which could potentially breach the general medical council prescribing guidance that doctor must be satisfied that the drug serve the patient need to address some of those concern have table several amendment amendment and ensure that no drug can be approve under the act unless there be scientific consensus that it be effective and do not cause undue pain or side effect and that it have be specifically license for that purpose by the mhra can not really understand why anyone would disagree with that amendment clarifie that the secretary of state be not compel to approve any drug if after consultation it be conclude that no substance be appropriate or safe enough to meet the standard amendment alongside amendment mandate that before any regulation be lay before parliament comprehensive report must be provide that report must include time to death possible complication include pain and any likely side effect of the propose substance again can not see why that would be controversial because surely we all want everybody to be fully inform and make fully inform decision and that be part of make an informed decision amendment to new clause require any medical device for self administration be approve by the mhra and that the secretary of state consult the mhra before make any regulation that be basic safeguard that we would expect in any medical intervention and it should be non negotiable condition here finally amendment remove time limit and therefore the pressure on the secretary of state understand other people concern about that there be often narrative that it will lead to patient be able to die at time and in place of their choosing however the regulation in the bill require the doctor to stay with the patient from the moment the drug be give until they be dead we have hear that that could take quite long time do we really have enough doctor to do this at people home at time of their choosing at the moment do not think we do and do not see how in short period of time that will be achievable either stand in support of new clause and along with amendment and and to all of which be in the name of my hon friend the member for spen valley kim leadbeater colleague need not fear will not speak to all of they be proud welsh mp and lot of the debate today have centre on difference or confusion about the distinction on devolution on aspect of the bill focus on new clause and consequential amendment pay tribute to my hon friend the member for spen valley and to the right hon member for dwyfor meirionnydd liz saville roberts for their work together on this issue to ensure that people in wales can access the assist dying process in the welsh language if that be their preference in the last few month have meet with many constituent about this bill include medical professional and palliative care consultant one of their overarching concern be fear that the language barrier may inadvertently impact on the ability of relevant person in wales properly to access and understand the assisted dying process be grateful to those constituent include dr siwan seaman and professor mark taubert accordingly new clause and amendment be important they seek to replace clause and provide welsh version of the form for the first or second declaration the report about the first or second assessment of person and the final statement far they stipulate that where relevant person inform the voluntary assist die commissioner that they wish to communicate in welsh the commissioner must take all reasonable step to ensure that that wish be respect and that communication by the relevant assist die review panel be in welsh these be important amendment as they be about accessibility and respect ensure that language be never barrier to compassionate end of life care they uphold the principle of linguistic equality which be well establish in public service in wales and trust that that should not be controversial to colleague when they come to vote later on as welsh mp be pleased to see the inclusion of amendment and while they may appear to be small amendment they be important as my hon friend the member for spen valley say they fully respect the devolution settlement by ensure that welsh ministers have all necessary power on devolved aspect of the bill health while retain the power of uk ministers over aspect that be not devolve think that be slightly misunderstood early by some in this debate take together the amendment provide clarity and legal certainty and offer reassurance to patient clinician and government agency in wales that principle should be uncontroversial know from my own discussion with the welsh government and the welsh health minister that he be extremely grateful for the interaction he have have with my hon friend the member for spen valley and he be confident this measure be workable from the welsh perspective new clause seek to mandate that the secretary of state must within six month publish report set out the impact of this legislation on the civil procedure rule and probate proceeding during the debate and the stream of evidence we have hear do not recall suggestion that this bill be likely to result in any serious change to those specifically reference matter on the contrary england cmo professor sir chris whitty warn against create bureaucratic thicket say that the good safeguard be the simple one let we keep that at the centre of our mind when we consider this legislation and avoid insert amendment that be no doubt well intentione but would create such thicket conclude by share one story from constituent of mine who be focus very much on safeguard which have be the debate on all these amendment and new clause will the hon gentleman give way will not because want to finish up appreciate the hon member forbearance that constituent be claire claire be originally diagnose with irritable bowel syndrome it be only much later that it be realise she have stage cancer within an hour of this house vote to pass this bill on second reading claire message to say what powerful debate today it hard to say pleased as it terrible issue to have to contemplate but it such relief to know the next stage be open and hopefully allay the fear of those talk about safeguard claire lose her battle with cancer last month so be pleased that we be here again discuss the specific of this bill and talk about amendment in good faith that either side think will enhance its safeguard in honour of claire and for all those like she urge colleague to support the amendment and new clause have outline and to support the bill itself rise to speak in support of amendment to amendment which be in my name should also refer to my entry in the register of members financial interests about my involvement with the royal college of psychiatrists new clause we be tell be replacement for clause hope that member have take the time to compare the two new clause contain even more power than clause it follow the trend of this bill instead of more detail be add more power be add it seem to that the line be there be some issue that we sort out later but that this place will not be involve in that later what be particularly concern be that the power that the bill create contain no explicit limit or guide principle by which they be to be exercise nor do we have the benefit of policy paper from the secretary of state say how he intend to exercise those power or how his successor will believe that the provision relate to approve and new clause face real problem as dr greg lawton barrister and pharmacist tell the committee in write evidence the lethal substance intend to end life be not medicinal product within the meaning of the human medicines regulations that definition be itself derive from eu law which state that the term medicinal product must be interpret as not cover substance whose effect merely modify physiological function and which be not such as to entail immediate or long term beneficial effect for human health that create the real problem if the substance be not medicinal product why do the bill provide that pharmacist be to be involve in their preparation and why would doctor be supply they new clause seek to get around the problem by give the power to the secretary of state to amend the human medicines regulations so that the substance fit in the impact assessment tell we that the government have no plan to conduct or rely on the sort of scientific study normally do for drug approval or for the mhra to be involve as pharmacist should say that the drug to be use for assist dying be commonly use in pharmacy now it would be obvious for pharmacy to supply those drug in some way shape or form accept the hon member point about medicine be use but he will hope accept my point how would the same study use to approve treatment be use to approve their use for death think the hon gentleman say in an early intervention that those medicine would then be use off licence to the risk of the prescribing doctor and the person use they that be where the risk fall back on the individual rather than be cover by anything in the bill that be where my regret come understand the need to treat the substance as medicinal product in england and wales if it be the will of the house to change the law here what can not understand be why the law should change the situation for the rest of the united kingdom that be the basis of my amendment to amendment the house be not vote for assist dying in northern ireland so it have no locus to change the definition of medicinal product in northern ireland in order to accommodate this bill which we have be tell apply to england and wales only or be it the intention of the bill sponsor or those behind she to extend it to northern ireland at later date use some of the henry viii regulation in it there be further issue in northern ireland we be still in part subject to eu law and would be interested to know whether the government have consider that aspect can the minister really change by ministerial diktat eu law in northern ireland when it come to the use of these substance if so why be he not be grant such power in other area of significance to northern ireland why only this why have so much government time previously be spend on medicine regulation and supply for northern ireland why do the right hon member for melton and syston edward argar as the minister of state for health and as the minister of health in northern ireland spend so much time on that to that extent ask the hon member for spen valley kim leadbeater and the minister what engagement have there be with the department of health in northern ireland or the chief pharmaceutical officer for northern ireland or be this another part of the bill that be be put in to meet the promoter need without any background or engagement in conclusion the application of those provision to northern ireland also have implication for the conscience protection if as result of regulation make under those provision pharmacist in northern ireland be require to be involve in the manufacture or preparation of such substance they will not have the benefit of the conscience clause as that clause have not be extend to northern ireland therefore oppose the extension of those provision to northern ireland and scotland will also oppose amendment and ask hon member to support amendment to amendment in my name rise to speak in support of amendment which be table in my name will minimise my comment to maximise the time available to other hon member owe to the widespread unease among nhs practitioner and the grow number of concerned voice about the bill shortcoming if it be pass by the house still hope that it will not be it be likely that assisted death will take place away from the public sector indeed the bill do not prevent assist death from be outsource to private company and there be no definition of what reasonable remuneration mean in return for help to end someone life my amendment seek to ensure that provider publish annually the number of people to whom they have provide those service the cost of do so and the revenue receive in return many hon member will be guide by their religion when they vote on these issue although deeply respect that be not person of faith if there be booming baritone voice appeal to my conscience it be not that of god but that of nye bevan who be concern about the commodification of care in his time the worry be about the role of the market in extend life today my concern be about the potential role of the market in end it throughout the bill passage we have discuss different kind of coercion by individual on the life of people whose protection be entrust to we as labour mp do not think that we can have this debate without address the economic coercion experience by the vulnerable in our society as someone who have sit beside bed and pray for mercy genuinely understand the attraction of argument around freedom of choice but argue for that as fundamental principle in isolation without also acknowledge the economic social and cultural context in which people make such choice be not labour approach to the issue do the hon member agree that no matter how many new clause we introduce we can not militate against people be vulnerable particularly financially accord to the charity mind million people in this country have consider suicide because of financial hardship how could we militate against that the hon member make an important point that we have to consider we must recognise that as he say people choice be limit by the unfair distribution of wealth the injustice that disable people face throughout their life or the attitude of the powerful in society towards those who be less fortunate if my hon friend look at the statistic he will see that it be usually the well off in society who choose assist dying not the less well off will come to that point shortly we have duty to ask whether the poor and most vulnerable will be coerce into choose assist die over palliative care because of economic disadvantage will they be exploit by those with financial interest in their choosing to end their life will their death become commodity if we be really go to pass legislation that allow someone death to become matter of business we must have full transparency on those financial motivation and my amendment would require that if we be really go to pass legislation that allow someone death to become matter of business we must have full transparency on those financial motivation and my amendment would require that carer in the private sector be not bad people any more than people work directly in the nhs but private healthcare operate in context the evidence that profit influence the moral choice make in the care and treatment that be already provide in this country be overwhelming this be not hypothetical concern for example systematic review publish by the bmj find that private equity ownership of healthcare be associate with low standard of care around the wonderful miracle of ivf there be an industry profit from people desperation as they start life rather than end it already at the end of life this relate to the point make by my hon friend the member for stroud dr opher choice in palliative care be limit by economic status with the wealthy more likely to die good death than the poor my amendment seek to address the fundamental question of whether free choice really be free by bring into daylight the financial motivation of those involve in individual decision my hon friend make strong argument for exclude private for profit provider he may know that table an amendment in committee that would have limit the provision of assist die to charity unfortunately it be reject will he clarify where and how he think assisted dying should be provide and his understanding of the bill in that respect give the lack of clarification we have have from my hon friend the member for spen valley kim leadbeater my hon friend make an important point amendment seek to recognise that there be difference in where private provider income stream come from and that that raise moral issue will my hon friend accept one more intervention do not wish to exacerbate your bronchitis madam deputy speaker so will continue amendment touch on fundamental point at the heart of the debate disabled people and the sick in every aspect of their life have to fight every day for resource from state market and society that view they as drain on finance do we honestly believe that at the moment when the most vulnerable be least able to argue for themselves under the most intense societal and cultural pressure and at their most expensive those same public and private sector institution will succeed in make choice real for they when they have fail to do so throughout the rest of their life even if we stretch credulity and convince ourselves that that will be true in the state sector can we say that it will be true in the market do not believe that the bill should be pass but if it be let we not make it bad by allow unscrutinised profit from the loss of human being rise to speak in support of amendment and to new clause new clause and and amendment to new clause will make two observation at the outset do so as welshman represent an english constituency as former chair of the northern ireland affairs committee and as the current chair of the public administration and constitutional affairs committee remain to be convince despite the confidence express by the bill promoter that the bill honour in spirit and letter the devolution settlement base on the expression on the face of the chair of the scottish affairs committee the hon member for glasgow west patricia ferguson do not think she believe that it honour the devolution settlement as far as scotland be concerned either also make the point that we be here to make law that have to stand the test of time she be not the only one to do so but the hon member for north herefordshire ellie chowns share heartfelt anecdote about conversation with her mother as result of her mother professional work know how easy it be to do because it be trap that have fall into but particularly on an issue as emotive and literally life change as this we should not base our decision just on anecdote we must base it on cold analysis of what be before we it be almost six month to the day since the bill be introduce and still think it be well describe as skeletal we have be tell time and again by the hon member for spen valley kim leadbeater and the minister how busy official have be look at the practicality of the bill and how to operationalise it and make it workable yet this house be keep in the dark on what ministers intend indeed the hon and learn member for folkestone and hythe tony vaughan say in his early contribution that his understanding be that the hon lady be still prepared to work with colleague to perfect the bill but madam deputy speaker we be on the second day of report stage and we could easily fall to third reading today the time for that evolutionary conversation be long past the time for detailed clarification be now the bill remain skeletal the most common phrase in the government impact assessment be not know time and unknown eight time it be leave to the times to ferret out the information that minister be think of outsource end the life of the terminally ill to private contractor on for profit basis the hon member for east renfrewshire blair mcdougall who speak before reference nye bevan can hear nye spinning in his grave at the thought of that rather than fill in the blank and constrain the power to be give to ministers even more henry viii power have be add henry viii power which be not in the original bill we be tell know full well that many right hon and hon member buy this that the role of the committee and the further stage of the bill would provide all the answer dot all the cross all the and provide full clarification that have not happen this house rightly bridle when ministers of the crown bring forward legislation that have an unhealthy reliance on henry viii power if we bridle at other such legislation we certainly should bridle at this bill it be begin to feel as if this be deliberate tactic keep thing vague do not make anything too real or tangible and do not confront what this will mean day to day let just keep it light let keep it airy fairy let keep it in the cloud of principle and somehow or another through benign intervention good will accrue this be too serious an issue in which to place that faith because it could be misplace that rely on we as member of parliament not to care to switch off when we hear the word secondary legislation something that we know can often be deal with in five or minute in committee room with or people select by the whips and no debate on the floor of the house this be not niche issue for the hansard society or the delegated powers and regulatory reform committee and it would be shame and stain on this house and this parliament if we be to nod through bill that give we the idea that henry viii be the way to go will the hon gentleman give way will not be very conscious of time madam deputy speaker give that so many right hon and hon member have be constrain in the length of their contribution because of your persistent cough say that not as criticism and that next week we have lot of one line whip and the follow week we have exactly the same more time really should be give to the bill do wish the government have take it on not as government bill but by find government time for report on the floor of the house this be too serious an issue to have as many gap and lacunae as this bill have the found father of the united states work on the basis that the vague generality of the constitution would always be adhere to and that man and woman of goodwill would adhere to it be pretty certain that they be now begin posthumously with the current incarnation to wonder whether that be true we should not be legislate to leave it up to ministers to define regulation and decide how they come forward we have bills that have page after page after page which when people ask themselves what be this all about actually amount to very little the amendment that have be table and which support have be table in good faith but be afraid to say that in try to improve the bill they be try to make silk purse out of sow ear rise to support new clause and and amendment and to they be all about the right people have the right power at the right time and they respect the devolution settlement for wales be mindful of time and therefore be sorry but will not take intervention be extremely grateful to my hon friend the member for spen valley kim leadbeater for engage so meaningfully and strongly with the welsh government include go to cardiff to speak with welsh health ministers and official to ensure that they be continually consult during this process new clause ensure that the secretary of state not the chief medical officer be responsible for issue guidance on the operation of the bill it enhance oversight and accountability by place that responsibility with the secretary of state so that scrutiny and accountability regard how the bill will be implement in practice be put in the right place it be normal practice that official whose role and responsibility may alter over time be not name in primary legislation it be however important to note that the chief medical officer be not be cut out of the process because the chief medical officer for england and wales must be consult the new clause also allow person with learn disability and other protect characteristic as well as provider of palliative care service to contribute to the process of provision guidance it be simple but important measure that ensure the right level of ministerial oversight and urge colleague to support it as my hon friend the member for cardiff west mr barros curtis have explain it be important to urge member to support new clause because it ensure that people in wales be able to access the assist dying process in the welsh language if that be their preference almost of the population in wales speak welsh and it be so important that they can access this service in their language should they wish to do so it be small change but it will make huge difference to patient family and clinician in wales amendment and simply refine provision around the use of interpreter require the secretary of state to publish code of practice on the matter interpreter be essential to ensure fair and equal access to the assisted dying process for those whose first language be not english or welsh amendment and provide great detail on the welsh government responsibility in deliver assist die service in wales some hon member seem confused about what be and be not devolve but as welsh mp wholeheartedly support the amendment which respect devolution they ensure that welsh ministers have all the power they need regard the devolved aspect of the bill and the health provision while retain the power of uk ministers over those aspect that be not devolve such as criminal justice provision and crucially change to the suicide act amendment and clarify how and when provision relate to voluntary assist dying will come into force in wales they do not impinge on the devolution settlement but simply provide clarity and legal certainty all the amendment would help my constituent noah year old with terminal brain tumour who know what he want if his pain become unbearable the bill be about give people like noah the choice control and compassion that they deserve at the end of life who be we to deny that choice pay tribute once again to my hon friend the member for spen valley for work closely with official in both wales and this place to craft what could be the strong and most safeguard assist die legislation anywhere in the world it be bill design to protect everyone include my constituent in monmouthshire and people across wales thank to the careful consider amendment include the one that have speak about today the bill not only respect the devolution settlement but ensure that the right people hold the right power at the right time to deliver this law safely urge member to join in the aye lobby to legislate to protect the right of the terminally ill in their final month to legislate for compassion for choice and for dignity diolch yn fawr iawn dirprwy lefarydd rise to speak to amendment to which stand in my name clause on the provision of information in welsh and english and new clause which be table by the hon member for spen valley kim leadbeater other have touch on the welsh language and will touch on the settlement in wales as well in relation to the welsh language we be talk about something that be quite conventional form and guidance should be available in write welsh however of much more significance be the opportunity for people to use welsh it may well be their first language in deal with the provision in this bill my amendment would ensure that all reasonable step be take to find co ordinating doctor and an independent doctor who can question people in welsh where necessary would dearly like it to be more than all reasonable step but the reality be that we have to deal with the staff who be available and the language skill that they have thank the hon member for spen valley for table new clause it recognise that it be really important for welsh speak individual to be able to communicate in the language in which they can well express themselves when it come to the assist die review panel because that be the final stage at which we will recognise whether there be question of coercion and capacity welcome the fact that there be different clinical specialist on the panel believe that have an expert psychiatrist and social worker will help to identify potential question of coercion and capacity because they will have different approach to those question must step back to the reality of how welsh language speaker can use welsh in the justice system which be where the assist die review panel come in in the justice system an individual have the right to speak welsh if they use welsh in court an interpreter will be use to interpret their word to the people to whom they be speak that be not acceptable in this context this be the most serious and most desperately difficult conversation that people will have and they must be able not just to speak welsh but to be hear in their own language if all the subtlety and what they really want to express be to be hear will not press my amendment to and will support new clause wholeheartedly turn to the senedd power particularly those in clause welcome new clause which provide clarity on the responsibility of ministers in the welsh government and the uk government but there be two issue here the clarity of power and respect across legislature have concern about amendment and table by the hon member for spen valley which would amend the amendment move by the hon member for richmond park sarah olney in committee what do those amendment do they ensure vote in the senedd to decide when the bill will come into force in its entirety in wales the scottish parliament pass stage two of the assisted dying for terminally ill adult scotland bill on may such bill could not be bring forward in wales because wales have no power over criminal law the bill that we be discuss today could not be bring forward in wales although appreciate what the hon member for cardiff west mr barros curtis and for monmouthshire catherine fookes say about the devolution settlement and be glad that we have clarity there be also question of respect for decision already make in the senedd as thing stand what do the senedd have to do it will be require to pass legislative consent motion as require by the sewel convention but that can be ignore by the uk parliament this legislation effect action in wales but the sewel convention can be overridden as can an lcm the second thing that can happen in the senedd and this will be expect be in those area that be within the power of the senedd on commencement decision be require on the provision of the bill that have devolve competency specifically the nhs in wales bear in mind that if that consent be refuse in wales the bill if enact can be bring in only in the private sector that decision lie with the senedd critically number of we have raise the debate on october last year when the senedd debate in principle the question of assist dying and the senedd vote against it professor emyr lewis of aberystwyth university believe that to be highly significant and agree by the way the first minister and the health minister of wales vote against the principle of what we be discuss here to therefore the amendment make in committee that allow the senedd to have vote on the entirety of the bill commencement when enact be highly significant although support much of the bill in principle and in broad detail can not support amendment and because they would roll back on that rise to speak to amendment which stand in my name want to be clear that decision on amendment would not be vote for or against assisted dying the amendment be about prevent any government of any political persuasion from rewrite the very purpose of the nhs use small group of mps in committee room rather than debate on the floor of the house the amendment seek to protect the foundational document of our nhs and ensure that any change to it be properly debate in open parliament as the public should expect let explain why that matter in committee clause be add to the bill the clause give future secretary of state sweep power to amend exist health law through delegate legislation subsection allow future government to change the very purpose of the nhs by amend section of the national health service act my hon friend be set out her concern eloquently what concern do she have that the bill write blank cheque for future health secretary to change the nature of the nhs without parliamentary scrutiny that be the whole purpose of my amendment and my speech section of the act be the legal foundation on which every nhs duty rest guarantee that our nhs will serve everyone always the section which express the promise of comprehensive health service design to secure improvement in the physical and mental health of the people of england have remain virtually unchanged since those word speak by nye bevan and enshrine in law set out the purpose of the nhs national health service free at the point of delivery rise order before an intervention be take may put it on the record that member should not be wander into the chamber and then very quickly make an intervention lot of members be wait to speak and to make intervention be that the case have you be in the chamber for while indicate assent okay go on do use the facility madam deputy speaker apologise for that be gentleman of an age laughter thank my hon friend for take an intervention we be about to reach the anniversary of the landslide labour government which set the nhs in train and the anniversary of the nhs fundamental to that be her point about the nhs be free at the point of need and be about care compassion and life what assessment have she make of how the bill if it go through unamended will fundamentally challenge that great victory and legacy that labour members cherish the power to alter the intention as mention by my hon friend be not in the bill we vote for in november that be why have table my amendment to prevent anyone from tamper with the nhs as found by our forefather let we be clear about what clause would allow it would allow minister through delegate legislation to rewrite the very purpose of our nhs it would let they do so without the full scrutiny that primary legislation demand and it would mean that parliament could be deny any real chance to amend or reject that change these be not abstract constitutional concern this be about whether the found promise of the nhs can be quietly rewrite not through open debate or an act of parliament but by handful of mp behind close door in committee room once that pass be sell there be no tell what future government might do or undo that be why this matter so deeply because the nhs be not just set of service but promise promise make right here in this house nearly year ago on second reading of the national health service act it be important for my hon friend to be able to explain in detail what the philosophical and institutional implication be but fundamentally for ordinary patient what do she think the bill will do to change the relationship between the patient and the doctor its potential be to alter everything in very undemocratic manner in this very chamber nye bevan tell we that the nhs would lift the shadow from million of home keep very many people alive who might otherwise be dead relieve suffering produce high standard for the medical profession and be great contribution towards the wellbeing of the common report april vol we have duty in this place to defend that promise we can not allow the promise to be reword without the full voice of parliament we owe it to the public to patient and to the nhs staff who dedicate their life to this service to stand firm and protect what be sacred the amendment be simple but its impact be profound it would ensure that any future change to the core principle of the nhs must be debate openly transparently and with the full consent of every member no short cut no sidestepping no ministerial overreach urge colleague across the house to support amendment to stand with our nhs and with the people it serve urge my side the labour side not to allow the assist die bill to be the trojan horse that break the nhs the proud institution and the proud measure introduce by our party in year rise to speak in support of amendment and table by my hon friend the member for twickenham munira wilson the hon member for newcastle under lyme adam jogee and my hon friend the member for wimbledon mr kohler as other member have say this be deeply consequential bill want to record my thank to the hon member for spen valley kim leadbeater to all member of the bill committee and to all those who have contribute to its careful scrutiny through the tabling of amendment and debate over they the bill be about the end of life it be an emotive and sometimes painful topic and be grateful to the many constituent who have generously share with their experience and opinion have also take some time to consult palliative care practitioner include those provide hospice care in my constituency those conversation reinforce the awe and admiration hold for these caring professional their expertise and deep commitment be always impressive contrary to the point make by the hon member for gosport dame caroline dinenage they be adamant that they can provide sufficient pain relief to the vast majority of those receive end of life care the issue be about not the efficacy of treatment but access to it in this echo the powerful point of the hon member for east renfrewshire blair mcdougall on the present inequality of access to palliative care amendment would ensure that the availability quality and distribution of palliative and end of life care be publish within one year of the act be pass when assess the provision of end of life care it be critical that this house and the public can see how palliative care be be deliver for the measure in the bill to provide genuine choice to those at end of life palliative care must be much more widely available the hon member for spen valley kim leadbeater argue that there should be no false choice between palliative care and assist dying yet she and health minister know that there be choice as resource be limited when so many hospice have close bed due to funding shortage and receive more than of their funding from donation be concerned that we may see significant expenditure on new regime for assist dying fund by the state as health treatment while the palliative care sector and hospice in particular remain chronically underfunded rise will not give way only by have the assessment of the palliative care system that be propose in amendment can we be confident of know whether access to palliative care be sufficient if we be to provide true choice at end of life that be critical also stand in support of amendment and amendment and would give this house say over the key decision that still remain to be take on the implementation of the bill give the significance of the bill and the importance of the many question still to be resolve these amendment be critical amendment would ensure that we do not career towards the enactment of this bill in four year whether or not the system be ready to operate safely and fairly take together with amendment and this would ensure that this house have the chance to consider whether those at end of life can access the full range of support advice and protection intend by the bill and which they deserve from palliative care service across the country like so many in this house have direct personal experience of the issue address by the bill my father be diagnose with stage cancer in may over seven week he and my family benefit from the incredible care of our local hospice share my dad life care and death have shape so fully understand why so many of my constituent have ask to vote on this legislation in the light of their and their loved one experience yet our task be to legislate for new system that will affect thousand of people and society as whole however this house vote on this bill our debate must result in new focus on the provision of palliative care so that all people at end of life truly have option in the management of their care and death rise to support amendment to and new clause table by my right hon friend the member for walsall and bloxwich valerie vaz who sadly can not be here today health inequality shape life expectancy and outcome covid death illuminate that but it be absent from the bill young would have be behind this bill be very pro body autonomy when it come to abortion but year of be an mp have expose to coercion duress the billionaire price of london property and eld abuse it be no coincidence that like the majority of london mps and of black and minority ethnic mp oppose the bill let we look at amendment the experience of my aged parent now no long with we open my eye to world of pill incontinence pad hoist power of attorney key safe box and carer worry see how non native english speak pensioner be not talk about welsh speaker have their agency deny perhaps unconsciously by health professional in stretch system my mum gp have clear contempt for her accented word at every appointment she would say to she one question only as my mum grow frailer and begin to lose the power of speech she revert to her mother tongue and be see by hospital team as an annoyance time waster and bed blocker similarly the disabled be often write off people can not see beyond the wheelchair or the non verbal amendment would place duty on the chief medical officer to provide information at every step of the way on that point will my hon friend give way will get more time laughter indicate assent thank my hon friend and recognise the time constraint on the issue of vulnerable group she may know that letter have be send about eat disorder but the spokesperson for the bill sponsor dismiss it say that the concern raise be old news do she agree that there be problem with the way the bill be be run as so often the concern and evidence present by group have be dismiss out of hand totally agree we know that esther rantzen and jonathan dimbleby want the bill to be implement but our role be to be voice for the voiceless so totally agree with she as oppose to the vague ever change qualifying criterion that be hold up as safeguard at least these amendment would put ethnic minority people on the board new clause say that if they be on the ward they should be on the board as well the bill seem to have neglect they altogether so the new clause would provide real protection we know that in cost of living crisis assisted dying could be quite attractive bame community have low disposable household income than standard household and during cost of living and housing crisis it be possible to imagine relative want to speed up granny or grandad probate or naani maa or dadima even to get foot on the ladder on that point will my hon friend give way no because will not get any more time give the cost of care people could convince themselves that elderly relative would be well off out of the way in order to get the young generation on the ladder we know from the experience of other place that once assist dying be allow the scope broaden depressed year old in holland can get it and the incentive to fix palliative care will lessen why now with the state of the nhs what of suicide prevention week yes we know that public opinion be in favour of assist dying but public opinion also support bring back hanging on that point will my hon friend give way no be not give way at my advice surgery people have point out the unfairness of the cost of dignita we know that the status quo be imperfect but let we not remedy it with something that will make thing bad we need to get this right if we be go to do it all although well intentione the bill have too much room for error manipulation misapplication and unintended consequence six month to live be impossible to predict and with life and death it be too late to change your mind after the latter have happen be it not this week doctor have argue that it will widen inequality and it be simply not safe these amendment strengthen the bill by take ethnic minority into account when hitherto they have be completely unacknowledge by it they must be incorporate into any assist dying legislation but the good thing of all would be not to rush down this road with indecent haste in the first place because it be so litter with obstacle rise to support new clause to and to oppose amendment commend the hon member for spen valley kim leadbeater on the way that she have navigate this incredibly difficult and sensitive process in consider these clause and the passage of the bill have keep in mind the simple but difficult word pain because the legislation be about those who face certain death in unimaginable pain and its relationship with palliative care and the word choice on that point will the hon member give way will not because so many hon member wish to speak in this country we be lucky enough to have some of the fine palliative care in the world and it be noble aspiration to want to improve that to be the good in the world nevertheless many of we will have see love one family member and friend suffer huge pain even give the fine palliative care the trauma that that leave for those leave behind can be painful and enduring which be why we be where we be on that point will the hon member give way no that would be unfair as so many wish to speak in consider the bill think yes let we improve palliative care but let we remember that choice when face with certain unimaginable pain be the right thing to provide that be why will be support the bill be almost in my hour of try to speak on this topic so hope member will understand that be not go to take any intervention rise to speak in support of new clause table by my hon friend the member for peterborough andrew pakes amendment to new clause table by my hon friend the member for rochdale paul waugh and amendment table by my hon friend the member for glasgow west patricia ferguson let start by say that end suffering be share goal of all member across this house no one have monopoly on want to end suffering the question be how good we do it as former aid worker and someone who have risk my own life in order to alleviate the suffering of total stranger in war zone promise the house that be motivated to end suffering at least as much as the next member it be worth the house knowing too that my darling dad die of terminal cancer in hospice that be run and fund by charity because the nhs do not have that provision new clause matter because we do not live in an equal society although many of we particularly on the labour benches seek to bring one about this be deeply flawed bill and the truth be that in seek to give choice to some it risk cause new harm to much large vulnerable group of our citizen the safeguard which be water down in committee will not prevent this indeed this week we have see letter from over doctor say that the bill will widen inequality and that it be simply not safe early we hear powerful speech from my hon friend the member for rochdale about the impact of advertising on the most vulnerable new clause would increase the collection of datum about the impact on the most vulnerable and bring in proper oversight from the chief medical officer include in relation to those with protect characteristic last time we debate the bill we hear from my hon friend the member for bexleyheath and crayford daniel francis we be in the shared situation of have close and dearly love family member who have complex disability my hon friend and our family know how it be to have to struggle to fight every week for the access to basic state service that our love one be entitle to but can not access those service and precious state resource would increase their equality and ability to live well but be stretch beyond break point by successive tory governments it be that experience that bring into politic and into the labour party and to this day away from my day job as member of this house still have to fight on behalf of my love one who have significant physical impairment as well as learn difficulty for they to access the healthcare and support that they desperately need vulnerable people do not always make decision in their own good interest and also know from my family experience that they can be highly susceptible to pressure from other who do not have their good interest at heart that be why the transparency create by new clause matter remind the house too that the royal college of psychiatrists have describe the so call safeguard in the bill as inadequate and that in washington state almost two third of those who have an assisted death in the last year for which data be available cite fear of be burden on their family friend or caregiver as reason for do so do not want that to happen in our country over disability right organisation oppose the bill as it stand and one of my constituent have tell that the bill contribute to sense among disabled people that we be disposable amendment and new clause both make important change to the role of the voluntary assist die commissioner ask my hon friend on the labour benches whether they have question the wisdom of the prime minister himself have to personally appoint the death tsar as the medium have christen that role shortly before the next general election finally early this week hear an hon member say that he believe the bill be flawed but plan to vote for it anyway so that it become law and we would have to sort out the problem later we have hear more of that today the hon member do not specify how he think this would happen or when he be right that the bill be flawed but he be wrong that we can ignore those problem to do so would be to fail in our job as legislator be in favour of these amendment and against the bill do not mean accept the status quo as some have try to suggest it mean that we choose instead to protect the nhs and to work to fight and to battle for palliative care system that be worthy of those we represent rather than divert time and energy into help people to kill themselves even though be not oppose to the principle of assist dying have number of deep concern about the content of the bill the process by which we be legislate for such monumental change and importantly the context in which it would be enact give the numerous challenge face our health and care service that be why have table amendment relate to palliative care and end of life need which have attract cross party support be grateful to the hon member for spen valley kim leadbeater for support the amendment want to pay tribute to she today for kick start debate about die well and in particular about palliative care topic that have be neglect by many of we myself include for far too long amendment would require the secretary of state to lay report before parliament year after the act have pass detail the availability quality and distribution of health service to those with palliative and end of life need marie curie estimate that one in four people who could benefit from specialist palliative end of life care do not receive it people who be poor less educate and yes non white be even less likely to receive it be horrified if be honest by the early speech from the hon member for loughborough dr sandher all the datum show we that people from minority ethnic community be less likely to access the healthcare service they deserve in particular palliative care there be deep distrust of health service and those of we who be in this place during the covid pandemic saw that play out in real time in hospital and care setting up and down the country with far more people from minority ethnic community lose their life and far more healthcare professional from ethnic minority not protect in the way that they should have be if those people from minority ethnic and disadvantaged community be less likely to access palliative care as result of the bill be pass contrary to what its supporter say my fear be that more people rather than few will die terrible horrendous traumatic and painful death and they will be disproportionately from those community the hon member raise powerful and excellent point about the people from ethnic minority who die during covid and their access to healthcare as she will understand that be of deep importance to too she be right about the need for great palliative care and be glad as she say that we be have that discussion if we look at assist die around the world and concern around ethnic minority be more likely to access it the stat show that it be the other way around and they be less likely to access it however that point be neither here nor there rather give that the safeguard be in place the question be be the process work well those be where the stat be go forward believe that the hon member raise the matter in good faith and thank she for do so actually think the stat the hon member cite undermine his own argument because all the datum show we that the member of the community be talk about be less likely to access the healthcare service they need and therefore less likely to end up access assist dying the hon member for stroud dr opher give the game away he be acknowledge it that wealthy people tend to access assist die more because they have the choice as well as the service to have that meaningful choice those inequality deeply concern my grave concern about the bill become law be that the people be talk about do not have the loud voice or well fund campaign to support they this whole debate about inequality in access to palliative care should be the topic of debate on separate day and hope there be the chance to have that debate marie curie also warn that there be no realistic national or local plan to address the scale of this challenge and that the whole system be in perilous state due to lack of sustainable funding and limited prioritisation of end of life care survey of integrate care board find that half have no plan to invest capital in palliative care service and admit that their service be inadequate for the need of their population although my amendment would not place duty on the secretary of state to put forward plan to address the variable provision of care as that be outside the scope of the bill the propose report would at least shine much need spotlight and very much hope provide catalyst for change if the bill pass assist death will be available universally on the nhs to those identify in the bill but good palliative care will not be so people will not have genuine choice at the end of their life this amendment would not change that but it be bare minimum first step to analyse and expose the gap the amendment need to go hand in hand with urgent action however which be why have be persuade today to support amendment so that the parlous state of palliative care can start to be meaningfully address before the bill come into force if it be not in well state the bill should not be enact hear the argument from hon member on both side of the chamber about palliative care in this country not be at the level that we would expect and accept that what do not hear from those who oppose the bill be exactly what level we need so that assist dying can go hand in hand with it as genuine option note that the health and social care committee and the hon member for york central rachael maskell have undertake report so they will advise we on that issue interruption be aware that need to finish so urge hon member to support the amendment of my hon friend the members for wimbledon mr kohler and for richmond park sarah olney to ensure that we do not allow the bill to implement sweep henry viii power on such sensitive and important issue and to ensure that we collect through new schedule important monitoring datum on how any assisted dying or death service will operate we need transparency rise to speak in support of new clause and amendment and against new clause as right hon and hon member will be aware new clause would not classify death under the bill as suspicious or unexpected so full coroner inquest would not be need if the bill become law assist dying would be legal strictly regulated and well monitor choice make freely by the individual concern to be absolutely clear to hon member it be not assist suicide the bill concern people who want to live but who face with an inevitable irreversible and terminal diagnosis want choice over the manner of their death that be an important choice that remove some of the trauma and anxiety for not only the patient but their family and love one new clause and its consequential amendment will ensure that family who be naturally grieve the loss of their love one be not needlessly subject to an invasive coroner investigation it be important to realise that if there be any suspicion around an assisted death coroner can still be involve the new clause do not exclude that but it stop the automatic referral to coroner share my hon friend sentiment firmly believe that we should protect bereaved family against such distressing ordeal happen automatically particularly when the process as set out in the bill will already be legal and transparent with that in mind it make practical sense to support new clause if we pass legislation to permit assist die with the full weight of the law behind it we must also respect that choice in the way that we classify and record such death those death would not be in any way unexpected or suspicious so to classify they as such would simply be inaccurate as have already be touch on in great detail today if the bill be pass it would implement the most robust assist die framework anywhere in the world it already include multiple layer of oversight in my view the process be cautious thorough and robustly safeguard retrospective investigation would be to duplicate the process and risk suggest wrongdoing when none have occur wonder what my hon friend view be of the opinion of the royal college of pathologists the body responsible for medical examiner which be that death follow assist dying should be notify to the coroner just as other death follow the administration of drug prescribe or not must be respectfully disagree with that position believe that there be already level of safeguarding in the legislation new clause be compassionate and practical clause that would ensure the law work not only with the individual make the choice but for the family they leave behind move now to speak briefly on new clause which would strongly encourage member to vote against table by my right hon friend the member for walsall and bloxwich valerie vaz the new clause would require the government to publish report on any impact the bill might have on civil procedure rule and probate proceeding as have already be point out the chief medical officer have warn that we be at serious risk of create bureaucratic thicket with this legislation in my view new clause would do just that require the government to publish such report would create unnecessary bureaucracy and divert resource without add any material value as member will be aware the government have already publish an impact assessment on the relevant impact that they deem the bill could have there be nothing in the bill likely to result in any change to civil procedure rule so there be no obvious justification for produce formal report on that issue it be important that we remain focused on practical and meaningful safeguard rather than procedural requirement base on immaterial impact introduce extra reporting requirement base on speculative impact risk create unnecessary red tape without deliver any practical benefit therefore urge member to reject new clause and accept that no additional reporting in that area be need as we rightly scrutinise the bill today on top of nearly hour of scrutiny so far which be more than many government bills receive we must keep die people at the centre of the debate speak today in support of new clause and its consequential amendment and in opposition to new clause for exactly that reason to keep terminally ill people at the centre of this discussion and at the centre of this piece of legislation no matter where we stand on this press matter whether member support it or have reservation it be crucial that we collectively ensure that the bill be workable compassionate and truly centre on the die person as legislator that must always be our chief concern rise to support and speak briefly to amendment to amendment table by the hon member for south antrim robin swann and will speak to new clause amendment and other amendment if time permit be rather confused when look at the amendment paper few day ago and notice that amendment that would directly impact on northern ireland have be table when last check the bill as whole extend only to england and wales so find amendment and perplexing to be clear health and criminal justice be devolve matter the people of northern ireland elect their own assembly to make precisely these sensitive decision include whether to legislate for assist suicide which be an issue of profound moral weight and cultural consequence my hon friend be right to pursue this matter the hon member for mitcham and morden dame siobhain mcdonagh say it early on the nhs be form by the labour party and be of the labour party these amendment would ensure that the secretary of state could overrule assembly member in other word member of the assembly could make decision but the secretary of state could overrule it surely that be incredibly wrong it fly in the face of the democratic process that we be here to uphold my hon friend be absolutely right on constitutional basis alone amendment to amendment be necessary and hope that hon member will feel they can support it move on to factor beyond the constitution be concerned that there be dangerous absence of an adequate regulatory framework for lethal drug under the bill at present clause give the secretary of state power to approve lethal drug while clause mandate the secretary of state to make provision for prescribing dispensing transportation storage handling disposal and record keeping as well as enforcement and civil penalty however the fundamental issue of how these approve substance be actually approve remain alarmingly weak the bill define approve substance simply as drug or other substance specify by the secretary of state in regulation there be no explicit requirement for those substance to undergo specific rigorous testing for their use in assisted dying when this issue be debate in committee be disappointed to see good faith amendment to engage such as amendment be dismiss will the hon lady give way no will not amendment seek to mandate that those substance be approve through the medicines and healthcare product regulatory agency and either the national institute for health and care excellence or the all wales medicines strategy group process therefore strongly support amendment table by the hon member for sleaford and north hykeham dr johnson which ensure that drug can only be approve if the secretary of state be reasonably of the opinion that there be scientific consensus that the drug be effective at end someone life without cause pain or other significant adverse side effect that be common sense approach that should attract support from across the house this week more than doctor write powerful letter to all mp to outline their deep concern about this bill call it real threat to both patient and the medical workforce strongly urge this house and colleague to read that letter before third reading the government own impact assessment do not provide any comfort with regard to the use of lethal drug under the term of the bill which the doctor letter pick up on say that there be no requirement for the drug to undergo rigorous testing and approval that would be require of any other prescribed medication nor indeed for they to be regulate by the medicines and healthcare product regulatory agency they go on to say that that be contrary to all good medical practice this matter not just for regulation but with regard to patient safety and complication there be no requirement in the bill to inform patient about how risk include prolonged death rather than the promise peaceful and dignified death will be manage complication do occur and this be not scaremongere in oregon when complication have be record patient have experience difficulty swallow drug regurgitation and seizure and they have even regain consciousness in canada canadian association have note that patient have experience regurgitation burn and vomiting draw member attention to the write evidence submit to the bill committee by group of expert senior pharmacist and pharmacologist in their submission they warn that the approach of the bill put the cart before the horse specifically they caution against proceed without comprehensive review of the evidence for efficacy and safety and note that that review should be scrutinise by mp before consideration of legalise assist suicide these be not small detail or incidental matter yet even at this late stage in the bill passage through the commons we be still be ask to pass legislation without satisfactory answer to basic question from expert in the field that be simply not good enough be grateful to have have the opportunity to speak and will close by say simply that whatever mitigate amendment may be pass this bill remain morally and ethically wrong it be flawed and should not be pass rise to speak to amendment and but first turn to amendment which would extend some of the provision of the bill to scotland my review of the bills in scotland and england that be proceed at the minute suggest that if someone move permanently from glasgow to bradford or newcastle they would lose their right to an assisted death in scotland and would have to wait year to acquire their right to an assisted death in england imagine the heartbreak if somebody be diagnose as terminally ill three or six month into their permanent move to newcastle that be natural consequence of the law of habitual residence there be long stand case law on that one matter that have not be address satisfactorily be how the relationship between scots and english law and the scottish and english bills will be work out suspect that that will require further primary legislation in this place and in holyrood if both bills pass turn to the remainder of the amendment amendment be very sensible and would introduce much need scrutiny and oversight to the appointment of commissioner the right hon member for salisbury john glen have set out in detail the very sensible reason for the introduction of his suite of amendment amendment be particularly important because the panel face real difficulty in compelling people to come before it if they have relevant evidence it seem manifestly reasonable that the panel should hear from people who have relevant evidence be also concerned that the panel process do not provide clear role for people who love and care for the person seek an assisted death amendment would require the panel actively to consider hear from such people which address serious gap in the bill it be important to place the panel process in its proper context recognise that there be an important cluster of intrinsic ethical value around the right to self determination and autonomy and the right to be treat with dignity for many the justification for assist dying be that people should be able to exercise that right have some sympathy with those argument but there be further very important question will everyone who request an assisted death be do so on the basis of true exercise of autonomy and true exercise of self determination people across our family of nation can not access good help with their mental health and good treatment can help people with mental health issue to have fulfilling life even at the end of that life speak from personal experience with various family member we all agree that palliative and end of life care be not available to many people britain have entrench poverty and people worry terribly about money at the end of their life it be important to understand that the panel and commissioner would not ventilate or investigate those matter at all because they would be look at pressure from other people and not at those terrible societal pressure do my hon friend agree that across all aspect of the bill we can not legislate only for those with good mental health or for those who be love support and protect we must have at heart the good interest of the most vulnerable and those without voice or without love one to ensure that they be protect be oblige to my hon friend that be precisely why join the labour party as year old face with terrible circumstance some people will seek an assisted death find it hard to accept that those will be truly autonomous choice we must be clear that the very same circumstance that have deny people dignity and rob they of autonomy throughout their life will drive they to an assisted death find that deeply troubling and worry that we be place too much confidence in concept of capacity autonomy and self determination everyone accept that coercive control be common indeed it be incredibly common as be domestic abuse and eld abuse there be very clear risk of coercion recognise that the supporter of the bill have seek to improve protection and to protect people in those type of circumstance have anxiously scrutinise those protection and do not believe that they will achieve their aim that be why the amendment be so important last weekend my hon friend the member for spen valley kim leadbeater post on story of two old people who want to die together and who have find doctor to sign off their assisted death be my hon friend concern that this debate might be romanticise suicide pact give that as we know there be mercy killing which be unfortunately actual death do he share the fear of the government suicide adviser that the bill will undermine suicide prevention effort think everyone in the house debate this issue in good faith and in the court there be general view that one should be reluctant to attack otherwise be sure that question be mean on that basis however one must not lose sight of the fundamental point that the protection in the bill will not address the profound societal pressure that people will face one must not lose sight of the fact that whatever protection be include in the bill it will not protect people against coercion edmund burke say bad law be the bad sort of tyranny over time have see many imperfect measure put before the house under government of all persuasion by the way and usually through scrutiny they be improve that be because the parliamentary process work when there be time available and in particular when there be pre legislative scrutiny independent analysis and thorough thinking about the consequence of what we debate here that could have happen on this important matter but it have not because it have be shoehorn into process ill fit for its purpose the amendment we be debate be late attempt to improve the bill particularly recommend the amendment table by my hon friend the member for runnymede and weybridge dr spencer who make an excellent contribution to our debate my right hon friend the member for salisbury john glen and the hon member for rochdale paul waugh support those amendment because it be critical that the safeguard in the bill be not only maintain but improve and enhance for all the reason advance by hon member across the house about coercion and vulnerable people the hon member for north herefordshire ellie chowns say she have never encounter coercion north herefordshire must be wonderful place where people carry harp and drink ambrosia but in the rest of the kingdom and assert the rest of the world there be many wicked people do many bad thing we must never allow those wicked people to have reign and power over those who inevitably because of their circumstance will be at risk if the bill be not improve rise give way to the hon member for north herefordshire as cite she be afraid that the right hon gentleman have misrepresent what say be contribute an observation from somebody who have be deeply involve in palliative care practice who report that it be far more frequent that the die person wish to die while it be their family who be pressure they and encourage they to stay alive as long as possible the fear about coercion appear to be worry about something that be not actually the case in these case of die people be afraid that disagree there be numerous case where people will be encourage and perhaps even force to take decision when they be cop with illness and at their most vulnerable when they be frightened doubtful and distressed and may be unbalanced of course we have to protect against that eventuality if the bill be to be pass on that point evidence from exit interview show that of people choose an assisted death in canada and in oregon list as their reason for do so that they feel they be burden to their family the hon gentleman anticipate what be about to say have cite exactly that evidence many time during the debate we need to look at the experience elsewhere to inform what we do here we always do that when we pass the right law in this place there be bad news than that because rather than be improve during its passage the bill have in many way get bad in particular by give additional power to ministers so call henry viii power when the two word delegate legislation be mention in this place we should always be fearful when the word ministerial discretion be use be doubly fearful say that look directly at government front bench members but could have be look at the conservative front bench the bill give permissive power to government to make all kind of change want to take some of those to illustrate my point the bill empower ministers to amend the suicide act include the offence of encourage suicide they can rewrite the principle of the nhs in section of the national health service act to read secure improvement in the mental health of the people of england and wales and end the life of the terminally ill they can amend the nhs act to specify that this service be not free of charge the bill point only to the section of the national health service act that say service to be provide free of charge except where charge expressly provide for they can amend the definition of register medical practitioner so it be not doctor carry out the assessment and so on and so forth that be why the amendment in the name of the hon member for mitcham and morden dame siobhain mcdonagh be so vital the speech she give be among the good speech have hear in this house the passion she feel for vulnerable people and the difference the nhs make to they be not only feel on the labour benches as she well know regardless of the theatre we all come to this place to ensure that the least fortunate have voice that those with less power be give little more by our advocacy in conclusion say to the hon member for spen valley kim leadbeater that there have never be any doubt about the depth of her piety let we now be sure about the breadth of her mind if she really want the bill to be pass in way that be palatable then she must surely accept the amendment have support and highlight in this brief all too brief contribution member need to be aware that will start the front bench speech at pm call the final back bench speaker rachael maskell rise to speak to my amendment the insufficiency of clause and new clause and the mechanism for substance approval have attract much criticism as they defy safe process have therefore undertake extensive research with lead academic toxicologist anaesthetist pharmacist and other to understand the safety concern over pharmacology prescribing and dispensing normally the mhra would undertake research and trial to secure safety quality and licensing the british national formulary focus on dosage and side effect and nice or the all wales medicines strategy group focus on show that drug work and be cost effective that safety regime underpin the reputation of uk pharmacology so can this house assure itself that without due process someone will have safe and peaceful death let we look at the evidence first the data be poor the health and social care committee visit oregon we know there be vary time for how long it take for someone to die up to hour the research cite nausea and vomit in of case seizure oral muscular burning regurgitation and regain consciousness will my hon friend give way no time there be lack of consistency of approach and datum across jurisdiction on the substance use how they be titrate and the dosage administer while ingestion can be factor absorption vary accord to frailty metabolism diagnosis body mass index and drug reaction pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic be complex however it have be my discussion with toxicologist that have be most alarming they highlight the high risk of acute pulmonary oedema this be back by research show that of case use pentobarbital on death row have flash pulmonary oedema the drug disintegrate the membrane in the lung tissue fill they with fluid cause shortness of breath and sense of drowning as clinician have support many people on intensive therapy unit with such diagnosis high concentration of the drug cause an acute assault to the cardiopulmonary function if paralysed and conscious patient may look peaceful but be anything but such physiological distress need research it be unclear how the government will identify datum process and safety the risk to those handle toxic substance also need to be examine and in the light of the government identify that pregnant woman could opt for an assist death that clearly need examination there be no formulation for safe titration or dosage if pentobarbital be to be use as it be in australia the government impact assessment do not examine it so it need revision also the drug be not an approve substance for human in the uk license or unlicensed the mhra and nice have role to play we be increasingly hear that professional body be withdraw their support from the bill because they know that the regime that have be set out be just not safe so it be our duty to examine the evidence call the shadow minister may start by offer the condolence of his majesty opposition to all those affect by the air india plane crash include the family of the very many british citizen who very sadly lose their life our thought be with all of they as be well understand now the opposition remain neutral on the principle of whether assist dying should be introduce that will depend on the bill progress through its remain stage in this and the other place however wish to raise two important matter first on the matter of time all of we understand the considerable challenge that mr speaker face in have to balance the desire of colleague to speak on this matter with the limited time available for private member bill know that he be do his good to strike that balance number of member have point out that the time be give to this bill be significant and more than that normally allocate to even quite substantial government bills none the less it be right to acknowledge that this be far from an ordinary bill it be hard to think of more deeply consequential and highly contentious piece of legislation for our society the reality be that both today and in previous sitting number of member have be unable to speak there have be an informal time limit on speech and intervention have necessarily be limit as result debate in this house be important not just because it decide how we vote but because it be use by the court to help interpret legislation more limited debate limit the scope for that ordinarily minister would have significant time at the end of report to deal with amendment provide clarification and explain intention in way that the promoter of the bill will not again majority of members may be satisfied with that but very many be not although what we decide on the business of the house be ultimately determine by majority vote how we reach decision and how we allow alternative view to be explore matter we should all consider whether we want debate of such importance to be curtail in the manner that it have be ask the government to consider assist mr speaker by make more time available for we to ensure that on third reading we have the full debate possible with every member have reasonable opportunity to speak and take intervention in the way that they would like secondly member will be aware that the bill although extensive be not the full picture as other have highlight significant element of how assist dying will operate be due to be determine by future delegate legislation the government delegate power memo note that the bill contain delegate power include henry viii power and more power be contain in the promoter amendment that be schedule for decision today they include matter such as the content form and thoroughness of doctor report regulation for replace co ordinating doctor who be unable or unwilling to continue and decision on who will be notify of the panel decision which have be raise as an important potential safeguard those be not trivial matter these piece of legislation can not be amend and mp can vote only yes or no in some case they be unlikely to be debate and they almost certainly will not be on the floor of the house it be important for member to fully understand that mp often have to weigh up the consequence of reject such legislation when they disagree with it because it could leave void member be well within their right to be content to proceed regardless certainly majority of the committee have present bill to the house with the composition as describe that is of course legitimate choice for member to make we have hear in the debate today about amendment to curtail these power and member will need to decide their view on that urge the government in the interest of help member to have the clear possible idea of how scheme they be be ask to vote on will operate to provide as much detail as possible on what these future regulation might consist of although we will not be able to have all the answer think most member would agree that it be well that we vote with more detail rather than less even if they be satisfied to support assist dying in principle this be something that only the government can do ask that the minister reflect on that challenge in his closing remark alongside give the government response to those ask for more government time to allow wide debate with more member able to speak emphasise again that the opposition remain neutral on whether we should introduce assisted dying but it be incumbent on we to at least draw attention to matter of procedure that can be address only by the government look forward to the minister address the concern of members along the line reflect in my remark today associate the government with the word of the opposition spokesman regard the tragic incident in india as member will know the government remain neutral on the passage of the bill and on the principle of assist dying we have always be clear that this be decision for parliament however the government be responsible for ensure that the bill if pass be effective legally robust and workable let start with brief observation about the process and in particular the time make available to parliament to scrutinise the bill the bill have receive over hour of parliamentary time which be more than most bills receive more than amendment be table and consider in committee thank member on all side of the debate for their contribution during the extensive consideration and scrutiny that the bill have receive give the time will confine my remark on the amendment to those about which the government have significant legal or operational concern and those table by my hon friend the member for spen valley kim leadbeater to address significant workability concern before get into the detail remind the house that full list of amendment table by my hon friend that the government deem essential or highly likely to contribute to the workability of the bill can be find in the letter send to all member by and the minister of state at the ministry of justice my hon and learn friend the member for finchley and golders green sarah sackman on may let start with amendment table by my hon friend the member for spen valley new clause and amendment and would allow the government to create or change legislation to set out the end to end process in relation to approve substance to be use for assist dying they would allow for monitoring and for regulatory regime to be design that will offer robust oversight of approve substance and the device use to administer they specifically in the context of assist dying amendment and new clause would replace clause which be currently unworkable in the wide legal context they would align the scrutiny and certification of assist death with the exist process for death that be not deem unnatural that mean that assist death would be scrutinise by medical examiner rather by coroner unless report to the coroner by anyone who have concern about the death amendment to would ensure that the secretary of state and welsh ministers have power to make necessary regulation to approve assist die service in wales amendment would bring the welsh commencement power in line with the devolution settlement and remove the requirement in clause for welsh ministers to lay commencement regulation before the senedd for approval to align with usual procedure now turn to amendment table by other member that the government assess as create potentially significant workability challenge amendment would require the mhra to license the approve substance to be use in assist dying that may present workability challenge as licensing be not possible if the approve substance do not meet the definition of medicinal product under the current relevant legislation furthermore licensing be reliant on the manufacturer apply to the mhra for marketing authorisation for that indication and provide the necessary evidence of safety and efficacy in support should the bill pass the government would work to put in place an appropriate regulatory regime for the approval of substance it may be helpful to note that my hon friend the member for spen valley have table new clause which recognise the need for robust regulatory framework and would provide the power need to introduce such framework amendment to amendment to new clause and amendment to new clause would restrict the scope of henry viii power available to the uk and welsh governments to make provision about assist die service they would far restrict the use of power in relation to the regulatory framework for approve substance and the device use to administer they and to the prohibition on advertising point member towards the delegate power memorandum publish by the government which set out our consideration of the henry viii power in the bill as with legislation more broadly the government recognise the need in appropriate case for amendment by henry viii power member will be aware that the delegated powers and regulatory reform committee will issue its own consideration of the bill which will of course be make available to all parliamentarian amendment seek to shorten the commencement period to three year should the bill pass an entirely new service with robust safeguard and protection will need to be carefully develop and test with input from range of delivery partner the government view be that the bill as amend in committee with four year backstop for commencement would be more likely to provide for safe and effective implementation one of the key thing that the bill sponsor the hon member for spen valley kim leadbeater have say throughout be that four year in the bill as it currently be would be backstop can that be the case if the minister be talk about requirement of four year and that it could not have be deliver soon can confirm that it be absolutely the policy intent of the sponsor for that to be backstop the government be work on that basis to ensure that it be backstop and not target amendment seek to remove the four year backstop although that be matter for member to decide we note that if both that amendment and amendment table by my hon friend the member for spen valley be accept nobody would have the power to commence reserve provision in wales that would create major workability concern for the service in wales the advocate of the bill talk about the point of choice and autonomy in the decision about when and where person will die can the minister confirm whether we have enough doctor to provide service for people to die at home at the time of their choosing refer the hon lady to the impact assessment which be of course not forecast but set of scenario in it detail be give on expect number and the capacity of the system to deal with the service amendment and to relate to the appointment of the voluntary assist die commissioner and panel member the amendment would put the process for the appointment out of kilter with standard practice for public or non judicial appointment and could significantly limit the pool of individual available amendment would give the panel the same power privilege and authority as the high court which be significant in scope and be set out across different court rule and legislation it be unclear how those would apply to panel in practice they may be unworkable give that the panel be not design to be court new clause and amendment would put various responsibility on the chief medical officer for england and wales impose duty in primary legislation on an individual civil servant may cause difficulty in the future if the role do not exist or if the title change it be usual practice for duty in primary legislation to be confer on the secretary of state who may decide to delegate to the chief medical officer would like to briefly respond to number of question directly ask of the government the hon member for south antrim robin swann ask about medicine regulation in northern ireland the amendment will not affect the application of eu law they will instead ensure coherence between the different legislative framework the sponsor will lead engagement with the devolved government support by official the hon member for richmond park sarah olney ask about the equality impact assessment the eqia consider the nine protect characteristic alongside socioeconomic background geography and mental health the hon member for west worcestershire dame harriett baldwin ask about the suicide act and advertising can confirm that encouraging or facilitate suicide will remain crime under the suicide act on advertising new clause if pass would oblige the secretary of state to make regulation prohibit certain form of advertising that promote voluntary assisted die service the exemption to that which may be provide under subsection will not cut across the criminal offence elsewhere in the bill or in the suicide act hope that those observation be helpful to member in their consideration of the technical workability of the amendment that we have debate today claim to move the closure standing order no question put forthwith that the question be now put question put and agree to new clause accordingly read second time and add to the bill new clause prohibition on advertising the secretary of state must by regulation make provision prohibit the publication printing distribution or designing anywhere of advertisement whose purpose or effect be to promote voluntary assist die service cause the publication printing distribution or designing of such advertisement the regulation may contain exception for example for the provision of certain information to user or provider of service regulation under this section may make any provision that could be make by an act of parliament but regulation under this section may not amend this act and must provide that any offence create by the regulation be punishable with fine in this section voluntary assist die service mean any service for or in connection with the provision of assistance to person to end their own life in accordance with this act or any other service provide for the purpose of any of section to leadbeater this clause impose duty to make regulation prohibit advertisement to promote service relate to voluntary assist die under the bill bring up and read the first and second time amendment propose to new clause in subsection leave out from exception to the end of subsection and insert for the follow communication make in reply to particular request by an individual for information about voluntary assisted die service communication which be intend for health professional or provider of voluntary assist dying service and ii make in manner and form unlikely to be see by potential service user regulation under this section may make provision that could be make by an act of parliament but may not amend this act or the

martin howe and many other who work very hard on this case the implication be obviously very serious if there be element in the police and possibly in the crown prosecution service who want members of parliament to be hold to different standard of account than the general public that remove we from the normality of law in this country think that would be very bad step indeed will take your advice of course and take this up with the clerks because our be hold to different standard would be very bad thing we all have to have the right to take part in public protest about human right abuse about war about peace and about anything else that be what democracy be about see this whole effort as means of try to silence the democratic right of everybody in our society by pick on we two as member of parliament be grateful for the decision that have be make today but like my right hon friend the member for hayes and harlington john mcdonnell do not intend to let it rest there be grateful to the right hon member for give notice of his point of order as he know it be not matter for the chair but he have put his point on the record far to that point of order madam deputy speaker it might be useful if member of parliament who have not often take part in demo in central london intervene at this point to show that opinion in this house of commons be absolutely united in various parliament indeed in most parliaments in europe mps have immunity from prosecution we have never have that system here and we have always proclaim what be very much the british way that member of parliament be no different from any other member of the public if they do wrong they will be hold to account but they should not be subject to some great test of culpability just because they be member of parliament as somebody who be not in the same party as the right hon member for hayes and harlington john mcdonnell and often have rather different view from his want to rise to show that what he have just say have universal support in this house thank the right hon member for his point of order while it be not matter for the chair he have put his point on the record and he have be hear by the house far to that point of order madam deputy speaker would it be possible for you to explain why that be not matter for the chair surely if mps be go to be deem by the metropolitan police to have great culpability than other citizen that must be matter for the chair and for mr speaker why should it be delegate to the clerks thank the hon gentleman for his point of order however it be not matter for the chair if it be matter of privilege he should raise the matter privately with mr speaker flood prevention sleaford and north hykeham motion make and question propose that this house do now smith before start my remark will make declaration of interest my husband be farmer and we have small stipend to pay to the internal drainage board in relation to flood risk my constituent in sleaford and north hykeham enjoy some of the most beautiful countryside that the united kingdom have to offer our hard work farmer reap the benefit of some of the good agricultural land in the country for their crop unfortunately live in this area bring some environmental risk many lincolnshire mps century ago hold the office of commissioner of sewer in the county the job sound unglamorous but be very important bring with it responsibility for manage the county waterway and drainage and for protect life and livelihood from the risk of flood damage be not suggest that take on that role myself but that historical flood risk have only become more acute in recent year land usage have intensify our climate have become more volatile and great pressure have start to affect our natural resource our county have suffer from flooding cause by overwhelmed drainage system and excessive river level the effect on people have magnify too some people whose home be flood lose not just possession but the ability to live in their home for long period of time some do not return home for more than year last week have the pleasure of visit heighington millfield primary academy as it formally reopen follow significant flood damage last year the closure have major effect on the child there who have to be bus to different school around the county within the trust and significant measure have to be take to restore the school put on record my thank to everybody involve in that work the community really pull together for those child and the department for education and the department for environment food and rural affairs work very hard together to ensure not just that the school be repair but that flood measure be put in place to try to prevent those thing happen again the school now have flood door in place so that it can prevent flooding come in through the door and it be have work do over the summer in preparation for the autumn rain to protect the outside environment which include bunde around the playing field and special garden at the back of the school on high ground which will absorb some of the water if the rain overtop the back again unfortunately at the same time that that great work have be go on new councillor under the direction of reform have choose to abolish the county council committee dedicate to manage flood risk will have more to say about that later in open this debate want to make simple point my constituent deserve to live in safety and to go about their work and education without severe disruption from climate event we need to ensure that we be do everything we can to protect their life and livelihood and that recommendation be be follow up and maintenance work be be do on time we also need to make the most of local expertise and experience and not undo the good work start under the previous government towards foster collaboration between agency and local people many community across my constituency have be affect by flood in recent time and they deserve to have their experience share in north scarle for example resident face huge disruption in when heavy rainfall on to already wet ground cause flooding at mill dam dyke the local authority report on the event find that poor maintenance of the local watercourse have contribute to the flooding as do problem with the surface drainage system as see when visit north scarle in december that year co operation among different agency be key in tackle these kind of event lincolnshire county council be responsible for clean gully and maintain drainage while the environment agency have responsibility for ongoing maintenance at mill dam dyke meanwhile local group such as flood action north scarle contribute valuable local knowledge and experience the ea have uphold its end of the share responsibility set out in the flooding report and have engage the local community by provide maintenance update it spend around on maintenance in however since the spending review publish this week reveal cut in the defra budget over the review period can the minister assure my constituent that the ea will still have the money to continue maintain these dyke go forward and what will the minister do to ensure transparency from council update from the ea be relatively easy to access but lincolnshire county council flooding project website simply list its own action follow each flood report as ongoing my resident need more clarity than that in sleaford resident face similar problem when field beck be overtop in october and drainage system again become overwhelmed welcome the work that the ea have do here too with the business case for major capital scheme approve on june be pleased about this investment which be project to avoid million in economic damage deliver million in people relate benefit and protect property from repeat flood damage in leasingham more work need to be do resident suffer flood twice in quick succession include in the school in october and january when agricultural ditch overtop and leasingham beck exceed its capacity the council flood report recommend that the ea and lincolnshire county council work together to carry out channel condition assessment at leasingham beck with the result to be report back to the lincolnshire flood risk and water management partnership however the inspection have not yet happen worse still even as report into historical flooding be call for close collaboration the reform council be undo the successful partnership already establish the lincolnshire flood and water management scrutiny committee do vital work in bring together key agency involve in flood management and prevention the ea internal drainage board anglian water district council and other key expert three week ago reform abolish the committee fold it into the generalist environment committee which do not have the same specialist remit to cover the most important and complex environmental issue face the county by reject the valuable contribution of idb district council and local expert reform councillor be say that they know well than local people who have tend the land for generation all the main party have oppose the committee abolition and have see it for what it be politick with people livelihood if the government see these reckless action be work on local community in sleaford and north hykeham and elsewhere in lincolnshire what can they do to ensure that council uphold their responsibility to resident instead of cancel initiative we should be create new one be encourage by the excellent work do under the previous government to advance the water maintenance pilot scheme which be design to foster collaboration between farmer and the national farmers union local drainage board and the ea the scheme enable great co ordination and common sense flexibility in the management of waterway for example by train local landowner in how to manage watercourse and then allow they to carry out their own minor channel clearance and maintenance work for themselves the scheme help to avoid the ludicrous heartbreaking situation in which local people can see problem with local watercourse be aware it be go to flood their farm land or their home and have the equipment and the know how to do something about it but the law prevent they from do so it be illogical public sector co operation agreement already exist to help streamline those scheme and place participant on clear legal footing one of the great local success under that framework be the silt dredging of the south forty foot drain farmland drainage channel date from the century under psca between the black sluice drainage board and the ea why have the lesson of those scheme not be apply more widely since the last election the scheme in my own constituency have grind to halt and with it have go the benefit that be already accrue will the minister commit to support those scheme and encourage their wide roll out as she look to her budget it be worth recognise that it be much cheap for the idb to clear drain and ditch than for the ea to do so since the ea procurement process be so cumbersome that it become significantly more expensive one of the thing that frustrate many local people in my constituency be that they could do the job and get it do much quick they be wait and place be flood while it be not get do another thing that the minister could discuss with the treasury be that the idb have be prevent from use red diesel in its pump the idb have tell that the problem be that the pump be place in isolated place and believe it or not people be steal the diesel it be white diesel it be expensive so it be worth something and people be steal it from the pump which be put everyone at risk the idb feel that if it be red diesel in those pump theft would be much less likely brant broughton be an area in which number of house flood we have have less promising update from the environment agency in that respect it say that it be expect to receive model of the river system around the summer of indicate assent the minister be nod do not know whether she have an update on what the environment agency mean by the summer we be expect the health plan in the spring and that have be and go so if she could help with that that would be really great there be some concern about the overall cost benefit ratio give the number of house encourage the minister to remember that although the people who live in rural area may live in area that be less densely populated they have as much right to safe environment as anybody who live in more densely populated part of the country there be more example of community in my constituency that have suffer the impact of flooding and be cry out for join up and proactive approach that will protect they from repeat occurrence in the future in washingborough and timberland familiar story happen in recent flood heavy rain overwhelmed drainage and excessive water runoff lead to community be leave to suffer while the ea have carry out some channel clearance and vegetation management flood report make clear that responsibility fall between central agency the county council landowner and stakeholder such as anglian water once again it be vital that open communication be at the heart of the strategy and that politically motivated meddling be not allow to get in the way take the chair of the environment agency and the former minister my hon friend the member for keighley and ilkley robbie moore to visit the delph at washingborough when it be full it be very clear that the ea priority have be to protect the small creature live in the dyke by not clear the vegetation out but of course once the flood come those small creature be no more anyway it would have be much well for the creature the environment and the wide countryside and the people who live there if those dyke have be clear properly in the first place tree be literally grow in that dyke when we go to see it there be two final community face specific future threat that would like to highlight in ruskington resident endure flooding in and cause by the overflow of ruskington beck understand that the environment agency have be conduct bimonthly maintenance and debris removal and be investigate capital programme for defence in ruskington as part of the next five year funding period any scheme will have to meet economic viability criterion and define cost benefit metric despite future house building plan that will see more land cover more people in at risk area and more demand on drainage system as of december under the government new target the central lincolnshire partnership of which north kesteven form part face house building target of house per year over the course of this parliament an increase on the previous target can the minister assure that the cost benefit analysis decide the fate of future flood defence scheme will take account of the government rampant house building plan and will account for all the way in which flooding impact community such as ruskington from work hour lose to home damage insurance claim watercourse repair and drainage clearance finally anwick suffer in the flood of when the river slea and its tributary experience very high water level the ea and anglian water have be engage in positive liaison to manage risk at the river slea farroway drain and anwick catchwater but resident in anwick contact in september when sewage processing plant flood cause discharge and pollute smell across the area meet anglian water to discuss those constituent concern but their big concern be now about biogas digester that may be build immediately next door in this case too it be vital that lesson be learn and that we avoid repeat mistake that will lead to more disruption for local people in the future address the risk require the careful allocation of money glance at the most recent funding allocation under the flood and coastal erosion risk management grant in aid scheme show that many dozen of project appear in the bidding process but receive no funding the allocation datum for the upper witham internal drainage board in my constituency show intend project list for completion between and but none have any grant funding at all allocate this year lincolnshire county council meanwhile be due to receive in grant funding over for year one of the property flood resilience project two small project will receive total of from non grant public contribution but other project will receive no funding at all the government have make much of the billion in funding for flood defence that be announce in february but as have say before govern effectively be about make choice can the government clarify for my constituent how the ea be expect to prioritise its funding among the many equally important project that need support especially in light of cut to the defra budget how much money be spend on develop scheme that subsequently do not come to fruition what be the estimate cost in household damage lose output and broad economic term of decide not to act as mention early the hard work farmer in my constituency do so much for our local and national economy and for this country food security and it be vital that we remember they what will become of agricultural productivity in area leave with inadequate flood defence what will happen to food security when some of our good quality agricultural land be lose to frequent inundation and how be farmer mean to prepare for this economic and practical term when they already face such heady mix of threat to their livelihood just as farmer have be leave to face the family farm tax institute by the labour party and have suffer the sudden loss of the sustainable farming incentive they will also face the threat of flooding without the help and support they need if this government fail to act in the long term interest of rural community we have reach the time for action on flood prevention and resilience as note early the way to manage the risk be with local knowledge collaborative and long term management strategy and proper funding essentially with basic common sense first we must keep the valuable expertise of local people within the decision make system idb local farmer and expert local committee know their land good and we must give they the tool and authority to manage their own environment secondly we must build on project such as the water maintenance pilot to foster long term planning and inter agency work we can do more the creation of lincolnshire river authority for example would provide structured platform for long term flood planning that could be tailor to the need of local people rather than to the nationwide ea or defra framework finally we must ensure that vital project receive the necessary funding without be hold up by central agency cost benefit framework local authority should hold budgetary power as well as decision make power to make sure that intervention be make where they be need most and in timely and efficient way with these measure we can make sure that local people have control over their own local environment and give they the tool they need to prevent the devastating impact of flooding which have blight some area of lincolnshire for too long congratulate the hon member on secure this debate and on raise these very important issue which will endeavour to address in the time remain protect community home business and farmland from flooding be priority for this government and be delighted to hear that heighington millfield academy student be now safely back at school be sure that there have be lot of disruption particularly for those take public exam be grateful to the hon member for her generous comment about the department for education defra and ea official who have be work at pace to minimise the impact and pay tribute to all the people involve in that not least the parent and the student themselves be very pleased to hear that there be flood resilient repair and be interested in way in which nature base planting around the school can potentially help with flood mitigation in the future may say how incredibly disappointed be to hear that the reform lead county council in lincolnshire have take the very short sighted and unwelcome decision to abolish the flood risk and flood protection committee this show the danger of pander to reactionary rhetoric and then leave local home and local community unprotecte shall be watch the council very closely to ensure that it be fulfil its duty under the flood and water management act be aware that the hon member constituency have be badly affect by flood from storms babet and henk during the winter of sadly more be flood this january after heavy rainfall and my thought be with those affect as the former mp for wakefield have property flood in and can tell she that the psychological impact on resident be very long lasting totally understand her desire to raise these matter on behalf of her constituent and the local community she serve engagement and collaboration be key component of manage and mitigate flood risk and be pleased to hear that the hon member be in contact with the environment agency on these matter can confirm that her constituency be receive million from the government flood investment programme this financial year which be fund the repair and maintenance as she say of number of crucial flood defence as she mention lincolnshire section report can say that official tell that they have be complete and that any decision arise from they will take place in future funding year work have start this month on phase of the lower witham flood resilience project which will support embankment asset phase of the project which be plan will bring further investment in sustain legacy asset while implement adaptation measure to improve the resilience of the area to flooding the environment agency be work with partner to build an up to date model of the lower witham to be complete this financial year and it will be use to test future adaptive approach and accurately assess flood risk will ask the minister for water and flooding my hon friend the member for kingston upon hull west and haltemprice emma hardy to write to the hon member if there be any thing that we can not get through in the time available the river slea flood resilience project be explore new more sustainable solution to flood risk management in sleaford public engagement have be undertake with organisation and other stakeholder on this project ruskington be also be consider for flood resilience project as set out by the chancellor this week in order to support the government growth mission and plan for change we be invest record billion over the next three year from april to build new flood defence and to maintain and repair exist one across the country that be billion each year this be increase in our annual average investment compare with our exist spend of billion over the past two and our current investment programme be support project which will help to protect home and business by march and through essential maintenance further property will have their expect level of protection maintain or restore that be total of property that will benefit help to secure job deliver growth and protect against economic damage we have also unlock million from this investment to get stall project move this be target at scheme that be ready to go so that protection can be deliver fast for those who need it the most and we have publish the full list of funded scheme for this financial year the government inherit flood asset in their poor condition on record follow year of under investment leave of the environment agency key flood defence asset below the condition require this government be take decisive action to fix the foundation give community confidence that flood defence will protect they we be prioritise over the current two spending year from and million in repair and restore those critical asset last year million focus on damage from recent storm and flooding with furth million this year to ensure that defence be resilient reliable and ready in addition environmental land management scheme present valuable opportunity for support flooding and coastal erosion risk management through direct funding of action and provide revenue stream to support landowner work with ea capital scheme and through indirect action that will lead to reduce watercourse maintenance requirement increase the lifespan of our asset the hon lady mention red diesel and just want to make quick point on that the previous government remove most red diesel entitlement from april but there be some exception risk management authority which include internal drainage board may use red diesel for drainage ditch clearance include work relate to agriculture horticulture and forestry hope that be useful clarification watercourse management responsibility fall to different body riparian landowner whose land adjoin watercourse such as drainage ditch be require to keep those watercourse clear of anything that could be an obstruction the ea have permissive power to work on the main river and lead local flood authority or internal drainage board have permissive power for ordinary watercourse the ea focus on those activity that will achieve the great benefit in term of protect people and property from flooding that of course can include dredging and clearing channel in lincolnshire that often involve use the local idb the ea spend an average of million year on these activity to improve water flow in around km of main river the need for dredging be assess on location by location basis the ea will work with local community idb and through public sector co operation agreement to assess whether dredging be technically achievable and cost effective ensure that it do not significantly increase flood risk downstream and that it be environmentally acceptable the hon lady ask about future funding reform the current approach to flood funding introduce by previous government in neglect more innovative approach to address that we have review our approach and last week launch consultation on proposal to reform the way we allocate funding to flood scheme our proposal will make it simple for all risk management authority to calculate their funding benefit all council include those that have less resource to commit to the application process this should speed up the delivery of vital scheme and ensure that money be distribute more effectively across the country include for rural and coastal community and poor community that have previously struggle to secure funding we will make it easy to invest in natural flood management scheme that also give benefit for nature water resource and the fight against climate change we be consider how community can make well use of property flood resilience measure change to the current approach to flood funding will be launch in time for the new flood investment programme which will start in april the consultation be open to all and we encourage everyone with an interest to respond and help shape our future approach to flood funding this issue be at the very top of the secretary of state priority which be why we set up flood resilience taskforce to provide oversight of national and local flood resilience and preparedness that taskforce represent new approach that bring together representative from national regional and local government the devolve administrations the emergency service charity and environmental interest group we need to know what work and we be learn where we need to make change we have establish action group lead by member to deliver progress on area include flood warning awareness of recovery and insurance scheme the government fully support the vital role that internal drainage board play in manage water and flood risk and in protect the environment when go around look at the different area of flooding in my constituency get consistent message that the ea have not perform as well as the idb and that it be cost more money per activity in her final few minute can the minister touch on how the idb can do more of the work and engage more local people in do it for themselves the previous government have allocate million to the idb fund be happy to say that in march we announce an additional million boost to the fund that create total of million which should enable idb to modernise and upgrade their asset and waterway so that they be fit for the future improve water management for more than hectare of agricultural land and about home and business that include three idb in the hon lady constituency black sluice upper witham and witham first which have receive government funding of about million in grant from the idb fund since to help with pump station repair and watercourse embankment repair be in my final minute encourage the hon lady constituent to sign up for flood warning on it be vital that community be in the communication chain so that they be aware of flood event especially give that intense rainfall be expect this evening will endeavour to write to the hon lady about any other issue she may have question put and agree to house adjourn
