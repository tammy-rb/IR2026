hourly train for the new station plan at charfield the station at pilning be parliamentary station with just one train run week to avoid formally close it its location near the grow industrial location of severnside mean that if properly reopen it be prime place to help the many worker who travel from south wales to make the trip without car the third station be severn beach once seaside resort the line now serve commuter however commuter can be leave disappoint by flood on the line as well as the fact that the service be not more frequent rail campaigner be also keen to see other station reopen such as coalpit heath and thornbury but for that to be possible we need national investment in westerleigh junction to increase capacity and unlock this potential hope that the secretary of state will commit to make that part of the integrate infrastructure review that be reference early as my hon friend the member for bath wera hobhouse say ultimately passenger be not interested in who run the train they simply want they to run on time and for the ticket to be affordable give the continue squeeze on people finance we need an immediate freeze on rail fare and our fragmented ticketing system need simplify to cut cost for commuter we also need to think about integration with other form of public transport in my constituency we have see serious cut to local bus service with many village leave with no regular bus at all my aim in this place will be to champion the right of people to have affordable and green method of transport whether they live in rural or
