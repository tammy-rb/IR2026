of innovation locally although sadly my own parish of frampton cotterell claim to the invention of the stetson hat appear to be little more than an urban legend however we can be proud that the

and software engineering take keen interest in see those industry flourish and want to ensure that our young people can benefit from the opportunity they bring my constituency be of course more than

important debate because if we be to tackle the climate crisis and cut congestion on our road we must get rail service back on track to give people genuine alternative to get around effectively there be currently three railway station in my constituency yate station be reopen in the and we desperately need the propose redevelopment will also be seek to ensure that the funding for half hourly service be extend beyond the current end date of that will benefit not only yate but provide an hourly train for the new station plan at charfield the station at pilning be parliamentary station with just one train run week to avoid formally close it its location near the grow industrial location of severnside mean that if properly reopen it be prime place to help the many worker who travel from south wales to make the trip without car the third station be severn beach once seaside resort the line now serve commuter however commuter can be leave disappoint by flood on the line as well as the fact that the service be not more frequent rail campaigner be also keen to see other station reopen such as coalpit heath and thornbury but for that to be possible we need national investment in westerleigh junction to increase capacity and unlock this potential hope that the secretary of state will commit to make that part of the integrate infrastructure review that be reference early as my hon friend the member for bath wera hobhouse say ultimately passenger be not interested in who run the train they simply want they to run on time and for the ticket to be affordable give the continue squeeze on people finance we need an immediate freeze on rail fare and our fragmented ticketing system need simplify to cut cost for commuter we also need to think about integration with other form of public transport in my constituency we have see serious cut to local bus service with many village leave with no regular bus at all my aim in this place will be to champion the right of people to have affordable and green method of transport whether they live in rural or urban area in conclusion promise to work tirelessly for my constituent not only on fix our railway but on other issue too such as the fact that our school be among the low fund in the country and that it be almost impossible to register with an nhs dentist locally look forward to work constructively with right hon and hon member

gary sambrook become well know locally and through the committee in the conservative party nationally he and other candidate fight campaign that be untouched by the disgraceful tactic of intimidation that be witness elsewhere in birmingham and which must have no place in our public life be certain that this be not the end for gary in birmingham politic and wish he well to talk about birmingham be to tell tale of two city that be as true of the northfield constituency as it be elsewhere pocket of relative affluence sit cheek by jowl with deprivation the historic village centre of king norton and northfield lie short distance from the new estate like weoley castle that be build to serve the need of birmingham grow economy the fortune of the constituency rise and fall with birmingham but the seat be also define by its outer estate new frankley rubery and allens cross which be distant and distinct from the city centre all these community face common challenge include crime and antisocial behaviour and the decline of the traditional high street they have be hit hard by cut to neighbourhood policing and by the decision last year to not proceed with the regeneration of northfield high street there be much to do for most of the constituency history it be well know for the longbridge car plant which also draw in worker from the surround area of west heath rednal and beyond for year longbridge pay handsomely into the national purse and it be essential to our defence in time of crisis during the second world war longbridge and its shadow factory produce many of the armament and aircraft that keep our nation free if the house will excuse diversion be remind at this point of my grandad story often repeat with pride to we as child about his time station at the air defence at billeseley common when he almost fire rocket at an encroaching german plane the site that begin as the austin work be an important part of our national life at its peak it employ some people model from the austin to the metro become part of our share culture it be hard to believe that next year will mark the anniversary of longbridge closure that occasion must be mark appropriately in birmingham and in parliament the site be now home to an ambitious redevelopment project and importantly some manufacture job be return but travel just short distance and the scar of that closure be still plain to see the male employment rate remain staggering point low than in birmingham as whole shamefully average monthly wage be low in the constituency than they be in after inflation the scourge of in work poverty be never far away today my constituent be most likely to be employ in public service be proud to be the son of two teacher even if sadly the headquarters of the nasuwt the teachers union which my parent be member of for many year be just over the border in the neighbouring constituency of bromsgrove there will be more to say much more in this parliament about the funding and delivery of service in birmingham it be enough to say today that after year of severe cut the second city be bleed and welcome the statement that the new government have make about the importance of put local government funding on sustainable footing the new government plan to establish fair pay agreement for adult social care and to reinstate the school support staff negotiate body will also make real material and long overdue difference to thousand of low pay worker in the northfield constituency most of they woman who be proud to help represent as an officer of the gmb union and whose skill and professionalism have be undervalue for too long if could achieve one thing in the time have in this place it would be to secure improvement to special educational need and disability provision it be cause that be close to my heart be one of those child know what it mean to have to fight to avoid be define by other people low expectation know the stigma that be the mark of attitude that be still common and from word that will not repeat in this place wish that could say otherwise but it never leave you know too that child life can turn on access to an identification or single decision about adjustment and resource or even for the want of few encouraging word so if speak for moment in anger it be because too many child and family in birmingham and beyond face barrier that be high now than they be year ago in breach of the promise that life for each generation will be well than the last it be not enough to fight for people within fail system we have to change it that be one of the cause come to parliament to advocate for and welcome the commitment on send make by the education secretary and the prime minister in the early day of this parliament
