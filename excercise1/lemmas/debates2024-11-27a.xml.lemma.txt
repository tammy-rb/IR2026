since the election do the secretary of state agree that the recent budget give the northern ireland executive the opportunity to really go for growth after many year of uncertainty do there be no doubt that the funding the northern ireland executive receive as result of the budget be more than they have anticipate but all government be about make choice with the resource we have and the income we can raise and decide what our priority be the budget provide sound foundation for the northern ireland executive to take the decision they need to take do the secretary of state agree that to ensure sustainable finance the northern ireland executive need to set out clear step to reform both the nhs and broad public service do agree with that as my hon friend and the house will know the long waiting list in the health service in the united kingdom be to be find in northern ireland that be not acceptable above all for those people who be wait far too long there be plan for reform which welcome but the people of northern ireland want to see progress happen just last week attend and speak at rally host by the ulster farmers union in response to the change to agricultural property relief it be attend by farmer with every political party in northern ireland stand together in opposition to the change when will the government acknowledge that their figure be not reflective of the average farm and that this death tax will result in the break up of family farm as we know they the selling of land to pay the tax and the purchasing of devalue land by big business that be not interested in use it to feed our nation will the secretary of state outline whether he have share the concern of northern ireland farmer with the chancellor have speak to the secretary of state for the environment food and rural affairs and treasury minister about this understand that the change be unwelcome and difficult but give the fiscal position the government be have to take difficult decision there be however difference of view about how many farm will be affect and the treasury estimate be about claim year we can not infer from land value an inheritance tax liability because it depend on the ownership structure of the farm the secretary of state know that there be extra funding for the running of the police service of northern ireland and about the issue with police recruitment but there be also the issue of not have new police college will he give commitment that he will speak to the first minister the deputy first minister and the justice minister to ensure that that police college be build at kinnegar that be an issue for the executive but as the hon member allude to the position on police funding have be improve with additional money be give to the psni by the executive out of extra funding that the budget provide the uk government have also increase the additional security funding that be give in recognition of the security need in northern ireland with mile between my constituency of dumfries and galloway and northern ireland know how much we have in common unfortunately we also share the fact that hospitality business in northern ireland and much of scotland be not benefit from discount on business rate bill that can not be call headwind to quote van morrison it be full force gale do the secretary of state agree that by increase employer national insurance contribution rather than grow the economy on both side of the north channel we be threaten job stop investment jack up price and put business viability at risk the business meet in northern ireland be vibrant and look forward to the future of course the increase in employer national insurance contribution present challenge for some business but there be no get away from the fiscal inheritance that this government find when we arrive in office the foundation have to be fix and that be what we be do call the shadow secretary of state associate conservative members with the remark that the under secretary of state make about ken reid he will be very much miss belated happy birthday to the secretary of state for yesterday last week the secretary of state suggest to the northern ireland affairs committee that the treasury have not yet conduct detailed analysis of how the budget will affect farmer in northern ireland have he now ask it to do so the treasury have conduct an analysis of the overall number of farm that it think will be affect it be important that people look at all the arrangement that we have put in place include how as the hon gentleman will know individual can pass million on to family member and couple up to million when all the allowance be add together as well as interest free payment over year of course land transfer seven year before death can go to child with no inheritance tax pay should have congratulate the hon gentleman on his double hat appointment he be shadow chancellor of the duchy of lancaster as well as shadow secretary of state he will now have many merry conversation with himself about the windsor framework and hope conversation with the secretary of state he will know that the make up of farming in northern ireland be slightly different from that in the rest of the uk there be great density of farm in sole ownership and agricultural land be worth more that mean that farm in northern ireland be more expose to labour family farm tax the farmer have meet in northern ireland be deeply concerned about that as the secretary of state say there be disagreement nationally about the figure on one side we have the government who say that not many farm will be affect on the other side we have the expert who say that very many farm will be affect transparency will help everyone will the secretary of state commit to ask the chancellor to publish detailed treasury work on the budget impact on farm in northern ireland so that independent expert can check their figure to understand the impact we have to look at the ownership structure of each individual farm be not entirely sure whether the hon gentleman be advocate that the government should do that for all farm right across the country it will be for farmer to look at the arrangement that will apply from and to take advice on how they can ensure that they can continue to pass their family farm to their child and grandchild call the liberal democrat spokesperson total income from farming in northern ireland fall by last year amid volatile market soar cost and decline output more than northern ireland farmer recently gather in the eikon exhibition centre to highlight the impact that the change to agricultural property relief will have on their sector with dairy farming face serious economic challenge and gross agricultural output decline can the secretary of state commit to publish full impact assessment of apr removal for northern ireland farming sector as well as its wide implication as indicate in answer to the same question moment ago until we understand the ownership structure of each farm do not see how an impact assessment that would answer the hon member question could be do now that farmer know what the new arrangement be go to be urge they to take advice there be number of thing that they can do last week meet the ulster farmers union and number of young farmer and be in no doubt about the concern that they have express it be really important that we discuss it on the basis of the fact and that people look at how they can plan for their future city and growth deals what discussion he have have with the northern ireland executive on the future of city and growth deal in northern ireland it be pleasure to sign the head of term document for the mid south west growth deal alongside

regenerative tool in northern ireland and the wide uk with deal like this agree these deal be all about partnership and place include their heritage all those be an integral part of the approach in belfast the city deal be roar ahead with thing such as the advanced manufacturing centre and considerable investment in digital appreciate the government focus on growth especially green light the city and growth deal and their transformative impact on our often overlook economy and infrastructure the forthcoming windsor framework review present an opportunity to look not just at east west trade which be important but at other overlook issue to allow we to realise the growth potential of our unique trading arrangement will the secretary of state consider ambitious term of reference for that review to allow we to maximise growth and innovation by explore issue such as dual market access and north south co operation as set out in law whether there be an independent review depend on the outcome of the consent vote that will take place in the northern ireland assembly the government would be under legal obligation to commission review if it be not pass with cross community consent would expect the review to focus on article to of the windsor framework but it would be for the reviewer to consider how they conduct it associate myself with the minister of state remark about ken reid he be colossus of northern ireland politic and journalism more broadly across the country thank she for those comment the secretary of state will know that get the city and growth deal back on track be good follow the disappointment of the pause that follow the incoming government he will also know that there be commitment in the spring budget to support skill and education centre at the

with the deputy prime minister be aware of the pause that affect the particular project to which the right hon gentleman refer consideration will then have to be give to how that may or may not be take forward but note his interest and will follow development carefully the secretary of state know that city and growth deal be about economic growth and ensure prosperity within northern ireland be he aware of the concern among business in england wales and scotland who be say that as result of the general product safety standard emanating from the european union they can not send their product

northern ireland who want to trade and to consumer who want to buy in their own country but be currently frustrated from do so advice be be provide about the general product safety regulation many company already meet its term because they be export from the uk to the european union there be step that some business will have to take but hope the impact will be very small because there be way to

leasehold system all of they be frustrate by the broken promise of the previous government will the prime minister reassure they that this government will introduce legislation as soon as possible to resolve the fleeceholder and leaseholder crisis yes we will do so agree that the last government totally fail to tackle the unfairness of the leasehold system we will provide homeowner with more power

we be deal with the billion black hole that the conservatives leave be not go to write the next five year of budgets at the dispatch box we say that we would not hit the payslip of work people we pass the budget we invest in the future and we keep that promise the prime minister be not fix any foundation he be make everything bad the whole house will have hear he refuse to repeat the chancellor

cbi say on monday that the dot of the government policy do not join up it be right be it on monday the right hon lady say that she would not reverse the increase in national insurance yesterday on their predecessor legacy legislation the opposition could not decide what their position be today they have launch policy commission ask other people to give they some idea for government the right hon lady talk about petition we have massive petition on july in this country we spend year take our party from party of protest to party of government they be hurtle in the opposite direction what load of nonsense we have budget in march this year and tractor be not blockade the street of whitehall afterwards let give the prime minister another example of real business follow his budget the head of mcvitie say that it be hard to understand what the case for investment in the uk be while the prime minister have be hobnob in brazil business have be struggle to digest his budget be it not the case that the employment rights bill show that it be not only the ginger nut that be cause he problem be attend the summit suspect that on their current trajectory the opposition do not know whether they would attend the perhaps the policy commission will come up with an answer on that one we have have record overseas investment in this country the right hon lady keep carp from the sideline she say at the dispatch box that she want all the benefit of the budget all the investment but she do not want to pay for any of it she have rack up billion of unfunded commitment in just three week as leader of the opposition when it come to the economy we be the one who be grow the economy the investment for which the prime minister be take the credit be our work when be the business secretary we negotiate those deal that he announce the bottom line however be that in all that he have say he do not seem to care about the young people who will lose their job as result of his budget perhaps he can show concern for the people who find out yesterday that they could lose their job at vauxhall plant in luton while he fly around make unilateral commitment back at home the real world effect be business close in bedfordshire and basildon do he stand by his promise to ban the sale of petrol car by even if more job will be lose interruption would not normally invite heckle but that one be accurate the question of the position of job in luton be very serious one family and worker will be very worried and we be engage with they but remind the leader of the opposition that the electric vehicle mandate that be an issue in this particular case be introduce by the last government also remind she that she be the business secretary who introduce they we be get on with support those community while she be shout from the sideline the prime minister clearly do not read his briefing about the ev mandate the fact be that we change the date and make it easy for people everything he have do have attack people the budget be an attack on farmer an attack on worker an attack on pensioner an attack on the young and an attack on thousand of charity and business across the country the whole system be break and the prime minister be make thing bad everyone be unhappy be it not good thing that the chancellor be an expert on customer complaint think the right hon lady have just read out the charge sheet against the last government everything be break but the opposition come here every week with absolutely nothing to offer except complaint nothing constructive no new idea they do not know what they be do from one day to the next they be live in fantasy world in which everything be fine apparently for year well the country be feed up with those fantasy it have get rid of those fantasy we be go to take the hard decision the opposition be jump on every pass bandwagon while we be take the country forward as we enter the last week of islamophobia awareness month the prime minister will know that this year have be extraordinarily difficult for british muslims on the receive end of society most deplorable attitude they have be consider easy prey for the far right and scapegoate by politician endorse institutional islamophobia the reality be that the emboldening and normalisation of islamophobia as highlight in number of report lead to the race riot that we see on the street of britain this summer when mosque and those who be visibly muslim be subject to despicable attack with many left fear for their life will the prime minister condemn those in public office and position of power who actively promote islamophobia will he commit to adopt definition today and will he far outline what concrete step the government be take to rip out islamophobia at its root include in this place my hon friend be right to raise islamophobia there have be concern rise in islamophobia and antisemitism over recent month and we be commit to tackle all form of hatred we will work with other on an ongoing basis to make sure that we do call the leader of the liberal democrats may associate myself with the prime minister remark about the terrible impact of storm bert and all the flooding our thought be with all those affect with thank to our amazing emergency service christine father be tell that he need end of life care but after few day it be remove due to funding cut he be tell that he would not get it and he die few week later in excruciating pain christine say that it be terrible to watch he suffer do the prime minister agree that whatever the house decide on friday it be urgent that we improve access to high quality end of life care will he make that key focus of the year nhs plan and will he now commit to protect hospice from the national insurance rise thank the right hon gentleman for raise that case and be sure the thought of the whole house be with the family involve obviously there be very important vote on friday but whichever way that vote go we must invest properly in care across our health service that be why in addition to put the nhs back on its foot we be put forward year plan to make sure that the nhs can give the care that everybody would expect across the spectrum include end of life care thank the prime minister for his reply hope that we will hear more from ministers particularly on hospice and national insurance in the day to come turn to the cost of living crisis on friday ofgem say that energy bill will go up again in january after last month rise million of people be really worried about how they will make end meet this winter not least hundred of thousand of pensioner who be in poverty but above the pension credit limit who will now lose winter fuel payment with energy bill go up again will the prime minister reconsider and restore winter fuel payment obviously the whole house be concerned about energy bill which be actually low this year than they be last year the long term way to deal with this issue be to have clean power by to make sure that we drive energy bill down on permanent basis and that be what we will do on the winter fuel allowance the right hon gentleman know very well what the government position be indeed have rehearse it with he many time antisocial behaviour involve modify and off road bike be menace and have huge impact on community such as mine in sunderland although welcome the work that northumbria police do in partnership with our council they need strong power and more resource can the prime minister outline how he will back the police to tackle the misery cause by intimidate and downright dangerous antisocial behaviour on bike thank my hon friend for raise this issue because antisocial behaviour affect so many people sometimes it be describe to as low level but its impact be not particularly when it come to off road bike that be why we be implement tough new respect order which will give power to the police include power to seize off road bike and crucially power of arrest for breach of order something that have be miss in recent year we will tackle this problem because it blight community across the country as everyone in the house will be aware we be currently in the middle of the bbc scam awareness week the advice in that context be always simple if you see scam you should report it with that in mind can the prime minister advise the house whether he be aware of anyone who have promise to reduce energy bill only for they to increase be he aware of anyone who promise to back business only to tax business and be he aware of anyone who promise to protect pensioner only to pick their pocket for their winter fuel allowance it be order those in the gallery will not clap or interrupt the proceeding be very glad to see the right hon gentleman in his seat in the house and be sure that many of his colleague in scotland share that sentiment what can point to be government in scotland that promise to take scotland forward and take it backwards so can identify the first one and it be right there november mark islamophobia awareness month last year the united nations human rights council adopt resolution condemn the desecration of religious text include the koran despite opposition from the previous government act of such mindless desecration only serve to fuel division and hatred within our society will the prime minister commit to introduce measure to prohibit the desecration of all religious text and the prophet of the abrahamic religion agree that desecration be awful and should be condemn across the house we be as say before commit to tackle all form of hatred and division include islamophobia in all its form sarah and her family have farm beef cattle in my constituency for over year and they have always plan for her sister to continue the family legacy early this year sarah mother die suddenly and unexpectedly she be just sarah say to that despite already have tragic year it be make even bad after the budget she say change to agricultural property relief have hit we hard while we already struggle to cope with bereavement and lose mum what would the prime minister say to sarah and her family in what have be the most difficult year of their life in the light of the family farm tax be grateful to the hon lady for raise that case and the awful bereavement if she would kindly send the detail will certainly have look at the case in relation to farm more broadly as she know billion be set aside in the budget over the next two year as an investment in farming that be the big amount that have ever be set hear the chuntering but the conservatives actually fail to spend the last farming budget by million on the question of inheritance of family farm it be important to bear in mind that in typical case which be parent pass to child the threshold be million and that be why as she know the vast majority of farm will be totally unaffected southwark face significant challenge with antisocial behaviour but we have few police today than in due to tory cut in coalition with the lib dems as the prime minister fix the postcode lottery of law and order will he consider the request from southwark police southwark council and myself for our community to be pilot test area for the new respect order to address this serious problem be grateful to my hon friend for raise this because

money they be entitle to in return all that funding will be confirm in the usual way we recognise that labour be determined to defend the economically disastrous conservative policy of be outside the custom union and single market however do the prime minister agree with the principle that where it be in our country interest to maintain alignment with eu standard so that we can well sell our product internationally we align and where it be in our interest to diverge we diverge certainly agree that the deal we get under the last government be not the good deal that we can get that be why we be determined to reset the relationship and we have already begin that obviously there will be no return to freedom of movement the customs union or the single market but beyond that we can increase and improve the situation whether on trading security or other co operation and we be actively work on that the final question be from frank mcnally follow major fire at the tradebe depot in

grip of clinical waste disposal and must act appropriately to protect the public purse and ensure public safety do agree with that and it be the rule rather than the exception when it come to the snp government the challenge for they now be that they have the power to act and they have now be give the money to act they have run out of excuse that complete prime minister question stellantis luton with permission mr speaker wish to make statement on the announcement by stellantis yesterday on the future of its manufacturing site in the united kingdom know that yesterday be dark day for luton this be an iconic plant power by talented workforce there be very few people in the town who do not know someone who work at the site wish to outline the step that the government have take to try to prevent this outcome and how we be go to support the industry and the area go forward the transport secretary and find out about the challenge of this site just day after the election the global chief executive officer tell we that he feel extremely frustrated by the lack of action from the previous government which mean that his desire be to close the luton plant since then we have be involve in intense negotiation with the company to try to find way to keep the site open follow these initial meeting in july of this year the company announce its intention to conduct review of its operation in response to the significant pressure that it be face in key market follow the review the company set out plan on tuesday which will see manufacturing at the two current stellantis plant consolidate into single location we be and be aware that stellantis have significant excess capacity across europe the company talk of efficiency and investment elsewhere will of course be positive for its bottom line but that will come as no comfort to the worker affect for more than century vauxhall as brand have be synonymous with luton and we be bitterly disappointed to hear that this relationship look likely to end our no priority be the people of luton who will of course be devastate by this decision news such as this rip through the heart of community send shock wave beyond those immediately impact through their family their community and the business that they support grow up in car community and know what it be like when half the street work at the same site we have ask the company to urgently share its full plan with we and to work with the government so that every single worker who be impact receive the support they deserve the department for work and pensions stand ready to help anyone affect with rapid response service design exactly for these kind of scenario it provide vital support and advice to both employer and their employee face redundancy want the house to be aware that we have do everything we possibly can to prevent this closure my right hon friend the secretary of state for transport and meet stellantis many time over the summer and again on tuesday morning to discuss the situation and the acute pressure that the company be face we have work hard to find solution that would support the business and ensure that people keep their job and we confirm in write that we be willing to consider any solution put forward however despite our good effort we have be force to accept that this be ultimately commercial decision by stellantis as it respond to wide challenge within the sector and will be frank with hon member these challenge be not confine to any one company car manufacturer around the world be battle with increase cost supply chain issue and change consumer demand in highly competitive fast evolve market hon member will know that last week ford also announce job loss in the uk over the next three year as part of major restructure programme across the whole of europe many of the challenge face by our car manufacturer be global in nature and they can not be resolve by uk government intervention alone although this announcement be not what we want or what we work towards we must not mischaracterise this it categorically do not signal retreat by stellantis from the uk the plan announce by the company will also see it invest million as it consolidate manufacture at its ellesmere port plant in cheshire hon member will know that ellesmere port be the uk first all battery electric vehicle plant and stellantis decision to bring production of the vivaro electric van to there be welcome we will of course continue to work closely with the company on next step of the consolidation process include the proposal to offer affected worker relocation package to take up role at ellesmere port the investment be make at ellesmere port and elsewhere demonstrate that there be real opportunity for uk manufacturing as part of the move to zero emission vehicle but the transition have to be properly manage that require government who be on the pitch something that the car industry finally have in this government the government be determined to support automotive company as they revamp their production line adjust their business plan and develop the technology need for the next generation of zero emission vehicle these car and van be green clean and essential to our net zero ambition roughly of the uk greenhouse gas emission come from car van and lorry to tackle that and wean our country off import fossil fuel we need zero emission vehicle but the government be resolute that the transition must be do in partnership between government industry and of course consumer that be why the secretary of state for transport and be listen closely to the concern of the automotive industry and the wide sector about the transition to electric vehicle and about the conservative party zero emission vehicle mandate we hold roundtable early this month to hear directly from major automotive company the society of motor manufacturers and traders and the charge sector and in response we will shortly fast track consultation on our manifesto commitment to end the sale of new pure petrol and diesel car by we will use that consultation to engage with industry on the previous government zev transition mandate and the flexibility in it and we will welcome the industry feedback as we move forwards we want to do everything that we can together with industry to secure further investment in the british automotive sector now and over the long term that be why in the budget the chancellor commit billion to research and development and capital funding to support the zero emission vehicle manufacturing sector and supply chain also our industrial strategy will give the automotive sector the certainty that it deserve and will send clear signal to global boardroom that the government be in this for the long term we want to invest alongside they create policy environment that allow they to prosper and help they to do what they do well bring good job to every part of this country through the national wealth fund we be unlock billion in private investment in new green infrastructure include gigafactorie and support growth and job creation not just in the automotive sector but in the wide economy we be work with investor to build globally competitive electric vehicle supply chain in the uk and so be lay the foundation for growth over the long term the closure of the luton plant by stellantis be bitter blow to our car industry to luton and to the worker who make vauxhall world class brand produce world class car and van but we must not lose sight of the fact that those vehicle will continue to be design and build here in the uk at ellesmere port that matter to and it matter to the government when say that decarbonisation must not mean deindustrialisation mean it win the race to net zero and have world lead automotive sector must go hand in hand we must never undermine the transition as the previous government do but we will be pragmatic in ensure that regulation and incentive be work as they should contrived culture war be not what the industry need instead it need partner in government ready to look at the practical solution that be necessary we stand ready to do that and commend this statement to the house call the shadow secretary of state thank the secretary of state for advance sight of his statement this be sad day for the worker at the luton vauxhall factory and our thought be first and foremost with they and their family they be the most recent custodian in long history that go back to when their factory open its door for the first time luton build white van be icon of british business represent to many the hard graft and skill of million of trader the self employ and small business across this country the opposition stand by those hard work people we be on the side of the plant worker because we know the value of skilled work and the transformative power of british business the closure of the luton plant fear be just down payment on the job that will be lose through this government relentless attack on industry their neglect of the reality of business and their failure to meet their promise not to raise taxis the government owe it to the plant worker to at least be honest this decision be the direct result of government policy that be simply unworkable for industry stellantis tell we as much when it say that the decision be make within the context of the zev mandate the society of motor manufacturers and traders say the uk situation be particularly acute with arguably the tough target and most accelerate timeline in the world and that unsustainable business cost undermine uk industry the government policy on zero emission vehicle be job killer they say they have be talk since july so why this panic turn today when it be already too late the last government acknowledge that the previous vehicle mandate be too stringent we take the decision to push it back recognise the impact that it would have on industry we listen to unite the union on this the secretary of state party unilaterally reverse those change and bring the deadline forward to instead of listen to unite he listen to the member for climate central the right hon member for doncaster north ed miliband even today the secretary of state speak of end the sale of new purely petrol and diesel car by he try to slip subtle change in there the consequence of which be significant welcome the fact that for once this government have listen to business but he appear to be mislead business at the same time can he explain exactly what his policy be as we see today there be real cost to these target instead of have the courage to recognise that he be wrong his solution appear to be yet another consultation which be yet to take place how many automotive business have the secretary of state speak to about the target in any of his conversation with stellantis do it ask he at any point to remove the fine have he meet the right hon member for doncaster north to entreat he to row back from his ideological pursuit of domestic target which ignore the fact british job be be export to more carbon intensive economy most of all we must not ignore the elephant in the room the timing of the decision it follow budget that declare war on business with triple whammy of tax rise that remove incentive for growth and investment billion job tax which have leave boardroom across the country put recruitment and pay rise on hold and an employment rights bill that the secretary of state write while hand in hand with his union paymaster which be already deter business from hire in britain business be ring the alarm bell the cbi the british retail consortium ukhospitality and the society of motor manufacturers and traders have all say that the pressure on business be too much to swallow in open letter after open letter statement after statement they say that labour be not on their side it lie about its plan it be attack work people and now it be attack the van that they go to work in the businessman and woman who give labour the benefit of the doubt be regret it when will the secretary of state listen when will his government abandon their attack on british business will he lead the charge to change course why will he not suspend the fine and target that have lead to today tragedy that be the single most dishonest statement have ever hear in my time in this house order be sure the right hon gentleman will withdraw that comment mr speaker would like to clarify some of the point that the hon gentleman raise the zev mandate policy order we be on the same side we will be quiet wo we the zev mandate policy that the shadow minister mention be policy of the previous government as he be aware the change that the previous government make be not to the zev mandate they be not pragmatic about it they change the destination and keep the fine the ramp up and the threshold exactly the same they allow no flexibility or pragmatism in how the policy operate but still undermine the transition lead to massive reduction in consumer confidence he ask whether have talk to industry be the guest speaker at the smmt dinner last night people be there from every bit of the automotive sector they be absolutely clear they support the destination it be how the previous conservative government policy operate that be cause they the problem as say in the statement as he would know if he be listen or have read it in advance day into this government we be tell that the plant be likely to close labour have act with pragmatism we have be willing to look at any part of the policy to prevent this outcome the simple truth be that it be too late after year of failure to put this right say to the hon gentleman with all politeness that he be out of touch with industry with worker and even with what the previous conservative government do and that speak for itself call the chair of the select committee this be indeed hard day for luton welcome what the secretary of state share with the house and the review of the zero emission mandate that he announce in that review hope that he look again at the perversity of the regime that he inherit which could involve petrol engine maker in this country transfer credit to company like elon musk tesla and to chinese ev maker if we really want to ensure level playing field why do we not reverse the decision of the last secretary of state follow the eu commission and launch anti subsidy investigation into chinese ev maker the trade remedies authority be ready to go it just need the secretary of state to give the green light be grateful to the chair of the select committee include for the exchange that we have in the committee evidence session yesterday he be right that because of the position we inherit the issue with the flexibility in the policy and the fact that no domestic producer be on track the transfer he describe be effectively the problem that be why say that decarbonisation can not mean deindustrialisation it be precisely what we inherit that we be critique we do not want to undermine the transition in the way the previous prime minister do anyone in industry in the sector could tell conservative member how disastrous that be but we need to give breathing space and ensure that the policy have none of the perverse incentive that he describe on subsidy the trade remedies authority and the potential response from the uk we have to bear in mind two thing first under the system that we inherit industry make the application have power to do that as secretary of state but they have never be use to my knowledge secondly we must remember that the uk automotive sector be world class export lead sector if we be to go down any kind of protectionist route on principle we would have to bear in mind what it would mean for the market we sell vehicle into if we sell of our product abroad we have to consider the international export position alongside the domestic market position if industry make that request of course that request will be follow up in accordance with the way the system operate call the liberal democrat spokesperson thank the secretary of state for advance copy of his statement yesterday like the secretary of state attend the society of motor manufacturers and traders annual dinner and greatly appreciate the opportunity to hear directly from such an important sector for the british economy uk car manufacturing bring billion of pound into our economy it employ hundred of thousand of people directly and many more thousand across its supply chain it be at the forefront of the green transition and of make transport sustainable for the future via electric vehicle most importantly the industry be always willing to be frank with and with other politician it reaffirm to that it see major hurdle on the horizon and the closure of vauxhall year old factory in luton be sign of great trouble ahead inevitably the conservatives will play politic with the announcement but there be still no apology from they for trash the economy there be not one moment of reflection that the previous government policy on electric vehicle be disaster the policy simply do not do enough on infrastructure and incentive the government therefore need to fix the tories mess as starting point the government urgently need to work with vauxhall to mitigate this major shock for the area the government have say that they will fast track consultation but it need to be fast track today urgency be the key so when will that consultation start and when do the secretary of state expect it to report the previous government do not do enough to incentivise people to buy electric vehicle nor do they provide the right infrastructure what be the government do to increase sale of electric vehicle and increase the number of charge point in place such as my constituency be grateful to the hon gentleman for his question and observation and apologise that he have have to hear speak twice on this topic in the short period of time between last night and today he have ask the conservative party to apologise for its economic record that case stand for itself but would also like to know give how urgently this issue be present to we as new government what the last government be do at the end of their time in office what do they know what conversation be they aware of certainly we inherit position of extreme frustration from the company and can not imagine that that frustration have not be convey in some way to our predecessor turn to the hon gentleman specific question there be policy in the budget relate to charge infrastructure which recognise be key part of this issue as well as billion for research and development through the automotive transformation fund and the partnership with business that we use that fund for obviously the consultation he ask about will come from the department for transport the shadow secretary of state the hon member for arundel and south downs andrew griffith ask why that consultation be happen but the previous government set these policy out in primary legislation so he know that there be process to follow any conversation about the threshold in the exist policy would be for my right hon friend the secretary of state for transport to have but refer back to my point about how the system work and the flexibility and allowance in and how we can make sure that we be give automotive manufacturer in the uk system that let they get to the transition they and the consumer want but in way that work with industry to enable that transition to happen for the benefit of the united kingdom call rachel hopkins refer the house to my entry in the register of members financial interests as trade union member as well as someone with friend who have hear that they have lose their job close the luton site will damage our local economy with more job at risk in the supply chain and worker and family receive this devastating news just before christmas welcome the comment of the secretary of state that decarbonisation must not mean deindustrialisation and the decimation of good skilled job will his announcement today move the dial in discussion with stellantis to help protect the luton site also welcome his tone he be take this seriously compare with opposition members so will he join in visit worker and their trade union representative at the luton site to listen to their concern be extremely grateful to my hon friend for her question believe everyone in the house who care about the automotive sector and work people in this country will share the sentiment she have express about the scale of what this decision will mean for luton can absolutely promise she that will take up her invitation to come with she to the site can also promise she the full deployment of my department and indeed all of my colleague across government to provide whatever help be require we be in conversation with stellantis as be the union believe about the detail of the package that will be present to the workforce but of course will engage closely with my hon friend and with my hon friend the member for luton north sarah owen to make sure that package be to the maximum benefit of her constituent and the wide area as bedfordshire mp know how significant the vauxhall plant be to our local economy and as local employer the secretary of state have explain how devastating this decision will be for family locally not just in luton but in my constituency unfortunately though he have say very little about how he be go to support the people who be lose their job be the secretary of state concern that this government tax on job will make it much more difficult to replace these manufacturing job in bedfordshire be grateful to the hon gentleman for his sentiment but the straightforward answer to that question be no this be skilled and talented workforce these worker have not lose their job because of any deficiency on their part rather they have be put in this position by combination of factor include the overcapacity in europe to be frank from the minute we come into office think the company already intend this closure it have nothing whatsoever to do with government policy recognise the pressure arise from the exist policy we have inherit hence the pragmatism on our part as government to make sure the policy be work for the transition but have no doubt that whether these worker choose to take advantage of the relocation offer or of demand elsewhere they be brilliant talented people who will be in demand refer member to my entry in the register of members financial interests before start want to put on record that the people who will be lose their job in luton today deserve much well than the response from the conservative front bench representative it be very far from factual and very far from serious thank the secretary of state for his statement and welcome any support for vauxhall worker and their family who be understandably devastate by stellantis decision especially this close to christmas it follow the closure of the skf plant in luton north early this year after century of manufacturing like skf vauxhall be or be synonymous with luton stellantis callous decision will impact our whole town our whole region even so what support will be offer not just to the skilled and dedicated vauxhall worker who be lose their job but to our town as whole to cope with the loss of this manufacture giant that luton help build be grateful to my hon friend for her question as well and echo the sentiment express to her constituency neighbour my hon friend the member for luton south and south bedfordshire rachel hopkins this whole decision be regrettable but its timing be particularly regrettable as say in my statement since the new government come into power on july we have do everything we can to try to avoid this decision reiterate the offer have make throughout the negotiating process both in policy flexibility and potential new government investment in the site but regrettably it be not possible to change the decision have make clear the support that be available and reiterate that promise do not want to minimise the impact of this decision in any way but believe my hon friend area be place of considerable economic strength with firm in the engineering aerospace and air travel sector and in the creative industry there be lot to be optimistic about for the future but recognise that that do not take away the bitterness of this particular blow for luton at this time make it clear that conservative members regard this as very grave matter we be take it seriously and we be also deal in fact turn to veracity then can we hear whether or not stellantis raise the question of the eye water zev mandate fine and ask for they to be lift yes in the conversation we have with representative of stellantis they raise every aspect of the previous government policy include the flexibility the ability to cap and trade and some of the allowance and what they would mean for the bottom line take those concern seriously which be why be willing in way that do not undermine the destination to consult on how this policy work alongside my colleague the secretary of state for transport although understand the previous government aspiration and why they introduce this policy do not think that when that decision be make they consider the kind of fall demand that we have see in europe we have to work pragmatically across all bit of government to make sure this policy do not lead to the kind of outcome that many of we who be aware of how exactly this sector work be concern about refer member to my entry in the register of members financial interests welcome the secretary of state statement and be greatly sadden by stellantis decision may suggest that plant and platform rationalisation would have be major factor let we be honest the industry want certainty but automotive manufacturer face the challenge of meet the zev mandate introduce by the last government which be more stringent than that in europe and most other market put simply consumer uncertainty be introduce by the last government so find the remark of the shadow secretary of state disingenuous order disingenuous be aim at particular person we do not do that you have be here long enough to know that and be sure you want to withdraw that comment immediately withdraw it mr speaker thank you urge the government to introduce more flexibility in the annual target from to introduce consumer incentive and consider redirect any penalty towards ev charging infrastructure not to chinese government car company my hon friend make some very good point about the fact that while nearly every major market have policy of this kind our operate in different way from how the french for example proceed with theirs agree that the major failing of the former prime minister speech be to keep this policy in place but change the destination that make no coherent sense whatsoever logically he should have do one or the other do both undermine confidence while still not provide the pragmatic flexibility we be talk about today the specific point that my hon friend have mention will all be part of the consultation that my right hon friend the secretary of state for transport will lead on assure the secretary of state that would have put the question be about to ask to conservative minister equally if all british car manufacturer come together and tell the government that they could not possibly meet this goal would the government nevertheless persevere in maintain it as an immovable target would recognise the right hon gentleman fairness and equity whichever side of the house he be sit on and have no doubt about that we do listen to those in industry and we have very close relationship with they which be why we understand that the destination they want be the pressure on the system in the next few year be because of this situation but say this in good faith to conservative members do not believe that the ministers at the time consider the full set of european and global economic factor when make these decision that be why we have to get the balance right give that we be an export lead automotive producer we should also recognise that if we be not ambitious about the transition we would lose our export market we would not have anything to sell because other country have such policy and that be where the consumer be go this be about how we support the transition and we be work closely with they industry on that draw attention to my entry in the register of members financial interests as member of unite the union thank the secretary of state for come to the house on such difficult day for the car industry and all our thought be with the worker in luton today thank he for the work he be do in engage with the industry and with union on well way forward on electric vehicle target this news be really disappointing but do he agree that we can and should be positive about the future of the automotive industry in this country it matter to locally as the mp for many business in the automotive supply chain as know it also matter to many member across the house thoroughly agree with the content and sentiment of my hon friend question the support this government be commit to be about that transition but we should be excite by what british manufacturer such as jaguar land rover nissan and toyota be do and at the luxury end of the market about mclaren and rolls royce supercar could mention all of our iconic brand and there be lot of exciting thing go on if hon member be not aware of that all those manufacturer be more than happy to host member of parliament come to visit so encourage people to do so however they will explain the pressure they be under in the short term and they will endorse the change of policy this government be put forward the electric vehicle association say that non governmental organisation think tank and campaign group be advocate for uphold the zev mandate we have just see the most devastating storm which have be dangerously accelerate by climate change know that the government know that net zero be not negotiable the previous government persistently undermine the motor manufacturing industry will this government listen to the electric vehicle association which after all be support this government in their ambition to get to net zero genuinely appreciate the question come from that perspective but this be not just about ngos we have be in close contact with big business about charge infrastructure and understand the importance of that want to make it clear that that be why we be not undermine transition but be ambitious with the industry about where we will get to nothing we propose as government will itself reduce or limit the deployment of electric vehicle what be talk about and what we be talk about as government be look at how for instance the flexibility in the system operate we be do everything we can alongside industry to get to that destination want nothing to do with the approach of the previous government which have really detrimental effect on the industry as it will tell any hon member very clearly be listen to what it mean to have this change in economic circumstance in relation to private demand for electric vehicle and want to work with industry to get to the place or the destination that think we both strongly support the previous government be warn before the election include multiple time in this chamber about the damage they be do to the car industry the constant change of policy on net zero miss target on the roll out of charge point and the failure to even allocate the rapid charging fund have all undermine consumer confidence will my right hon friend make sure that as soon as possible after his review he balance the need of manufacturer of car and van with the need of consumer believe my hon friend analysis be absolutely right and he and be in the chamber on several occasion when that case be make to the previous government the intervention from the former prime minister be not base on any kind of business or economic logic but be an attempt to create some sort of wedge issue before the election frankly that do they absolutely no good because people see straight through it say again that to change the deadline but keep the exist threshold in place up until be the bad of all world it really do have negative impact on consumer confidence and we will never repeat those mistake the secretary of state say in his statement that at the time of the election stellantis be minded to close the plant however since the election we have have the budget which have impose billion of increase taxis on business and the employment rights bill which will also increase cost on business enormously both have lead directly to collapse in business confidence do the secretary of state think that those decision help stellantis to stay or go can tell the hon member categorically that those decision have no impact whatsoever this be the crucial point hear conservative member say this but do they have any idea about employment condition in the automotive sector those condition be well above the floor that the employment rights bill will raise they to in the united kingdom they should get out and talk to industry and have such conversation please to be clear on the wide point the hon member make about business confidence recognise that the outrageous inheritance this government walk in on with conservative ministers not even plan to say how they would pay for the promise they have make create speculation about where the revenue would come from regret the fact that we have to make difficult decision ideally we would not have want to make those decision but we be the people fix the foundation and clear up the mess the conservative party leave behind there can be no long term prosperity unless we have serious government willing to do that refer the house to my entry in the register of members financial interests be sure the whole house will want to join in pay tribute to my good friend my hon friend the member for luton south and south bedfordshire rachel hopkins who be fierce champion for her constituent do the secretary of state agree that the news yesterday only highlight far the urgent need for uk industrial strategy and demonstrate the challenge that uk industry face under the last government without such strategy in place absolutely echo my hon friend sentiment about my hon friend the member for luton south and south bedfordshire and very much agree with her statement about uk industrial strategy there have be and be policy relevant to the automotive sector but what we have lack for long time across range of key sector in the uk be confidence and certainty that those plan will remain people have talk during this statement about the action of the previous prime minister in that intervention but that be exactly the opposite of what be require for long term policy the advanced manufacturing sector be one of the eight sector in our industrial strategy it be sector of tremendous strength in the united kingdom and our intention be to build on that and grow it to deliver even more success in future which be why it be such fundamental part of our plan commiserate with the worker in luton who will lose their job if vauxhall be synonymous with luton ford be synonymous with essex the secretary of state refer to ford job loss include at its research centre at dunton where many of my rayleigh and wickford constituent work on electric vehicle specifically be free trader by instinct but what china be do in that area be way beyond normal competitive practice it be dump electric vehicle very cheaply on world market point highlight by the chairman of the select committee the right hon member for birmingham hodge hill and solihull north liam byrne what specifically do the government intend to do about that to maintain fair competition and give british company include ford and vauxhall fair chance to compete first let reiterate my word about the right hon member constituent and the situation at ford have face this accusation before but if anyone think the government be somehow only listen to one part of industry or be respond to special pleading the announcement by ford follow by what we have have from stellantis this week be proof that we do need to move to listen and to look at some of the policy we inherit and make sure they be work as they should reiterate my early comment to the chair of the select committee we have not change the trade remedies authority and the system we inherit if ford or any other company want to make referral against unfair competitive practice it can do that but such request have not come from any part of the industry to date would not for second describe the chinese economy as one that operate on the market principle with which we be familiar but we have to be aware that the fundamental threat from china come from its commitment to research and development innovation high tech solution and be able to manufacture at scale we be kid ourselves if we think the threat be just unfair competition that economy have an incredible level of ambition for the future which be why we have to raise our game as well many of my constituent will be impact by this deeply worrying announcement so can the secretary of state confirm what discussion he be have with trade union on this specific subject and what plan he have to mitigate the job loss for resident of north east hertfordshire again recognise the situation face my hon friend constituent and there will be support on offer from the government he ask specifically about conversation with trade union can confirm that have several conversation just yesterday for instance with sharon graham the general secretary of unite to ensure that what the government be do and what be be negotiate by the recognise union on behalf of the workforce be consistent recognise that for many people in the local area the offer of relocation as part of the deal will not be attractive as people have link family and other situation however as the detail emerge promise that will keep the house and members of parliament update and work closely with they to ensure that it be everything it can be let we be honest these job loss be direct result of net zero and the previous government electric vehicle target be the secretary of state aware that car manufacturer across europe be lose fortune on ev production they be try to delay target and what we be witness be just the beginning of the slow agonising painful and tragic destruction of hundred of thousand of direct and indirect job in the uk automotive industry certainly agree that we should be honest and the hon gentleman characterisation of the uk automotive sector be simply not correct all ask he to do be this do not listen to the government or even the opposition but go and speak to the industry and the firm involve he should ask they about their investment plan and find out why he be so out of touch with industry sentiment many of the problem in some other european country have come from lack of ambition on transition fundamentally if we be sell of what we make in the uk to other market there be no long term market for internal combustion engine and we must recognise that again the hon gentleman should not take it from the government he should take it from industry be afraid that on this one as with our exchange on steel few month ago he be just out of touch with what consumer and business want do my right hon friend agree that unlike the conservative party this labour government do not regard the word industrial strategy as anathema do he agree that uk industry in general and the automotive sector specifically suffer under the previous government due to their laissez faire stand aside approach very much believe that industrial strategy be essential to the future of the united kingdom hop that this would be support on cross party basis and see no reason why conservative members or anyone else would not support an industrial strategy indeed some conservative members or their predecessor hold position similar to the one hold they get this and believe in it and do quite good job in some difficult circumstance within the conservative party yes an industrial strategy be essential to this government and hope the whole house will get behind our plan for invest the response from industry have be superb it be what we need as country and we should all get behind that it be clearly sad day for luton and worker there but the secretary of state must remember that this be not just about luton but about the whole car manufacturing industry and worker up and down the country in that industry will be say be go to be next will the secretary of state set out his position on conversation that he be have with other car manufacturer to ensure that the same thing do not happen to they reiterate the point make in my statement this be about the whole sector and while we walk in to find certain position with this plant when we form the government on july we recognise that there be also sector wide issue that be why we have be have these conversation and why we be willing to show pragmatism and change some of the policy we have inherit to ensure that they be work for british industry the hon gentleman ask about specific conversation as say in my statement just last week we have meeting with all the major uk base original equipment manufacturer and wide representative of the sector to talk about the flexibility that might be require to make this policy work in way that do not undermine british industry but get we to common destination for industry government and consumer together that be exactly what we be do and whatever conservative member feel about the previous government policy ask they to get behind that ambition success in the transition to electrical vehicle be vital for the west country and somerset in particular with the new agratas battery plant that be come to somerset and the port of bristol through which go vehicle year will the secretary of state please act to support consumer and consumer confidence by restore the plug in grant assure the hon member that will do everything can to bolster consumer confidence say all the time that product make in the united kingdom be great if people be unaware of just how great they be they should book themselves test drive or visit the production line and see how brilliant they be the agratas factory be an incredible investment and will be significant have always say that for the long term future of this sector we must make battery in the united kingdom over the long term vehicle will be make where the battery be make and that be key part of the industrial strategy for the sector can not make an announcement on the plug in grant as that be not cover by the department for business and trade but confirm to the hon member that across the government whether in the treasury the department for transport or the department for energy security and net zero we be all unite in want to make the transition success and we be willing to listen to hon member like herself and to industry about the policy that be necessary to do that in his statement the secretary of state mention the job loss at ford in dunton in my constituency and thank the minister for industry for speak to on the phone early this week about that welcome the fast track of the review that the secretary of state be put forward agree with my right hon friend the member for rayleigh and wickford mr francois and the chair of the business and trade committee and have speak to manufacturer about potential chinese electric car dumping in the uk will the secretary of state comment on that concern have also be raise with by local car manufacturer about the increase in vehicle excise duty on some model in the budget be there any possibility that some of those measure could be look at again as they be have an impact on the demand for such vehicle in the uk be grateful that we have be able to get the right hon gentleman some time with minister regard the serious situation affect his constituent member of this government will always take that seriously as believe ministers do under the previous administration vehicle excise duty be question for the treasury and the chancellor but the differential that exist from change in the budget between internal combustion engine and electric vehicle be one of the demand incentive that now exist within the system everyone would recognise that the government should do everything they can to support industry during the transition and such measure be part of the answer if the right hon gentleman have specific concern we will always be willing to listen to those the secretary of state be robust in his criticism of the previous government and their approach to the zero emission vehicle mandate but be he one of the labour mp who vote for the zev mandate let be clear we work constructively on the zev mandate that the previous conservative government put forward believe in incentive towards the transition be not argue against that react to the sheer brass neck of those on the opposition front bench who somehow do not even recognise that it be their policy that we be willing to change and present the argument as if it be the other way round will be robust in say that the fact be as they be when those on the opposition front bench be not willing to accept they we want this transition to work this be not about the destination or even the threshold this be about the flexibility how the policy operate and what that mean for market condition in the united kingdom that be an entirely reasonable and proper response to what we find walk through the door as new government and see no reason why people can not pragmatically get on board and support that one thing stop some of my constituent from transition to electric vehicle be lack of access to charge point as constituency neighbour the secretary of state will know that some of the housing stock in my patch lend itself more easily to personalised charging point than other part what more can the government do to ensure that everyone can access charge point to make the transition to evs agree that that be one concern that consumer have the principal concern for consumer on ev take up be the cost of the vehicle the hon member will know from our constituency that in some place it be difficult to envisage the kind of infrastructure that people take for grant in area that have more capacity to have it build into property and driveway there be about public ev charger in the united kingdom and there be not always equity across different part of the country lot of people be surprised to learn that we have more public charger than norway for instance which be very much the leader in electric vehicle roll out there be money in the budget to expand the roll out of charge point and build on the already in place but the hon member be right to say that that be key concern we must consider not just the overall number of charge point but the equity of those around the country and promise that the department for transport be interested in that thank the secretary of state for his statement and in particular for his honesty it be important to have that when we look at the bleak thing we have before we the secretary of state will understand that with the cost of living crisis that our constituent be struggle through the last thing on their mind be to afford forgive an all singing all dance electric car they be clearly struggle to pay their electric bill the closure of the plant which highlight the lack of passion for electric car can come as no surprise what can the government do to make electric car affordable for everyone which would enhance the need for car manufacturer once again be grateful to the hon member for his question and the way in which he put it he be right that cost of live concern be paramount we have also get to recognise that the cost of petrol and diesel be often key consideration in overall household finance the hon member ask specifically about what we can do to bring down the cost it be about co invest with industry in the most efficient form of production he mention an all singing all dance ev but there be whole range of vehicle available many of our producer have lead on family car the nissan leaf be great example of that make by some of my former school friend in sunderland we should get behind that and talk about how great those product be but fundamentally we need now to bring down not just the cost of the charge infrastructure but the unit cost that can be do only by investment in efficient production and scale production that be why the destination be so important work with industry on that destination be key to deliver the outcome that think he and want respect orders and antisocial behaviour with permission madam deputy speaker will make statement on the government action to tackle antisocial behaviour from residential neighbourhood to busy high street from roll countryside to city centre and from idyllic village to bustling town the place of britain should be source of local pride as well as be safe they should feel safe for those who live and work in they yet the dismal reality be that in too many area the opposite be true in the last year of the previous government shop theft soar by to year high street theft surge by and antisocial behaviour reach new height in our town and city that be the conservative party legacy on law and order up and down the country people feel uneasy or even unsafe unruly gang roam the street create intimidation and fear noisy off road vehicle speed around disturb the peace illegal drug be abuse with brazenness public space be awash with litter and graffiti and an epidemic of shop theft be plague retailer big and small while their staff be subject to intolerable level of abuse and violence at its core this be about respect respect between citizen respect for our society and the expectation underpin it and respect for the rule of law all those be weave into the fabric of our democracy but after year of neglect that fabric have become worn we see disgraceful illustration of that in the summer when serious disorder erupt in some town and city we see it on small scale every day as decent law abide people suffer due to the selfishness of other more than third of england and wales report experience or witness some type of antisocial behaviour in their local area while about million incident of antisocial behaviour be record by police in the year to june we must never make the mistake of dismiss this menace as low level or trivial to do so would be an insult to the victim it may manifest itself in different way in different area but wherever and however it occur there be an adverse impact on neighbourhood and community antisocial behaviour chip away at people sense of pride and confidence in their local area it ruin their enjoyment of public space for those affect by the most serious and persistent case their quality of life be damage one victim quote in report on antisocial behaviour publish recently by the victims commissioner say this every day cry it make anxious and it actually make physically sick another say it totally isolate and nobody can understand the pressure it put on you be sure that all hon member across the house will be familiar with account like those from the all too frequent interaction we have with our constituent on these issue early this month visit leyton in east london where hear from local councillor about the importance of partner work together to tackle antisocial behaviour more recently the home secretary and meet victim of antisocial behaviour and shop theft annie valentine and brian roberts from blackpool and tim nye from sheffield to hear about their concern at first hand this can not go on and the government will not stand for it that be why the prime minister have make safe street central pillar of our agenda for change key part of that mission be the work that the home secretary be lead alongside police to put visible neighbourhood police back at the heart of our community by restore that crucial link between police force and the people they serve we will ensure that resident and business have the reassurance they want and need as well as deter would be offender as we implement our neighbourhood policing guarantee we be determined to tackle antisocial behaviour head on today can update the house on that work to turn thing around and effectively combat the problem it be clear that fresh impetus be need which be why we commit in our manifesto to introduce respect order which will enable tough restriction to be place on the bad adult perpetrator of antisocial behaviour those subject to respect order could be ban from town centre as well as be compel to address the root cause of their behaviour for example through mandate alcohol and drug treatment the order will be apply for by the police by council or by social housing provider and issue by the court importantly there will be power of arrest available for all suspect breach protect community and town centre from further harm we be go even far anyone who breach respect order will have commit criminal offence and may face up to two year imprisonment an unlimited fine or community order these new power will be pilot first to ensure that they be as effective as possible we will also crack down on the scourge of off road bike in public park dangerous scooter on pavement and street racing all of which inflict misery on local community under strengthened police power officer will no long be require to issue warning before seize vehicle involve in antisocial behaviour retail crime harm life and livelihood and be must deal with as the serious threat that it be we will introduce new specific offence of assault retail worker and we will end the effective immunity for shop theft of good under the task of make our country safe will not be complete overnight but this be government of action the work of change be under way and as we step up this vital effort we be guide by the simple and unshakeable belief that our street belong to the decent law abide majority for far too long gang yob and thief have be run amok and that be not go to happen any more under this government the safety and security of the public will always come first we will be unrelenting in our mission to restore respect and take back our street call the shadow minister thank the minister for her statement and for advance sight of it it be not right that anyone should live in fear of intimidation in the place that they call home antisocial behaviour have real consequence it can ruin community and prevent people from make the most of their local area antisocial behaviour can make woman and girl feel unsafe walk home at night and it can have huge impact on shop and business if customer be leave feel unsafe visit their high street and town centre we welcome any focus on antisocial behaviour and effort to tackle it but tackle it require more than press release or rebrand those in the sector have describe the propose respect order as wholly unnecessary and near identical to exist power already hold by the police we will engage with the government as proposal be bring forward but we be keen to see meaningful action rather than just the renaming of public space protection order and criminal behaviour order change name will not change outcome the last government launch the antisocial behaviour action plan back by million worth of funding and over hour of police and other uniformed patrol undertake to target antisocial behaviour hotspot as of february our plan lead to nearly additional arrest close to stop and search and around us of antisocial behaviour power such as community protection order and public protection order my own labour police and crime commissioner in cleveland have commend the huge contribution make by the last government hotspot police initiative uniform patrol deliver by local authority warden in cleveland clock up total of hour on the street of stockton hartlepool middlesbrough and redcar as result between september and august the police report that incident of antisocial behaviour be down by in hotspot area we also ban nitrous oxide and increase fine for fly tipping litter and graffiti all of which be blight on our community the conservative government make sure that the police have the tool to discourage antisocial behaviour and dedicate funding to support police and crime commissioner to target enforcement in the area where antisocial behaviour be most prevalent the police play vital role in tackle antisocial behaviour and keep our community safe the conservative government invest over billion include additional funding each year that roll into government grant to enable the recruitment of additional police officer government priority and manifesto commitment by march this year the police headcount hit record number of police and high than previous record last year the conservative government arrange million increase in funding for frontline police for this financial year something hope will be match next year do the minister agree that in order to tackle antisocial behaviour we must ensure that police have the necessary resource and support the right hon lady speak about labour manifesto commitment to provide additional police officer police community support officer and special but have fail to set out any of the detail of when those officer will be recruit and which force will receive those additional officer can she explain how these respect order be different from the fail antisocial behaviour order or the exist public space protection order or criminal behaviour order our action plan put safety security and basic respect for other at its heart will she commit to continue the hotspot police initiative especially as we can already see the result across the country know have ask before but never quite manage to get an answer the last government increase funding for frontline police by million for this year will the government match that increase next year be grateful to the shadow minister for acknowledge in his opening comment the effect that antisocial behaviour can have on community and on individual but during the rest of his response he seem to have lapse back into that condition that affect number of right hon and hon member on the opposition benches amnesia about what happen over the course of their year in power include the vicious cut to policing with over police officer and thousand of police staff cut try to ignore the legacy that we have inherit and be have to deal with today be not satisfactory from the dispatch box answer the question diana be go to answer the question if the hon lady will give an opportunity to do so interruption think little courtesy in the house be helpful we be talk about antisocial behaviour and number of my comment be about respect which be very important in this house order can we have less noise and heckle from the back benches have always try to be respectful to all member of this house and will now try to deal with some of the point make by the shadow minister the most important point for the shadow minister to understand be that respect order be different from criminal behaviour order do not think he quite understand that criminal behaviour order be attach where there be conviction and the crown prosecution service apply in court for that criminal behaviour order respect order will not require conviction they will be make on application to court by council social housing provider and the police power of arrest will be attach if they be breach and that individual will be bring before the magistrate court if that breach happen they be different from criminal behaviour order they be also different in the sense that they be not community protection notice which think the shadow minister refer to which be for low level environmental antisocial behaviour issue in the conversation have have with individual in the sector and organisation that work in this field respect order get lot of support we want to pilot they we want to make sure that they will work fully when we bring they in across the country be confident that they will provide the flexibility of civil injunction which be what deal with antisocial behaviour at the moment but if civil injunction be breach the police officer have to take the individual to court to prove the breach there be no automatic power of arrest that be the difference from the respect order it combine the flexibility of the civil injunction with the tooth of the criminal behaviour order hope that explain to the shadow minister why respect order be very positive development to deal with antisocial behaviour call the chair of the education select committee welcome the measure that the minister have set out today and the government commitment to tackle antisocial behaviour which be an urgent issue in my constituency particularly in town centre but the most urgent issue that we face in tackle these issue be the number of police officer my hon friend will be aware that the previous government allocate funding to recruit police officer and then withdraw it when the met be unable to meet its target due to set of unique challenge in london can my right hon friend give her firm assurance that the unique challenge face the met be fully understand and that the government will provide it with the resource that it need to tackle this very serious issue in our community be grateful to my hon friend for raise this issue the met make up almost quarter of overall policing it play very important part in police london but it also have other responsibility at national level counter terrorism and so on decision on funding be be take at the moment the house will be inform in the normal way next month about the provisional settlement for policing but hear my hon friend concern very clearly call the liberal democrats spokesperson who know that she have maximum of two minute across my constituency whether in heaviley woodley marple or high lane illegal off road biker be persistent blight on the community they intimidate people endanger public safety and be generally noisy antisocial and really annoying be interested to read the home secretary comment on respect order over the weekend and the minister statement today thank the minister for advanced sight of it my local greater manchester police officer tell the challenge in tackle these off road bike often ride by young people be not lack of power but the difficulty of gather evidence and lack of tool to identify and actually catch offender who often evade they on these bike how will the government ensure that local police have the time resource and practical support need to enforce these new measure effectively we already know what be most effective at stop crime it be proper community policing where officer be visible trust and out and about in their local neighbourhood bobby on the beat who know their community and prevent crime every day the previous conservative government decimate frontline police number leave local force overstretch and make our community less safe would welcome detail from the minister on how the government plan to address this situation and in particular the cut to number of police community support officer who play crucial role in tackle antisocial behaviour be grateful to the hon lady for her comment and question first the specific issue we want to address be give the police the power they need to deal with the antisocial behaviour that be be cause by off road bike and bike the hon lady also speak about what else the police need to be able to implement those change effectively and will contact she with more detail on that will certainly talk to the police about what more we can do to support they as to the neighbourhood policing guarantee and our commitment to put police officer pcso and special into our neighbourhood be sure the hon lady will recognise that we be five month into this government we be work as hard as we can to get plan in place we be do this work with policing we want to ensure that the police be with we on this and that we have everything set up to allow that to happen smoothly and those announcement will be make in due course want to reassure the house that make that happen be probably my no priority welcome the government plan to introduce respect order to tackle the scourge of antisocial behaviour hear from my constituent in battersea all the time on their concern and worry about antisocial behaviour in part of our community can the minister confirm that the new order will also include public drinking and drug use to ensure that our community be safe and free from harm and nuisance my hon friend be absolutely right we want to address issue such as street drinking and take drug the whole idea of respect order will be restrictive in the sense that an individual may be tell that they can no long be in certain area such as on the high street in town centre or in park however positive condition will also be attach if there be issue around someone street drinking they could attend course for alcohol addiction they could attend course or treatment for drug addiction if it be appropriate they could attend course on anger in that way we will be deal with the problem in the area but also try to treat the underlying issue with the individual who have cause the antisocial behaviour certainly support the minister intent in bring this forward but be still struggle to understand what the material difference be between these respect order and antisocial behaviour order if it be the case that they be materially different will the minister say in what respect they be and will she say to what extent that will be base on perception by complainant we have recently have considerable controversy around perception of an allegation and its effect in non crime hate incident which have cause all manner of problem and bogge the police down in whole load of controversy be sure the minister would want to avoid that with this particular measure say first to the right hon gentleman that change be make to the antisocial behaviour legislation in in fact it be weaken the conservatives and liberal democrats in coalition decide to weaken the antisocial behaviour power that the previous labour government have bring in that be the first thing to mention what we have end up with be the civil injunction as try to explain early on perhaps need to do it again and be little clear civil injunction can be issue for antisocial behaviour but if they be breach by someone behave antisocially in town centre or on high street the police have to go to court to prove the breach that be the issue they can not be arrest and the antisocial behaviour can not be stop at that point there be process that have to be go through with the respect order there will be an automatic arrest for breach which mean action can be take far more quickly that be the key point the criminal behaviour order which we discuss early as well can be attach only to someone who have be convict those order be about try to nip the antisocial behaviour that be cause harassment alarm or be the definition that be use that be the level necessary to be able to apply for respect order hope that explain to the right hon gentleman the difference and why we think the way to go forward be to deal with thing through arrest and get people in front of court if they breach respect order rise order say to the minister that detailed answer be very well enjoy here but we have lot of people to get in with this statement call member of the home affairs committee in recent survey of resident of telford it be overwhelmingly clear that they have have enough of the inaction of the past year welcome the respect order come into the police officer toolkit can the minister confirm that they will give the authority the power to seize and crush off road bike to seize booze off drunken yobs and to deal with those who consume drug in our town centre we also need return to neighbourhood policing so that we have copper back on the street patrol their community be mindful of your instruction madam deputy speaker can absolutely say that this be about rebuild that neighbourhood presence to put those police officer pcso and special back in our community and deal with exactly the issue that my hon friend have raise with people drink take drug rid vehicle and cause harassment alarm and distress call member of the home affairs committee thank the minister for her statement and warmly welcome it she be right to mention neighbourhood policing do she agree with the met commissioner mark rowley that local police station be critical to neighbourhood policing and whether she will pledge to stop the closure of local police station that occur under the conservatives and under previous labour administrations that include wimbledon police station which remain under threat six year after win my judicial review stop its closure the hon gentleman will know that where police station be locate and how many there be be matter for police and crime commissioner or in the case of the metropolitan police for the mayor of london and the deputy mayor those be not decision that or any minister would be involve in they be operational decision for pcc and the mayor wholeheartedly welcome my right hon friend statement today every week meet resident who very sadly have their life disturb and sometimes even ruin by appal crime and antisocial behaviour so be delighted that the minister be bring forward these clearly well think through and well explain measure would she perhaps consider read for one of the pilot scheme in this very important set of measure there be many right hon and hon member who be pitch for their constituency to be one of the pilot and will certainly add read to the list antisocial behaviour affect all our constituency include my constituency of broxbourne some antisocial behaviour can be very localise down specific street in block of flat or between neighbour and some of the lever to solve that antisocial behaviour lie with housing association will the minister outline how we can bring housing association to the table they will play key role in solve and tackle antisocial behaviour as say in my remark housing association and social housing provider will be able to apply for respect order ought to say as well that the exist civil injunction will be rename as housing injunction which will deal with that more low level antisocial behaviour between neighbour housing association might want to use those as well but they will be able to use both respect order and housing injunction welcome my right hon friend statement do she agree that the big boost to antisocial behaviour we have see in recent time be the cut of police officer by the previous tory government which result in the decimation of our local safe neighbourhood police team really welcome her commitment to bring they back in addition the london hat conservative cut the london police budget so much so that we have black hole in the budget now that be force the commissioner to cut officer can she assure that she be aware of that and will address it so that we can start to put safe neighbourhood team back where my constituent in eltham and chislehurst want to see they it be always helpful to have experience and long stand members of parliament to remind we of what have actually happen because as point out early there seem to be some amnesia on the opposition benches an estimated hour of police time be spend on non crime hate incident in the past month and we already hear about burglary not be investigate for lack of police time so while welcome the description of the problem how be it to be solve unless chief constable be to be direct to reorder their priority the government have make very clear our priority for police protect the public as talk about today rebuild neighbourhood policing tackle town centre crime tackle antisocial behaviour tackle the scourge of knife crime and halve violence against woman and girl in the next decade the home secretary have also be very clear about the common sense approach that need to be adopt when deal with non crime hate incident we be work with his majesty inspectorate of constabulary and fire and rescue service and the college of policing on how good that can be do it be vital though think the right hon gentleman will agree that police force be able to track and monitor information and intelligence that might be helpful if there be go to be further criminal activity or serious social harm and community cohesion will be affect capture that be something police force need to do in doncaster along with many other area across the country antisocial behaviour fly tipping shoplift and off road bike be blight our community and our high street as former prison officer know that in deal with these issue it be critical that we tackle the cause and pathway to crime in the first place what be the government do to make it priority to tackle the cause as well as the crime themselves welcome my hon friend her experience as former prison officer will be invaluable in this place bring that knowledge to share in our debate she be absolutely right prevention which have be ignore for too long be really important particularly in relation to young people that be why we will set up the young futures programme the youth hub to as the home secretary say wrap our arm around those teenager who might be get into trouble make the wrong decision and get involve in thing that they should not be involve in and we will have that preventive pathway to ensure that they start to take the right step forward my constituent linda along with other member of my community be extremely concerned about antisocial behaviour in burgess hill car racing scooter and bike theft be cause fear and distress to resident across the town as the minister note in her statement the impact of that behaviour should not be minimise have raise these issue with both sussex police and the police and crime commissioner what can the minister do to ensure that sussex police have sufficient resource to stop small number of perpetrator have disproportionate effect on law abide constituent across mid sussex sussex members of parliament be listen very closely to the minister announcement on the provisional police settlement will be make in the usual way next month the home secretary have already indicate that an additional half billion pound will be make available for police that have already be announce with regard to the direct figure for sussex be afraid that the hon lady and you madam deputy speaker will have to wait few more day never think that would see the day when we have conservative members argue against more power to increase the safety of our community up and down the country it be absolutely gobsmacking for one absolutely support what the minister be bring in today in relation to respect order my constituent feel the impact of antisocial behaviour very keenly but they will want some assurance from the minister that there will be sufficient police officer and pcso available to issue respect order in timely manner can she do that please be grateful to my hon friend for that question it be rather odd that the picture paint by the opposition be that all the power be there so everything be fine and why do we need to change thing when it be quite clear to the vast majority of people think that thing be not fine and the power and the legislation be not work as we need they to that be why we be bring forward these additional respect order and the neighbourhood policing guarantee the police officer special and pcso who we want to have back in our community to actually use the legislation and get antisocial behaviour under control antisocial behaviour be blight on our community and agree that the police should be give the resource to tackle it in my constituency cambridgeshire constabulary be overstretch in the past week the policing minister have twice dismiss my question as to whether she would review the police allocation formula so that it receive its fair share of funding and my constituent have notice will she review the formula if not how will the government meet their guarantee for neighbourhood policing can just say to the hon gentleman that have not dismiss anything be very conscious of and take seriously my responsibility in the allocation of resource for police we have be in power for five month and we have to announce next month the provisional police settlement for those figure will be announce in few week time as to whether we want to look long term at resource we of course keep that all under review but for the moment the thing think most mp be concerned about be the allocation for next year that be what be work on at the moment that be the thing the home secretary be work on we be try to do our good and the home secretary have already announce an additional half billion pound for police do my right hon friend agree that an important component of ensure that our street belong to law abide citizen be the good work of council such as mine for example in provide highly professional community warden with enforcement power work in partnership with business improvement district ranger and the police do she agree that that innovative approach to the antisocial behaviour ecosystem might lend itself to rugby be high up the list to be pilot will certainly add rugby to the list my hon friend make an important point about how this can not just be do with the police alone it have to be do alongside council commend the use of community warden who be great resource for community in deal with antisocial behaviour social housing provider be also key this have to be about partnership work welcome the commitment to neighbourhood policing that will help cheltenham fight its problem with graffiti and illegal bike but when talk to my local police commissioner he warn that he be expect to have to work very hard to maintain the force current headcount because of budgetary pressure in the coming year can the minister explain the apparent disconnect between the concern of the commissioner locally and the government statement today do not think anybody be pretend that we have inherit positive rosy economic settlement from the previous government we be have to make difficult decision and tough choice what be very clear be that the security and safety of the british people be the no issue for this government and that the home secretary as have now say think three time have already say there be additional funding for police next year additional funding be put into police force up and down the country this year to fund the pay increase to police officer which have not be in the budget that the previous government have set for this year we have already put in additional money and we will be do so next year as well illegal bike be an absolute menace for people in tilehurst and indeed for all my constituent welcome the tough and swift action that the government be take on illegal bike and antisocial behaviour issue about which the conservatives be clearly far too relaxed when they be in government as well as associate myself with the request from my hon friend the member for read central matt rodda may ask the minister whether there will be new power for the police to seize illegal bike get they off our street and tackle this terrible problem hear very clearly that those bike along with off road motorbike be problem up and down the country and we be look at that what we can announce today be that we will be get rid of the requirement for warning but we be certainly consider what else we need to do to ensure that the problem be deal with properly by the police welcome the minister commitment to tackle antisocial behaviour there be particular problem in fore street in my constituency where those who abuse drug and alcohol gather and make nuisance of themselves will she please consider add bridgwater to her list of possible candidate for the pilot scheme must say that be very pleased to hear conservative member of parliament ask to be add to our list of pilot area for the respect order will certainly do that wish to associate myself with the comment that have be make about the scourge of illegal motorbike they be particular scourge in community across tipton wednesbury and coseley one of my favourite pledge in the labour party manifesto be the pledge to seize those bike without notice and crush they within hour can the minister tell we how soon we will get on with crush the bike today be able to say that we be go to do that my hon friend will have to wait little long for the detail and the timetable but that be certainly my intention welcome much of the minister statement shoplifting be significant problem in my constituency and shop worker in littleport and ely have recently tell how threatened they feel and how stressful it be what will she do to ensure that our local police who as we have hear be very stretch have the resource and capacity need to attend shoplifting incident and deal with the criminal what often hear from shopkeeper and shop worker be that they do not report shop theft because they think no one will come and nothing will be do that be one reason why the neighbourhood police guarantee bring police officer back to our high street and town and village centre be so important those shop worker and shop owner will know that there be visible police presence to deter but also to deal with those who try to shoplift that action will be take against they and that there will be consequence for people who steal we be get rid of the threshold and say if you steal that be criminal offence and there be consequence during the riot in the summer people in my own constituency in hull be loot in shop think that there be no consequence there be consequence for theft recently hold public meeting about the concern rise of antisocial behaviour in haxby and want to thank the deputy mayor of york and north yorkshire jo coles haxby town council the police and the local community for their effort do my right hon friend agree that respect order could play key role in reduce antisocial behaviour in the town and will she meet to discuss this in more detail would be delighted to meet my hon friend think that what he have describe demonstrate the role of partnership work in deal with antisocial behaviour rural crime be define as crime and antisocial behaviour occur in rural area which be very logical but in my region just of staff in the local police force be dedicate to rural crime unit despite the significant impact on community in place such as brecon and ystradgynlais do the minister agree with the liberal democrat proposal that every police force should have specialist co ordinator in its rural crime team in line with recommendation from the national rural crime network take crime urban or rural very seriously the neighbourhood policing guarantee for example be not just about urban area it have to cover rural area as well people live in rural area should feel that when they need the police the police will come and that there be police presence in their community be happy to discuss rural crime far with the hon gentleman if there be specific point that he wish to raise with since be elect there have be constant stream of antisocial behaviour incident across the town that represent at hindley town and ashton athletic football club and in platt bridge and winstanley it really dent people pride in the town that they live in as the minister say do she agree that the capacity for council and housing association to apply for and issue respect order be vital part of the new power that she have announce today yes absolutely agree this be not just about the police it have to involve council social housing provider and the other agency that will tackle together the scourge of antisocial behaviour thank the minister for her statement do she agree that antisocial behaviour be plague throughout the united kingdom and that the remedy lie across several departments obviously an increase in community policing be vital but so too be youth sector funding to create safe space for our young people do she agree that we need investment across multiple departments deal with matter from police to education to community what discussion have she have with her cabinet colleague to ascertain whether such joined up approach could be more effective the hon gentleman have express very eloquently the role of mission lead government that this party be take on the mission on safe street which cover antisocial behaviour be cross governmental it be not just about the home office although we be the lead government body in this context it have to encompass all the other part of government as well as local authority and housing provider this have to be partnership and it have to be cross governmental antisocial behaviour be sadly blight on our town centre in st austell but also on many small clay country village in my constituency therefore welcome the minister announcement on respect order and invite the government to pilot they in st austell what impact do the minister expect these order to have when it come to revitalise our once thriving town centre will add my hon friend constituency to the list our purpose in pilot respect order be to see what work and what the effect be but we be confident that the ability to arrest someone who breach an order will speed thing up we hear the complaint that when people be subject to antisocial behaviour order there have to be long process of go to court and prove the breach this be about arrest and deal with the person who breach an order quickly welcome the minister announcement not just as former crown prosecutor but because the town in my constituency be sadly not immune from antisocial behaviour we often see small group of people repeatedly commit this offence in our town do the minister agree that respect order will be useful intervention tool for deal with repeat offender and for tackle the root cause of their behaviour welcome my hon friend to these exchange her experience as former crown prosecutor be valuable and useful she be right it be usually small group of people who engage in antisocial behaviour we will deal with prolific offender not just by use respect order but by give they something positive that they need such as drug or alcohol addiction treatment or anger management course to try to solve the underlie problem resident in kenrick way in west brom dread friday and saturday night because selfish people race their car up and down the street cause deafen noise and extremely dangerous crash this have be go on for year and year despite the effort of sandwell council and the west midlands police what will today announcement do to stop the racer and give resident in west brom some peace and quiet my hon friend raise an issue that we have talk about lot this afternoon under the law at the moment there have to be warning give before any action can be take to deal with people who be race and cause harm and distress with the vehicle that they be use this be about get rid of the requirement for warning so that action can be take in far more speedy way may add st helens to the list of place that be interested in be pilot area warmly welcome today announcement as the minister and other have say there be nothing low level about antisocial behaviour it can destroy life and community and it be right that we take it seriously be particularly pleased to hear about the step take to protect shop worker and to hear that shoplifting will be take seriously can the minister tell bit more about how that might help shop worker in st helens north do she agree that although it be great that we be give the police more power to tackle antisocial behaviour they need resource to make real difference in our community will certainly add my hon friend constituency to the list it be grow which be always positive proposal on retail crime and assault on retail worker will be include in the crime and police bill next year it be important to remember that people have campaign for stand alone offence for many year and there be now cross party support for the offence thank to the campaigning of usdaw and the co op over many year welcome today announcement on respect order which will be extremely welcome news for my constituent in leeds south west and morley it be so good to finally have government who will deal with the scourge of antisocial behaviour have sit with constituent who have be in tear as they explain how their neighbour be make their life hell constituent have tell at my surgery that the police and the council antisocial behaviour team have no power to act respect order finally offer we the chance to change that in the minister statement she say that respect order would be reserve for the bad offender can think of several people who would fit that criterion so what reassurance will she give my constituent that it will be apply as liberally as possible the definition that give early cause harassment alarm or distress will be use when respect order be apply for ought to say that civil injunction will remain in place when it come to housing so those can be use respect order will be only for adult for young people the youth injunction will still be available and there be sanction within that there will be range of way that antisocial behaviour can be tackle use either respect order or the reform civil injunction hemel hempstead have some of the bad antisocial behaviour in our part of the county we have hotspot such as livingstone walk hosking court waveney and swallowfields where there be issue such as drug use boy racer with modify exhaust abandon vehicle shoplift and drunken noise have see the evidence of that while out on the street with local police fortunately hemel police be carry out great pilot project in grovehill to try to clear the area rebuild relation and deal with the thug there could the policing minister kindly outline how the new respect order will help hemel police to do that great work and will she join in pay tribute to they for the work that they do to clean up our street will absolutely join my hon friend in pay tribute to the police and other partner agency such as council and housing association for the work that they already do there be great deal of good work go on around the country and we need to build on that and give the police and other the power that they need to take the action that they want to take on antisocial behaviour which have just grow and grow in recent time wonder whether my hon friend would like to add his constituency to the list of pilot area for too many community antisocial behaviour have become nightmare but my constituent in bracknell be literally lose sleep over noisy and dangerous off road bike which be be drive on footpath often late at night so they will really welcome the tough new power announce in the statement do the minister believe that those power will finally allow my constituent to get good night sleep we all know the importance of good night sleep so hope very much that respect order will go some way towards deliver that there may be additional thing that we need to do but it be at least start to remove the requirement for warning before action can be take to get these vehicle off our road park and pavement because they be cause such problem we have save the good till last call andrew pakes think there be an unwritten rule in this house that whoever ask the last question get to be top of the pilot list give its beautiful cathedral and wonderful diversity peterborough city centre be the jewel in cambridgeshire crown as be sure that county colleague present will agree but we be be let down by the rise in antisocial behaviour shoplifting street drinking theft and intimidation be the big issue raise with by resident business and peterborough positive our fantastic business improvement district do the minister recognise the sheer anger that the british public feel about the fact that antisocial behaviour have not be deal with and about the way that they have be ghost by the conservative party which when it come to deal with antisocial behaviour tell they that they never have it so good will she explain to the house how the measure announce today will help restore trust and faith in the ability of the government to address antisocial behaviour my hon friend be the last to ask question but it be very important one he be absolutely right there be huge amount of anger about how thing be allow to get to this point there be complacency around the fact that there have be huge cut to police over the year and there have not be the investment in neighbourhood police that we need where we be be testament to that and it be why we have to tackle antisocial behaviour my hon friend also make an important point about business which be part of how we tackle the scourge of antisocial behaviour in town centre we be work with business and be encourage small business to team up with bid and other group in their city centre so that they work together and get information to help they deal with shoplifting point of order on point of order madam deputy speaker at northern ireland office question this morning there be not single mp from northern ireland on the order paper this have happen before have no criticism whatsoever of mr speaker who usually succeed in get in northern ireland mps on supplementary question understand that the number game work against we but can the arrangement be review notice that almost every person list on the order paper for scotland office question next week be scottish mp which be as it should be it would be nice if occasionally we get northern ireland mp on the order paper for northern ireland office question be grateful to the hon member for give notice of his point of order as he know the selection of substantive question on the order paper be the outcome of random shuffle of the name of member who table question which be conduct by the table office mr speaker make sure that number of northern ireland members be call to ask supplementarie this morning may suggest to the hon member that he might like to raise this matter with the modernisation committee scooter review and awareness motion for leave to bring in bill standing order no beg to move that leave be give to bring in bill to require the secretary of state to commission and publish review of the legislation and guidance relate to scooter to place duty on the secretary of state to promote public awareness of legislation relate to the use of scooter and for connected purpose almost two year to the day since bring the first debate to this house on the antisocial use of bike and scooter it be quite pertinent to be follow the statement on respect order and too would be interested in have trial area just get that in there be introduce this bill today to highlight an issue of much concern to the many constituent in newport east who frequently raise with the antisocial and sometimes dangerous use of scooter and bike would like to thank those resident and newport councillor particularly in hotspot area in my constituency for talk to about this as we have all see the landscape on our road have change dramatically over recent year the use of scooter have explode it be estimate last year that scooter ownership be now close to million in england alone but legislation have just not keep up with this trend our legislation be year behind that of other country the bill be about ask the government to address that quickly know that there have be positive move in that direction and particularly as we approach christmas when many people may be tempt to buy they as present to remind potential buyer of the law it be fair to say at the outset that there be clearly place for scooter in the transport mix they can play positive role in increase transport choice while reduce pollution and congestion they be particularly important for young people with low spending power and car ownership as one of my constituent put it use one as disabled person as find it easy than mobility scooter be reluctant to go out and about more for fear of lose it it cheap form of transport for the low pay and safety will only improve with legislation however for many scooter be source of great anxiety as say early many people have raise this with include local scout group and other recently ask constituent more widely for their thought and here be some of their quote one say some of the people rid these scooter and bike have no regard for other people or the elderly another say the majority ruin it for the few that use they correctly they be frequently use for blatant drug run and by people who have zero concern for pedestrian or driver safety an old resident of nearly tell of her experience of nearly get knock over while walk her dog she say that it really frighten she while another say my boy be full time wheelchair user have lose count of the amount of time we have nearly collide with bike and scooter travel at speed on pavement another resident say that unfortunately they be often use for drug run rider have mask over their face and cut over the roundabout at the bottom of somerton bridge with no due care and attention to other driver and pedestrian of course we should also consider the impact on the visually impaired which be often highlight by the royal national institute of blind people have mention this in previous debate that hold on the matter those complaint be from constituent who live in newport where scooter use be illegal because scooter usage be only legal on our road and cycleway as part of public hire scheme where trial be take place trial have be run in location across england since but there be none that know of in wales and scotland where believe there be lack of consultation by the last government with the devolved government there be currently location where trial be active if someone hire scooter as part of trial there be restriction on weight and on speed with maximum of mph and the scooter have to have light the person have to have valid drive licence and the hire scheme operator must have motor vehicle insurance policy they must meet those legal requirement beyond these hire scheme however while the sale of scooter be legal the use of privately own scooter on public land include road pavement and cycle route be illegal and can lead to prosecution despite this legal position sale have rapidly increase the problem be that because they be unregulated there be no limit on speed with some for sale online capable of be tamper with and reach up to mph there be no requirement for they to have light sound or any audible alert system there be no requirement for people to wear helmet there be no available insurance or requirement around their maintenance and there be no restriction on their weight with some scooter report to weigh up to kg these be clearly not toy and when collision occur victim can face serious injury it be the motor insurers bureau that pick up the bill for any compensation thereby push up motor insurance premium for all in the year for which the most recent figure be available there be almost collision involve scooter and six death know that this issue have be raise with many hon member include my hon friend the member for birmingham hall green and moseley tahir ali who have particular issue involve an accident recently there be also the issue of toxic lithium battery fire with an bike or scooter fire occur once every two day in london in as the minister say in westminster hall debate before the election they be often the result of unregulated scooter buy from retailer abroad that fail to meet uk safety standard on that point strongly welcome the government commitment to introduce the product regulation and metrology bill to address this fire risk also welcome confirmation this week from the home secretary and ministers regard the implementation of labour manifesto pledge to strengthen the law around vehicle use for antisocial behaviour so that they can be seize when such behaviour occur without the police have to go through lengthy process of issue multiple warning that delay action very much want to thank gwent police which be do what it can in tough circumstance to crack down on this it have have success in seize number of scooter and bike engage in antisocial behaviour and criminality particularly drug dealing the penalty can include confiscation fine six point on drive licence and criminal record gwent police have also take the lead with social medium campaign around christmas but would welcome more back up from the department for transport and the home office on enforcement and public awareness campaign particularly in the run up to christmas this very much form part of today bill buy scooter online be easy just cursory search bring up well know high street retailer that display reasonably prominent disclaimer but then go on to describe the scooter as the perfect fit for daily commuting and state that you can get wherever you need without hassle lesser know retailer often hide the disclaimer or do not have one at all and sell scooter capable of reach and even mph as well as raise awareness about the current law be ask the government to review where we be now after nearly five year of trial with view to legislate trial be just that they be test in the last government promise to introduce transport bill but it never come and scooter trial be extend early this year before the election for fourth time to may this leave we as one of the last few european country not to have legislate on this therefore welcome the secretary of state commit just fortnight ago to look ahead for opportunity to introduce this much need and long overdue legislation in consider their option know that ministers will hear and consider the experience and recommendation of key stakeholder include the police who be currently look at strict penalty and restriction on sale and import and sustrans which be ask for tight regulation of scooter construction and specification such as speed weight and safety requirement as well as co operation to solve pavement parking issue it be on the basis of those experience suggestion and of course the trial datum that my bill ask that the exist legislation and guidance be review and public awareness be raise to provide clear settled and long term legislative solution to the challenge as well as the opportunity that scooter present so that we can make our road safe for rider pedestrian and other road user urge colleague to support it question put and agree to order that jessica morden gill german mr alex barros curtis catherine fookes tonia antoniazzi ruth jones and steve witherden present the bill jessica morden accordingly present the bill bill read the first time to be read second time on friday march and to be print bill finance bill second read relevant document oral evidence take before the treasury committee on november on budget hc oral evidence take before the treasury committee on the afternoon of november on budget hc oral evidence take before the treasury committee on the morning of november on budget hc beg to move that the bill be now read second time four week ago today my right hon friend the chancellor deliver the first budget of this new government it be historic once in generation budget budget to deliver economic stability to fix the public finance and to secure step change in investment it be budget to lay the essential foundation for growth which be this government no mission and let face it after year under the conservatives the foundation need some fixing that be why our budget be build on tough new fiscal rule that will put stop to borrow for day to day spending and get debt fall as share of gdp our budget deliver fiscal responsibility while get the nhs and other public service back on their foot and protect work people that be the difference labour budget make that be not to say that the decision have be easy the very opposite be true we have take difficult decision on spending welfare and tax and this finance bill begin to implement some of those decision before turn to the measure in this bill will speak about what the bill do not include when be shadow minister shadow the tax brief cover total of six finance bills and probably as many ministers through those finance bills we see the conservative repeatedly extend the freeze in the personal allowance and the high rate threshold for income tax the finance act froze income tax threshold from until and then the finance act extend those freeze by another two year until the conservatives be responsible for six consecutive year of rise taxis on work people payslip our government will not follow that path in this finance bill there be no tax rise on work people payslip nor on many pensioner income like those the conservatives put into law we have make no change to the basic high and additional rate of income tax we have make no change to the rate of vat and in next week national insurance contributions secondary class contributions bill we will make no increase to work people contribution we say that we would fix the public finance while protect work people and that be exactly what we be do we also say that we would provide stability for business make investment decision and that we would cap the rate of corporation tax this bill deliver on those commitment too in the last parliament we repeatedly see finance bills be use to put temporary measure in place lead to an unstable and ever change investment allowance regime at the start of the last parliament the annual investment allowance have be temporarily raise to million that level be extend twice on temporary basis before finally be make permanent meanwhile full expensing for expenditure on plant and machinery be also introduce on temporary basis and over the last parliament the super deduction come and go entirely we be do thing differently our corporate tax road map which be publish at the budget and the finance bill before we today both make it clear that we be prioritise the stability that we know business need to invest do the minister agree with gary smith this be suppose to be budget for growth and job the increase energy profit levy be drive investment out of the north sea and will not make the slight difference to how much oil and gas we consume yet it be estimate that it will lose billion of much need revenue for the taxpayer this mean we will lose environmentally fiscally and in term of job surely even the minister can recognise how wrong that be will come to the energy profit levy in moment but we have engage with the oil and gas industry to ensure that we raise the money we need for the clean energy transition while support investment and job in that industry we recognise that oil and gas will play part in the energy mix for year to come but we also recognise that the industry must contribute to this essential transition this bill maintain the cap on corporation tax that we set out in our manifesto it also make no change to the permanent full expense regime or the annual investment allowance before turn to other measure in the bill note that the leader of the opposition have already commit to reverse several of they if conservative member disagree with the difficult but necessary choice that this government have have to make to repair the public finance and protect work people they have every right to oppose our plan but they must explain what choice they would make instead so far their new leadership have fall at the very first hurdle of be credible opposition by try to have it both way interruption they make plenty of noise but do not hear any alternative the leader of the opposition have say that she oppose the measure in this bill but she also claim to support the investment that those measure fund she say that reintroduce the vat tax break for private school fee would be the very first thing she do if she become prime minister yet she also appear to support the extra billion that our budget put into state education in fact we have calculate that she have make unfunded pledge worth million for every hour since she be appoint by my reckoning that is million worth of pledge since begin speak five minute ago by behave this way the conservatives simply remind people how very far away they be from be credible opposition and they be get far away by the day the then leader of the opposition and now prime minister rightly say that his administration would go for growth he make it his no priority and he inherit the fast grow economy in the interruption the minister shake his head but this be fact can he say what have happen to growth since july every business know that we can make investment decision only on the basis of secure public finance and economic stability which be why this government first priority have be to wipe the slate clean of the mess we inherit from the conservative party to deliver economic stability and to provide the environment for business to make the investment on which we will grow the economy that remain our no mission will the minister give way will make some progress as the chancellor set out in the budget we believe that before make any change to the tax rate that people pay it be vital that we do everything we can to close the tax gap that be why in the budget the chancellor announce step change in our ambition to do so with package raise billion of additional tax revenue by this package will ensure that more of the tax that be owe be pay and that taxpayer be support to pay the right tax first time our plan involve boost the capacity of his majesty revenue and customs to ensure compliance and reduce debt alongside change to legislation some of which this finance bill deliver to remove loophole use to reduce tax liability that be why this bill include measure such as introduce capital gain on the liquidation of limited liability partnership close route increasingly use to avoid pay tax the bill reform rule for overseas pension transfer close gap that allow individual to transfer significant pension saving overseas tax free and the bill implement the cryptoasset report framework tackle complex compliance case where significant proportion of offshore risk sit in our manifesto we say that we would take on the tax gap and that be what we be do in government the minister recognise the importance of reduce the tax gap so will he commend the previous conservative government for halve the tax gap they inherit from labour in as we all know effort to close the tax gap thoroughly stall under the previous government and we have bring renew focus to this effort it be one of our top priority before increase any tax rate we must ensure that people pay the tax that be owe frankly if the previous government have be do such great job how be it that our government have be able to find an extra billion to close the tax gap in our first budget alone that be in our manifesto and that be what we be deliver in our manifesto we make other specific commitment on tax and will set out now how the bill seek to implement they first let turn to non dom in the tax system as right hon and hon member will know this government believe that everyone who be long term resident in the uk should pay their taxis here that be why this government be remove the outdated concept of domicile status from the tax system and why we be implement new residence base regime from april we have long argue for such change to be make although the previous government end up be force towards our position they never implement any change under this government we will finally make the reform necessary to make the system fit for the century our new regime will be internationally competitive and focus on attract the good talent and investment to the uk our reform will scrap the plan reduction in foreign income subject to tax in the first year of the new regime introduce new residence base regime for inheritance tax retain and reform overseas workday relief encourage employee to spend more of their earning in the uk and extend the previously announce temporary repatriation facility to three year from april the new rule mean that from april anyone who have be tax resident in the uk for more than four year will pay uk tax on their foreign income and gain as be the case for other uk resident that be much simple and clear test than exist under the current regime the office for budget responsibility confirm that these reform will raise billion in revenue over the five year forecast period that funding be crucial for meet our commitment to fix the public finance secondly in government we have decide to go far than our manifesto commitment to increase the non resident stamp duty surcharge and we will instead increase the high rate of stamp duty on additional dwelling from three percentage point to five percentage point above the standard residential rate that increase to the high rate of stamp duty will raise more money than set out in the manifesto total of million by and will go far to rebalance the housing market the obr certify costing assume that an increase in the high rate of stamp duty by two percentage point be expect to result in additional transaction over the next five year by first time buyer and other people buy primary residence we estimate that approximately half those who pay non resident stamp duty surcharge also pay the high rate of stamp duty so the change will improve the comparative advantage of uk resident home mover while ensure that no additional barrier be face by those come to the uk and buy their main home thirdly the bill deliver our manifesto commitment to introduce the standard rate of vat on private school fee that will apply to any charge charge on or after july for term start after january and it sit alongside our change to private school business rate relief in the non domestic rating multipliers and private schools bill end tax break for private school be tough but necessary decision that will secure additional funding to help the government deliver their commitment to improve education in state school across the country and achieve the aspiration that every parent have for high quality education for their child be it not the case that state school parent work just as hard as private school parent although they will never be in financial position to be able to send their kid to private school and therefore it fall on this government to fund state school properly my hon friend be right that every parent aspire to high quality education for their child and that be exactly what this government will achieve through the already announce billion increase to the core school budget for the financial year increase per pupil funding in real term that include billion of additional funding for the special educational need and disability system the minister be dedicate to extoll the virtue of his manifesto when he sit down to write the budget with his right hon friend the chancellor do he recall whether the manifesto put to the country at the general election state that growth forecast under this government would be low than they be under the previous government be the taxing of small family farm for total revenue of million in his manifesto he be very keen on the manifesto but do it outline that growth would be low under this government be keen on our manifesto which deliver this labour majority and this labour government if the hon gentleman look at the manifesto that we go into the election with he will see the three word that open our pledge deliver economic stability after the mess that the previous government make of the public finance and the damage they do to our public service and our economy that be crucial deliver economic stability fix the public finance and put our public service back on firm footing be essential to get the investment and growth that our country badly need let be clear about the vat policy on private school fee charge the standard rate of do not mean that school must increase their fee by because school can reclaim vat pay on input and reduce the cost to minimise the extent to which they need to increase fee many school have already publicly commit to cap increase at or to absorb the full vat cost themselves parent from two private school in my area have write to that they will have to move their child into the state system but the problem be that there be not place in the state system to accomplish that will there be dedicated fund to help those school when pupil move will fund be put aside for the welfare of the kid who be be take out of school mid term figure that have be release suggest that there could be about such pupil such move will have significant impact on their mental health and their family welfare and know this government be commit to ensure that child have good welfare will the minister consider ringfenced fund to help support the mental health of those kid as the hon gentleman know mental health more broadly be priority for this government on the policy around vat on private school fee the impact on pupil in private school have to change to state school be expect to be very limited the government estimate that pupil less than of all state school pupil will leave or never enter the private sector as result of this policy those movement will take place over number of year and only pupil be estimate to move within the current academic year to put that number in context for the hon gentleman every year many pupil move between school include between private school and the state sector department for education report publish in look at move between state school and out of state school find that almost move take place every year as he will know pupil number in school fluctuate regularly for number of reason and the school funding system in england be already set up to manage that do my hon friend not think it ironic that conservative members be talk about the mental health of student they do not consider that when they make change to the state system as former teacher know the massive impact on young people mental health of the conservative party decision to move from lettered grade to number grade at short notice to completely change the syllabus and not to provide the resource or textbook that teacher need to teach those course my hon friend be right to point out that the lack of funding that the previous government put into the state sector have implication it take toll on child if school be not properly fund if the capital budget for school be not properly fund as well as their revenue budget that have an impact on child life that be why the funding that we be put into school be something for which will make no apology the fact that we be have to take difficult decision to fund it be the nature of government note that conservative members be happy to support our investment in state school but they refuse to support the difficult decision necessary to generate that funding frankly that underscore how far away they be from even be credible opposition on that point will the minister give way have already give way to the right hon gentleman so will make some progress within the policy provision for pupil with special educational need be an important matter that several right hon and hon member have raise with the government recognise the importance of that too and be glad to confirm that where pupil have special educational need that can only be meet in private school as determine by an education health and care plan in england or its equivalent in scotland wales and northern ireland local authority and devolve government that fund those place will be compensate for the vat they be charge on those pupil fee fourthly this government be deliver on the manifesto commitment to increase the energy profit levy by three percentage point from to and to extend the period over which the levy apply by one year the government be also end unjustifiably generous allowance by remove the levy core investment allowance which be unique to oil and gas taxation and not available to any other sector of the economy we be however provide stability within other feature of the system by maintain the level of tax relief available for decarbonisation investment by set the rate of the allowance at and by maintain the availability of first year allowance the minister be defend the change that he be make to the fiscal regime as it relate to the north sea and the production of oil and gas can he identify another oil and gas produce nation that tax its industry high than the united kingdom do we know that other country tax in different way norway have high headline rate although it have different set of structure of allowance and so on it be important for we that we calibrate the headline rate and the allowance in the right way that be why we have take the measured decision to increase the rate as describe to remove the investment allowance but at the same time to retain the first year allowance and the level of relief available for decarbonisation investment do the minister think that that be the right balance give that offshore energies uk suggest that the change will cost billion in tax revenue be absolutely confident through all my engagement with oeuk and many firm that work in the oil and gas sector that our approach strike the right balance as need in our economy it recognise that oil and gas producer will have role in the energy mix for year to come while also be clear that it be crucial we raise money for the energy transition the energy profit levy seek to achieve that by provide the money for that transition while also support job and investment in the sector as exist at the moment fifthly the bill deliver on our manifesto commitment around carry interest by increase to the capital gain tax rate that apply as an interim measure from april next year ahead of reform carry interest more fully in future finance bill the reform which will have effect from april will ensure that the reward be tax in line with economic characteristic they put the tax treatment of carry interest on fair and more stable footing for the long term while preserve the uk competitive position as global asset management hub as the chancellor set out both in july and again at the budget the fiscal situation we inherit be far bad than we have expect we know that the previous government leave we with billion black hole and so we have have to take tough decision to fix the public finance and get public service back on their foot some of those decision be outside the scope of this finance bill and will be debate during the passage of other bills however this bill include number of those decision which we have seek to take in as fair way as possible the bill make change to the main rate of capital gain tax by increase they to and from october that decision will raise revenue while ensure that the uk tax system remain internationally competitive we be support business through that transition by maintain business asset disposal relief with its million pound lifetime limit and by phase in the increase to that relief cgt rate in line with the change to investor relief to in april and then to in april the bill maintain inheritance tax threshold at their current level for further two year to april it also legislate for air passenger duty rate for and for those announce in the budget for from all rate of air passenger duty will be adjust to partially account for previous high inflation and that change will help maintain the value of air passenger duty rate in real term when it come to fly ryanair have come out and say it will cut million ticket because of the change how do that help growth let put these decision into context for the hon gentleman the increase equate to more for people take domestic flight in economy class and more for those fly to short haul destination in economy class none of the decision be easy but we have to take they to fix the public finance and to get our economy back on stable footing will the minister give way will make some progress that be the impact the change have on domestic flight and short haul destination in economy class however in addition to the broad change in air passenger duty rate the high rate for large private jet will also increase by further to ensure they contribute fairly to the public finance the bill also renew the tobacco duty escalator and enable his majesty revenue and customs to prepare for the introduction of new duty on vape product the bill increase the soft drink industry levy over the next five year to reflect the increase in consumer price index inflation between and as well as increase the rate in line with cpi each year from april finally while the bill increase alcohol duty for non draught product in line with retail price index inflation duty on qualify draught product will be cut by in cash term to support pub and we will increase the duty discount on product that qualify for small producer relief from february the chancellor have be clear that the budget be once in generation event at which the government take difficult but necessary decision by take those tough decision the budget deliver economic stability sound public finance and strong public service on those foundation we will work day in day out across the rest of this parliament to boost investment and growth many of the measure to boost investment be be deliver outside of the finance bill from the planning reform that we get under way within day of take office to the creation of mega fund for pension investment which the chancellor announce at mansion house the bill introduce additional relief for our creative industry for visual effect within film and high end tv which will play key role in strengthen the uk as global hub for film and tv likewise the bill introduce measure to support the transition to electric vehicle through high vehicle excise duty first year rate for hybrid and internal combustion engine vehicle which boost the incentive for ev and by an extension of first year allowance for electric car and charge point until above and beyond any individual measure the impact of the bill and the budget that it follow be to lay the foundation for great investment and growth through fiscal responsibility strong public service and economic stability we have lay the foundation for create wealth job and opportunity in every part of this country enable people to meet their aspiration for themselves and their family and make people across britain well off one of the measure that have bearing on the provision of public service be the increase to the employer national insurance contribution understand the treasury be in discussion with the devolved government and local government across england to ascertain precisely how much extra funding support be require to offset the increase cost upon their service will the minister give we an update on those discussion and when he believe local authority and indeed the devolve government will know how much money in additional support they will receive be afraid will not give the hon gentleman inside information on any ongoing discussion between the treasury and devolve government the policy for reimburse increase in employer national insurance contribution be well establish the last government follow similar process in relation to the health and social care levy whereby departments employee and other direct public sector employee be typically refund the entire increase and third party contractor and so on be not as for the devolved government settlement they have their own process to go through with the treasury be sure the hon gentleman will understand why can not give running commentary on that but be sure that his colleague will pick that up will the minister give way will make some progress have be generous in give way to the right hon gentleman in particular interruption all right go on then be grateful to the minister who have show his customary good humour and good will to the chamber he be unable to discuss the precise number for the devolved government but can he confirm what the overall cost be to the exchequer of compensate the public sector for the impact of nic believe it be around billion but want to check with the minister that that be correct regret give way to the right hon gentleman invite he to return to the chamber next tuesday for the second reading of the national insurance contributions secondary class contributions bill when will also be speak we can have full debate on national insurance then which be sure he and his colleague be look forward to hope they will support it in the lobby because no doubt they support the extra investment in the nhs which that decision fund thank he in advance for signal his good grace and support for our measure after we be elect we say that we would take the difficult decision necessary to fix the public finance we say that we would close the tax gap implement our manifesto pledge and protect work people we say that we would deliver economic stability fiscal responsibility and the certainty that business need to invest and grow this bill play central role in achieve those goal and commend it to the house call the shadow chancellor beg to move an amendment to leave out from that to the end of the question and add this house decline to give the finance bill second reading because it derive from the autumn budget which will lead to job be lose curtail investment and price be raise because the finance bill constitute an assault on business by increase taxis on investment because it will reduce the competitiveness of the united kingdom tax regime because it levy the first ever tax on educational choice and will increase pressure on state school because it will drive up rent by increase tax on homeownership because it will substantially increase the size of the state without sustainable plan to fund it and because it will reduce living standard increase borrowing and debt drive up inflation and interest rate with the result that the obr growth forecast for the autumn budget be low than that accompany the spring budget of the last government this finance bill this budget be disgrace they be disgrace because they be build on deceit deceit that be propagate by the labour party during the last general election it tell the british people that they need not worry about taxis be raise left right and centre yet what have we discover the figure of the office for budget responsibility clearly show that this country be now head to its high tax burden in the history of our nation during the general election we be also tell by the labour party that it have no intention of increase national insurance in fact it state exactly that in the manifesto on which the now government stand it break that commitment do not take my word for it paul johnson of the institute for fiscal studies say exactly that be it not the case that the manifesto say that there would be no rise in national insurance but when ministers go to defend this policy they say not on work people but then could not define work people now the language have slip to payslip be the shadow minister aware of this translation be pretty sure that the payslip be not mention in the manifesto my hon friend make an important and valid point as he say labour be now claim that there will be no incidence of this tax increase on work people although it seem to have problem define exactly what work person be none the less try tell that to those people who will see their wage depress as consequence of this measure try tell that to the full time equivalent who the obr say will lose their job as consequence of this measure try tell that to the young people up and down our country who because it be not just an increase in the rate but also an approximate halving of the threshold will be disproportionately affect labour also reassure farmer the then shadow secretary of state for the department for environment food and rural affairs the now secretary of state reassure farmer he go to the national farmers union and say that nothing would be do on inheritance tax and the annual percentage rate and on that basis the nfu tell its member that at least on that measure there be nothing to fear from future labour government how wrong it be only last week we see ten of thousand of farmer in their dignified way come up to the very gate of our democracy to ask simple question of the labour government why do you lie to we that be the nub of it the measure will see the break up of our farm and it will do nothing for food security do the shadow minister agree that the government could not conceivably have be so ignorant about british agriculture that they do not know that inherit the family farm be no form of enrichment whatsoever so introduce this change to apr be just pure bad government the hon gentleman be absolutely right it demonstrate that this government do not understand farming and do not understand the countryside there be labour members who represent rural constituency will not guess how many there will be after the next general election but some number few than suspect perhaps the cruell deception of all be of our pensioner who be reassure that there would not be any means testing of the winter fuel payment yet what happen million pensioner be to face cut before somebody on the government benches stand up and tell we that some of those pensioner can afford it say that many of they simply can not of those under the poverty line two third will actually lose these benefit while the prime minister be out of the country on the something else be sneak out letter from the department for work and pensions explain that at the point of reach its decision on this it know from its own internal analysis that it would impoverish pensioner into relative poverty and pensioner into absolute poverty this information be ask for time and again in readiness for debate in this house be it not right that information relevant to these measure should have be available in time for debate my hon friend be absolutely right it be disgraceful that labour wait until the farmer be at the gate of westminster to sneak out that impact assessment which show that by more pensioner would be in relative poverty after housing cost than be the case today indeed the analysis by the labour party back in when it be against this proposal be that up to pensioner would prematurely die in the cold as consequence of this measure now madam deputy speaker when you deal in deceit you need pretext for so do and further deceit have be bring forward and it be raise again at the dispatch box this afternoon which be the billion black hole where be it wish to reflect on the tone of the shadow minister remark look at chart in the obr document can see big rise in the tax to gdp ratio but from the right hon gentleman indignant tone one would think that there have never be tax rise under the previous government what the chart show be significantly large rise in the tax to gdp ratio because of the decision take by the previous government so be it not the case that the right hon gentleman tone do not reflect the fact of the decision he take order before the shadow minister respond may caution he against use the word deceit in the chamber no doubt he will now want to respond to the intervention madam deputy speaker will of course be guide by you on that matter on the hon gentleman point there be no doubt that as we go into the last general election the analysis of the manifesto of the three major party show that labour manifesto would have by far the great increase on the tax burden what labour have do be to break its manifesto and go still far to take we as the obr have say to what will be the high tax burden in the history of our country it be as simple as that thank the right hon member for give way do want to indulge he but as he have now mention the obr three time during the course of his speech wonder whether he would share with the house what conversation he have with former prime minister liz truss about respect the obr before she crash the economy and send inflation to as chair of the treasury committee at the time have quite lot to say about it and would point the hon gentleman to the public record in that regard let return to labour claim of vast billion black hole which one sens can even be see from the moon when the obr look at this matter it conclude that the fiscal pressure be less than half that figure it also make the point that have it be know at that time there would have be discussion between treasury official and the obr and that number might well have be small still and it be equally the case that government manage down in year fiscal pressure as matter of course to use another astronomer analogy this be not so much black hole as red dwarf interruption or red herring even well this be about not just mislead the british people but economic incompetence the government have set great store by growth they say that they will generate the fast consistently sustainably grow economy in the see labour members nod their head how be that go our friend at the obr clearly forecast low level of growth follow the budget than they have forecast base on our budget the precede spring that be direct consequence of the kind of growth destroy policy in which the government be engage what happen when the office for national statistics come out with its figure recently for the third quarter of this year interruption order the hon member for swansea west torsten bell have twice use the word you when heckle will not let he off in the future take it as familiar mark of respect from the hon gentleman the fact of the matter be that the ons figure for the third quarter of this year show growth of that be one seventh of what have be achieve in the united states in september the third month of the quarter there be negative growth the reason for that be very clear when this government come to office the first thing that they do be talk down the economy and talk about black hole and what terrible mess everything be in as cover for what they intend to do all along that have an impact on purchase manager index survey we can see the slump in business confidence in the datum and the government be now reap the whirlwind we have now have budget that will do even more damage to growth what will happen to inflation let we go back to our friend at the obr in every single year of its forecast inflation be high than in every single year of the forecast base on our last budget back in the spring fiscal splurge up front that will translate into high price and high interest rate for long mean high mortgage rate before labour members start jump up and down at the word the government now own mortgage interest rate and they be be affect in the wrong direction as result of their policy what about living standard they be down and flatline the joseph rowntree foundation say that by october the average family will be bad off in real term than they be today on the government watch on the government watch number of measure in the bill will far weigh on growth capital gain tax will go up destroy wealth creation the energy profit levy will destroy job make we less secure when it come to energy stamp duty will go up and that be one of the bad taxis the hon member for swansea west torsten bell will accept that as he share that view think he make the point in his recent book the level of activity in the housing market will be dampen people will be discourage from downsize which will put pressure on the housing supply and labour mobility an important component of growth will be impact my right hon friend be paint an accurate but bleak picture as reflect by the ifs the obr and all the independent analyst of what the impact of the budget will be however put it to he that he be understate the weakness that the budget will create for this country look back at the last year we be recover from the financial crash we have the pandemic brexit and the energy crisis we be unlikely to make it to the end of this decade without some form of further shock be it not central to the weakness of the budget that it make this country so much more vulnerable to what we do not yet know be come my right hon friend make perceptive point to which will come momentarily but first let deal with vat on private school we have already hear about the displacement effect the behavioural effect and the thousand of pupil who will have their education disrupt and the impact on their family but do not this measure tell we all we need to know about socialism those who stretch to try to make end meet to send their child to those school be to be deny their aspiration be to be sacrifice on the altar of envy be it not as simple as that my right hon friend the member for beverley and holderness graham stuart be right the budget will not create strong foundation for the future it will create vulnerable and brittle economy the chancellor have very little headroom against her fiscal target against the stability target because the government have talk down the economy and gilt rate have respond in turn it be conceivable that almost all that headroom have already disappear will prophesy that without doubt perhaps if the forecast turn in the wrong direction or the pressure on departmental spending over the next two year become difficult for profligate labour government or because of some external factor as my right hon friend suggest maybe tariff from donald trump america or if his deficit fund tax cut lead to high bond yield and high interest rate here almost guarantee the house that however it occur this government will come back for more in due course may prophesy too will let my right hon and gallant friend prophesy to be fair to the prime minister he make it absolutely clear that thing would have to get bad the difficulty be this be my prophecy if you like that there be no prospect of they get well thereafter that be an extremely astute observation the prophecy be that thing will get tough far down the line it will then be the case that this government take decision that leave we in weak and vulnerable position to withstand they why have this happen the labour party have very little business experience very few member on the government front bench have start up business or grow company in any significant manner will the right hon gentleman give way will give way to the hon gentleman perhaps he be an example of somebody who have do just that if the right hon gentleman and his colleague be against all the revenue raise measure in the budget perhaps he could explain which of the many investment in the health service road the justice system and school he and his colleague would cut it be not binary decision like that the hon gentleman be clever be sorry but will not disrespect he by claim that he truly believe that have the government bring forward budget that would have grow the economy as the conservatives would have do the government would have more money have labour grasp the nettle of welfare reform as we do when we be in office and we have very clear plan in our manifesto for saving of billion year the government would not have to go around can company beat up on pensioner and so on as an alternative there be well way of do thing and we have much well way early this week the chancellor of the exchequer say in her conversation with the confederation of british industry which do not go terribly well that her tax raise day be over yet significantly the exchequer secretary to the treasury fail to reiterate that assertion do he believe she my right hon friend raise an interesting point because the chancellor do say at the cbi conference when ask that she would not raise taxis in the future but this very afternoon at the dispatch box the prime minister appear to resile from that we now do not even have clarity on that vital point surely the point be that the chancellor be no economist no matter how much puff one apply to try to disguise the fact think would take leaf out of her book even though that page be apparently write by somebody else can inform the house that be an economist speak as former governor of the bank of england and president of the international monetary fund and have run the world bank and the world trade organisation at the same time yes for year have as much experience as our chancellor that flight of fancy be of course all mine but the inspiration come from the government benches this be finance bill of broken promise and breathtake incompetence finance bill that represent present danger to the future of our economy be there ever bill more injurious to what we conservative love to our pensioner our farmer our business the poor the vulnerable and yes work man and woman right up and down our country they say that astrologer be there to make economist look good well they can not make this lot look good it be write in the star it be story foretold that unchecked this budget and this finance bill would take britain down that be why we will never tire of the trial of opposition and why we will be the party that stand up for work man and woman across our country and fight this

creativity in closing whether in etwall egginton or stenson fields in the north or in lullington coton in the elms or walton in the south want people to know that promise to represent they with integrity dedication and deep sense of responsibility thank you for give that opportunity call the liberal democrats spokesperson it be an honour to follow the hon member for south derbyshire samantha niblett and congratulate she on her very heartfelt maiden speech commend she for her commitment to the nhs and for her desire to be role model for the next generation of woman who will follow up the ladder behind we her skill in datum and tech will be incredibly helpful in this house as we grapple with the challenge of online harm and the threat and opportunity of ai and wish she well in her career in this house there be no doubt but that the government have receive terrible inheritance under the former conservative government our economy flatline people living standard plummet and our public service be leave on their knee so inevitably the incoming government have have to make some difficult decision interruption conservative member might like side interruption steady on some of those decision we liberal democrats agree with to start with the government have decide to borrow for productive investment and in principle we agree with that they have raise the levy on the oil and gas giant and close the loophole and we agree with that they have decide to invest in the nhs and we also agree with that however we can not support the bill for many of the reason set out in our reason amendment the first question be who should pay for fix our nhs and social care we liberal democrats have always say that it should be those with the broad shoulder unfortunately the government finance bill do not reverse the tax cut give to the big bank by the conservatives it do not raise the digital service tax on the big tech company and it do not increase the remote gaming duty those three measure outline in our reason amendment would have raise billion of pound to help fix our nhs and social care and that money could also have be use to reverse the cut to the winter fuel payment the inheritance tax measure be not include in the finance bill but it do pave the way for they must say that it be bit rich of the conservatives to pretend suddenly to be the friend of the farmer when they usher in the very trade deal that have undermine so many farmer however urge the government in the strong term to think again about the family farm tax that measure be badly think through and lead to the bad of both world it do not close the loophole that result in big equity company and investor buy up land it be still more tax efficient for they to do that than to place their money elsewhere yet family farm be be catch up as collateral damage there be rumour that the government may be think again and urge they to do so it be possible for they to look at introduce genuine family farm test as exist in france and ireland if the government look at this issue the liberal democrats will in the spirit of constructive opposition work with they to get this right and to protect family farmer our reason amendment also outline our opposition to the increase in alcohol duty because it will hit not only consumer but small business and not just any business the business in this sector be bastion of new craftsmanship and innovation in our small batch distillery in summary we know that the government have an awful inheritance and have to make difficult decision but we liberal democrats would have make different choice have the hon member reflect on the fact that the liberal democrats instead of be just the party of no be the party who enable the coalition government which she be criticise think we can all say that lot of water have pass under the bridge since those time since we have see what the conservatives do when they be leave in government on their own hope that people will have see at the most recent general election that we liberal democrats put health and social care front and centre that lead we to become the large third party in the last year to conclude we liberal democrats would have make different decision from the government and for that reason we will not support the bill it be pleasure to speak in this debate on the first labour finance bill in year and an even great pleasure to respond to the very first budget deliver by female chancellor it be also an honour to speak on lancashire day and would like to put on record my congratulation to all my constituent in bolton west and far afield who be celebrate this important day as other have do congratulate the chancellor and thank she for blaze trail for girl in my constituency to follow in response to the remark from the shadow chancellor the right hon member for central devon mel stride would say that have spend year work in ftse company believe that the measure in the bill will be turning point for our country they be the first step in fix the foundation of broken economy after long year of economic vandalism by the conservative party let be clear the labour government inherit difficult financial situation with debt above of gdp million of pound of public money waste during the pandemic include via contract award through the vip fast line inflation at and cost of living crisis that bear down not just on the most vulnerable in my constituency but on work family young people and many business that be the economic inheritance bequeath by conservative members and we should take no lesson from they on how to manage the public finance to that end very much welcome the measure in the bill to take the hon gentleman back just few month he may remember that inflation be at and down at target and the level of employment be up by million people on where it be in it would be fair for the hon gentleman who be new to the house to want to give balanced picture and he may want to reflect on those million additional job the fact that inflation be down and the fact that the uk be the fast grow economy in the first quarter in the entire thank the right hon member for his contribution but will return to the point mention early about inflation at frankly the work be not do by the previous government to mitigate that very much welcome measure in the bill that will increase stamp duty on those who own second home the blight of second home ownership in certain part of our country have destroy the housing market for local people massively inflate price and deny those otherwise invest in the local area the ability to put down root be pleased to see the chancellor deliver on our election promise to scrap the non dom loophole which have be abuse for far too long by those who wish to enjoy all the privilege of life in this country without pay into the system applaud the chancellor commitment to deliver fairness into the tax system through the budget and the bill in the light of the debate we have be have in the country at large over the past few week wish briefly to focus my comment on three key topic which hope the government will soon revisit at some juncture during this parliament the first topic tax justice have be overlook for far too long accord to his majesty revenue and customs the tax gap the difference between what it should collect annually and what it actually collect be almost billion let repeat that figure forty thousand million pound close that gap by just could pay for nurse teacher and police officer imagine the transformative impact that could have on our public service on education on health and on tackle crime simply put work people in bolton west be expect to pay the taxis they owe so why should big multinational and the super rich be able to avoid contribute their fair share the renew focus on tax avoidance and evasion in the budget be much need but we sometimes have to spend money to make money we all know that tough decision about public finance have to be make but that do not have to come at the expense of boost enforcement through our public body include hmrc which should be self funding with great proportion of cash raise from fine asset seizure and the like return to the relevant agency our enforcement agency work incredibly hard to claw back billion of pound that be lose every year to economic crime in the uk but they do not have the resource to protect we from all manner of crime from fraud to money laundering and tax evasion it should be criminal who be make to pay not the hard work taxpayer and for that would be sensible way to both combat economic crime and bolster our public finance we already know that every pound invest in the serious fraud office return three pound to the treasury return on its budget while every pound spend on the national crime agency international corruption unit result in of illicit wealth freeze as it happen research publish this month by spotlight on corruption hope the minister will take note of this find that just of the billion generate for the government by law enforcement agency and anti money launder supervisor between and be reinveste in those agency or in crime reduction and community project if just of those enforcement receipt have be reinveste economic crime regulation and enforcement would have receive an extra million year nearly double the annual investment underpin the to economic crime plan at no cost to the taxpayer but with potentially substantial reward the second area of focus that would like the government to attend to during this parliament be council tax for almost three decade successive government have sit on their hand when it come to reform the levy which be regressive and disproportionately target the wealth of low income family and the young as well as affect local authority bolton council find that it do not provide an adequate funding base to provide critical service for my constituent last year modest property in hartlepool worth would have be tax at over of its value while the owner of an million mansion in westminster would have see bill equivalent to just the fairer share campaign have call for proportional property tax which would see homeowner pay flat rate base on current and annually update valuation not the absurdly outdated number it calculate that that would put an average of into the pocket of household in bolton west and leave of people in my constituency well off indeed in total fairer share reckon that that reform could save household outside central london and the south east billion year help to level up community and genuinely boost local economy finally would very much like to see the spending commitment to of gdp on defence reach as soon as fiscally possible welcome the government commitment to that effect the increase of billion for defence already announce by the government be indeed welcome we must continue to invest in defence to ensure that the uk will have the capacity to keep we safe in what be become an increasingly dangerous world this finance bill demonstrate that after year of dither and delay the labour government be take the difficult decision head on with the measure announce last month by the chancellor be confident that my constituent across bolton west will be able to realise their full potential and that together we can build the healthy more prosperous society that want to see with tax justice at its heart and those with the broad shoulder pay their fair share to fix the crisis in our school our hospital and our prison commend the hon member for south derbyshire samantha niblett for her maiden speech she and share many interest not least in technology promote woman in technology and accessibility wish she well turn to the matter in hand the measure in the bill be in addition to other announce as part of budget that have cause serious concern for business in bognor regis and littlehampton re energise our high street have be one of my key priority but the budget push we far from that goal the government plan to increase employer national insurance contribution from to and to lower the threshold from to that will force business to pay more soon meanwhile business rate relief for retail and hospitality will drop from to research show that that will cause increase in rate with the average uk restaurant see cost rise from to hike that could force closure those change come on top of exist pressure cause by covid the war in ukraine and energy price inflation local business have share the impact of that on its profit and loss its freight cost be up since raw material be rise by warehouse rent be up last year with another rise in and utility cost be up in business already stretch thin can not absorb the additional cost that the budget impose pile on national insurance contribution and high business rate alongside steep minimum wage hike without support productivity and growth be recipe for disaster in paint this stark picture my hon friend have not mention the employment rights bill which be expect to impose particular burden on hospitality business include those on her high street total of billion in addition to the measure in this budget my right hon friend make valid and important point have restrict my comment to the finance bill and the budget but the employment rights bill place significant additional pressure on business and thank he for that point for town such as bognor regis and littlehampton where business already operate on razor thin margin these measure could be existential highly regarded local employer include family run small and medium sized enterprise such as temple spa and meridian medical be gravely concerned entrepreneur like those take immense personal and financial risk to create job and support our economy yet this government treat they as an endless revenue source instead of engine for growth the chancellor projection may work on paper but they be disconnect from reality our high street sme and family business need support not policy that make survival let alone growth hard urge the government to rethink their approach or take step to mitigate the impact on our community be grateful for the opportunity to contribute to this very important debate as we move to put the measure announce at the budget on the statute book but first add my congratulation to my hon friend the member for south derbyshire samantha niblett on superb maiden speech demonstrate the commitment and expertise that we be lucky to have on the government benches and the house be lucky to have as whole suspect that this be not the budget that my right hon friend the member for leeds west and pudsey rachel reeves envisage as she first as chancellor but it be the one that be need once the economic inheritance receive by this government become fully understand want to touch on the very difficult financial situation that this government have inherit and what difference the measure announce in the budget will make to resident live in my constituency we should be clear about what the inheritance from the conservative party be an economy that over the past year have see productivity and wage flatlining leave british family significantly poor than those in france and germany and country expose to fossil fuel market which lead directly to the bad cost of living and energy bill crisis in generation whatever the conservatives may like to say to wriggle out of that inestimable fact they leave billion black hole in the public finance with no plan to fix it and this be the bad part unfeasible departmental spending target stretch into future year our response of capital gain tax rise air passenger duty and agricultural property relief undoubtedly fall on those with the broad shoulder who be most able to bear those increase may clarify whether the hon member believe that the farmer make on average less than year and the make less than year be those with the broad shoulder thank the hon lady for that intervention we be very clear the number from hmrc show that very few of the sort of farm that she be refer to will be affect actually it say everything to that the person lead the march last week have boast that he have spend million on farm in order to avoid inheritance tax this be budget to reset our finance after year of chaos with difficult but necessary decision decision we have not dodge unlike the previous government this labour government be elect to fix the foundation of our economy and to begin to rebuild the public service that people across our country include my resident in dartford whom be privileged to represent in this place really need the measure in the bill will rebalance the tax system protect work people and raise the crucial revenue so desperately need for our public service at time when their performance be unfortunately at historic low what do this budget mean for people live in my constituency in dartford swanscombe greenhithe and ebbsfleet people live across my constituency rely on their excellent district general hospital at dare nt valley which be full of brilliant hard work staff who do their absolute well however after year of conservative government capacity in the hospital have just not keep up with need dartford borough be the second fast grow local authority area in the period cover by the last census thank largely to the development of ebbsfleet garden city but investment in service have not keep up with the need of grow population the more than billion announce in the budget over two year for our health service will cut waiting time thank to extra elective appointment each week and the capacity for more than additional procedure thank to the new home in ebbsfleet and across dartford we be also become much young constituency as young couple settle in our community and start family we warmly welcome these new resident and be confident they will welcome the chancellor decision to increase the core school budget by more than billion year mean the recruitment of teacher and the additional billion investment to address the break special educational need system in dartford and across our country if conservative members disapprove of the revenue raise measure in the budget it really be incumbent on they to say which bit of that extra investment they would cut be afraid we be back to magic money tree economic we hear that very clearly from the shadow chancellor all these measure form part of our manifesto commitment to break down the barrier to opportunity of which sadly far too many remain finally and perhaps most importantly for the long term prospect of our country hope the whole house will support the government strong focus on boost public investment by more than billion over the next five year this be an area where we have be sadly lack when compare with our international competitor the announcement have be far enhance by the chancellor mansion house speech which include proposal to unlock the power of our pension fund to invest in our country against that background it would be remiss of not to mention project that hon member across the chamber might remember describe in previous contribution as shovel ready the propose new low thames crossing be crucial to unlock the growth that the new government be seek both in the south east and beyond and could be start very quickly with much of the preparatory work already have be undertake it would create job and unlock investment across the thames estuary address the large traffic bottleneck in the uk and allow freight to move much more easily from port in the south east to destination across the country will end as begin recognise that these be difficult decision and that they will not be welcome by all however we must not duck the tough choice need to restore the foundation of economic stability in our country and our public service it be pleasure to take part in this debate let we travel back in time to those halcyon day for the labour party so confidently predict victory in the election so far ahead in the opinion poll and so clear on the prospectus they lay before the british people it have fully fund fully cost programme when the now chancellor be challenge about whether she have full insight into the public finance she assure the interviewer if recall correctly that absolutely she do therefore people could rely on the cast iron promise which all labour members stand on that labour would not raise national insurance would not raise income tax would protect farmer and would not cut pensioner benefit that be the promise but it be well than that it be not just that labour be not go to bring in all those taxis but that it be go to make growth their no mission for mission lead government those who fear return to sort of socialist job destroy and enterprise wreck past could be reassure that this be moderate party that have put the right hon member for islington north jeremy corbyn well behind it no matter how many labour members have say he be great friend and would make great prime minister they have change their mind there be moderate promise it be not only member of the public who be lead to believe in the labour mission and what it could bring for the country imagine labour members the people who be select as candidate for the labour party who come in not to jeremy corbyn labour party but to this labour party of enterprise protect worker and encourage low tax system but do so in way that none the less would prioritise the healthcare system special educational need child and the like that be the promise and it do not just beguile many people in the country although not that many as only of people actually do vote labour but none the less enough imagine what it be like say this to opposition members to come to this place and be part of that fantastic crew of hundred and hundred of labour mp to deliver that manifesto and where be we now at the historic second reading of the finance bill of the central policy measure of this new government where be they will the right hon gentleman give way they have be humiliate in the budget debate as one after another repeat their rote word it be the most intellectually empty budget debate have ever take part in listen to labour member after labour member trot out their year of chaos and their billion black hole will the right hon gentleman give way will the right hon gentleman give way it would be entirely wrong of give how few labour members there be in the chamber prepare to defend the budget if do not now give way to one of they thank the right hon gentleman for finally give way wonder if he might use the opportunity to reflect on the economic record of the previous government which see the high interest rate and inflation through the roof that affect people pocket and their ability to get on in life will he also reflect on the fact that his party lose the election and perhaps show some humility be grateful to the hon lady be happy to do so although it be worth point out that we be suppose to reflect today on the actual proposal put forward by the government of which she be now member but the hon lady be right to highlight the conservative economic record have criticism of those of we on the conservative benches do not think we do enough to talk about it from to which economy in europe grow the most be it germany or the uk oh it be the uk be it france or the uk oh it be the uk which country in europe create million more job for which government do the horrible scar of youth unemployment which be permanent feature even in the good year prior to the crash for those interested in the history of employment stay horribly high with its long term scar impact on young people it be the labour government all that be turn around people be pay tax at when labour leave power that be lift to they may be decry and disown their part in the coalition government but the liberal democrats should have some pride in what we be able to do together we inherit an economic basket case we bring discipline back but while we be fix the foundation we do not lose sight of the fact that we know where the wealth come from it come from the private sector not the public sector from those small shop those restaurant all those other business on which the country rely for its wealth this budget have go down and damage each and every one of they one by one it have look around for target the broad shoulder for the socialist envy to vent itself on and who well than landowner so the budget focus on people be not an expert on every area of the economic life of this country but let we suppose that look across the entire economy and try to find people in private enterprise use their own asset where would people have million of pound in asset and be prepared to receive return on they who would keep that up year after year simply in order to feed the nation as part of pact compact between they and the government indeed the whole country who would be prepared to do that and to feed we while ask so little in return attack farmer of all group in society be one of the most retrograde and regrettable of attack as my right hon friend know work for charity for six year or decade as the chancellor of the exchequer like to call it would he care to reflect on the damage do to charity by this government budget they be already in squeeze and the government have squeeze they far through their decision on employment right and also through taxation in the budget we be see kind of socialist envy and attack on misguided target for instance child with special educational need in private school will be pull out of those school mid year because their family can no long afford to send they there that be not the intent not only do labour members want to stand on an honest prospectus but that be not be sure what they want nevertheless that be what be happen interruption it be exactly what be happen my hon friend be right however to point out that this be not just about class base assault on people who do not deserve to be assault it be also about sheer ineptitude let we consider the billion for the nhs why so little for social care surely labour members however green and new to the house must be aware that the nhs depend on the social care system but because of the increase in national insurance contribution and the minimum wage its cost be rise by about billion and it be get million hospice will be affect and so will small charity order remind the right hon gentleman and indeed all other member that this be specifically finance bill second reading debate we be not have general debate on the budget be extremely grateful to you for your guidance madam deputy speaker will try not to refer too much to the impact of national insurance contribution because we will have that opportunity next tuesday none the less my hon friend be right to talk about the impact of this budget overall and the effect on hospice and charity in particular yesterday meet the chief executive of hica large not for profit provider of social care home and in home care hica be brilliant organisation which have make real progress over the last few year it finally manage to make surplus last year so it can pay its staff more than the minimum wage and invest in its stock now it be face million impact on its million turnover as result of this budget and this finance bill as well as farmer oil and gas have be touch on today when be the minister for energy security and net zero it always strike as absurd to look at the production of oil and gas rather than the consumption it be the consumption that be the problem we must change our factory our vehicle our building so that they no long need oil and gas if we be to move away from they attack production when it be drive by demand be attack the wrong end in this measure the labour government be raise the energy profit levy on top of refuse to issue new licence the net effect of that notwithstanding the liberal democrats say that they support the policy do not know why or how they can do so will the right hon gentleman give way will in moment this do not make the slight difference to how much we consume but it mean that we import more from abroad and in the case of liquefy natural gas those import have embed emission four time high than the emission of what we produce domestically we be go to bring this in from place that be less careful than we be in its production we be go to lose ten of thousand of job and billion of tax revenue and we be go to lose the engineering expertise and company that we need for the transition there be literally no way to make that make sense and hope the hon lady will now do turn and see the logic of my argument will resist that invitation do the right hon gentleman understand the nature of windfall tax it raise money on the windfall that sector be not expect we know that the big oil and gas giant base their investment plan on the profit that they be expect but clearly they raise lot more money because of russia illegal invasion of ukraine windfall taxis have be place on the big oil and gas giant for the profit over and above what they be expect to receive the hon lady do not actually refer to the measure in front of we know it be the liberal democrats policy to have windfall tax on anyone who do not sound popular big bank big tech and oil and gas that be their answer if anyone say how would you do it they trot that out and lose not single vote because the very definition of not take tough choice be suggest that there be easy money the measure in front of we which the hon lady specifically say she support be not windfall tax it be further tax in tandem with the removal of any new licence which effectively destroy investment in the north sea point to apache which say it be look to withdraw by risk job harbour energy japex and chevron to name just few they be pull out and there be no environmental benefit we be lose all that tax all those job and all that expertise which be exactly what we need for carbon capture and for hydrogen for the green economy it be utterly insane note that there be very few labour members present watch they as they come in for the budget full of cherry cheek enthusiasm and read out their whip prepare rote remark about the disaster leave behind which as we know be the fast grow economy in the with inflation at target debt come down and the economy come up they be not all mad socialist loon and day by day we can see they lose spirit in the tea room and in the corridor as they realise that the deceit that their front benchers practise not only on the people but on they be come home to roost the government will pour all of the billion into the nhs in the next year it be in the figure and we be suppose to believe that public service will rise by or in the rest of the period up to the next general election be that credible it be not think labour member know that which be what they have signal by their absence because they realise as we do that this finance bill and the budget be ruinous for this country my right hon friend the member for central devon mel stride be absolutely right to say that they make this country more vulnerable to the shock that may and most likely will come and it will be the labour party that own the mistake that be be sow today it be pleasure to follow my hon friend the member for south derbyshire samantha niblett who give wonderful maiden speech be sure that her daughter lillian will look on she as lovely role model as she move forward early this month we witness an historic moment as the first ever female chancellor deliver the government budget comprehensive plan that be design to support work people rebuild our economy and bring fiscal responsibility back to the heart of government the budget deliver plan for recovery plan to undo the damage leave by the previous government and most importantly plan that will benefit the people of halesowen and the wide community however let we be clear this government inherit dire financial situation interruption it be true the chancellor expose billion black hole that be leave by the previous government and series of undeliverable promise that the conservatives know they would never have to keep the last government know that they have no money to deliver their agenda yet they conceal the truth from the british people leave the incoming government to pick up the piece the budget be about sort this out and we be commit to do just that our economy face multiple challenge include high debt underfunde public service and rise youth unemployment but the true cost of the past year be feel most acutely by the people who have be leave behind in halesowen hear from resident every day people who have be wait week for doctor appointment people who be force to travel mile to receive healthcare and people who be completely unable to access their nhs dentist fourteen year of cut have leave our nhs in crisis and no matter someone political affiliation no one can deny the challenge our health service face but it be not just in healthcare our school road railway all of this infrastructure have suffer from year of under investment our public service be fall apart it be tempting for member to read out the rote stuff that be give to they as some of the hon gentleman colleague have be prepare to do but be mostly not prepared to do today but just gently point out that there be never reduction in nhs spending in real term it go up in every single year if there be belief that the nhs can be magically turn around by have above inflation increase in spending alone can assure the hon gentleman that that be not true because we do it every year and we still have demand go beyond the resource the right hon gentleman will have notice that we reach record nhs waiting list under the last government more than million people wait and many of my constituent wait over two year if he think the investment in the nhs by the last government be enough he be completely wrong our road be literally crumble work family be struggle and the hope of upward mobility be slip far out of reach we can not let this continue the government be face with what the institute for fiscal studies have describe as genuinely difficult inheritance the truth be that the last year can be describe as at good period of manage decline or at bad wilful neglect the last government will be characterise as an administration that allow service to erode and future generation to be abandon we must take different approach and offer real change we be not pretend that the work ahead will be easy but we be determined to rebuild and restore key part of this recovery be invest in our most vital public service especially the nhs which can not survive on good will alone the budget commit to inject much need fund into our healthcare system secure lifeline for the nhs that will allow it to begin this recovery the budget be also about present an offer to work people who have be neglect for so many year include rise in the minimum wage to boost the living standard of million low pay worker nhs funding to support million more operation scan and appointment every year fuel duty freeze for another year provide relief to driver and family million investment to fund the construction of more social home significant increase in the carer allowance earning limit because those who care for our love one deserve our support and crackdown on tax avoidance fraud and waste ensure that the super wealthy pay their fair share of tax the decision in the budget though some be difficult in the short term be the right one for the long term good of our country this be finance bill that prioritise public service and work people without raise taxis on the majority it be about restore fairness rebuild trust and set the country on new path towards growth it be also important to remember that fiscal responsibility be central to this government approach the ifs have praise the soundness of our fiscal rule ensure that our effort to drive growth be sustainable and the public finance remain on stable footing change the fiscal rule to allow more investment be both sensible and necessary and this investment will boost long term growth the bill be not just about recovery it be about secure prosperous future business in halesowen have be struggle especially on our high street where many have be force to close their door in recent year have hear the concern of small business owner and the concern share by the black country chamber of commerce and be pleased that the chancellor plan include support for high street business include business rate reform which will give local shop the chance to compete against tax avoid multinational my hon friend be make an excellent speech highlight whole series of important point just wonder whether he be go to come to the cut in beer duty know there be number of famous brewer in his area and this be an important measure for many brewing this be an important point for many brewing town and many small related business in that sector have number of sme in my own constituency that will benefit from this as well as pub do my hon friend welcome this measure as well as the important measure he have mention for small business in town centre welcome the reduction in tax on beer have speak to many business in my constituency hospitality sector include many pub that be happy with this measure which they hope will increase the footfall in our town centre and in their business be also delighted that the budget confirm million of investment in the redevelopment of haden hill leisure centre in cradley heath in my constituency and million of investment in halesowen town centre to redevelop what be become difficult area the bill will ensure that local asset that serve the community be protect and enhance it mark turning point for our country lay the groundwork for well future it be plan that protect our public service support work people and put the economy on sustainable path fully support this bill for halesowen and beyond it deliver hope invest in community and fix the foundation of the economy so that we can deliver the change for which the country vote this finance bill be bad news for my woking constituency in the budget the government announce an extra billion for local authority that might sound good but the reality be stark inflation rise wage and increase demand for service mean that council be face billion funding gap over the next two year by fail to provide adequate funding in this budget and finance bill the government be push some council to the brink of bankruptcy the situation be even bad in woking as our local authority have already go bankrupt woke borough council small authority in two tier structure be carry billion worth of debt member can guess which political party run the council at the time the conservatives it be an eye watering figure and taxpayer should never be put in the position of foot such bill but they will have to shoulder it as part of the government intervention in woking the borough council will have to sell lot of its asset to try to pay off the debt however at current value those asset be worth billion which be huge gap that put the council in massive negative equity the government like to talk about billion black hole but fear the black hole be bad than they realise to understand these issue ministers need to look at local government bad debt and off balance sheet debt it be quite possible that my local authority alone will not repay billion of debt that this finance bill assume will be repay woking be just one local authority in one constituency out of this finance bill make mistake but it could be even bad if it be build on flawed foundation one way for my constituency to get out of the mess we have inherit be to grow the town so that our economy grow and improve however worry that this budget and finance bill undermine that goal the measure go after small business which be the lifeblood of my high street and community be particularly concerned that the increase in alcohol duty will hit small brewery such as thurstons in my constituency like many of my constituent and neighbour use bus all the time bus be lifeline for we the fare cap be helpful during the cost of living crisis and encourage people back on to the bus after the covid pandemic however the government be now scrap it resident from knaphill tell the rise be concern with increase each way it will put even more strain on pensioner like it amount to an extra year for someone who commute by bus every day that be huge burden at time when household and family in my constituency and elsewhere be already struggle bus be not just convenience or luxury they be the backbone of local economy connect people to work school college shop and healthcare if this government be serious about economic growth they should be invest in bus not hit passenger with what be effectively bus tax on work people in their election campaign the labour party promise not to increase taxis on worker but this budget and finance bill do just that at time when people be face the bad cost of live crisis in decade this finance bill increase the tax burden on everyone the liberal democrat manifesto and our reason amendment show that there be fair way we have bold plan to properly fund the nhs social care and other public service by ask big bank oil and gas giant and big tech company to pay their fair share our plan be ambitious which be what this country need labour budget do not come close the finance bill do not go far enough to protect people and the service that they rely on the government need to get their priority right the liberal democrats be against the bill because it do not effectively tackle the crisis in social care or reverse cut to winter fuel support it do not support people with the cost of living crisis and it introduce shocking tax on education woking deserve well and this country deserve well congratulate my hon friend the member for south derbyshire samantha niblett on her phenomenal maiden speech she be already prove to be powerful advocate for her constituent the finance bill be necessary corollary to the budget it be the beginning of process that the new labour government be undertake to rebuild the foundation of our country after an incredibly poor inheritance from the predecessor government have be quite shocked to hear the joy with which conservative members have be speak about the phenomenal economy that they leave the country with it be an economy in which wage growth have flatline at the low level since the napoleonic war leave household bad off per person trade have fall low than our neighbour and national debt go from in to just before the pandemic know they love blame the pandemic for everything but thing be pretty bad before the pandemic the heart of the problem be that the conservative lack credibility in the right hon member for beverley and holderness graham stuart stand for election on manifesto that say that the conservatives would eliminate the deficit by the end of the parliament in he stand for election on manifesto that say the same thing as he do in in he and his colleague decide to give up entirely on tackle the national debt which be one of many thing that we now have to tackle of course that be the more rational end of the previous year and there be seven chancellor in year by the way we have the blip which know conservative members do not like talk about when one of their chancellors with the backing of prime minister liz truss promise of gdp of unfunded tax cut be incredulous that the conservatives be talk about gilt early gilt move more in one week under liz truss than in whole year on average there be no comparison order the hon gentleman be in the chamber when ask member to return to debate the finance bill rather than the rather context of the budget be madam deputy speaker try to intervene on the right hon member for beverley and holderness number of time but he would not give way so feel have to squeeze in couple of point before get to the finance bill the finance bill include many important measure that support the freeze on fuel duty be an important and welcome decision by the chancellor the conservatives impose stealth tax on the country by freeze threshold on income tax and the chancellor rightly commit to change that in it be revenue raise budget but despite all the change we will have capital gain and corporation tax rate that be very competitive with those of our colleague my constituency need this budget because it need stability it need the investment that this budget will bring that investment be crucial because the legacy that talk about span number of area include lack of public investment the institute for public policy research say that nearly billion less be invest in the public sector than in comparable economy as we can see in our public service hospital and school the budget be about choice it be difficult budget and not perfect budget because of the inheritance we have to deal with the fact there be disagreement on the budget but people who disagree with the revenue raise measure and agree with the spending have to say what taxis they would have increase say gently to liberal democrat colleague who have find other source of income that the institute for fiscal studies effectively say that their plan to raise income elsewhere have no real credibility this be difficult budget but it be the beginning of plot course for stability economic growth and investment in public service in our country that be what my constituent very much hope will be the legacy it be very long stand principle observe all but universally around the world that we do not tax education because it be public good some family find that independent education cater to need that the state simply do not that be the case with school in the music and dance scheme or in certain faith community in some case family choose an independent school because of their child special need or because for whatever reason that be the place where their child can be happy whatever the circumstance and whatever the reason we believe in the sanctity of the principle of parental choice many place around the world recognise the value of that choice through the tax system this country be not one of they there be no tax break for use independent education provider everybody do someone want to make an intervention would love to hear it thank the right hon member for invite to intervene remind he that the ifs have confirm that there be enough capacity in the state sector for the transfer of pupil also on the point of special educational need thank you order the right hon member will know full well that it be for to decide if the hon lady intervention be too long the right hon member may also recognise that the government have be clear that when special educational need be be meet in the private sector vat will not apply on three count be afraid that be incorrect first it do not cover everybody with special need at private school secondly the ifs have not say that there be ample space in state school nor could it possibly know that thirdly and most importantly the point on which be heckled and on which invite somebody to intervene be completely different one my point be that unlike in quite large number of country here there be no tax break for those use independent education provider everybody contribute towards state education through general taxation if we take up private school place that contribution do not reduce in the modelling that go with the finance bill the government say that they expect little over billion to be raise from the measure in maturity we do not know the detail of the modelling and how robust the analysis be however agree intuitively with the treasury that small part of the effect will be feel immediately in january but that the effect will really start from september it will be feel gradually through some child leave the independent sector the big effect will probably be from those who do not start in the independent sector in the first place or who do not start their next phase of education in the sector be not totally clear from what the treasury have publish whether it factor in all the effect of the change it obviously factor in family who be directly price out of the independent sector but what about those who be indirectly displace because they be at school where number of other family be price out and the school have to close do it factor in the high number of education health and care plan application that will be make and the much high than average per place cost that the state will have to meet for those displace be also unclear whether the treasury analysis look at all the effect on independent education cumulatively yes there be the vat which be in the finance bill but there be also number of other measure be take this year that materially affect the cost base of independent school and that be likely to be reflect in fee they include the increase contribution to the teacher pension scheme business rate change which affect about half of independent school and the massive hike in employer national insurance contribution which will affect so many sector all those be transfer from the independent state sector to the exchequer so the real increase in the cost base for that sector will be considerably more than over the course of the year in the minister sum up would love she to tell we what assumption be make about the total average price increase whatever it be the government calculate that in the policy maturity child will be displace from the independent sector and of those will go to the state sector minister say do worry there be load of place available in the state sector in fact the hon member for barking nesil caliskan suggest that third party have say that as well and the exchequer secretary say it again in his remark he say that we be talk about of the total population in state school it be useless to have place available in primary school in inner london if that be not the age group of people leave the independent sector the effect will be uneven across the country and need be concentrate largely in secondary school and sixth form there be plenty of place where even small number of child be displace from one sector to the other could have big effect on the state school system what discussion have ministers have with colleague and with council in salford stockport sale bury bedford bristol and so on could name considerably more what contingency plan be in place indicate dissent the hon gentleman shake his head take it that mean that he have not have those conversation interruption be happy to take an intervention from he what contingency plan be in place for september if the displacement be great than anticipate we know that the money will follow the pupil if more pupil turn up in the state sector but we have not hear whether that money be come out of general exchequer receipt in other word that the department for education will not be expect to find that money from elsewhere in its budget similarly what be the contingency plan and what capital have be set aside in case extra capital funding be need as well as the displacement of pupil there be also potential displacement of teacher as we have hear from the union as the right hon gentleman encourage to intervene will agree that there will be movement of teacher from the private sector back to the state sector as former teacher know number of former colleague who leave the state sector because of the failing of the last conservative government and they be consider go back into state education only because of the hope that the new labour government have give they well we shall see as teacher he will know that teacher move between the state and independent sector all the time they move in both direction but that be not what the association of school and college leaders be talk about it be talk about the fact that the change be be make mid year and say that it carry risk of redundancy and of the permanent loss of teacher to the profession labour members the hon member for harlow chris vince be one of they frequently like to say to opposition members that we have to choose they say be you on the side of the many or the few be you with or the well we refuse to choose it be not question of whether we care about the or the we care about the the child it be definitely true and right that at the department for education this be true when be minister there minister spend way more than of their time and effort on the state sector in our time in government between and that pay off with huge result when we support our brilliant teacher in their great work our result go up we go from in the world to for math and from in the world to for read we have the good primary school reader in the western world free school meal eligible child be more likely to go on to university and the number of school rat less than good be down from one in three to few than one in that be through support teacher academy trust broad knowledge rich curriculum and the propagation and spread from school to school and teacher to teacher of prove method such as math mastery and synthetic phonic yes the system do also need money per pupil funding under the last government be high than it be under previous labour government among the nation it be middle of the range in cash per child and the high as proportion of national income of course we have to keep increase the resourcing that we put into key service none more so than education but the conservatives do that as priority from general taxation not by take from another part of the wide education system repeat the government do not have to choose these be all child will the right hon gentleman clarify his comment that all the education spending that he mention come from general taxation my understanding be that the figure that he just quote include the student loan system no they do not if the hon gentleman be talk about the oecd figure they be for primary secondary and college base education in the state sector but be grateful to he for his intervention when government member talk about the in the same tone in which they sometimes talk about the think they believe that they be about to topple the toff and achieve some sort of great victory in the class war they be not eton college will not miss heartbeat over this measure the pupil who will be hit will be those in small town school the one that be significant employer locally and big part of the local community they do not have big endowment they do have pretty thin margin school that cater to child with special educational need will be hit denominational school will be hit there have be some concession from the government they be not the most massive concession in the world but they be not nothing either we should acknowledge they and thank the government for they the first be on the music and dance scheme with extra help for family with child at the school in question albeit that the concession will benefit only little less than half the total number of family in what be means test scheme anyway there be also the confirmation that centre for advanced training will be exempt and of what the government plan to do on the continuity of education allowance we need to ensure that those mitigation be more comprehensive than they be now and that they become permanent of course the opposition would prefer the government to drop this measure altogether and not be the international outlier by tax education but if they be determined to bulldoze on we must have key change in committee we must have an exemption for all child with an ehcp not only if it specify the individual school child who have sen support and those who be currently apply for an ehcp we must have exemption for school whose fee be low than the average charge in the state sector and for religious denomination where there be no faith school provision in the state sector do not accept the notion that as ministers have say at the dispatch box member of religious faith community be not discriminate against by this measure it may well be that as whole people of faith be not discriminate against more than other because the vast majority of people of religious faith be in the state sector anyway where there be plenty of catholic school anglican school and other denominational school but it be not credible in the slight to claim that there be no discrimination and that the effect will not be feel much more strongly by member of certain tradition within judaism christianity and islam we also need key postponement child who be already in public exam year or the year before public exam can not have their education disrupt in this way the school that they move to may not even offer the same gcse or level the same exam board or the same syllabus most significantly of all the government must for good reason include simple practical reason at least postpone the introduction of the measure in area where state school be already full or almost full at that stage of education because the big effect of this divisive destructive tax attack will be on state school it will be feel in class size and ultimately in all parent ability to get the preferred choice of school for their child pay tribute to conservative members for embrace their role in opposition they be throw their whole heart into it and it be wonderful to see they in their rightful place long may it continue be the member for darlington where quarter of the treasury be base and my wonderful home town be fill with people from all walk of life we share the unifying belief that despite our rich railway heritage we do not like to be take for ride the coalition of people who elect come from every part of the town from people work two job worry about keep their child feed right across to people earn six figure who vote labour for the first time because they be worried about the lack of opportunity for their child to succeed the people in that coalition lead different life but agree completely on their reason for vote labour their reason be the same as for those up and down the country who vote for labour for the first time in drove the conservatives have crash our economy and stifle growth and all those people be bad off because of it as member of the prestigious treasury committee be privileged to hear the view of the top economic leader in our country their advice be clear growth and investment require economic stability and this finance bill will deliver economic stability our labour government be elect to offer industry and the market the assurance they need that britain be back in business the bill do just that our labour government be elect to ensure that people in every corner of the country can be well off this finance bill will create the condition to do just that our labour government be elect to get our child future back future that they can be excite about with life fill with opportunity prosperity and public service that work when they need they the bill be essential to deliver just that be proud to stand here to champion bill that will create the condition for long term investment in my area the huge amount of investment from big business that this government have already crowd in be testament to the fantastic reputation our country have on the global stage reputation that the last three prime ministers nearly destroy while the conservative chop and change their leader chancellor and policy the market business leader and global investor step back they watch and wait to see if the new prime minister know what they be do or if the next new prime minister have the backing of their colleague they watch and wait to see the new prime minister long term vision for the country but scandal after disastrous scandal lead they to lose confidence order the hon lady should sit when be on my foot this need to be debate about the finance bill not other matter and certainly not general debate on the budget again the conservatives stop answer the phone to labour the industry ghost they and then the country reject they but on the finance bill not day into this new labour government britain be back open for business with billion of pound of investment in green technology new nuclear solar and hydro project be give the go ahead and whopping billion of private investment crowd in tough choice be take to fix the foundation and to stabilise the economy choice only necessary because of the incompetence inertia and wilful ignorance of the last government to govern be to choose and be proud to have choose to stabilise the economy invest in net zero and energy independence balance the book and begin to rebuild our public service all in the service of work people this house will pass the bill the economy will be stabilise and every corner of our great country will be well off and not moment too soon it be great pleasure to have an opportunity to speak to the bill would have think it would be pleasure enjoy by many more people on the government benches last time check it have be while since be at university it be quite important to have constituent view hear on the finance bill and the budget it be scandalous how quiet the government benches be we will have in the order of eight labour speech today which be just unbelievable if one be unionist and be be that an intervention no it be not if be this would be an opportunity the government have an opportunity with the mandate they have to create budget for change but this budget will leave million bad off the budget last month have some moment of cheer in it and will touch on they now because it will not take long there be scope within the finance bill for increased investment which the snp have call for there be scope within the budget for increased funding for the nhs all across the united kingdom again the snp have call for that and it be welcome to see tackle the most elite of all the elite the non dom be also welcome as be the ambition to tackle the scourge of vape thereafter though we get into serious difficulty will start with the bill clause to further and final attack on north sea oil and gas scotland natural endowment the uk have draw hundred of billion of pound from the north sea over the course of my lifetime the past year it be almost as though the uk be addict to it so much so that it be go to kill the goose that lay the golden egg the government be hike taxis erode allowance and drive investment from the north sea include precisely the business that we need to drive the just transition to net zero in the place where we need they what other state would attack one of its own industry in this way it beggar belief it will come home to roost in spade and it will not shift the dial one bit towards the net zero future that we be try to get to the oil and gas that be be displace from the scottish sector by this government ineptitude will be replace by oil and gas from other jurisdiction where the tax will be pay and where doubtless human right be very much bad clause contain the universally detest provision on agricultural property relief the way in which this government have manipulate the figure to justify this mendacious attack on one of the most noble profession anywhere in the world and certainly across these island be simply unbelievable as be the idea that of farm will not be affect by these provision the fact that the government habitually quote circumstance in which two parent bequeath farm at the same time which almost never happen show that they themselves know that they be on shaky ground if the problem be non farm enterprise invest in the purchase of agricultural land in tax efficient way tax that that be what the government should have have the bravery to do there be no material enrichment from inherit the family farm other member have talk today about the return on capital employ in farming be miserably low it be as much vocation as it be an employment and we should never forget that the product of what farmer do feed we all it be ridiculous single minded myopic nonsense from another dysfunctional fiscally incompetent labour government who would not know which way up be if somebody do not point it out to they because farm be business we can add the imposition across the economy of the increase in employer national insurance charge if that be not enough the government have stick the boot in on four door pick up turn they into family car for taxation purpose pick up be the backbone of the agricultural economy but it seem that nothing be off limit for this labour government when it come to stick the boot into agriculture what government seriously take on the people who produce our food remind the government be guess but be pretty certain that they will not know that malt barley be the prime ingredient in the scotch whisky industry which again produce billion for the uk exchequer on the topic of the scotch whisky industry do the hon member agree that increase the levy by so that bottle of whisky now have of tax add before it be even out of the door be another attack on one of scotland main industry could not agree more with the hon member that be absolutely right and be go to touch on that topic little later we see in clause that the rate of landfill tax be go up by wonder what discussion government ministers have have with local authority on the impact of this increase it would be just like this government to not have put two and two together and realise that it will be significant upward pressure on cost for council clause deal with high sugar drink public health emergency exist in this country in this state and the government be propose to increase the tax on high sugar drink from per litre to per litre that be scarcely an increase at all tax of per litre be go up to per litre an increase of per litre we do not sell sugary drink in litre we sell they in ml can so that be an increase of per can be the government kid it be public health emergency the clue be in the title have they get no ambition at all this bill and the budget that lead up to it will impose billion of pound of tax rise and cut that will hit work scot in the pocket we see our old folk freeze in their house as result of this bill and the budget that underpin it as result of the bill young people will be chase few and few job with low and low wage the cbi say this week that the tax rise in the budget have send business into crisis containment and damage control because this chancellor billion raid on business be the single big tax increase since norman lamont in the chancellor decision hinge on departmental efficiency that will never ever be realise we know this because it have never ever be do so further cut be come down on top of these taxis this be pure fiscal poison for community and business across these island the government be inflict the same pain on the northern hotel in brechin perthshire timber and montrose port as they be inflict on nissan and tesco be not imply that it be fine for big business and bad for small business this be one size fit nobody finance bill and the budget that go along with it be the same the clawback that they be apply to the devolved nation which the exchequer secretary would not speak about early do not come close to meet the cost of the national insurance increase there be million of compensation for the scottish government who be face million exposure and that be the nature of what this government be do what of the reward for this fiscal pain low growth in the economy low profit increase debt low investment low wage fall output capital flight and the risk of default as the ultimate conclusion it be almost as though the chancellor have forget that her job be to run the economy not ruin the economy this would be matter for separate debate know that madam deputy speaker and do not want to test your patience but the raid on employer national insurance will devastate small business charity and the care sector it will cost scottish public service the public sector with direct employee in scotland million and when we include the partner agency work with our nhs and our care service that figure will be very much high supermarket and other retailer have also say that the inevitable result of the chancellor change will be high price for consumer the government make great play about not raise taxis but it amount to the same thing when wage be suppress and price be go up as the hon member for gordon and buchan harriet cross mention the duty on scotch whisky have be hike in this bill which the industry have call an indefensible tax grab this be despite labour leader in scotland for labour members interest he be gentleman call anas sarwar claim that he speak to the chancellor about it would be very interested to know about that conversation but perhaps it be be it okay if hike up duty anas with the reply yes no bother chancellor you carry on one of the glaring omission in the bill be any provision for the waspi woman it be of course welcome that the budget will address the great imposition put on people affect by the infected blood scandal and on postmaster however those be cause by the post office or the nhs and other whereas the waspi woman issue be cause by the uk government that great tragedy be cause by the government yet it be the one that be not address in this bill or in the broad budget it be therefore little wonder that polling in scotland last week show that of scot feel they be go to be bad off or certainly no well off as result of the budget since the chancellor deliver her budget supermarket farm pub and telecom provider have all warn that these decision will be inflationary do the hon member think it be fiscally responsible for the snp finance secretary to have use all of the million from offshore wind he have speak lot about this government but do he think that that be appropriate to my great regret be not entirely sure what the hon member be talk about if she would like be very happy to catch up with she afterwards we can find out exactly what be concern she and will make sure she have all the fact she need just when mortgage payer think thing be go to stabilise and that the bad of the last uk government fiscal incompetence be over the major bank have be talk since the budget about an increase in the rate they be able to offer many hon member have talk about what be say before the election and what have come to pass after it but during the election the prime minister promise that there would be reduction in energy price we have see that that be not the case and that energy price be high and will go up by in january there be honesty tax on energy bill across the united kingdom as result of what people be tell be go to happen before the election and what have come to pass at the hand of this labour government the hon gentleman talk about honesty it sound like he have read our manifesto so do we say that we would reduce energy price by november do we say that we would raise the minimum wage and do we do it be pleased with the hon gentleman intervention can only assume he be use car salesman in previous life we need to read the small print from labour we will reduce your energy bill by term and condition apply honestly you could make it think they be probably speak to the hon gentleman rather than madam deputy speaker thing do not end with the honesty tax mention this be serious point because pensioner in scotland will be strip of their winter fuel payment in the cold part of these island without so much as by your leave to the scottish government will the hon gentleman give way no will not we have touch on number of issue there in closing earning be set to grow by just in real term over this parliament as result of the bill and the budget that go with it and that will extend the uk long pay stagnation the resolution foundation have find that by average weekly earning be set to be just high than they be in furthermore the institute for fiscal studies state labour spending plan after be unlikely to survive contact with reality those will take an intervention from the hon member for edinburgh south west dr arthur because he have goad the government have take the difficult decision to mean test the winter fuel allowance and protect the poor pensioner but my understanding be that that be devolved power in scotland the scottish government could have make the decision to use the resource they have perhaps from wind as be discuss to extend the allowance to more pensioner in scotland but they do not they decide to enforce that cut in scotland when they could have take different path particularly give the additional uplift of money that have come from this budget do not know the hon gentleman have never set eye on he but will make the assumption that he be scottish labour mp do not know who he be because he have only just appear in the chamber despite the fact that we be two and half hour into the we have hear lot from the hon member for barking nesil caliskan as well the hon gentleman ask what the scottish government will do about the winter fuel payment so let tell he for the next time he be an apologist for the united kingdom the labour government devolve control over the winter fuel payment and then effectively take the budget away by cut it for pensioner elsewhere in the united kingdom that be the trap of devolution he do not want to see it but can see it fine do not know it so do not know how he know what the scottish government will do regard the winter fuel payment and what target support they will provide in the winter ahead one thing for sure however be that whoever in scotland be stand up for pensioner it certainly will not be the labour party in closing it be no surprise that the bill and the budget hold nothing but pain for community service and business in scotland labour take scotland for grant the labour government even ignore representation from their westminster apologist with scottish constituency who sit on their own benches this be another tragic budget for scotland and another push factor inexorably move we close to independence at least the budget be good for one thing congratulate my hon friend the member for south derbyshire samantha niblett on fantastic maiden speech be sure that her expertise in the tech sector will be an asset to this place welcome the ability to contribute to the debate on the finance bill be wholly supportive of the measure announce in the budget that form the legislation after year of conservative mismanagement of our economy and the country the public speak on july and give clear mandate to repair the dire circumstance we find ourselves in that leave my constituent foot the bill the electorate know and show at the ballot box that they be in dire need of grow up government that would not shy away from the hard decision we have hear many contribution from opposition members set out the thing they do not like about the budget if they support the benefit of the budget we have not hear much about how they would fund those measure or what they would cut my constituent vote for government who would finally ensure after year of failure that we would grow our economy low the tax burden on work people and restore the fantastic public service that once upon time make this country world leader my constituent understand that there be difficult decision to be make they know that government be about make choice and decide what country we want to be in the future they make their decision at the ballot box do away with the conservatives my constituent choose to no long be country with crumble road country that dip in and out of recession country with low investment ultimately steer by the hand of the conservatives in chaotic fashion that clobber their living standard they vote for labour and with that they decide that they want to live in country with monumental investment in its national health service which will reduce waiting list we be already see the benefit of that and rebuild key hospital such as leighton hospital in my constituency they want to be in country where their work be reward fairly and where minimum wage increase will put year into their pocket not only that they want to live in country order be go to make the request that have make at least twice this could be third time or the fourth please can member debate the finance bill second reading which be what we have on the order paper this afternoon this be not general debate on the budget we debate the budget several week ago and we can not keep cover old ground my apology madam deputy speaker be about to move on to point cover by the finance bill my constituent want to live in country that level the play field and ensure that work family have as much opportunity at all stage of their life regardless of their postcode or their background that be why support the government decision to end vat relief on private school aim to equalise educational opportunity know that many family work hard to send their child to private school but have never meet constituent who do not work hard just to make end meet and their child also deserve the very good education that our country can provide hon member hear hear conservative member say hear hear but we do not often hear they advocate for state school as former state school pupil with three daughter in state school let assure the hon member that despite the caricature that sometimes he and other like to paint not all conservative members be privately educate say to he quietly that it be not choice of either or we want to see excellence and choice in education right across the board it be not one against the other thank the hon member for make that intervention he say that it be not choice between one and the other but for year under the previous government we hear his side talk about state school have to make difficult decision and tighten their belt as the husband of state schoolteacher know that our state school be severely underserve by the previous government the money generate by end the vat relief on private school will be vital to recruit the more teacher that we need in our state school and to roll out free breakfast club across the country to ensure that no child in education go hungry do the hon member know how many additional teacher be recruit in the last parliament without put vat on private education do he know how many breakfast club be already in state school in this country there be thousand of they thank to the national school breakfast programme we have hear lot of contribution from the opposition benches about the fantastic record of the previous government but that do not stand up to the live reality of our constituent that be exactly why we see the result that we have in the general election the soon opposition members come to term with that result the well will the hon member give way be sorry but have give way several time already welcome the government go even far in the bill to level the play field and ensure that those with the broad shoulder take the heavy burden that be why we need the legislation to close loophole such as the non dom status change the furnished holiday letting tax regime and provide more resource to hmrc to tackle the tax gap that will help we address the financial black hole that the conservative party clearly have no regard for claim do not exist and have fail to apologise for the bill will allow we to fix what the leader of the opposition admit today be break foundation believe that the government budget and the bill will be vital starting point on long road to recovery for this country commend the government for their work and support this bill progression through the house may start by congratulate the hon member for south derbyshire samantha niblett on her excellent maiden speech not only will her daughter have be inspire by her word but so too will countless other young woman must declare personal financial interest in relation to independent school fee want to start by tell story of aspiration sacrifice and hard work this story be tell to by parent who be go into christmas feeling devastate they have work tirelessly miss valuable time with their child and sacrifice holiday and any form of luxury because of an aspiration to give their child an education that otherwise would have be out of reach this parent say to be not rich person hustle every day to make the money need to send my child to this school this parent will now see all those sacrifice come to nothing as her child face the upheaval of move school in the middle of the academic year let we imagine that child first day in their new state school their school year have be disrupt and their effort to catch up on the miss learning as consequence of be force to change school part way through the academic year they join other student across the country who be expect to do the same as consequence of this policy their classroom size swell as the promise of new teacher remain year away from become reality and the school struggle to stretch its exist budget to accommodate the new intake there be not enough textbook computer or teacher let we imagine the child with special educational need and disability their routine have be overhaul they start to fall behind in their class despite the very good effort of their teacher who want to provide the extra support so desperately need they simply do not have the bandwidth the consequence of that be child future prospect slip through their finger every day because the school they now attend have not be adequately resource for the arrival of they and their fellow new classmate imagine be the parent of these child they be not rich they just want the good for their child as consequence of one ill conceived ideologically drive policy that dream have be snatch away with no consideration of the impact it will have on family on school and on teacher who will be leave redundant while the government speak of hope to bring aspiration to all their policy to charge vat on independent school fee will do the precise opposite it will not deliver high standard across the board this be not policy that lift up on the contrary it will deliver the bad for all child it be the very definition of level down government can not be expect to get thing right all the time but it be not unreasonable to expect government to recognise when they have get something wrong it be not unreasonable to expect government to hold up their hand and to pause reflect and recalibrate if the government true endeavour be to bring about policy for positive change they must be willing to recognise when they need to change course and this be that moment ask the government to demonstrate some moral courage admit that they have err and abandon this policy of folly the budget that be present to the house will turn the page on what have be chaotic few year under the last government it be also an opportunity for my constituent to welcome budget that demonstrate responsible government who will take tight fiscal rule seriously the truth be that economic growth come when there be financial stability and the first step towards financial stability be to ensure that the book be balanced this budget protect work people from high taxis in their payslip and provide an increase in the national minimum wage which my constituent will absolutely benefit from it speak volume that the majority of the time spend by opposition members have focus on subsidy that use to exist for private school and now do not because this government be ensure that we invest in the state sector will the hon lady give way no can tell those member that when additional money be spend on the state sector it improve the life chance and opportunity of my constituent be grateful to the hon lady for give way could she identify which subsidy she be talk about be talk about the vat relief that exist for private school interruption yes it be subsidy politic be full of choice and government first responsibility be to ensure that they balance the book if government be responsible they will invest in decent public service and create condition for economic stability want to concentrate on that final point for moment we have hear remark from opposition members on small and medium sized business say to those member that when speak to local business in barking they say that the economic instability over the past few year be what have create pressure for they welcome in particular the government tax announcement on non dom loophole the government change the residential base mean they will increase revenue by almost billion the rate change on capital gain mean we will maintain our position as have the low capital gain tax of any european economy these measure be collection of decision that show we be prioritise investment in public service alongside an absolute commitment from the government to create economic stability to achieve the future growth that this country deserve will speak about the impact of the government change to the energy profit levy on people and business in my constituency and on the uk as whole in term of the energy security the government be mean to ensure and the government ever more ambitious decarbonisation target which be be put at risk the chancellor decision to increase the epl rate to and extend it to while also remove investment allowance demonstrate fundamental misunderstanding of our energy sector indeed the global energy sector and the community here that depend on it accord to aberdeen and grampian chamber of commerce energy relate job across the uk but disproportionately in aberdeen and aberdeenshire be be put at risk because of the change the obr figure project that capital expenditure will fall by with oil production down and gas production down for business across my constituency that mean few contract reduced investment and diminish opportunity or to put it another way few job few prospect and more redundancy what be incomprehensible about the change to the epl be that they make no economic sense study by offshore energies uk show that the change will cost the treasury billion in lose tax billion if the chancellor be so convinced that she be in hole maybe not dig deep would be good idea the oeuk put that down to rapid decline in production due to under investment while we be still go to use oil and gas for year to come the government be therefore choose to take it from overseas producer where there be low environmental credential and bad employment standard rather than from the uk where we will be able to increase employment secure employment help our tax revenue and secure our economic growth both locally and nationally labour change in the budget will see wholly punitive regime with the effective tax rate be on oil and gas company the high of any comparable off sea mature basin what other industry in the uk would be expect to deliver something as fundamental as our heating lighting or transport fuel indeed energy to ensure the nhs can operate and school can run while also be tax to such an extent that the government be drive away investment in sector so crucial to our national security what be particularly concern about the epl be the impact on home grow energy business these be not global multinational that be often use as example of the energy giant who make massive profit company that can and do buffer the impact of epl by increase their overseas investment and reduce their investment in the north sea instead this policy hit hard the company that have emerge and grow out of north east scotland employ local people support local supply chain and help our local economy thank the hon lady for give way in january the conservative chancellor increase the energy profit levy by from to what be the impact of that change on north sea job and the economy thank the hon gentleman for his question we must remember that investment allowance have now be reduce and take away increase the epl by further while decrease investment allowance make the north sea really difficult place to invest in apache have announce that it be set to pull out of the north sea basin how do the hon lady think that announcement relate to the fiscal decision of this government do she think that it be inextricably link to this government ambition for north sea oil and gas and their failure to fully understand how the industry work the fact that apache announcement come within week of the budget speak for itself when it come to the question of the final straw that break the camel back as be say the energy profit levy have the great impact on our local home grow business it be turn the light off in the very business that we should be support and championing by remove investment allowance the government be force company to scale back their north sea project thereby increase our reliance on expensive import energy from overseas north east scotland be already lead the charge on renewable energy we have hydrogen project in development wind farm off our shore and expertise that could and should position we as global leader on clean renewable energy technology however rush ill think out transition to which the epl contribute will undermine our effort the skill of our oil and gas sector be precisely what we need in order to deliver sustainable transition the company that will be penalise by this levy be the one that we need to invest in green technology just yesterday meet developer of float offshore wind farm and ask they about the epl they hope that one of their project will involve collaboration with an oil and gas field the float wind farm will help to decarbonise the rig and in return the oil and gas producer will help to fund the cabling back to shore however now they fear that the increase and extended epl will jeopardise the oil and gas company ability and willingness to invest this labour government be turn what be windfall tax into permanent feature of our tax system create long term uncertainty that will drive investment away from north east scotland the energy profit levy be blunt instrument not balanced strategy the government must listen to industry expert local business and community like mine in gordon and buchan we need competitive open business environment that attract investment and will support our energy transition while protect job and supply chain and secure our energy supply the nation energy security depend on it it be pleasure to speak while you be in the chair madam deputy speaker it be also pleasure to hear the brilliant maiden speech from my hon friend the member for south derbyshire samantha niblett we be colleague and partner in crime in the cause of technology know that she have glitter career in front of she and look forward to witness it in view of the instruction from your predecessor in the chair madam deputy speaker studiously read the budget briefing from the house of commons library which explain the history of the finance bill broadly that history commend this country stability and its financial institution broadly but with one great blip let start by recognise the context of the bill the wreckage from which we emerge the wreckage of the growth plan as the conservatives call it under their prime minister liz truss the briefing for which thank the library staff tell we that not set out the prospective flow of finance bill from that be total aberration from the wreckage however have come the return of stability in fairness recognise that at the time the present shadow chancellor the right hon member for central devon mel stride call the party leader out he say that she be fly blind and other be follow she blindly it seem that blind flight be contagious on the opposition benches today the right hon gentleman talk about oppose about be the party of no rather than the party of government he do not tell we how he would fund public service he do not tell we what taxis he would raise if he oppose all of ours be conscious that he also once call the pension triple lock unsustainable this be not someone to be trust with government or with opposition note that the right hon member for east hampshire damian hinds have just leave the chamber have say that he be not interested in choose he stand for the as my hon friend the member for darlington lola mcevoy say to govern be to choose to avoid choice be to play the fantasy politic of opposition and be glad that the right hon gentleman have find the warm benches opposite the hon gentleman say that the tories have no plan for public service accept that the labour government do have plan but it be completely unbelievable so where do that leave we may recognise with warm comfort the traditional place of the scottish nationalist as total enabler of conservative government the hon gentleman talk about fiscal credibility may point out the absolute wreckage of the scottish government who have waste almost half billion pound of offshore wind proceed on day to day spending because of their fiscal mismanagement if he be take tutorial alongside the conservative party may ask he to invite his colleague in scotland to they those will serve they very efficiently from my experience of the city of london and of invest in this country and abroad the broad lesson have learn be that finance be always contingent but the fundamental matter for that reason the bill have to be see in the context of what it enable where the conservatives treat the work people of this country as their cash machine we be protect payslip where they do not support healthcare in this country and wreck the waiting list system as experience grow up in this country we be support the nhs where they slash public investment and take cowardly decision across their finance bills we be invest in our future want to mention proposal in the bill that be close to my heart the relief on draught duty which will affect the lamb and flag in wick the three golden cups in southerndown and close to my heart finnegans on barry island when the gavin and stacey christmas special be show will make sure to make the most of the draught duty relief particularly at finnegans but across the vale of glamorgan let return to the choice at the heart of this bill as the treasury distributional analysis show the overall context of what we have do both in the bill and more broadly be that of household in this country will be well off that be the amazing distributional context after year of what we experience under the conservative party what daffodil laden budget we have the bill offer the big ever budget settlement for wales it mean billion for welsh public service some minimum wage worker in wales will be well off there be million for our coal and steel community and timely million of support for coal tip for the daffodil laden budget and the bill that undergird it be very grateful to the chancellor it be pleasure to speak in this debate as member of the treasury committee after suffer the high fall in living standard since record begin the united kingdom desperately need economic growth yet the obr forecast that the policy in the government finance bill and budget will have no impact on growth over the next five year the recessionary impact of the tax rise combine with focus on current spending that crowd out the private sector largely offset the fiscal stimulus of one of the large fiscal event in recent decade and of borrow an extra billion year there be potential upside to the growth forecast in the budget mainly from the impact of planning reform but this budget and finance bill be miss opportunity for growth that matter because there be chronic structural problem in the british economy that we must address indeed give that public sector net debt be now approach of gdp the government ability to borrow to invest in the future or to cope with an unforeseen shock be severely constrain many labour members have speak about the importance of public investment which agree with so would like to address the follow point since the financial crash the uk economy have be hamper by productivity growth collapse to per year the second bad in the unless and until we solve the productivity crisis the uk will not escape its downward economic spiral of high taxis an age population ever crumble public service and ever high debt key cause of that be chronically low public and private investment in of the last year the uk have have the low total investment of any economy yet as the obr testify under the budget public investment will remain flat as share of gdp so the budget be unlikely to help solve the productivity crisis this be why the obr be forecast that for every borrow by the government the economy will grow by only next year and that these effect will reverse in five year the hon gentleman know that hold he in high regard but be slightly perplexed because he welcome this government investment in public service the nhs and so forth yet his colleague oppose many of the revenue raiser in this finance bill and perhaps he do too can he help square that circle as the hon member will know the liberal democrats have alternative measure for raise those revenue but my fundamental point be that yes welcome public investment but it be flat in the budget it be not enough in my view and furthermore it be not focus on the right area by contrast economist have find that optimal form of public investment be able to raise gdp by for every invest the good public investment for raise economic growth be investment in intangible capital such as knowledge research and development patent and license that can bring great gain in productivity because knowledge can build on exist knowledge and it can crowd in private investment as it lower the financial risk of participation for private investor indeed the most effective form of be target on specific goal for example the kennedy administration in the have stunning success in increase us productivity and growth by have the very specific goal of the moon landing be excited to see that to solve target problem be in the budget on page but then see that of the billion in spending in the budget only million will be spend on the good type of to drive economic growth that be about double the budget of my local district council that be not really appropriate for the world sixth large economy we stand on the cusp of new industrial revolution in artificial intelligence and this country have just one chance to gain the first mover advantage and to harvest the productivity gain and growth that could result indeed combine with innovation in the life science and climate technology which be mention in the budget this could be our route out of this downward economic spiral yet in the page budget the word artificial intelligence appear once call on the government to redouble their effort on public investment and because would like to live in country that have the resource that it need to provide opportunity for our citizen and this budget be miss opportunity to do that my hon friend the member for south derbyshire samantha niblett have leave the chamber but praise she for her maiden speech be pleased to speak on this finance bill it underpin the first labour budget in year it also raise the revenue that this country need in order to recover rebuild and renew will not spend age talk about the conservatives and the mess they have make but cue groan from conservative members we all know about the billion black hole the mini budget and their reprehensible record on public finance however want to take moment to praise the shadow chancellor the right hon member for central devon mel stride because genuinely enjoy his astronomy reference it be just shame that he be not quite on planet earth when it come to recognise that we need to not only invest in public service but pay for they the vehicle for that be this very finance bill even while this government be tackle the tories toxic inheritance we be through this finance bill protect payslip when it come to income tax and employee national insurance let get on to other key measure in the bill that welcome measure on tobacco duty non dom tax status and the oil and gas windfall mean that public service in my constituency of york outer will be all the well off let start by talk about the nhs this week meet yorkshire cancer research to talk about the vital work that it do as we discuss on second reading of the tobacco and vapes bill yesterday the tobacco duty increase will act as deterrent to smoking and it will save life take together these measure be important to change habit but the tobacco duty increase will also raise extra cash to fund our nhs primary care service such as the york medical group which recently visit and york hospital will undoubtedly welcome extra investment certainly welcome it as parent who recently have to wait many hour in york with scream toddler after trap finger it be vital that we get the nhs back up and run for constituent like mine one constituent have be wait seven year for surgery let that sink in it be half the time that the tories be in power be clear that this bill raise the revenue to put the nhs on much surer footing the hon gentleman be conscientious member of parliament and understand what he be say but do he accept that in the word of former labour leader we invest in public service with the proceed of growth when he stand for re election will he tell his constituent that he advocate for budget to cut growth in his country that be slightly laughable if may say so as an affable yorkshireman thing like the national planning policy framework will drive growth and some of these measure be not include in the obr blue book this pro growth government be do so much for growth so find the hon gentleman question slightly perplexing the bill will abolish the non dom tax loophole and replace it with residence base regime have look and this change will raise billion just last week the transport secretary kindly visit and the mayor of york and north yorkshire to announce million of funding for our bus which will transform our region my quick math show that close the non dom tax loophole will pay time more than that sum which be the difference this bill will make will soon be have my office christmas do be sure there be joke to be make about liquid asset but recently visit elvington brewery and this bill rightly cut alcohol duty on draught product that be wonderful news for our yorkshire pub need to declare an interest for myself and my hard work team because these measure mean that we be look forward to enjoy cheap pint of the wonderfully name fairytale of brew york which will be launch by brew york over the festive period conservative members back investment in our public service but they do not support the revenue raise by this bill perhaps they have be have too many fairytale economic pint the vat increase on private school fee will bring in billion year which will go directly to school like those in york outer the budget announce billion uplift for sen provision and billion increase in the school budget which will make huge difference to place like applefields school and manor church of england academy have also visit askham bryan college fantastic agricultural college in york outer its great student who be study level will benefit from million of extra funding for college directly stem from this finance bill while make some proportionate tax rise in the budget we have maintain our position of have the low capital gain tax in europe we have strike the right balance because we will have extra cash for our school and it be real lifeline for all the conservatives obfuscation we have actually keep so many of our manifesto promise one of which be to deliver windfall tax on oil and gas company policy so good that the conservatives steal it when they be in government the additional revenue raise by the epl will help we to set up gb energy which will deliver for the british people by deliver the green job of the future may briefly refer to the first bill ever speak on in this house which be now the budget responsibility act say the bill be important because it be the only way we can grow those public service with stable economy official report july vol that be as true now as it be back hear grumble from the opposition benches conservative members do not seem to think that economic stability matter when it come to invest in public service they certainly know quite lot about economic instability this government have be task with rip out the rot follow year of chaos the bill help to fix the foundation by provide the revenue to restore public service in york outer and beyond we be debate the finance bill follow an election in usual time such bill would enact what be say in the win party manifesto but not this time on the electoral trail all the labour members who be now minister repeat what be say in the labour manifesto time and again their plan be fully cost and fully fund they repeatedly say that they have no plan to raise taxis beyond vat on private school or to increase public borrowing the manifesto say in bald term that we will not increase national insurance there be no qualification to that it be there in black and white it be extraordinary that we be debate finance bill that have no correlation to the manifesto that it come after the electorate be profoundly mislead the reality be that the labour party be increase spending by more than billion labour member use the argument of their fantasy black hole which have be thoroughly debunk by the independent government body the office for budget responsibility the independent ifs and the financial times no one believe labour because that black hole be not there it be not black hole it be more like red herring the reason for that red herring be that labour need it as the excuse to do what it always intend to do put up taxis and increase spending on public worker why do it do that because labour members all of they know that if they have be honest with the electorate and tell they that labour be go to be tax and spend party no one would have vote for they even then only of the public do it be big con on the electorate that be why we have petition live on the government website that say believe the current labour government have go back on the promise they lay out in the lead up to the last election as of this afternoon million people have sign that petition because they feel mislead by this government the budget provide billion for education billion for send billion for the nhs and several billion more for thing like council would the hon gentleman constituent in broadland and fakenham welcome the contribution of those fund to the nhs school and council or would he not like that investment to go into his constituency there be number of point in the hon gentleman intervention first how much money should be spend secondly what should it be spend on and thirdly where should we get it from will go straight to the heart of where we can get the money from if we return public service productivity back to level there be ten of billion of pound to be save if we return the size of the civil service to the level before the big covid expansion there be ten of billion of pound to be save and if we return welfare spending on disability back to pre covid level which my right hon friend the member for central devon mel stride be in process of do before the general election there be ten of billion of pound to be save on that point will the hon gentleman give way in moment if we add that all up there would be billion that could be spend on the frontline however the problem with the labour party be that it take money and spend it on inflation bust wage rise for its union paymaster but not on increase and improve the outcome for the people who use service that be the big difference between the conservative party and the labour party the focus of our spending be not the people provide the service we be for the people who use those service the people of this country my hon friend be make typically eloquent and excellent speech challenge number of labour members to outline that public service can be invest in if in addition to some of the tax raise mechanism they have choose we have economic growth will my hon friend outline how much growth have be cut by under the government proposal compare with ours be correct in think it be over the parliament my hon friend be entirely correct over the course of the forecast period the office for budget responsibility estimate that growth will be cut by it be bad than that however because we also have an increase in taxis on business of billion through the national insurance contribution which the obr tell we will be pay for overwhelmingly by reduce pay for worker amount to billion it also forecast that more than full time equivalent job will be lose as result of the policy that labour member plan to vote for will the hon member give way will on that point the hon member keep talk about his government have be in the process of make mark on productivity have leave we with the bad productivity slowdown in year will he tell we how long the process would have take the hon gentleman intervention be not on the point that he rise for but there be one thing that he do not mention and that be the covid impact interruption hon member can laugh about it but we spend billion support the economy and the people of this country in once in century impact on our economy if my hon friend will forgive will he give way yes will that be extraordinary do he agree with that there seem to be collective amnesia among colleague on the labour benches if we have take their advice during covid when we be make reasonable decision not only would we have see the long lockdown that the now prime minister be call for but more economic damage which they now deny ever happen in the first place my hon friend be absolutely right and there be point worth make here since covid the private sector have improve productivity by about productivity in the public sector have yet to improve although before the general election it be start to do that will the hon gentleman give way will not want to make some progress because have be quite generous in give way the obr say that more than job will be actively lose as direct result of the decision member on the labour benches be about to take think that be an underestimate have be talk to business in my constituency of broadland and fakenham over the past few week and as former entrepreneur have be take aback by quite how badly the tax and spend decision of the labour party have go down with my small and medium sized employer their account to suggest that those choice be affect their decision on employment and particularly on employ young people one employer say to just two week ago that year old be hard to employ than say or year old because overall more of they will fail in their job as they get use to the work environment employ year old use to be worthwhile because the national minimum wage be low and national insurance contribution do not have to be pay on the first of their employment that advantage have be remove and it be now disproportionately more expensive to employ an year old than old member of staff that be real life case where the employer tell they will stop employ young people in their business be that really what labour members want to achieve that be what be happen already be not quite clear what the hon gentleman be say be he advise business in his constituency not to employ year old or be he tell year old in his constituency that he want they to be pay less be not tell anyone anything be report what business be tell as direct consequence of the action of the member on the labour benches young people be not be employ who otherwise would have be the obr say that will lead to more than job be lose time will tell but think that be an underestimate we have reduction in recruitment reduction in the employment of young staff reduction in investment and as result we will have reduction in growth over the course of the forecast period but bad than that we will have reduction in living standard this cost of living crisis which have now be cause by labour will reduce living standard by by that reduction be direct result of the budget so if labour members vote for this bill they will be vote for increase the cost of live crisis by none the less we have see some increase debt cost be increase inflation be increase which will exacerbate the cost of living crisis and mortgage cost be increase you talk about increase inflation yet we see record level of the conservative government one third of which be cause by our exposure to gas shock do he agree with this labour government that we need to invest in clean energy so that we be no long leave vulnerable to foreign dictator and their control of fossil fuel market order before the hon member answer that intervention remind member not to use the word you moreover this be debate on the second reading of the finance bill so can we please make comment intervention and speech relevant to the finance bill be grateful for that intervention inflation be direct consequence of the russian invasion of ukraine as everyone know but what be important be that the conservative government take the difficult decision to get it down to target of it be already creep up under labour and it will be high than it otherwise would have be as direct consequence of these measure do not trust my word for that that come directly from the obr again the obr tell we that mortgage rise will occur directly because of the decision of government members union activity will be up with the consequential impact on productivity and efficiency of our private sector the size of the state will go up and shamefully the tax take will be the high since record begin will not support this finance bill or its second reading so labour members will have to take the consequence of their own decision may start by congratulate my hon friend the member for south derbyshire samantha niblett on her excellent maiden speech as fellow technologist she have do so much to make sure that woman in particular be part of the technology sector that be vital as we work to get more woman involve in the technology sector and in technology policy last week constituent who have vote labour at the election come to see she be an elderly woman and she ask this very simple question what make this labour budget as corollary of that she say if be to vote now why should vote labour to make sure that we have another budget like the one you have just pass and have particular answer for she we talk about some big thing we talk about the big choice that be in the budget underpin by this finance bill we talk about for example the choice to make hard decision in order to fund our nhs properly to make sure that we shift from national health service to neighbourhood health service so that in my constituency we can ensure that there be proper health provision in town like hindley green and orrell which over the past year have lose all their primary care provision she think that be compelling then say that another of the big choice that we make in the budget which this finance bill underpin be to invest instead of accept the slow decline that the conservative members have preside over for year we then discuss some of the less well cover measure that this finance bill support and it be those that wish to talk about today in these measure we can see the value that make the budget and this finance bill labour budget care respect and pride in our community these be the measure that answer her question what be it that make the budget that this finance bill pay for labour budget let talk about few of the small thing that will benefit my constituent and work people right across the country most importantly for those represent we will end the injustice of the mineworker pension scheme just yesterday my constituent remember the springs colliery disaster in hindley ten of thousand of people who use to live in the constituency of ince which precede my own come together in what be powerful and emotional moment for they by end the injustice of the mineworker pension scheme the chancellor ensure that as we build the next generation of energy reduce bill and ensure that foreign dictator no long have hold over energy production in this nation we also remember the last generation of energy production the worker who power our industrial revolution and build this nation wealth do my hon friend agree that the proceed from the finance bill will allow we not just to invest in the future but to recognise our heritage compensate mineworker and in particular support coal tip in wales entirely agree with my hon friend to be specific about the benefit that will accrue there be family in my constituency who for decade have watch the government take out of their pension scheme and refuse to rectify the ongoing justice we all know what conservative member think of miner by ensure that they get increase in their pension we be not only put money directly into the pocket of the work people who build this nation but signal our respect for an industry and profession that make this country wealth the second small subtler sometimes miss thing that demonstrate the value that lie behind the measure that the finance bill will pay for be the million funding increase for kinship and foster carer my council in wigan be pioneer in the provision of adult social care and care for child it have blaze the way in ensure that it work with third sector organisation and maintain the budget to fund its own care provision publicly now it be back by government who care about what carer do as the hon member for south derbyshire have argue the flipside of high productivity and high technology economy be care care be the most human thing that we will do more and more of as we build high tech and high productivity economy the government million increase will ensure that caring be properly fund in this country thank my hon friend for mention carer be also really pleased to see in the budget an increase in the carer allowance eligibility limit to week which will allow many carer to work long and earn more money before their allowance be withdraw do he welcome that commitment which show the real commitment of the labour government to support carer not only do agree with my hon friend point about the carer allowance which will benefit people in my region of the north west the increase demonstrate wide point about respect those who provide care in our society and economy for too long we have think the profession to be unskille and have undervalue it as path of work in several of the measure that the finance bill will pay for the government have demonstrate that caring be vital part of the economy that we wish to build have say this before and will say it again high productivity and more technology mean more care we must respect and value that most human of profession if we be to build an economy in which we all want to live in the future every thursday during the pandemic we clap cheer and make noise to signal to our nhs carer that we care about they it be not just about noise it be about the promise of well future on the other side of the pandemic which be where we be now do my hon friend agree that one of the most important thing that this labour government have do be give much deserve pay rise to our teacher and nhs staff under the conservatives million nhs appointment be cancel and million teaching day be lose because of conservative policy the nhs be force to spend billion on temporary staffing and we lose school day that cost the economy million conservative members ask how much our public sector worker be pay and how much they be worth do my hon friend agree that they be worth every single penny that they will be pay under this labour government absolutely agree with my hon friend that those who keep this nation go who keep teach our child and who keep look after those who be sick and die deserve every penny of the pay rise that this government award they since the subject of the pandemic have come up would add that the moral credibility of conservative members to ever use the sacrifice that our nation make during the covid pandemic as rebuttal to anything that this government do be lose the moment the prime minister tell the nation to stay at home while he invite his colleague to booze up in no downing street my hon friend mention partygate but it go far beyond that we have to remember that the dodgy contract that go to mate and donor bring our country into utter disrepute in this finance bill debate do he recognise the financial impact of that on the country order once again remind member that intervention should be on what be in front of we the second reading of the finance bill absolutely take that point but will remind conservative members of the simple argument be make in case they have lose the thread of it be go through the measure in the budget that may have be lose by medium scrutiny of some of the big measure my question be how would they pay for those measure if they support they they need to answer that question pose by the bill today as the minister say early the first word in labour manifesto be about restore economic stability if conservative member support some of the measure be describe they must themselves answer the question of how they would pay for they will mention three more measure before close these measure specifically benefit the region that be proud to represent in the north west and they will drive growth not just here in london and the south east but right across the country include in wigan and the town across makerfield the first measure be the electrification of the wigan to bolton line which will mean that constituent in hindley will benefit from more reliable train service that do not get cancel as they have repeatedly be over the past two week due to the weather the second measure be an increase in the household support fund of million in the north west that will specifically help those just above the pension credit threshold who none the less need support this winter the third and final measure be the integrate settlement with our trailblaze labour mayor andy burnham in greater manchester mean that we can cap bus fare at it also mean that we will trailblaze the live well centre which work people will benefit from and those out of work will be provide with the holistic support they need to get back into work those be the measure that this finance bill support the question for conservative members be will they support the measure that pay for those provision if they will not they will continue to be the party that do not restore economic stability that crash the economy and that send mortgage rate spiral the first and most important thing this labour government have do and will always do be protect the economic stability of this nation person character be most on display in watch what they do when nobody else be look can not remember who say that either former prime minister or baseball coach in the united states government character be often in the thing that get less attention that demonstrate whose side that government be on in the provision the government have demonstrate that they be on the side of miner carer commuter and worker in makerfield greater manchester and the north west what this finance bill show be that this be government who will tear down any barrier that get in the way of we deliver for work people in the united kingdom this finance bill should be chance to begin the vital work of transform our economy to make it fair to restore public service and to make our economy greener by invest in urgent climate and nature action as such welcome the focus on public investment however overall the green party view be that the bill lack vision for our future and do not deliver the ambitious and hopeful change that people vote for in july would argue that that be because it seek to answer the wrong question the bill should not be design to focus purely on growth for growth sake but should instead focus on more modern and rounded way of measure economic success that deliver wellbee liveable future well standard of living and good quality job when deliver the budget the chancellor refer to growth time but she do not mention climate or nature once when the joseph rowntree foundation analysis warn that current spending plan will see inequality and poverty increase while average disposable income fall the government plan clearly be not go to deliver fairer future for we all the finance bill be an opportunity to set thing on the right track because that be possible with the right choice be elect advocate specifically for transformative wealth tax for those with the broad shoulder to bear the great financial responsibility for transform our economy therefore very much hop that this finance bill would seek to tax all kind of wealth much more ambitiously to fund our future do the hon gentleman have model of wealth tax from another country that have be successful in raise the amount of money he claim it would have raise thank the hon member for that question always enjoy her contribution later in my speech will talk about specific model that would propose one that put forward in the general election and that have the support of number of researcher and academic there be lot of model out there include those that look at example from other country be glad that the government be take step to close the unfairness gap in the tax system whereby income from work be tax at high level than income from wealth or asset reform capital gain tax have be major policy priority for the greens for some time it be long overdue and commend the chancellor for grasp that particular nettle however the finance bill could and should go even far focus on the very wealthy in society over the past year the uk have become an increasingly unequal country between and alone billionaire wealth in the uk increase by almost billion the five rich family in the uk be wealthy than the bottom of the entire population that last stat can be replace with more recent one accord to the equality trust the uk five rich family now own more wealth than the bottom million do both be startling fact to answer the question pose by the hon member for east thanet ms billington wealth tax of annually on asset above million and of on asset above billion would demonstrate that this government be serious about fairness figure that be back up by researcher and academic suggest that such wealth tax could raise ten of billion during this parliament much big than number of the figure quote by other member today it would show that the government be serious about fairness about transform the economy and about invest for well future if the hon member be so concerned about inequality and poverty in this country why do he refuse to support the building of pylon thereby add about billion to the cost of increase electricity production in this country those cost will above all go on to the bill of work people be that not measure to reduce inequality and poverty in this country that the hon member would support if the hon gentleman be aware of my campaign background he will know that have be one of the strong advocate for accelerate to move to renewable energy for decade with all the benefit that bring for reduce bill if he hear the westminster hall debate yesterday he will know that we need to combine speed on renewable with bring community with we and assess all the option available and we have cross party support in argue for that will the hon gentleman give way perhaps the right hon gentleman would let make little more progress first please wealth tax would go long way towards fund the public service that our economy rely on and to deliver nature and climate friendly policy that will benefit we all for example by maintain the winter fuel allowance for pensioner while invest in the roll out of the street by street insulation programme we could bring down household bill and carbon emission and at the same time support the most vulnerable household with energy bill over the winter month prevent hundred of avoidable death there be also nature base solution that would help to protect against the flooding chaos and misery cause for example by storm bert recently preparedness or adaptation be often neglect when it come to climate action yet this week have demonstrate what difference it can make wealth tax could see charity and not for profit health and social care provider for example exempt from the plan increase in national insurance contribution for employer in recognition of the significant work they do in our community and the significant further strain that this plan change will put they under as community action suffolk have warn this financial challenge may be step too far for some organisation that deliver vital service keep suffolk resident safe and well and reduce pressure on other public sector system include the nhs the government have take or have seek to take some step towards tax wealth in address the real problem of very wealthy people invest in farmland to avoid pay inheritance tax however the way in which they have go about do so be result in huge problem it be clumsy because it be impact on small farm that may on paper have asset worth several million but if the farmer be not actually earn any income or very little they never actually see the benefit of that the exchequer secretary be back in the chamber and would ask he whether in consider the agricultural property relief know it be plan for further year budget so there be time for the government to look at this he will look at the work of tax analyst dan neidle dan neidle have highlight that the government own intention of rightly clamp down on tax avoidance will not be meet under the current plan which will impact far more small ordinary farm than the government have admit his proposal include an alternative suggestion for meet the government state aim of clamp down on tax avoidance not affect ordinary farmer too often we find that the greens talk good game but when it come to make decision whether on pylon or inheritance tax they begin to get little bit nervous so would be interested to know the hon gentleman view while he may have concern about the threshold that have be set for inheritance tax for farm where do he think it should be set first have welcome the measure in this budget on non dom and capital gain tax and have argue for the government to go much far and be much bold with genuine wealth tax on the very rich be very happy to set out the measure want which be bold than the government to raise capital on farm as say would urge the hon member and the minister to look at the work of people such as dan neidle which suggest way in which the government could well achieve their own stated aim of rightly prevent people who often have no interest in farming from invest in farmland in order to avoid inheritance tax speak to many farmer last week as be sure do members across the chamber and those with ordinary farm in my constituency tell that typical suffolk farm of acre may be worth million to million on paper but if they be always in the family if they be never sell and those farmer be earn very little income they be not realise the benefit of that the farmer speak to be extremely distressed about how much pressure they be under for generate very little income with all the work they do and want to do for our natural environment we need to look at the detail of what be be propose while welcome the main aim of clamp down on tax avoidance that the government be set out make these point conscious that the government choose to table an income tax charge motion on budget day thereby restrict scope for amendment to the bill today wish to put on record my disappointment at that decision because an amendment of the law motion would have demonstrate commitment to much broad debate great scrutiny and healthy willingness to engage with alterative view expect well on that as know do my constituent although will seek to amend the bill to take account of the compelling case for wealth tax the scope for do so have be deliberately and unnecessarily constrain by the government in what ruth fox of the hansard society call decision to prioritise ministerial control and convenience over robust parliamentary scrutiny before conclude my remark wish to mention one other aspect of the bill that relate to the urgent climate action we need to take that must be about scale up renewable but it be also about the transition away from fossil fuel hide in the bill and the budget be the government intension to subsidise carbon capture and storage fig leaf for new fossil fuel project and fail to end the obscene subsidy include tax relief that be hand out to the oil and gas sector hope to pick that up far and for it to get more scrutiny as the bill progress will the hon gentleman give way be about to finish in conclusion green mp will vote for the bill on the basis that we welcome number of improvement and investment we be constructive in support improvement that move in the right direction and the investment that have start in the nhs and want to see that commit to and expand for the nhs and social care in further year we look forward to further debate about how that can be strengthen to

enhance our financial market for too long the burden of taxation have fall disproportionately on work people the bill address that imbalance it find that balance and the fairest way to do it by choose

for many year with the appalling state of the road we all know about the dread pothole and the government be do what they can on that as well will not go on too much about the removal of the vat exemption on private school because spend lot of time talk about that on monday however be delighted that it will generate additional revenue to invest in our public service include our school number of school in harlow have suffer with reinforce autoclaved aerate concrete and one school sir frederick gibberd college be have to be completely rebuild because of the previous government failing this finance bill be more than just collection of tax adjustment it be forward look plan that lay the foundation for resilient economy it reflect the government commitment to support key industry that be vital to our nation invest in sector that promise sustainable growth and ensure that the uk remain at the forefront of global innovation it create fair and balanced future for all call the shadow minister it be pleasure to respond to the debate on behalf of his majesty loyal opposition it have be good debate with more than member contribute but be little surprised that we do not hear more from labour members want to defend their first budget for year some have now appear miraculously in the chamber but they be not here for the rest of the debate let start with the maiden speech from the hon member for south derbyshire samantha niblett join other in congratulate she on an excellent maiden speech be interested to hear about her tech background and the samantha spot map she mention the influence of her daughter family be important in overcome the instant loathing that some people can take to mps which she talk about in my experience it be not as bad as some might fear interruption that be just you special thank you we all appreciate the kind word from the hon member for south derbyshire about heather wheeler work be sure that the hon lady will continue that manufacturing event with rolls royce and the other world class business in her constituency know from personal experience that she will enjoy take part in the armed force parliamentary scheme with the raf there be familiar theme in the speech of other government members which the whip will have be pleased to hear with lot about fix the foundation and black hole although the hon member for macclesfield tim roca can not see he at the moment do concede that it be not perfect budget perhaps he have be take away by the whip to reflect turn to opposition members speech congratulate my hon friend the member for bognor regis and littlehampton alison griffiths who speak powerfully about the impact of the bill and the damaging impact of the budget on high street hospitality and family firm in her constituency my right hon friend the member for beverley and holderness graham stuart in masterly contribution take we back in his time machine to the time when cast iron promise be make he focus on what be happen in reality and the importance of enterprise he also highlight that economic shock may come as they have do in the last few year for example through covid and energy price and that the chancellor may have already box herself in my right hon friend the member for east hampshire damian hinds display his considerable knowledge as former education secretary he talk about care for of pupil and about the damaging impact that the education tax will have there will be serious consequence for small school religious school and parent and pupil involve with they that theme be also draw on by my hon friend the member for solihull west and shirley dr shastri hurst who talk about his constituent and put we in the footstep of the pupil who will be affect as well as their parent my hon friend the member for gordon and buchan harriet cross return to her consistent theme of the real world consequence for energy firm of the energy profit tax the lose revenue and the self defeat nature of that measure finally my hon friend and neighbour the member for broadland and fakenham jerome mayhew focus on young people employment prospect which will take hit as result of the bill there be two very different take in the debate unlike some would not claim to be an economist but the obr be full of they and its verdict on the budget and the finance bill be clear they mean low growth high inflation and high borrowing as the shadow chancellor my right hon friend the member for central devon mel stride put it the british people put their trust in labour to stay true to its promise what do they get in response finance bill that be stuff full of tax increase and break trust with the british people it have billion of annual tax rise it be the big tax raise budget in modern history and it be work family and business who will pay the price as we hear the government have say that their priority be growth we will not let they forget that they inherit an economy grow at the fast rate in the follow the budget the obr have downgrade its growth forecast for the period by inflation which go up to last week be now expect to be high in every year of the forecast period the tax burden will increase to the high level since record begin borrowing will increase by an additional billion over the parliament it be little wonder that business confidence be plummet the labour party have consistently talk our economy down the consequence be clear the late purchasing manager index output datum show that private sector activity have shrink for the first time in more than year business be rightly blame the chancellor and this anti aspiration anti enterprise government let turn to some of the part of this broken promise budget that be cover in the debate first the bill deliberately undermine incentive for investor entrepreneur and people willing to take risk and back enterprise it hike the main and low rate of capital gain tax the treasury state that this measure alone will hit over quarter of million people who will pay more tax as result it put up tax rate on investor relief it be little wonder that expert have warn that this government risk stymie the very investment that they seek to stimulate secondly the bill continue the fundamentalism of the government energy policy which fail to put our energy security first it will increase the energy profit levy to bring the headline rate on oil and gas activity to the exchequer secretary could not name country that have high rate be sure that denis healey would approve it extend the rate by year and remove investment allowance on the real world consequence offshore energies uk have say that the hike will choke off investment and put job at risk we should be maximise our home grow energy not undermine domestic production and rely on import that have high carbon footprint have highlight the government break promise turn to single promise that they be actually keep unfortunately the education tax for some who do not seem to understand the labour party be not end relief but bring in new tax it be vindictive tax be impose partway through the academic year deliberately design to disrupt the education of thousand of child put vat on independent school will particularly hurt parent on modest income who choose to save and send their child to school that they think be good for they more than child with special need who be without an education health and care plan and be in independent school will be hit by this charge something that government members who be not in their place at the moment do not seem to understand but really should this be an attack on aspiration pure and simple and we oppose it other hon member have refer to the family farm tax next week every member will have the opportunity to vote and show whether they stand with their farmer or with labour family farm tax which will do so much damage to our countryside and food security as mention the consistent theme in this debate from government members have be blame fantasy black hole for this tax increase bill those claim be thoroughly debunk by the obr and by the shadow chancellor in his opening remark before the election the chancellor say that she would not pretend to have not know the state of public finance in order to justify tax rise then she do just that let we hope that she mean what she say to the treasury committee on november we have now set the envelope for spend for this parliament and we be not go to be come back with more tax increase or indeed with more borrowing there we have it read her lip no more tax increase that be the commitment not to the confederation of british industry but to this house but at prime minister question today the prime minister fail to repeat that pledge he hang the chancellor out to dry if the chancellor break that promise how can she credibly continue in post labour inherit the fast grow economy in the inflation at target unemployment halve and the deficit halve labour members may not like it but it be true interruption it be absolutely true the measure in the bill do not boost growth but target work people pupil and parent small business and the wealth creator we need to grow the economy many government members have loyally clung to the idea that the government be fix the foundation of the economy not many would agree not tesco lidl or the other retailer who have warn that the billion year job tax will mean job loss and people weekly food shop go up not the two third of firm who say that they will scale back on take on new people not the pub bar restaurant and hospitality sector which be hit by an extra billion of cost the prime minister have find someone who agree with he although he do have to go to rio to do so however while president xi be so well practise in parrot meaningless slogan that he could be labour mp the british public and british business be not buy it they know that this government do not back enterprise and do not keep their promise the difference could not be clear we stand with work people people take risk to start business and take people on and people invest in company unlike the labour party we be on their side urge member to support our amendment tonight just as it be an honour to close the budget debate on behalf of the government it be an honour to close the debate on second reading of the finance bill the first finance bill by labour government in year thank hon member for their contribution and look forward to hear further contribution during the committee of the whole house and the bill remain passage alongside the exchequer secretary to the treasury before address the numerous point raise in the debate it be worth reflect briefly on the point make by the exchequer secretary in his opening remark on what the bill will achieve the bill legislate for key measure in the budget budget in which we take tough decision on tax spending and welfare to restore britain economic stability the bill deliver on our manifesto commitment and start the work of move to fair more sustainable tax system while raise the revenue need to adequately fund our public service the government have take balanced approach that will create fair system while still promote growth and wealth creation we be adjust the rate of capital gain tax for example tax pay by few than of adult every year to raise some of that revenue although rate have increase the government will maintain the uk position as have the low cgt of any european economy there be no change to cgt rate on property or the annual exempt allowance and there be phase increase to business asset disposal relief to give entrepreneur time to adjust that be just one of the many measure in the bill that will move we to fair system where those who can pay do pay interruption will get on to farmer hon member will be pleased to know congratulate my hon friend the member for south derbyshire samantha niblett on an excellent maiden speech she be absolutely an inspiration to her teenage daughter but also to young woman across the country include my daughter thank she for that we be very pleased to have she we need more people with career in tech in the house she be very welcome we also hear powerful contribution from my hon friend the members for darlington lola mcevoy for crewe and nantwich connor naismith for macclesfield tim roca for barking nesil caliskan for vale of glamorgan kanishka narayan for makerfield josh simons and for harlow chris vince pay particular tribute to my hon friend the member for york outer mr charters for his play on word as an english graduate always enjoy that and think he be excellent hon member have extensively discuss the agricultural property relief change announce in the budget and will note that they be not include in the bill that be because the government be commit to technical consultation on tax legislation we feel it be important to get complex legislation right and to give business and those affect by tax change the certainty that they need ahead of the measure come into force the government will publish draft legislation on this measure before legislate for it in future finance bill be grateful to the minister for make that point be there timetable attach to that that she could set out to this house many business will have listen to that statement and will want to know exactly when they need to make their business decision we will set out plan in due course the bill do however extend the scope of agricultural property relief from april to land manage under certain environmental agreement that support the uk government wide environmental objective of support farmer and land manager so that they can deliver alongside food production significant and important outcome for the climate and environment the measure be intend to prevent the loss of apr be barrier to the involvement of agricultural landowner and farmer in land use change under environmental agreement include but not limit to the environmental land management scheme in england and equivalent scheme elsewhere in the uk want to address something the hon member for st albans daisy cooper talk about family farm this be not in the finance bill but will still refer to it individual can pass on sum of up to inheritance tax free if that include residence be pass to direct descendent and million when tax free allowance be pass to surviving spouse or civil partner there be also full exemption from inheritance tax when pass asset to spouse or civil partner be grateful to the minister for give way madam deputy speaker beg for your patience as retread some of the remark make early it be my view that the family farm tax give we the bad of both world at the moment it do not prevent equity company from buy up land but it do treat family farm as collateral damage urge she to think again on this measure and think about introduce genuine family farm test if she be to do that she would certainly have the liberal democrats support it be difficult decision and understand the point the hon lady be make but the reform to agricultural property relief mean that farmer can access relief for the first million and relief thereafter mean an effective tax rate it be difficult decision but we have to do it to fund public service my hon friend the member for bolton west phil brickell talk about tax avoidance and fraud to stop people take unfair advantage of our system the government announce in the budget the most ambitious ever package to close the tax gap raise billion in additional tax revenue per year by will the minister give way the right hon gentleman have speak enough time in the debate so will not be take yet another intervention from he the hon member for bognor regis and littlehampton alison griffiths raise question about sme and high street the government have be absolutely clear that we need to take difficult decision to deliver long term stability and growth and that stabilise public finance be the only way to create long term stability in which business can thrive but we recognise the need to protect small employer which be why we have more than double employment allowance she may like to know that mean that half of business with mixed liability will either gain or see no change at all next year the right hon member for east hampshire damian hinds raise question about vat on private school hit send pupil to protect pupil with special educational need and disability who can only have their need meet in private school the local authority and devolve government that fund those place will be compensate for the vat they be charge on those pupil fee hope that reassure he the right hon gentleman also raise point about faith school of course the government value parental choice and recognise that some people want their child to be educate in school with particular faith ethos my hon friend the exchequer secretary meet the partnerships for jewish schools and the association of muslim schools during the consultation period on this policy to ensure fairness and consistency between all school that charge fee faith school will remain in the scope of the policy it be worth note for the right hon member that some faith school be likely to be less impact by the policy if some of their income be derive from voluntary donation from the community because donation that be freely give and for which there be no obligation be outside the scope of vat as such not all the income that small faith school receive will necessarily be subject to vat hope that reassure he bit thank the minister for give way want to ask she specifically about what she just say about special school still get funding be she aware that many parent of child with special educational need choose to send their child to special school even though they do not have education health and care plan so do not have fund through local authority and so will still be affect by this measure wonder what she think about that my hon friend the exchequer secretary say that he will write to the hon lady about this but we note the point that she have make and we be look into they the hon member for gordon and buchan harriet cross ask about oil and gas investment we recognise that oil and gas will continue to have role in the energy mix during the transition but we need to drive public and private investment towards clean energy the money raise by these change will contribute to public investment while the sector continue to benefit from in relief for every of private investment to reflect our commitment to facilitate clean home grow energy the government have confirm that the sector will continue to benefit from decarbonisation investment allowance with value similar to the relief that it receive prior to the november energy profit levy rate increase end by say that the bill deliver on key manifesto commitment from this labour government it provide stability it support business and it move we to fair more sustainable tax system for those reason commend it to the house question put that the amendment be make shockat

propose that this house do now wakeford the issue of sewage dumping in our waterway be one of the big concern of resident across my north cornwall constituency during the general election and judge by the number of member here today certainly be not alone in that in the course of my speech will take the opportunity first to highlight the scale of the problem of sewage dumping and its effect on our community secondly to set out what infrastructure improvement be badly need to tackle this scandal thirdly to outline some of the regulatory reform that be require and finally to outline what south west water must now do to end the scandal of constant sewage dumping in our beach and river north cornwall be very rural constituency we have several river include the camel the inny and the allen north cornwall be also bless with some of the most beautiful beach in the world include harlyn summerleaze widemouth bay daymer bay polzeath crackington and many more be extremely fortunate to grow up in cornwall where learn to swim and surf at these incredibly beautiful spot north cornwall family and resident young and old thoroughly enjoy the wave at mawgan porth the fishing village of padstow and port isaac and the breathtake cliff at tintagel they also enjoy the impressive sea pool in bude and boscastle the environment agency figure show that the total duration of sewage overflow discharge into local river and waterway in the south west region be hour which represent an increase compare with in natural england notify somerset council that the phosphate level in the somerset levels and moors ramsar site be too high and thousand of home be still catch in moratorium alongside this last year there be sewage spill in glastonbury and somerton make it the most polluted constituency in the country do my hon friend agree that water company should be invest in more sewage treatment plant and that the government should introduce sewage tax on water company profit absolutely agree on both of those point and shall address they in slightly more detail in moment in alone many of the blue flag beach in north cornwall experience more than hour of sewage discharge across separate incident this pollution as my hon friend have just mention be often link to combine sewer overflow which be activate during heavy rainfall to prevent urban flooding severely compromise water quality and endanger swimmer and marine life congratulate my hon friend on secure this debate he talk about storm overflow the datum record from storm overflow by south water west be sometimes different to that which appear on the water uk app do he agree that we need just one single reliable source for sewage outflow datum agree that we need one reliable source of datum and will come on to address that slightly later in my speech commend the hon member for bring forward this matter he refer to the fact that his mum and dad live in farm building and it be clear what the issue be there do he have the same problem as my constituent when it come to single house with septic tank the removal of sludge can be do only once year for disabled people and big family it be important to have it do twice year have he experience that issue in his own constituency have grow up in very rural area in north cornwall know that many of my constituent face that issue so thank the hon member for raise it to look beyond the shocking statistic for moment and properly understand the real impact that the issue be have on coastal community such as mine refer to three year old finley from widemouth bay this time last year finley mum take her son to widemouth bay to play on the north cornish beach later that day finley become extremely unwell and friend child who have be on the same beach at the same time have similar symptom of diarrhoea and vomiting which last for week just last week there be three sewage dump in widemouth bay tragically in just the few month since my election have lose count of the number of constituent who have write to or stop in the street to explain how they have stop swim or surf in our ocean for fear of get sick from the contaminate water cornwall be cover with sewage alert and proceeding have be take against south west water do the hon member agree that the new water review will be vital to reform regulation and infrastructure will address the water review in moment be pleased that the government be finally look at this issue in detail and crucially as the hon member say consulting which be so important as say have lose count of the constituent who have tell that they have stop swim or surf in our ocean for fear of get sick from the contaminate water imagine the immense effect of that on our tourist industry in cornwall and the south west which have be the envy of the country sewage spill be wreck not only our health but vital local business surfer against sewage have report large increase in report of people get ill after enter the water in the year to september there be report double the number in the previous year by september the number have rocket to it be with certain amount of trepidation that go surf at summerleaze beach in bude just day before the election not just because my right hon friend the member for kingston and surbiton ed davey be stand next to in wetsuit and wonder what stunt await but because there be visible sign of sewage dump from early that day it be not just our beach that bear the brunt of sewage dumping but our river just today natural england confirm that the river camel remain in an unfavourable condition and cornwall wildlife trust caution just this afternoon that our ecosystem and specie be in grave danger if we do not urgently put stop to this my constituency be little further north but still in the south west recently spend an afternoon with some environmental campaigner in tewkesbury testing and recording sample from the river avon for nitrate and phosphate pollution the amount of pollution be find to be very high in the former and high in the latter consistent with their finding since june do my hon friend agree that it be time to put environmental expert on water company board to hold they to account and ensure that environmental concern take precedence in the boardroom do agree with my hon friend be start to wonder whether hon member have see my speech because be come on to that how do we end this scandal despite the result of the parent company of south west water the pennon group for show that the group revenue have increase to million largely thank to high customer bill very little of that be spend on much need infrastructure upgrade to add insult to injury the company recently announce that south west water bill will rise by staggering by the year copy of pennon group five year business plan to seemingly describe the state of our waterway in parallel universe on page under the heading bathing water quality reference be make to deliver improvement at bath and shellfish water across the region to maintain our bathing water performance quick glance at the company own waterfit sewage app show there to be sewage dump at multiple beach across cornwall and the south west region today and quite likely as speak thank the hon member for secure this important debate sewage be massive issue across the south west and in dorset in particular and constant source of frustration for my constituent one issue that come up time and again be the excessive profit that private water company be make do he agree that it be time those company be bring back into public ownership will lay out some of my suggestion for water company reform shortly so will not give away any spoiler just yet it be well know that one of the big reason for sewage dumping be that there be not enough capacity in our storm overflow tank to hold rainwater to make sufficient capacity those tank be routinely empty and raw sewage be pump into our waterway soon after my election be face with report of brown water come out of resident tap in st eval and in some case no water at all it turn out that the reservoir tank at the nearby bears down reservoir have serious crack in it and water tanker be deploy to serve the area the capacity of the tanker be nowhere near sufficient and measly compensation of per household be issue after week of severe disruption similarly in week st mary resident complain to about problem with their water pressure which have persist for year in some case the sudden drop in pressure cause scolding from the result hot water it be quite clear that those issue have arise after decade of under investment in our water and wastewater infrastructure we may reasonably ask where have ofwat the water regulator be while all of this have be go on ofwat have seemingly be miss in action which bring to the urgent need for regulation revolution in our water industry welcome the government plan part of the water special measures bill to prohibit performance relate pay for senior official in year when water company fail to meet its environmental consumer or financial standard eagerly await how those standard will be more tightly define be more suspicious however about the proposal to require each water company to publish an annual plan detail how it will reduce pollution incident many water company already do that and my constituent want to know how those company with their glossy brochure and ambitious target will be hold to account there be palpable sense of relief among senior executive at south west water when meet they soon after the detail of the bill be publish on enforcement measure if the water company fail to meet improvement target ofwat will be give the power to issue fine it be questionable whether fine will incentivise firm that be make hundred of million of pound and again look forward to see at what level the penalty will be set follow the consultation my hon friend be make an excellent case certainly in my own constituency far west than his own in west cornwall and the isles of scilly there have be discharge around the coast just in the past day on the propose change in the government consultation as attractive as the concept of bring water back into public ownership be and strongly support it the consequence and cost make it rather challenging the conservatives set up the company as risk free money make emporium do he agree that we need to bring in regulation that ensure they be govern in the public interest my hon friend make good point and will outline some of the measure will put to the minister urge the government to go much far by scrap ofwat which have prove itself to be toothless and miss in action the liberal democrats would replace ofwat with much more powerful clean water authority which could ban bonus for water company boss who fail to stop sewage dumping revoke licence of poorly perform water company immediately force water firm to publish the full volume and scale of their sewage dumping mandate local environmental expert to sit on water company board and set legally bind target on sewage discharge thank the hon member for give way and for bring this debate before the house on the question of public ownership do he think that the independent commission on the water sector regulatory system might be well off if it be task with at least consider how public ownership of water company might work rather than the current situation in which this supposedly independent commission have be ban from consider one of the possible solution to the problem the hon member raise an important point about independence as be cover briefly early that consultation will be very important part of this process lib dem amendment have recently be table in the other place to empower the regulator to revoke water company licence in the face of repeat failure and crucially to make it criminal offence for water company to fail to implement pollution reduction plan hold senior manager personally and criminally liable in the last parliament my liberal democrat colleague in this place also table an amendment to the victims and prisoners bill that would have create sewage illness victim compensation scheme under that scheme where medical evidence be provide to support claim proper compensation would be payable by water company to their victim such as three year old finley and his family take this opportunity to plead with the minister on behalf of all my constituent to seriously consider these measure so that water company be finally hold accountable with no more excuse and no more delay pick up on point make by my hon friend the member for honiton and sidmouth richard foord early edms not electronic dance music or early day motion but event duration monitor that be fit to storm overflow tank only measure the number and duration of spill not the volume there have also be report of fault with those edms which could represent serious under reporting of sewage spill significantly skew the datum that could mean that the situation be far bad than we think whatever enforcement approach be take by the government against water company the accuracy of the datum will be crucial so ask the minister to please consider the accuracy of the current monitoring system when take my seat in this place promise my constituent that would always speak truth to power in previous career advise business and their leader if could offer some advice here and now to the chief executive of south west water would say please do the decent thing and go now in what other universe could chief executive preside over such record of abject failure with ms davy have be the chief finance officer since and then the chief executive since almost year of fail leadership have bring we to this diabolical situation how on earth can anyone now have confidence that south west water will miraculously turn thing around in the next five year ms davy decline to take bonus last year instead add that bonus amount to her base salary which at last count be whopping before member start worry about south west water shareholder they too be award generous dividend of per share this be all while water bill be rocket child be get severely sick as result of that greed and people everywhere be too afraid to enjoy the beach and river that make cornwall and the wide south west so uniquely special as society at what point do we come together and say that this have to stop for the sake of our child and the sake of we all well humbly suggest that that point have now long pass thank the hon member for north cornwall ben maguire for secure this important debate and everybody who have intervene may also express my support and sympathy for finley it be awful to hear about child become ill when they be just enjoy the thing that we enjoy so much as child be genuinely sorry to hear about that as have say before the amount of sewage in our waterway be unacceptable clearly unacceptable for too long the level of pollution in our river lake and sea have be leave unchecked the south west of england with its mile of coastline be bless with some of the most stunning waterway in the country and it be of course vital that we protect these natural asset south west water environmental performance be clearly not good enough it continue to be rat as require improvement in the environment agency environmental performance assessment and it have the high rate of incident on its network in the sector so far as the hon gentleman say there have be pollution incident in his constituency and they be clearly unacceptable where company have fail in their statutory duty to maintain their asset properly and protect the local environment regulator will take appropriate enforcement action the environment agency have inform that charge against south west water currently await court hearing and many of they relate to discharge in north cornwall of course it be inappropriate for to comment far on these while those proceeding be ongoing however be reassure that the new power in the water special measures bill include those relate to the monitoring of emergency overflow quite enjoy the idea that we could call edms electronic dance music instead and maybe that be what will be think of in the future will assist the environment agency with workload and efficiency relate to these type of offence two new dedicated inspection team have be in place since october this year once officer be train the annual number of inspection in the region will double from the they will carry out this year think that be positive action that have be take by the environment agency look forward south west water be take action to deliver necessary improvement subject to ofwat final determination it be plan to invest about million over the next five year to reduce sewage spill by from current level it be also aim to cut pollution incident by and invest million to reduce nutrient pollution in river this investment will mean clean river sea and lake across the country be keep an eye on the time this time madam deputy speaker on storm overflow guidance in support of the forward investment to reduce pollution incident on november the government launch consultation on update information and guidance for the management and regulation of storm overflow infrastructure in england document will be publish shortly afterwards to ensure that water company have clear forward framework to guide investment in storm overflow improvement the government have also intervene to increase the transparency of pollution incident to enable the public and the regulator to well hold water company to account we have include duty in the water special measures bill to require all water and sewerage undertaker to produce annual pollution incident reduction plan along with an accompany implementation report the chief executive will be personally responsible for approve both the pollution incident reduction plan and the accompany document on the national storm overflow hub the government have legislate to require water company to publish all discharge datum from storm overflow in real time the hon member for honiton and sidmouth richard foord mention the need to have one reliable source of datum which be incredibly important water uk launch its national storm overflow hub last friday if hon member have not have chance to look at it please do on transparency it be very good in make we angry about pollution incident it be maybe not so good however we can see where company be discharge all around the country how long they have be discharge for and whether they be online or offline for transparency it be huge step forward although be not from the south west have the beautiful river wharfe flow through my constituency of shipley until now we have be rely for transparency on top of the poops which show that there be over overflow of sewage pollution last year do the minister agree that these be national problem and we really need to tackle this not only with south west water but with the like of yorkshire water to make sure these sewage outflow stop in future agree entirely with my hon friend and commend she for come and raise that point completely support she be aware of the new storm overflow hub that the minister talk about my point be that sometimes the datum that the new hub reveal be different to the datum that the water company be reveal on their app such as the south west water waterfit app that be discover by constituent of mine in relation to sidmouth last weekend be more than happy to look into any anomaly so if member want to send through detail of where there seem to be discrepancy in the datum can pick that up south west water have bathing water and be hop that the hon member for north cornwall will be pleased not only with our bathing water announcement on remove strict automatic de designation and remove fix date but also that we be redefine the term bath perhaps to include people who go surf hear that he be interested in surf that will enable more people to enjoy the water environment at the moment the term bather refer to people who swim but we know that so many more people enjoy our beautiful water on november defra jointly with the welsh government announce consultation on package of potential reform to bathing water regulation and those change will modernise the system to meet the need of the public the government have be clear that there be no excuse for poor performance and we will not look the other way while company routinely fail to meet agree standard water company must take seriously their role in meet public expectation and regulatory requirement hold they to account when they fail let recap our three stage approach to fix the water industry in the first week of the new labour government the secretary of state and meet water company to secure agreement to amend their article of association funding for vital infrastructure investment be ringfence so that that money can not go on bonus we see evidence of that just last week that money be for infrastructure improvement there be new customer on the panel of water company as we be look at change the culture and give customer voice and we be also strengthen protection and compensation for household the most significant increase in enforcement power for regulator in decade have come from the water special measures bill which will arrive in the house for second reading before christmas be sure will see many face in that debate those power include provide ofwat with power to ban bonus enable regulator to issue automatic and severe fine for wrongdoing and there be also duty on ofwat to fulfil its environmental duty and legal requirement the bill will strengthen cost recovery power to ensure that water company bear the cost of enforcement activity the independent commission have be mention few time and it be need to reform the whole water system as we know the system have develop incrementally since privatisation do not think anybody here think it be system that we would wish to design in the way it have evolve the call for public evidence will come in january and as have do before urge every member across the house to get involve in that and find some evidence thank the hon member for north cornwall ben maguire for secure this important debate many of the point that have be raise this evening be issue we have all experience but have find that south west water communication and engagement with its customer have be atrocious over recent month what more can the government do to ensure that south west water properly engage with its customer apologise to the hon gentleman for have to rearrange our meeting yesterday as be visit flooded area we will get that meeting back in the diary quickly he be right to raise that issue as it be one of the reason why we want to put customer representation on the water board and give customer that strong voice be more than happy to follow that issue up with the hon gentleman and see what more can do to support he it be incredibly important that customer be treat with the respect they deserve and if water company be not do that be more than happy to follow it up rise have two minute leave so will quickly finish if hon member do not mind the commission will be lead by sir jon cunliffe support by expert adviser who will be announce shortly it will be wide range and report to the government in the second quarter of the recommendation be intend to inform future legislation to deliver long term reform to clean up pollution and return the sector to stability across england and wales include of course the south west be grateful for all the contribution to the debate this be really important issue reiterate the government commitment to drive meaningful long term improvement in the performance and culture of the water industry we be committed to improve the health of our river lake and sea across england and the south west look forward to work with all hon member who be interested in fulfil that ambition with we question put and agree to house adjourn
