efficiency in home and cut bill over the past few week have be inundate with question from the people of winchester about the cut in the winter fuel allowance and it seem as though people from all part of the house be get similar correspondence although totally understand that there be many wealthy pensioner who do not rely on the winter fuel allowance to heat their home large proportion of pensioner live on or near the poverty line and will be plunge into crisis this winter give the huge strength of feeling in all part of the house will the chancellor reconsider her decision if not will she at least commit to vote and debate in the house about how we well protect our most vulnerable order sorry have to get through the order paper put in for an adjournment debate minister think you get the gist thank the hon member for his comment but as my right hon friend the chancellor set out the state pension be more this year than it be last year thank to the triple lock we have commit to maintain the triple lock as the foundation of state support for pensioner throughout the rest of this parliament energy bill be low this year it be crucial that he and other member across the house support our goal to increase the take up of pension credit if we make sure that all pensioner who be eligible for pension credit take it up they will thereby receive the other benefit include the winter fuel payment to which they be entitle call the shadow minister during the general election the labour party commit to bring down energy bill by now that the election be over energy bill be go up by some on behalf of the british electorate especially the million pensioner who be have their winter fuel payment take away ask the minister to confirm to the house that the cut be still labour policy if it be specifically how be the calculate and when will it be deliver thank the shadow minister for his comment and welcome he to his new place he refer to the cost of energy as we know the cost of energy be substantially low than it be this time last year but we be under no illusion about how much more we need to do to make sure that energy bill be truly affordable and that we tackle the cost of living crisis that be why we have set to work straight away in establish great british energy alongside our national wealth fund which will help to invest in the clean energy source of the future and bring down energy bill for good call the lib dem spokesperson we know that the government have inherit mess and that at the centre of that mess be billion hole leave in the public finance by the previous government but that can not be allow as cover for measure that cause suffer for the most vulnerable in society the chancellor will have hear lib dem colleague talk about the hardship that the scrapping of the winter fuel allowance will mean for their constituent so can she assure we that she will give her full support to measure to boost the uptake of pension credit most crucially will she give the house the opportunity to have proper debate and vote on this cut which will have such an impact on so many thank the liberal democrat spokesperson for her comment and for recognise the state of the finance that we inherit the billion in year black hole that we need urgently to address to put our finance on firm footing it be essential to boost the uptake of pension credit as the chancellor set out some pensioner who be eligible for pension credit be not take it up we see lack of action under the previous government to drive up that uptake and we be oversee campaign across government to increase the number of pensioner who access pension credit and thereby the winter fuel payment welcome that response but if the government be ask we all to make difficult sacrifice people need to know that the government be make the vital investment that will protect the vulnerable and help to deliver economic growth do the chancellor agree that now be the time to work across government to launch an emergency home energy upgrade programme to provide free insulation and heat pump for low income household crucial part of the manifesto commitment that we bring into government be to increase the insulation of up to million home across the country we will set out further detail of our plan for insulation in due course but we know that that be the kind of investment that bring down energy bill for good living standards what step she plan to take to help improve living standard what step she plan to take to help improve living standard what step she plan to take to help improve living standard the government be focus on improve living standard across the country which be why growth be key priority if real household disposable income per capita have grow from to at the same rate as it do between and it would have be high last year this government approach will centre on foster good work the government will reform employment support to offer more people dignity and purpose in meaningful employment the plan to make work pay set out significant and ambitious agenda to ensure that workplace right be fit for the modern economy and to empower work people and deliver economic growth we have launch ministerial taskforce on child poverty and update the low pay commission remit to consider the cost of live when make recommendation on the national living wage thank the minister for that reply many of my blackpool south constituent have contact regard the means testing of winter fuel allowance and the link to pension credit there be probably thousand in my constituency who do not receive pension credit and be potentially miss out on year what step be the government take to ensure that all pensioner in my constituency and across the country receive what they be entitle to welcome my hon friend to his place he be absolutely right to highlight how important it be to make sure that all those who be eligible for pension credit but be not claim it sign up and thereby receive the benefit to which they be entitle which now include the winter fuel payment the government be undertake new campaign to drive take up and the department for work and pensions be hold pension credit week of action in the first week of september when promotional activity will be support by organisation include age uk and local authority there will be further action in the come month include on tv in the press and on radio and we will be write directly to up to pensioner who receive housing benefit but be not claim pension credit to encourage claim where they may be eligible the economic chaos of previous conservative governments push up interest rate cause mortgage cost to rise by month for family in barnet what step be the chancellor take to bring down those rate so that family who have work hard and save hard can get the living standard boost that they so desperately need welcome my hon friend to his place as he rightly point out the recklessness of the previous government have have direct impact on his constituent living standard as new government we recognise that many household right across the country have face high mortgage cost in recent year and we be already take action to fix britain economic foundation with new approach to growth with the three pillar of stability investment and reform sustainable public finance be necessary for economic stability and long term growth the government will therefore set out the difficult decision need to secure the public finance in the budget on october in north warwickshire and bedworth like in the constituency of my hon friend the member for chipping barnet dan tomlinson monthly mortgage cost rise by an average of in the year follow the previous government disastrous mini budget that make life really difficult for hard work family in my constituency what step be the chancellor take to ensure that such devastating situation can never happen again to family in my constituency and across the country welcome my hon friend to her place she be absolutely right to highlight just how much damage the conservatives recklessness in cause to family in north warwickshire and beyond the decision of conservative ministers unleash economic turbulence that push up people mortgage and make people across britain bad off our new government will hardwire budget responsibility into government with our new fiscal lock in the budget responsibility bill which will make sure that the disaster we see nearly two year ago can never happen again the live standard of nearly pensioner in malvern hills district and wychavon district be go to deteriorate very sharply this winter in the face of increase in their energy bill and no winter fuel allowance many of those pensioner have income just above the pension credit threshold and many be too frail and too old to work yet within the first few day of come into office the chancellor manage to spend over billion very quickly by set up great british energy and national wealth fund and by give in to the pay demand of her party union paymaster be it not the case that this chancellor have make the chilling political choice to balance the book of this country on the very frailest shoulder be disappointed that the hon member be talk down essential investment that we have make in our country future she also seem to be confuse there be billion black hole because of the unfunded spending commitment make by the conservative party when it be in government but she make an important point about protect pensioner which be why it be so important to ensure that all those pensioner who be eligible for pension credit take it up and look forward to her support in make sure that they do so statistic from the trussell trust publish today show that half of people on universal credit run out of money and could not afford to buy food before the end of the month what prospect do those people have of an increase in their living standard the reintroduction of the household support fund be welcome but what step be the treasury take to make sure that people do not go hungry this winter as the hon member rightly point out the government be provide million to extend the household support fund in england for another six month and that will include barnett consequential that be an important measure to help people in the month ahead but the crucial way to increase people living standard and tackle the cost of live crisis in the long term be to get the economy grow we have speak at length about the measure that we have already take as new government from plan reform and the national wealth fund to great british energy all that be about get the economy grow because that be the sustainable way to make people well off and to invest in our public service mean test the winter fuel payment increase the burden on many vulnerable people and reduce their living standard unlike the scottish government who have many statutory constraint on their budget the chancellor fiscal rule be entirely self impose do the minister think that stick to the chancellor fiscal rule be more important than the health and wellbeing of pensioner let be clear if we do not have fiscal responsibility if we do not stick to fiscal rule we will lack the economic stability that be so crucial to get the economy grow and ensure that people across britain be well off we must return stability and fiscal responsibility to our country follow the conservative government record we see what happen when they lose control of the public finance and make unfunded spending commitment we need to ensure that that never happen again which be why we be hardwire fiscal responsibility into the future of government through our new budget responsibility bill economic growth what progress she have make on increase economic growth what progress she have make on increase economic growth sustained economic growth be the only route to improve the prosperity of our country and the living standard of work people that be why we have already take number of action to begin deliver on our growth mission the no priority of this new labour government which include series of planning reform to get britain building the establishment of national wealth fund to bring in private sector investment the announcement of pension review to unlock growth boost investment and deliver well return to pensioner the launch of skills england and the announcement of the forthcoming white paper on get britain work again this government be determined to boost growth and improve living standard and by do so to have the money that we need to fund our vital public service the delivery of so much of what the chancellor describe run through local government what progress have be make on give local council long term funding settlement my hon friend be absolutely right to make that point the government be commit to deliver long term certainty for local authority as part of our wide commitment to more empowered accountable and sustainable local government system that will support strong public service in all our community the government will set out further detail on our plan for local government funding in the upcoming budget and spending review on october this year alone two more high street bank branch have close in monmouthshire bring the total to eight in the past two year my constituent now find themselves struggle to access basic banking service particularly in caldicot be recently hand petition that have be sign by more than constituent be sure that the chancellor understand the importance of high street banking not only to our constituent but to local business and local economic growth what progress have she make in her work with colleague in the welsh government to support high street bank and hub in monmouthshire and across wales welcome my hon friend to her place it be already obvious that she will be strong voice for the people of monmouthshire in our party manifesto we commit to roll out banking hub in community like those she speak about which have lose multiple bank in the past few year the economic secretary to the treasury will happily meet my hon friend to work on achieve one such banking hub in her constituency that be an offer to member right across the house so many of our constituency have lose bank branch in the past few year for old people small business and family the lack of access to cash can be devastating and we be determined to reverse it with the roll out of the new banking hub growth and additional runway capacity at gatwick be again on the agenda my constituent who work at that airport and those who fly from there benefit from its stability and reach but it need to be recognise that any expansion of flight require careful balance between additional home and job will the chancellor confirm that suitable growth will not come at the expense of community such as mine without proper consultation and acknowledgement of its impact thank the hon lady for that question this government be pleased to sign off the expansion of london city airport because we recognise how important aviation be to our economy get growth and investment into the uk of course it be right that we always take local view into account and make sure that any investment in or expansion of airport come with the infrastructure that be need for local community but the answer to decision whether on road rail energy or aviation can not always be no if it be we will continue with the situation we face over the past year low growth deteriorate living standard and worsen public infrastructure we can not continue like that as see it the taxpayer be now accountable to the state the state be not accountable to the taxpayer and think that lot of our lack of growth be root in the fact that many of our office run by the state be not work and be actually strangle our economy would like to know what the chancellor be go to do to ensure that government be as accountable to the taxpayer as the taxpayer be to government that be the purpose of election and at the last election this government achieve sizeable majority for our mission include grow the economy improve living standard and make work people well off we have just get start and that be what we be absolutely determined to do in order to deliver on the mandate we get on july call the shadow minister the institute of directors late economic confidence index show that optimism about the economy fall back to minus last month follow three year high of plus in july can the chancellor explain how labour tax rise on work people business and pensioner will contribute to economic growth when the economy be already go backwards under this labour government thank the hon gentleman for that question think on october we be host an international investment summit welcome to london some of the big investor in the world in the two month that have be in this role have meet over business leader talk to they about the huge opportunity to invest in our great country include in life science financial service the creative industry and low carbon technology the opportunity be endless and this government be determined to work with business to ensure that we bring good job investment and prosperity right across the united kingdom topical questions if she will make statement on her departmental responsibility this government have inherit billion black hole in the public finance and rectify the situation require tough choice we will also clamp down on egregious spending and halve government spending on consultancy which will save million next year increase consultancy spend have be rife across government for the past four year it be up at the department for transport at the foreign commonwealth and development office and staggering at the home office it be no wonder taxis be so high and public service be so poor when the last government fritter away taxpayer money with no concern will treat taxpayer money with respect and we will fix the foundation of our economy so that we can rebuild britain and make work people well off welcome the chancellor to her place notwithstanding what she have just say can she tell the house why she have make the political decision to scrap the commitment to spend at least of gdp on defence undermine our support for ukraine and have instead prioritise give her union paymaster inflation bust pay rise that have only lead to more union call for more strike and more pay let respond directly on the issue of ukraine in my first couple of week in this job have the pleasure of meeting minister marchenko from ukraine and make commitment to he to go ahead with the extraordinary revenue acceleration programme it be important that we work together across the house to support the ukrainian people against the russian invasion in the previous parliament labour always support the government when they take action to support the ukrainian people and hope that that cross party support can continue can remind everybody that this be topical question have big list to get through rachael maskell will give we good example in york the average rent rise of exceed the state pension rise by this year with the loss of the cost of living payment and winter fuel payment and the increase in the energy price cap and cost of living pensioner be frightened about how they be go to keep warm this winter as be in change the eligibility for the winter fuel payment how will my right hon friend protect pensioner above the pension credit threshold to prevent cold ill health or worse this winter the basic state pension be worth more than it be year ago and will go up again in april next year because of the triple lock which we have commit to for the duration of this parliament we have already write to york council and be work with local authority across the country to boost take up of pension credit because this government unlike the last government be determined to ensure that people entitle to pension credit actually receive it call the shadow chancellor of the exchequer when the chancellor be sit on the opposition benches she repeatedly attack cronyism so will she tell the house whether she tell the treasury permanent secretary that ian corfield have make donation to she before she get he appoint as director in the treasury yes or no all government appoint people to the civil service the donation from ian corfield be declare over year ago in the proper way and we answer all the question in the right way that the civil service ask when we make that appointment ian corfield be support this government in host the international investment summit which will bring hundred of global investor to the uk next month think that mean the answer be no the ministerial code state minister must ensure that no conflict arise or could reasonably be perceive to arise between their public duty and their private interest financial or otherwise that do not happen will the right hon lady tell the house why cronyism be wrong under the conservatives but acceptable under labour the right hon gentleman have bit of brass neck criticise this government after the appointment and the partying at downing street that we see under the last conservative government and the billion of pound worth of contract hand out to friend and donor of the conservative party that be why this government be appoint covid corruption commissioner to get that money back for taxpayer because unlike the last government we be determined that taxpayer money be treat with respect and not hand out to donor of the party age uk report that there be around million pensioner who just miss out on the winter fuel payment these be people live on modest income within of the poverty line who will miss out due to tiny occupational pension and they include many in liverpool wavertree we have hear about the campaign to take up pension credit but can my right hon friend tell we specifically whether that pension credit will be backdate yes absolutely pension credit can be backdate by up to three month and we will ensure that that happen we be also work closely with liverpool city council to ensure that the constituent in liverpool wavertree and indeed in all our constituency be get the support that they entitle to the poor pensioner who be entitle to pension credit should get it it be travesty that miss out under the last conservative government we will ensure that pensioner entitle to support get it it be estimate that the bank of england will require furth billion of taxpayer subsidy to cover long bond sale loss through to so why be the chancellor clobber pensioner to save billion year when she could be challenge the bank of england to save ten of billion of pound year before become member of parliament be an economist at the bank of england and respect the independence of the bank of england the previous government undermine that independence that contribute to the economic chaos that we see under the last conservative government this government will never go down that route will the chancellor of the exchequer confirm that her decision be target at win new investment in green industry in place such as billingham in my constituency welcome my hon friend to this house because he bring great deal of expertise on green steel from his previous career this government plan to launch the national wealth fund be precisely to create investment across the country in some very important strategic industry and that include decarbonisation of steel and the steel industry the prospect of the financial collapse of major utility company such as thames water should cause we all grave concern give not only what it would mean for consumer in my constituency and many constituency like it but the wide implication it would carry for our economy and the government finance do the chancellor therefore agree that put thames water into special administration and reform it would protect not just consumer include my constituent but the wide economy water company be commercial entity it would therefore not be appropriate for to comment on that it be for the company and its investor to resolve their possible issue for decade member of the mineworker pension scheme in cannock chase and across the country have see billion go to successive government with an average of scheme member pass away every day resolution can not come too soon what progress have be make on transfer the government share of the mps investment reserve to scheme member champion this issue in the last parliament as chair of the business and trade committee be pleased to confirm that be work with colleague across government to make progress and will update the house far in due course story of crumble public infrastructure be all too common stepping hill hospital in hazel grove have have to close building because their condition be no long deem safe and we have see footage of medic have to wade through flood corridor when pipe have burst the allocate capital money simply can not cover the repair backlog how will the chancellor ensure that hospital such as stepping hill can access the capital investment they need both to repair crumble building and to deliver additional site where need the government be review the new hospital programme as part of our spending review we will undertake full and comprehensive review while continue to deliver the most advanced and most urgent hospital in realistic timeframe the letter from the cabinet secretary to the former chancellor that emerge this morning clearly state that the failure by the last government to hold spending review follow the unexpected national and global pressure significantly contribute to the fiscal challenge that the labour government inherit what can the chancellor learn from this the conservative party crash the economy and then wreck the public finance leave we with billion black hole the shadow chancellor be not willing to be straight about the damage he do and be now try to pass the buck to independent civil servant will always be honest about the public finance and take the tough decision that we need to fix the foundation of our economy in july borrowing stand at billion well ahead of the obr forecast of billion do the chancellor agree that she could have reduce the national debt have she choose not to reward her trade union paymaster by spend billion on inflation bust pay rise as the hon gentleman know government borrowing be run at billion high than the obr forecast because the previous government make unfunded commitment without any idea of how they be go to be pay for the previous government set the mandate for the independent pay review body and we have honour the recommendation of those body to ensure that our armed force our police officer our nurse and our teacher get pay rise think that be the right thing to do if he do not wonder how he justify that to public sector worker in his constituency do the minister share my concern about report of trade union victimisation at hmrc benton park view office in newcastle where three public and commercial services union rep have already be dismiss and more face live disciplinary proceeding be pleased to welcome those three rep to parliament today will the minister agree to meet they and the pcs about this worrying situation as ministers we greatly value and respect trade union and the work of trade union representative in support their member while it be not appropriate for to comment on individual case will look into this matter far and respond to my hon friend in due course the chancellor decision to cut the winter fuel payment be forecast to save billion can she advise the house what other option she consider for make saving in the department for work and pensions budget before decide to make this cut the black hole we inherit be billion we announce in the statement on july billion of saving to reduce the size of that black hole but the hon gentleman can see there be still work to be do and we will be set out further measure in the budget on october to get grip of the public finance forthcoming transparency international report have identify contract worth billion that be award to party with direct political connection to the conservative party so can the chancellor update we on the progress in appoint the covid corruption commissioner and whether they will take evidence from corruption campaigner such as transparency international we be appoint fix term covid fraud commissioner through an open competition that be now run as of this morning the commissioner will make sure everything be do to return money owe to the taxpayer it will report to the chancellor work with the secretary of state for health and social care and will report to parliament in due course the economic potential of the brigg and immingham constituency and the wide humber region be heavily dependent on the renewable energy sector however there be cloud on the horizon with the future of scunthorpe steelwork in doubt can the chancellor give an assurance that if there be redundancy at scunthorpe there will be generous package of support for worker and investment through the local authority to redevelop the area the hon gentleman speak powerfully about the huge opportunity at immingham and on the whole east coast through renewable energy and carbon capture and storage part of the reason for the national wealth fund be to invest in industry such as ccs but also in our crucial steel sector which be important to so many of the other government ambition on grow our economy we be determined to support the steel sector through that investment from the national wealth fund the chancellor plan for growth be welcome in cornwall but in the meantime we be rely upon share prosperity fund and town deal money the deadline for the completion of those scheme be march and march to ensure that investment be not lose will the chancellor consider extend the deadline for completion of those scheme by up to month thank my hon friend for that question and welcome she to her place she speak powerfully on behalf of the people of cornwall the spending review will be the appropriate time to look at the share prosperity fund and what resource we can give to the people of cornwall and be sure my hon friend will work with the relevant secretaries of state to ensure those representation be hear the chancellor would have know in advance of the cut to the winter fuel payment and the stripping of million from pensioner in scotland that scottish pensioner suffer the low temperature rural scottish pensioner live in some of the old house on these island and most scottish pensioner in rural area be off the gas grid know that what discussion do she have with her new scottish labour mps about push scottish pensioner into fuel poverty would just note that the scottish government have decide to mirror what the wide uk government be do rather than use the tax power that they have that be decision the scottish government have make give the fiscal situation they face we face similar issue with billion black hole in the public finance welcome this government plan to get britain build again with commitment to build million home across our country there be also million home for which council have give planning consent and those with skin in the game need help and support to get those house unlocked what step be the government take in that regard thank my hon friend for the question and welcome he to his place as former local government leader he know the huge opportunity there be to build the home our country desperately need we have make commitment to build million home during the duration of this parliament that will require make choice to call in planning decision as we have already do in our first week in office with regard to four specific housing development thousand of pensioner in my constituency have work hard all their life and be now worried at the prospect of lose their winter fuel payment upon which they rely will the right hon lady reconsider and reverse her decision the increase in the basic state pension mean those constituent be well off than they be year ago and of course energy bill be low this year than they be last year but it be important that we ensure that the people who miss out on pension credit under the previous conservative government now get access to that support because they be the poor pensioner and at the moment they be live in poverty because the previous government fail to sign they up to pension credit as departments be prepare their spending review submission will the chancellor and her team consider allow the international development budget to be on the same footing as the research and development budget and look at over year so that we can get back to the figure will she be willing to meet and delegation to discuss the benefit of that approach to such an important budget the government spending review be currently under way all decision on official development assistance spending will be take in the round as part of that process would be delighted to meet my hon friend

suffering and devastation that hear about from family who have be tear apart and child who be on the brink of starvation have be etch in my memory we now have confirmation that the senseless war between the sudanese armed forces and the rapid support forces have bring famine to sudan in the zamzam internally displace people camp in northern darfur which host more than half million people people be die from starvation every day we have to be clear that these condition exist across sudan we should be discuss more damning assessment today but sustained tactic of deny access to the hard hit area of the country be make many people and their suffering invisible the famine face sudan be almost entirely man make and direct consequence of the deliberate effort by both war party to block aid get to those most in need the war party must remember their obligation under international humanitarian law access must not be arbitrarily deny and starvation must not be use as weapon of war the uk welcome the decision to reopen the adre border crossing for humanitarian assistance for three month this move if conduct in good faith could save thousand of life the saf must act to remove any unnecessary restriction on truck move through adre and the rsf must urgently facilitate movement into area under their control without that lifesave aid will be block from access those most in need last month announce an additional million of vital assistance to sudan south sudan and chad to support vulnerable people force to flee violence and seek safety with that announcement the uk have almost double its oda to sudan to million this financial year most of which be vital humanitarian aid the uk also welcome effort by the us saudi arabia and switzerland to bring the war party to the negotiating table last month but we remain deeply concerned that the saf do not take the opportunity to act in the good interest of the people they claim to represent and refuse to attend the talk in person the war party must do everything in their power to ensure that this wholly unjustified war end immediately we continue to call upon the rsf to implement the commitment make in the jeddah

with the war party what progress have there be on initiate follow up to last month unsuccessful effort to bring the sudanese armed force to the table the us special envoy tom perriello have be work hard try to make progress but what role be the uk government play it be welcome that the adre crossing have open and that there be some improvement in humanitarian access but the uk have key role to play in bring donor together for sudan what plan do the uk government have to convene influential regional player such as the african union the united arab emirates and saudi arabia give that our extensive excellent diplomatic network can make such an important difference overall what strategy do the uk government have to counteract the grow influence in the region of russia which be foment conflict both in sudan and in nearby country such as libya to gain access to red sea and mediterranean port and to encourage migration pattern such as those that we have see be grateful for the hon lady commitment to the issue and for her incredibly important question she give the figure for those who have be displace indeed sudan be the world large displacement crisis in absolute term of course some of those individual have be displace before when be in south sudan talk to those who have previously leave south sudan because it be so unsafe go into sudan and then be force back to south sudan

together to ensure that other regional actor be bring in to push forward peace the ceasefire that be so desperately need and the humanitarian access that be need of course there be also the negative the possibility of other country become involve in the conflict and worsen it the uk government be clear that any measure of engagement with the war party that be not focus on humanitarian access or peace will only prolong this devastating war which be lead to so much death and destruction this be one of the world bad conflict and humanitarian disaster but sadly it receive so little of our attention so welcome the urgent question and the minister response praise the effort of the british embassy in exile in addis it be clear that we need long term strategy to end the fighting and begin political settlement what plan do the minister have to send uk personnel back to sudan when the time be right perhaps base in port sudan until return to khartoum be possible be grateful to my hon friend for raise this issue the staff from the uk embassy that be previously in sudan show the good of uk government there be no question about that they be place in truly horrendous terrifying

humanitarian assistance they just reannounce previous commitment will the minister tell the house what extra support the new government will provide give that the conference raise only half of what be need the case for even more uk aid be clear we need to play our part in secure path to peace in sudan as whole give the uk role as the penholder at the un what specific action be be take to prevent the supply of arm by neighbouring country we hear the distressing news that slave market have open outside khartoum what action be be take to prevent human trafficking during the conflict be grateful

prevention datum be grateful to my hon friend for mention this area in which she have great expertise we be deeply concerned about the escalation of conflict relate sexual violence in sudan since the outbreak of the conflict in april as she and other in the house will be well aware there be report of this issue for example rape case be report from april to august that be likely to be massive underestimate of the situation on the ground disturbingly woman and girl be subject to sexual violence in internally displace person camp at checkpoint when travel in their own home and when try to get firewood or desperately try to get support for their family there be also report of kidnapping ransom and sexual exploitation my hon friend ask what the uk be do we continue to condemn those atrocity against woman and girl we have call out human right violation especially conflict relate sexual violence carry out by the party to the conflict within the un human rights council and security council and we be work to ensure that evidence be collect the fighting in sudan be have an impact not just on that country but on neighbouring country such as south sudan which can not export its natural resource what action be the government take to open up channel through which country such as south sudan can export good in order to feed people in their country the right hon gentleman will be aware that there be already humanitarian crisis in south sudan visit the bentiu refugee camp which house people it be effectively an island of marooned people in lake of floodwater at the moment there be already crisis there he be absolutely right that economic prospect have go even far backwards follow the crisis the main oil pipeline have be impact by the conflict in sudan we have have discussion with international partner about what can be do to improve the situation have discussion with the world bank when be in juba in south sudan about what can be do on economic reform there be role for the government of south sudan in ensure economic reform be very clear that reform need to take place and that we need strong action and election the impact of the sudan conflict be be feel in south sudan as the right hon gentleman say the newport sudanese community come together yesterday in pill to open their new community centre they feel that the conflict and this famine of epic proportion still go largely unseen some be hear horrific story from family and friend could the minister reiterate to they that as the penholder on sudan at the un security council we will do all we can to ensure that international attention and action be not too little too late and that crucially aid get to the right place be grateful to my hon friend for raise the important point about diaspora community in the uk have speak to many people with sudanese heritage in the uk who be deeply concerned about the situation at home be yet to meet someone with sudanese heritage who have not be impact somehow who do not have close family member who have be kill or subject to violence or have have to flee or be in food insecurity pay tribute to the sudanese community in newport and across our country most certainly their plight be not be forget commend the minister on have make her visit so promptly the conflict in ukraine and the middle east get coverage on the news night after night it seem to that this conflict ought similarly to constantly feature in our medium why be that not happen be it purely because of the denial of journalistic access be very grateful to the right hon gentleman for his question which have think about lot how can we elevate this crisis one fear that people will look back and ask why more be not do about it give the huge humanitarian toll there be the big displacement crisis in the world and the famine which the uk government recognise some very committed journalist be cover it and praise their action hope that there can be additional coverage and great international awareness that be important for the un and other multilateral organisation as well this government will do all we can to raise the profile of this crisis within those body there have now be over day of war in sudan and we know that the geopolitical context be very complex to say the least there have be report from human rights watch of summary execution and torture will the government commit to galvanise the international crisis response that be need to hold international partner to account so that the sudanese people receive the commitment and attention they deserve be grateful to my hon friend for raise that incredibly important point we have indeed as she eloquently spell out see really disturbing increase in human right abuse in sudan there have be an escalation of violence with many civilian kill sexual assault on woman as we talk about and the restriction of humanitarian and journalistic access the uk will ensure that there be continue scrutiny of sudan at the un human rights council the uk be the leader of the core group alongside germany norway and the united states we have be seek to use that position as actively as possible to raise this issue colleague should also be aware that the uk be fund the centre for information resilience research body that be gather open source evidence about the ongoing fighting that be incredibly important for the long term accountability of those who be abuse human right so appallingly in sudan thank you mr speaker for provide time for this issue today also thank the minister this be the grave humanitarian situation on earth and be grateful for her remark about evidence gather on universal crime however be little concerned that be yet to hear what concrete action be be take to enforce an arm embargo and stop arm from reach the conflict zone be grateful to the hon gentleman for be very clear about the magnitude of this appalling conflict and the need to do all we can to prevent it the uk government have seek to use every lever we can to put pressure in this area whether political diplomatic or humanitarian and to use every venue we can to be very clear reiterate that the war party and those support they to become engaged in the conflict must cease their action which be have such negative impact on the population for those who be engage to the extent that this be become proxy situation every single day they do that they be contribute to the humanitarian crisis the uk could not be clear in our language despite sudan experience one of the most severe humanitarian crisis in the world the previous government fail to expand safe route for those in sudan even for those who have family here in the light of the ever worsen situation on the ground what step will our new government take to help those flee the conflict to reunite with love one and find safety in the uk be grateful to my hon friend for mention the situation face those who have be force to flee sudan the pattern for those flee conflict be quite differentiate many who be already in humanitarian need or with low resource have be force into chad obviously from darfur as mention early we be also see some be force back into south sudan many have move into egypt which have see really significant expansion in its sudanese population think all of we as parliamentarian will remember what happen at the beginning of the conflict when there be the evacuation pay tribute to the civil servant who ensure that the evacuation take place because it be very difficult time of course we take very seriously our commitment on ensure that refugee be protect in the region be very grateful that time have be give for this urgent question group such as the zaghawa be face genocide in sudan as result many young zaghawan man have flee to europe and some live in makeshift camp along the french coast they wish to come to the uk for particular reason because sudan be former colony of the british empire and they be teach english at school the like of tommy robinson demonise they for be young and male but it be precisely because they be young man that they be most at risk of be slaughter by the janjaweed will the government look again because there be particular historical duty of care towards people from sudan and allow safe passage to the zaghawa who be flee genocide we have be very clear that there must not be demonisation of individual from any heritage or background we be see situation where separation be be undertake by some of the war party so that it be become impossible for father to leave with their child and for uncle and grandfather to leave they be be separate unfortunately and effectively pressgange into support some of the war party that be extremely disturbing we see that previously but we be see it again intensify meet young boy whose uncle have be subject to that and who escape by the skin of his tooth we will ensure that we focus on human right include for young man for everybody in those situation but the critical thing will be to ensure that sudan itself have the ceasefire that be desperately need and that there be de escalation and great regional stability that be what will be important in both the medium and long term thank you mr speaker for dedicate time to this crisis give the challenge of get international aid into sudan the humanitarian response be very dependent on local community lead emergency response route what measure be the government take to ensure that funding reach frontline responder be grateful to my hon friend for raise that point she have considerable expertise on these issue from before she become member of parliament we be concerned about the situation of access for humanitarian aid in sudan talk little about that early but it be important that we do not see unreasonable impediment put in place recognise her point about community support be provide meet some representative from the so call emergency response room also meet as say some civil society voice from sudan who be also engage in that humanitarian effort it be important that their contribution be recognise they be not part of the war party they be completely politically neutral for that reason of course they be be target themselves what effort be be make to gather testimony and evidence of the war crime breach of international humanitarian law and ethnic cleansing that we all know be take place in sudan at the moment be grateful to the hon member for raise that point mention that the uk be support the centre for information resilience research body that be gather evidence of what be take place on the ground for example funding be be provide for the sudan witness project which be investigate attack against civilian and infrastructure on the specific finding of genocide be clear that that be an internationally focused definition but we be concerned that we be see pattern of violence that bear the hallmark of that kind of development so we be keep that very closely under report september vol correction thank the minister for her statement sudan have border with seven country home to around million people all those country now face the destabilising flow of gun and mercenary what assessment have the uk government make of the impact of the civil war on the humanitarian crisis and not just in sudan but in neighbouring country my hon friend raise an important point as mention we have already see in south sudan and other neighbouring country extreme humanitarian need clearly the conflict in sudan be make the situation even bad in many of those nation be grateful to those nation that have open their border so that those flee conflict be able to move out of the conflict situation but clearly that be come at significant cost in situation where there be already considerable humanitarian need south sudan for example already have the bad maternal mortality in the entire world it have statistic that place it right at the bottom of the human development index of all country this be only make the situation bad regret to say thank the minister very much for her reassuring word about how to help those in sudan but give that some million people be displace there and million be suffer from food insecurity it be clear that humanitarian crisis of gigantic proportion be unfold in particular and here declare an interest as chair of the all party parliamentary group for international freedom of religion or christians have be kill million christians have be displace and church have be destroy and close there have be human right violation in the form of rape kidnapping and looting sudan be the eighth bad place in the world to be christian it be clear that much more must be do may ask the minister very respectfully what step she be take to work with non governmental organisation on the ground to get support to the people who need it the most the vulnerable the ill woman and child the hon gentleman be right sadly about the scale of the humanitarian disaster we see unfold and about the human right abuse he mention religious minority and also the impact on woman and girl which be mention early we be see an extremely disturbing situation in sudan we will continue to do all we can to raise the profile of this issue the humanitarian situation in sudan be priority for as soon as become the new development minister be determined that should be brief on it it be an enormous crisis and we in the uk must do all we can to ensure that we play our part politically diplomatically economically and in humanitarian term yesterday hear from two sudanese doctor who be bear in sudan but live in my constituency and who be rightly and understandably very worried indeed we have hear from the minister about engagement with the world bank the african union and the united nations but many of our european neighbour have colonial tie with this part of africa as do we what specific and direct conversation have the minister have with european colleague to urge they to do their bit to help resolve the crisis the sudanese doctor group have be very important in the uk in raise the profile of these issue and in try to ensure that information about the situation on the ground be get through and be report in the medium we will continue to work multilaterally but also bilaterally have discuss these matter with for example counterpart from norway germany and number of other european nation and also with the current european commissioner for development who will of course be move on with new commission we clearly need to work together to try to resolve these matter child be often on the frontline of conflict and that certainly apply in sudan where whole generation of child be live nightmare and face catastrophe can the minister expand on the specific measure be take to protect child both in term of immediate humanitarian aid and to raise the important issue of child right my hon friend bring considerable expertise to the house gain before she become member of parliament the appalling circumstance in which child be find themselves because of this conflict really must be raise up the international agenda when be in south sudan meet some child who have escape from sudan those child could not smile any more there be nothing that they could see for their future it be extremely disturbing they have lose their parent and they have see for example sibling die of measle or diarrhoea while they be try to escape the conflict this be truly horrendous situation child right must indeed be raise and we should of course also consider the situation of child in the context of the activity of the war party again the uk government will be call on those party to ensure that they be follow international humanitarian law and above all that we have the ceasefire that be so desperately need ofsted urgent question to ask the secretary of state for education if she will make statement on propose change to ofsted reporting as the government explain in the write ministerial statement that be lay yesterday and as be outline in our manifesto single headline grade will no long be issue by ofsted when it inspect state fund school our landmark reform will drive high and rise standard for child and will increase transparency for parent today ofsted publish the outcome of its big listen consultation exercise the large engagement with parent child and professional in its history which as the right hon member for east hampshire damian hinds will know begin under the last government the big listen contain some difficult message it be clear that significant change be need and ofsted have respond by commit itself to improvement hold school accountable for child education be vital but single headline grade be low information for parent and create high stake for school so this government be act make inspection both more powerful and more transparent for this academic year parent will continue to see four inspection grade for the exist sub category and from september the introduction of school report card will provide more complete picture of school performance we will develop those over the come month work closely with parent and school we want high and rise standard for every child and we will act decisively when those standard be not be meet we will continue to intervene when performance be serious concern ofsted legal duty to identify school cause concern will remain they will still be require to notify the secretary of state of these inspection outcome and she will retain her legal duty to issue an academy order to local authority maintain school when that be require however we will change the way in which school be support to help they succeed from early we will introduce regional improvement team which will partner with struggle school to drive improvement quickly and directly this mark the beginning not the end of our journey towards an accountability system that be fit for purpose and will help to break down the barrier to opportunity for every child throughout the country the system can certainly improve after the terrible tragedy of ruth perry change be make and as the minister say ofsted initiate its wide big listen consultation we support that and welcome much of what be in ofsted announcement today but fear that the government have not think through the consequence of their own announcement yesterday the overall effectiveness assessment be vital indicator for parent and it also play specific role in the statutory framework can the minister confirm that ofsted will still have legal duty to identify school need special measure or require significant improvement that the department will still intervene and that this will be base on the same criterion as before with the use of the same word inadequate but now in any one of four category when will there be clarity for other sector early year college prison and social care crucially what be the implication for intervention if child social care in an area be fail with all the terrible consequence that that can bring there be already wealth of report card information on school from pupil progress to attendance what will actually be new in the report card that the minister mention rather less discuss aspect of yesterday announcement be the introduction of the ominous sound regional improvement team to monitor struggle school rather good fit be find with an academy trust apparently they will be fund by yes you guess it vat on independent school in respect of school with successive require improvement judgment can the minister tell we what reason there be to believe that regional improvement team will be more effective in deliver improvement than strong academy trust between and the proportion of school rat less than good come down from about one in three to one in what worry be that these change mean less transparency for parent and step backwards from proven school improvement approach with academy trust to directive top down approach urge the secretary of state and her minister to assess the true impact that this will have on young people prospect before it be too late the shadow secretary of state be minister in the department for education and he know these issue well he also know that the work we be announce today be about clear up the mess that the previous government leave the big listen be announce under his government and his former colleague the previous chair of the education committee be persuade of the case for reform of the single headline grade labour be party of high and rise standard for all our child in all our school reform inspection to enable improvement in our school be urgent inspection and accountability be crucial tool for achieve well outcome for all our child we will take no lesson from party under whose watch one in four child leave primary school without meet the standard expect in math and reading one in five child be persistently absent from school and it be not good enough we be determined to fix it and the announcement that we have make be the first step on that road may thank the minister for take swift action as former teacher and child lead at local authority know how high stake and low information ofsted judgment have start to become for local family indeed have speak to parent in my constituency ahead of my westminster hall debate on education for child with special educational need and disability tomorrow know that the lack of focus on inclusive education be real issue for lot of parent can the minister confirm that when look at new scorecard we will make the most of this opportunity to ensure that ofsted be hold school to account on the breadth of their inclusion in the local area my hon friend put the issue very well we will consult on the report card system and take the time to ensure that we get it right but we want to ensure that we have clear picture for parent by put clear spotlight on great range of area of performance rather than one word overall judgment for example we want to give parent well picture of the support that school be provide for child with special educational need as part of the process we will explore how to demonstrate that within the report card system call the lib dem spokesperson the death of ruth perry be tragedy and underscore the high stake nature of ofsted inspection have witness at first hand how headteacher and teacher in my constituency have suffer under the strain and stress of ofsted inspection but other have also tell how helpful they have find they and how brilliant ofsted inspector have be we liberal democrats certainly welcome the move away from one word judgment which we have long be call for at the same time we believe that robust and fair inspection and accountability regime be essential to ensure that school be operate at high standard and be safe nurturing and inclusive environment in which our child and young people can thrive although the change be welcome first step could we have some reassurance that it will be follow by proper root and branch reform for too long ofsted have be see as an adversary but it should be see as helpful friend can we see the announcement as first step towards world where ofsted be helpful respected partner for school perhaps the regional improvement team will provide that sense that local authority use to do so before they have that function take away from they finally ofsted should be look at broad varied and rich curriculum how will the minister curriculum review connect with the ofsted change thank the hon lady for welcome today change which be welcome by many people in the sector and across the country who rely on strong inspection system that be fair clear and transparent echo her comment about the death of ruth perry which be tragedy take this opportunity to pay tribute to her sister julia who have fight so hard over the past year to ensure that lesson be learn we know that ofsted have report on its big listen today and copy will be available in the house of commons library it be very large report ofsted have undertake huge exercise which show that it be listen it will take time to see the change implement but ofsted be determined to change and as the hon lady say we be determined to work in partnership with it to deliver the change require that apply across the board in our education sector where we want to work in partnership with school and those who be deliver the excellent education that we want to see for every child the hon lady mention the curriculum review may get in trouble for the length of response that her question require but the curriculum review be key part of reform our education system and ensure that it give breadth and depth of experience to young people their teacher and their school thank my hon friend for her statement to the house on the long await ofsted reform give the welcome focus on inclusion send and improve training for inspector can she update the house on how this will support child with send in wolverhampton north east and beyond concur with my hon friend that this be about ensure we have an inspection system that drive high and rise standard for every child which include support our aim to see an inclusive school system that deliver the outcome that we want to see for child with special educational need it be about provide great transparency in our school system and an inspection regime that focus on whole variety of area where school should be strive for improvement we know that school work incredibly hard and be do an incredible job for our child but every school can always do well and an inspection system that support and drive improvement will be welcome across the board across stone great wyrley and penkridge we have some amazing outstanding and good school across the country however we see school that be fail and in need of intervention could the minister set out what she envisage as the trigger mechanism for intervention the right hon gentleman raise an important point and we will work with ofsted on develop the new report card system over the next year we will engage and consult as part of that process because we want to get it right he be right to suggest that where there be serious failing in school we will continue to intervene in the good interest of child and we will continue to intervene where the government currently have legal duty to do so we will continue to intervene but through our regional improvement team we will also look to put improvement support in place for school that be struggle because no child should be leave in school that be let they down school across the country include in my constituency of hartlepool will welcome today judgment as they start the new term will my hon friend join in thank they for their extraordinary hard work include on behalf of my child who start their school term today the decision demonstrate that in this government school have partner who will work with they to improve every child future agree and wish my hon friend child all the good as they start school today many child across the country be have their first day back at school remember my first day at school very well remember it be terrifying and not dissimilar from one first outing at the dispatch box concur that this government priority be to drive high and rise standard not in some of our school and for some of our child but for every child in every one of our school and we will work tirelessly to deliver that the reform that we be announce be crucial part of ensure that it be deliver in my career as teacher have the dubious pleasure of be inspect by four different regime be afraid to say that ofsted be the most brutal the least personal and the least useful of all the regime at its good an inspection regime can help to drive up improvement and celebrate what be great about school inspection hold up mirror and make teacher ask themselves what more they can do for the child they care about so much what lesson be the department learn from other inspection regime around the world the hon lady raise an important point and her experience be obviously valuable to the house for the lesson that we can learn she be absolutely right to say that good inspection regime drive improvement and identifie in all school not only those area where they be do well which should be celebrate but those where there be room to improve we will consult on the report card system extensively over the next year we want to make sure we get this right and we want to do it in partnership we will look to see how this be do elsewhere to make sure that we learn from good practice and we will continue to ensure that this be an inspection system that should be welcome by school as it help they to identify how they deliver for their child as she rightly say know that that be the priority for every school thank the minister for her statement and for the excellent practical reform that be be set out will she join in thank in advance all the hard work teacher and support staff across southampton itchen and offer they an assurance that this government intend to work in real partnership to ensure that every child get the good start in life thank my hon friend and very much welcome the opportunity to thank all our teacher as they go back to school this week they will be put in really hard and rewarding year ahead and will give the good to the child in their care absolutely echo what my hon friend say we be clear from day one in government that we want to work in partnership with the sector we know that the government do not deliver education to child our teacher do our school do our support staff do and the parent who make sure their child get to school do we support they all in that endeavour but where we can do more to support they in deliver that we will the announcement that we be make be part of that endeavour when my sister lee take what be then call she gce exam in the early she be give specific mark for each exam result by the time take mine in the late that system have be replace by one of grade which merge together all sort of different result and be likely to lead to subjectivity and relativism henceforth could not the simplistic one word system that be now be replace be replace by proper mark system where individual aspect of school be specifically mark and an overall figure give which would therefore not be subjective but would give parent an easy guide as to the performance of the school the right hon gentleman make characteristically thoughtful point as part of our consultation we will look at how good to deliver our aim which be to provide great transparency great clarity and great information for parent for school and for the staff who be work to drive improvement as he say no child would be give single grade for their overall school performance which beg the important question of why we have be do that for school when the previous conservative government leave office education standard be decline school be crumble and they claim to have maxe out on their support for child do the minister agree that school parent and pupil deserve well and that with this government they will get it interruption my hon friend put it incredibly well although those on the opposition front bench seem to protest against his appreciation of the reality that school up and down the country have be face which have be let child down that be our key focus today yes it be about school it be about an inspection framework and it be about the organisation ofsted that deliver that but actually this be about child it be about ensure the good outcome for every child if we get this system right and we put education back at the heart of national life again we will deliver on our pledge to break down the barrier to opportunity for every child wherever they be in this country welcome the announcement by the government as do many school and parent in my constituency who want more information rather than just one word rating can urge the minister to give parent more power through great detail while ensure that rating be easy for parent to understand the hon gentleman have very much set out our aim and intention and that be why we will consult extensively on this we have give ourselves till september to have the report card in place and we want to ensure that we have input from education expert parent and child and that we maximise this opportunity to as he put it maximise the information that parent will find useful and the information that school will find useful to drive the improvement that they want for their child york outer be home to many inspirational teacher and be proud that my wife be one of they but head tell that there be recruitment and retention crisis do the minister agree that the end of ofsted headline judgment will improve teacher retention and can she update the house on the plan to recruit specialist teacher thank my hon friend for his intervention and wish his wife and all teacher start their new school term well it be an incredibly exciting time it be little bit daunt for some but it be an important opportunity to reset their school life at the beginning of new year similarly this be an opportunity for we to reset our relationship with the sector in do so we must ensure that we can recruit the necessary teacher we must make teach the attractive respected and admire profession that it should be to ensure that we meet the pledge to recruit new teacher we have already start the work we have reset the relationship and the tone we have obviously make progress on the pay review and we will continue to strive to reach our target to ensure that every school have the teacher it need and that every child have the teacher they need especially in the subject that require specialist teaching thank the minister for her response to all the question and wish she well in the role that she now play to make education well for our child that be what we all wish to see the minister will understand the need for parent to easily and simply determine which school well fit the need of their child and family and that any review of school must be accessible not only to those with an educational background but to those who be perhaps not familiar with educational terminology this need to be clear in the reporting do the minister also acknowledge that rather than have teach staff focus on an area that appear to be get low grade than the rest and direct resource to improve that one area the resource and attention must instead go to child and their educational need which be more varied and complex than ever before the hon gentleman make characteristically thoughtful point and do not disagree with anything that he say in fact the report card system should give much more holistic picture of school life parent know their child and they know the sort of school environment that will suit they report card system will enable the highlighting of area where school may be do particularly well and the area where it may need to strive to improve that will be useful for parent it will also be useful for school to know where they can improve and it will be useful in drive high and rise standard for every child we be absolutely determined to deliver that and we see this as key part of ensure that that happen if be to pick single word to describe ofsted grade system it would be inadequate so welcome the government commitment to review ofsted review system and particularly to review its focus on special educational need will the minister engage with family with special educational need when develop the new school report card system ensure that we meet the need of child with special educational need and their family be key priority for the government we recognise that the system be break and that there be too many family and too many child not get the education that they deserve we see this as part of the process of reset that relationship and reset the system so that we can have school system that be inclusive where that be appropriate and so that we can have mainstream school that serve the whole community we will endeavour as part of wide reform that we be look at to ensure that we have special educational need system that meet the need of every child in this country thank the minister for her statement and for her clarity on the next step to drive improvement in school across the country many teacher and parent will welcome the news that we will move away from one word inspection but intervention be not the same as drive improvement can the minister reassure that alongside intervention there will be plan and support for school so that we see the improvement necessary to give every child the good start in life we will continue to intervene in the worst perform school where school would previously have be rat inadequate the government will still take action we will issue academy order if require in line with legal requirement inspection report will continue to make it clear to parent if school be in this situation and ofsted will continue to make it clear where school be cause concern and if intervention be require by law we will also ensure that where school need support they get that support we will roll out regional improvement team to ensure that where school be struggle they get the support they need through system that partner they with high perform school in the area to ensure that school work together for the benefit of their whole community we see that as key part of drive the reform that we want to see for every child welcome the minister change to ofste inspection this holistic approach be genuinely common sense in the future will similar measure apply to child service we recognise that this be first step on the journey towards remove single headline grade which we see as reductive we have widespread agreement on that across all educational remit at this stage we be implement it in school as matter of priority but we will work with ofsted and the sector over the next year to develop reporting arrangement across whole range of area for which ofsted have responsibility congratulate the minister on this rapid work the conservatives have year but labour ministers have do it in matter of week can have commitment that ofsted focus on attainment send and attendance will be laser focused for the benefit of the house there be only two more conservatives members in the chamber for this statement on education standard than be stand for the conservative party leadership my hon friend be right we have deliver at pace and hit the ground run when it come to improve our education system just as every day at school matter every day in government matter for drive high and rise standard for every child my hon friend rightly identify attendance as key issue and we share that concern the previous government talk lot about that but do very little to turn the table we want to see attendance prioritise as we know that far too many child be miss far too much school which be harm not only their educational opportunity but their life chance and the whole school community we want to send the message loud and clear in this first week back at school that every day at school matter and every child should be attend school the decision to end single word judgment will be welcome by education professional across birmingham have see in my own household the mental and physical toll that the old system could impose can the minister confirm that the new school report card will allow ofsted to assess send inclusion alongside send attainment yes we know that the current system be not work for anyone which be why the change we have outline be so important we know that we need to spread good practice and drive standard across all of our school include for child with special educational need who be key priority for this government and we will consult on the good way to do that thank the minister for her statement anyone who have visit school in their constituency before or after an ofsted inspection can not help but know the impact on staff welcome this opportunity to reset our relationship with educator and family because it be so important right now that those young people who be look to become teacher see it as worthwhile profession in which they will be welcome and appreciate by the government hope this be an opportunity for the minister to work with the education sector and family to build report system that be fit for purpose and encourage people to work in the education system hear hear we know that the system have be let down child and family and that we have shortage of people who want to be teacher we need to make sure we have teaching workforce that can deliver the education that every child deserve my hon friend put it incredibly eloquently and very much agree that this be about reset our system and reset the government relationship with family so that they send their child to school and believe that school be the good place for their child and with teacher so that they know they be trust value and support to deliver what know they go into teaching to deliver and so that we encourage more people to become teacher contract for difference call ed miliband to make statement on contract for difference congratulate you on your new role madam deputy speaker with permission would like to make statement about the sixth contract for difference allocation round it be less than two month since the government come into office with mandate to fix the foundation and make britain clean energy superpower the last government leave this country expose to international fossil fuel market as result every household and business pay the price in the bad cost of living and energy bill crisis in memory because of britain particular exposure family and business in our country be hit hard than other the only way to provide this country with the energy security that the british people deserve be through home grow clean energy that we control that be the mandate on which this government be elect and that be what we will deliver last year contract for difference auction under the previous government be fiasco no offshore wind project be award which be disaster for the industry and for our effort to move away from dependence on fossil fuel in july when we come into office make the decision to expand the budget for this year auction by to maximise the amount of home grow clean power we could secure while deliver value for the british people and today the result be in can announce to the house that we have secure record break new clean energy project more project for our country as whole than any previous auction more project in england more project in scotland and more project in wales than any previous auction over two and half time the capacity secure in last year auction nearly gw of clean home grow power enough to power the equivalent of million home the most successful renewable auction in british history and major step forward in our mission to make britain clean energy superpower and to help britain get off the rollercoaster of volatile global gas market let set out the result in detail first solar be one of the cheap and most readily deployable energy source at our disposal we have secure record solar photovoltaic project the large number of solar project ever in an auction unlock gw of new solar which be increase on our instal capacity secondly we have secure almost gw of onshore wind however must report to the house that thank to the conservatives near total ban on onshore wind there be just one small onshore wind project in england of mw their nine year ban destroy the pipeline of project that be why this government lift the onshore wind ban in england as one of their first act our onshore wind taskforce will now go about the process of work with industry to rebuild the pipeline of project thirdly this auction be success for the emerge technology that will serve our country in the future float offshore wind offer huge opportunity in every part of britain the last auction secure no float offshore wind on come to office be present with budget that risk repeat the mistake of the past so take the decision to more than double the budget that cover this cutting edge technology can report to the house that today auction have secure mw float offshore wind project more than time big than the previous big float offshore wind farm in britain at double the price at low price this float offshore wind farm alone be double the size of all of europe instal float offshore wind capacity in addition on tidal where britain have huge leadership opportunity we have secure six new tidal stream project at the low ever price fourthly on fix offshore wind in contrast to the zero gw secure in last year round we have secure gw of offshore wind enough to power the equivalent of million home that include secure both the large and second large offshore wind project in europe hornsea and hornsea off the yorkshire coast an industry flat on its back because of the mistake of the last government be back on its foot thank to this government can also report to the house that across the whole auction all these result be secure at price well below the maximum price limit price that demonstrate that wind and solar be the cheap source of power to build and operate in our country for the house benefit that mean clearing price for offshore wind that be five to seven time low than electricity price drive by gas at the peak of the energy crisis the success of this round do not just offer great energy security for the british people it also offer the possibility of good job throughout britain but that will not happen without action by government because we know that too often in the past renewable energy produce in britain have not create enough good job in britain with great british energy and our national wealth fund we will invest to make sure our clean power mission produce job in every corner of the united kingdom this government have be in office for less than two month in that time we have lift the onshore wind ban consent more nationally significant solar capacity in one week than the last government do in year and now deliver the most successful renewable auction in the history of the country and on thursday we will debate the second reading of the great british energy bill this be government in hurry to deliver our mission energy security low bill good job and tackle the climate crisis commend this statement to the house call the shadow minister be grateful to the secretary of state for the timely advance sight of his statement would like to put on record that member on the opposition benches welcome the success of the contract for difference allocation round the secretary of state be right to be proud of that achievement by the government it be to be celebrate that we as country be create an extra clean energy project that include gw of offshore wind farm and mw of float wind the secretary of state will be grateful to the previous government for set up the detail of auction round last november the previous secretary of state recognise the problem of and the price set for offshore wind price that be set before round of inflation that make the cfd strike price cap too low for the producer by the way this be not just uk problem it affect other project for offshore wind around the world increase the strike price by around to the current price of have be crucial to secure the current success of course in addition the previous government have many other success in just of our energy need be supply by renewable today it be nearly this have come from many initiative not least bring in the contract for difference auction in and make the auction process an annual event an initiative that be learn from problem it would not be fair to ignore the contribution by the new secretary of state as he say he have increase the pot for this year auction by while that be welcome frankly who would not welcome more renewable energy that do not tackle our energy issue at the same time as increase renewable energy production the government be decrease uk gas production the uk need reliability of supply of energy but we all know we can not predict with any certainty when the wind will blow and the sun will shine that be why we need baseload dispatchable energy that can supply the energy need of our home and economy we recognise the importance of invest in renewable to deliver clean energy and the gw announce today be brilliant step in the right direction but give these success and his self declare success today why do the secretary of state plan to saddle the country with billion in debt to fund great british energy in previous month he may have answer that question by say that the purpose of gb energy be to cut energy bill by however we note that his promise to cut energy bill seem to have go missing much like the winter fuel payment of million pensioner despite the secretary of state pledge and that of many hon member on the government benches he will be aware that energy bill be in fact go up can he confirm when bill will fall and by how much pensioner be not the only one be impact by this government ideological energy target as have already mention the secretary of state ban new oil and gas which will cost oil and gas worker their job research conduct by the industry predict that that move will see tax revenue from that industry fall by billion by the opposition welcome the secretary of state ambition to make sure that the job create by the transition be locate in britain but at this stage the majority of job in the solar and wind sector be locate in china what step be he as the current secretary of state take to ensure all the job create through be locate in britain he have already make bit of habit of rid roughshod over the concern of local community approve development without regard to the concern of local community these decision will see some of britain green belt and good agricultural land develop will the secretary of state confirm what share of today investment will take place on the green belt what protection be he put in to protect the green belt the secretary of state have speak at length about the need to overcome challenge face the grid in government we deliver increase in the amount of renewable energy connect to the grid but we recognise that so much more need to be do what step be the secretary of state take to support this further increase have he investigate undergrounde what plan do he have to protect the countryside from more pylon note that the secretary of state today recommit to decarbonise the grid by we have previously warn he of the risk of be over ambitious which include leave family face the cost it be not only the opposition who have warn he of that chris stark his newly appoint head of mission control once describe the target as over ambitious will the secretary of state please share exactly what his head of mission control believe to be over ambitious about decarbonisation target his head of mission control also warn that it be entirely fair that people be concerned about the cost of decarbonise by will the secretary of state confirm that neither taxpayer nor bill payer will be leave with the cost of the target will he tell the house when we will see proper comprehensive estimate for the full system cost of his decarbonisation plan for in conclusion the opposition welcome the fact that the secretary of state have build on our success in boost renewable energy however we hold serious concern about what this round will mean for britain green space and whether give the increase cost of his commitment remain to cut bill by congratulate the hon gentleman on his elevation since the election look forward to our exchange in this house say he to gently that the crucial first phase of opposition in my experience be have bit of humility to admit where they have get thing wrong do not deny that some of the thing that the previous government do be right but quite lot of what they do be wrong for example the nine year ban on the cheap clean form of power the blocking of solar project across the country and the crashing of the offshore wind market which lead to the bad energy bill crisis in generation that be their legacy and at some point some of the leadership candidate will have to face up to that let deal with the hon member specific point if may say so respectfully feel like he answer some of his own question he draw attention to the fact that energy bill be rise from october he be right about that and that be deeply regrettable why be that happen because we be expose to international gas market this be about power that we do not control every solar panel that we do not put up every onshore wind turbine that we do not erect and every piece of grid that we do not build leave we more exposed the conservative party be in dilemma on this because it be face both way but it have to face up to that fact of course we will have proper and orderly transition in the north sea keep exist field open for their lifetime and have just transition for the workforce but the idea that the conservative party and some of its erstwhile friend be cling to that fossil fuel will get we out of this be completely belie by all the fact and the crisis that we go through the shadow minister say and agree with he that we need to have job in this country he say it as if he find it hard to remember who have be in power for the past year it be terrible he say that everything be be produce elsewhere he be right germany have almost twice as many renewable energy job per capita as the uk sweden have almost three time as many but most interestingly denmark with its publicly own energy company ørsted have almost four time as many the hon gentleman ask about great british energy we will debate that matter on thursday but one reason why we go to the electorate on this point and be endorse on it be that unless we have publicly own national champion all the evidence be that the job will go elsewhere that be part of have basic industrial policy the hon member talk about solar energy but again he have to make up his mind about where he be on this he say that he agree that we need clean energy in this country and that we have to get off the international gas market but the problem be that the conservatives duck every difficult decision then he ask about undergrounding the conservatives be in power for year so they have plenty of time to do the undergrounding of all the cabling why do they not do that it be because they know that it be multiple time more expensive now they come along less than two month after the general election and say that it be time for some undergrounding of the grid for goodness sake have experience of be leader of the opposition perhaps it be time for the conservatives to have some private tutorial on how to be in opposition it be great to see my right hon friend in such ebullient spirit have to say that his enthusiasm can only be match by that of the industry which today have roundly welcome the decision that he take back in july to increase the size of this auction that demonstrate that if we have government who be consistent positive and ambitious the industry will respond and will back their plan can my right hon friend assure the house that the great start that he have make will be continue with consistent plan under this government so that business can invest for the long term know that the government will always back they my hon friend make typically eloquent point this be about partnership with private industry the truth be that much of the investment that we need for the clean power mission will come from the private sector and suspect that there be cross party agreement on that we on the government benches have difference with the opposition though because we believe that lot of that come from break down the barrier to planning and grid infrastructure which be massive challenge for supply chain and skill there be also role for what we call catalytic public investment lever in extra private investment the other point that my hon friend make be absolutely right there be huge enthusiasm in the private sector and industry more generally for this sense of mission for the country we want this mission to involve every business that have an interest in this area and believe that we can achieve that call the liberal democrat spokesperson we liberal democrats very much welcome the result of this round it be significant improvement on last year when the previous conservative government completely fail with zero bid from the onshore wind developer the result show that the cfd programme be back on track they demonstrate the power of industry and government work together to identify fix problem so that we can widen the level of private sector investment we bring in which be require for clean power system transition britain unique geography with its abundance of natural resource be an asset we must harness the wind and the world large tide it be hugely encouraging that record break amount of solar capacity have be procure whatever the conservatives be say now about their record in government solar target be repeatedly miss and this round be welcome change unlike the conservative government who as have be point out leave we at the whim of the global oil and gas market this government be make choice that will increase our energy independence and low energy bill for our consumer future allocation round especially in the next few year must continue to deliver increase quantity of renewable that can be achieve by set ambitious budget and bring forward incremental reform of the cfd regime can the secretary of state assure that this round be not just one off and that we will increase the pace of the cfd allocation round thank the hon lady for her support and the warm tone that she use she be right that we face big challenge as country to get move on the offshore wind bill the onshore wind bill solar on rooftop and ground mount solar the truth be that cfd auction have serve we well and continue to do so we inherit this auction halfway through the round and we increase the budget substantially to make sure that it be success but the right thing for we to do think this be the main point that she be make be to talk to industry about how we can make sure that future round be success be very interested in how we can have line of sight for industry so that it can have the industrial certainty to plan ahead the annual auction round be serve we well but we need to work with industry to make sure that we land the clean power that we need and get the job here too the secretary of state be right to point out that the previous government preside over the fail fifth auction round for the offshore wind sector it be devastating congratulate he on achieve success for this important industry but part of the measure of that success will be the wide industrial benefit include good job what action will he take to make sure that coastal community such as mine see those job as well as training and manufacturing my hon friend speak with great experience from both inside and outside this house and welcome her expertise on these issue she be absolutely right that we have to face up to the fact that we be in global race for these job investor be try to decide whether to locate their blade factory and other investment in the uk or elsewhere that be why we go into the election with range of measure include great british energy the national wealth fund and the british job bonus all be design to achieve the re industrialisation that my hon friend be talk about what consideration have the secretary of state give to proposal for an interconnector from north africa to the uk bring reliable solar and wind power at time when the wind be not blow here and the sun be not shin shall address this question at more general level for reason the right hon gentleman might understand think we should be look at all proposal that can maximise energy security he be talk about the xlinks proposal be obviously aware of that proposal and know that we need to look at it in the broad way my view have always be that we need every source of power available which be why embrace nuclear onshore wind offshore wind solar tidal carbon capture and and absolutely as the right hon gentleman say from sedentary position oil and gas also have crucial role in the transition my right hon friend be correct that clean energy be by far the cheap way to power the uk as confirm by industry body today in welcome his announcement but there will be intense international competition for investment how do he foresee ensure that we have the competitive advantage in attract that investment for year to come again my hon friend speak with great expertise part of it be about be have government who be commit to proper industrial strategy and have the lever to make that strategy happen there be an interesting divide between the opposition when they be in government and we although of course america be different sized country from we we see the inflation reduction act as offer real lesson to we about how we can lever in private investment we will not be able to do it on the scale of that act but these intervention can make difference there be also this crucial point we care where the manufacturing happen and we be determined to make sure that it happen in the uk will the secretary of state who be obsess with renewable energy actually be honest with the british people the truth be that the offshore wind turbine bid today be some above current price the float offshore wind bid be some three time the current price his department say that this require subsidy of some billion year that be before the extra transmission cost before constraint payment before compensation payment for blight my constituent countryside and before the cost of back up when the wind do not blow and the sun do not shine why will he not be honest and tell the truth that renewable energy be more expensive not cheap be interested by the hon gentleman intervention because his manifesto be basically high bill and to make people poor we do not need to look into the crystal ball we just need to look at the record the truth be that the cost of live crisis the energy bill crisis cast long shadow in this country it be cause not by dependence on renewable but by our exposure to fossil fuel he just need to understand this basic point whether fossil fuel be produce in this country or internationally they be sell on the international market and that be why the british people pay the price and the government fork out billion the only way to get off the rollercoaster of international gas market and take back control be to become clean energy superpower thank my right hon friend for his statement this allocation round be testament to the continued success of the contract for difference scheme as we be now on course to produce more renewable energy than ever and we need to get that power to consumer do he agree that we need the same political and financial commitment to the development of transmission infrastructure as we do to renewable welcome my hon friend question we need to be honest about this we face what we can only describe as crisis with our grid situation because we have people want to connect to cheap clean renewable and be offer date in the often late in the we have industrial investment that we need to happen for which date in the be offer grid reform and as part of that plan reform be absolutely crucial for this government and for any government who be serious about this be afraid to say that the legacy of the last government be disastrous when it come to the grid we will build the grid and look forward to support from all part of the house from those who want to tackle fuel poverty and want low energy bill fair play to the new secretary of state gw of offshore wind be great achievement especially compare with the flat zero achieve by the tories in auction round it unlock the vital inch cape array off my angus constituency coast and support job in montrose as well as in moray west and there be also the game change green volt float array off the north east coast of scotland he highlight gw of onshore wind mw of which be come from england will he tell the house where the rest of that onshore energy be come from his target be gw by how will he achieve that gw year from now until welcome the first part of the hon gentleman question and even the second part the only way this will work be if whatever our difference and we have large difference we work on this task with every government across the united kingdom whatever kind of government that be gillian martin the cabinet secretary in scotland and have have many conversation probably more in couple of month than be have in many year under the previous government that deliberate example of country first party second have be set by the prime minister we want to work with government across the uk to get the renewable revolution that we need if we be to make britain clean energy superpower it be pleasure to welcome my right hon friend to his place and to see he continue to champion this really important change which our constituent up and down the country have be cry out for one of the key issue we find when we go into people home be fuel poverty it be real constituent talk about not be able to heat their home that be the reality for many of my vauxhall and camberwell green constituent so they will welcome this announcement which will mean cheap bill and clean energy do he agree that we need to get on with this as quickly as possible give that bill be to increase from october resident want action from this government at fast pace so that they can see their energy bill come down my hon friend be right and she put it incredibly well it be hard for government of all stripe to admit this truth but when the october price cap be announce these matter be not within the previous government control and would not have be within ours because of our exposure these price be set internationally when putin or the petro state make decision they rebound on my hon friend constituent and the only solution be our clean energy superpower mission the truth be that it will take time and it will be hard for she and my constituent and the constituent of those across the house but the answer have to be to go as fast as possible because that be what get we energy security and low bill warmly congratulate the secretary of state on his appointment he be the perfect example of political renewable as politician we all have great deal to contribute to onshore wind more seriously do the secretary of state share my concern that the guardian last year and the daily telegraph this year both draw attention to the chinese exploitation of uyghur slave labour in the manufacture of so many solar panel other country have be ban their import how do he propose to deal with the matter because be sure that he share my concern that we should not profit on the back of that sort of disgraceful exploitation thank the right hon gentleman for his kind word he raise an incredibly serious and important issue when come into government ask for discussion across government on this control be in place to be fair to the last government and as part of the ongoing solar taskforce these issue be be look at but we need to kick the tyre on this to make sure that the proper control be in place my department be very happy to have discussion with he and other interested party on those question thank my right hon friend for his statement and his tireless campaign in favour of unleash our renewable energy potential as he know cornwall be ready willing and able to play full part in the renewable energy transition can he outline his plan to support small co operative community energy project when it come to those once again cornwall stand ready to act my hon friend ask very important question which give chance to advertise the second reading of the great british energy bill on thursday all be welcome standing room only as part of our plan for great british energy we allocate billion of the billion that we set out in the election for what we call the local power plan to do what other country such as denmark and germany do as matter of course unleash local renewable with local community council community group and co op be part of that that be important because it be way to tackle fuel poverty and generate income for local community it be also important as way of win consent from local people look forward to my hon friend and other make contribution on this question in that debate and other if as the secretary of state say he want to offer line of sight for industry he should look more closely at the opportunity that come from the development of tidal stream particularly through the creation of supply chain from the ground up that be always easy than recover one that have already go overseas but that line of sight have to go in both direction which be why developer in tidal stream energy be ask the government to set gw deployment target will he listen to those representation now and act on they when come into office and examine the issue around pot which cover tidal be very keen to make sure that we increase the tidal minimum which we do by these be important discussion to continue there be dilemma here as the right hon gentleman will know which be that tidal remain relatively expensive but the point of the tidal developer be that many technology remain expensive until they be deploy at scale these be hard question because they be about value for money and how much we invest in tidal but my department need to have those important discussion congratulate the secretary of state and his department on their excellent work give all that we have hear from the shadow minister today do my right hon friend agree that this government record success show that the main block to the sprint to renewable be the conservative party my hon friend make an important point about the legacy of the last government to widen her point would say to member across the house we need to be candid that this be hard for we as constituency mps that there be need to connect debate in this house about fuel poverty and energy bill and the decision that be be make in our area candidly unless we build the grid solar and onshore wind we will never get off the rollercoaster of international gas market all of we face choice we need public debate about this because if we be to tackle fuel poverty and do the thing that describe building be require and we need to make that happen gently say to the secretary of state that he promise at the general election to bring energy bill down by they be now go up by in october when will my constituent see the reduction that those in his party promise or do they not mean it think that tonight the hon gentleman will think that that be not very smart point to make week after we come into office the price cap go up have explain why the price cap go up because of our reliance on international gas market the decision that he have to make be this do he support our mission to make britain clean energy superpower in order to bring bill down or do he not there be one notable absence from the allocation round result today which be berwick bank wind farm locate in the north sea berwick bank have the potential to deliver up to gw of clean electricity and to lead to further investment in the supply chain and manufacturing the port of leith in my constituency be prime location for the project but we be still wait to hear about the consent can the secretary of state confirm that he will push the scottish government to speed up their section consent process so that berwick bank can come forward in the next allocation round and we can get on with deliver sprint to clean energy be glad that my hon friend have raise that point we face planning decision and question at policy level if can put it that way right across the united kingdom include in scotland and in england we will work with the scottish government and other to make sure that we have planning system that be fit for purpose and that can build the clean energy that we need this secretary of state be live in completely different world from my constituent because they be not ask for this on the doorstep at all by the way he be quite happy to spend billion on climate aid abroad and billion on gb energy yet rob our pensioner of at the same time but will give he the benefit of the doubt when will my pensioner in ashfield receive significant discount on their fuel bill and of how much think that the hon gentleman party support publicly own energy company but may be wrong about that can absolutely say that this be the way to deliver low bill for his constituent hon member when member can shout all they like know that this be hard for the hon gentleman but the reality they must face be this do he believe that continue reliance on fossil fuel and this country say no to renewable which think be their position will give we energy security the truth be it will not interruption the hon gentleman say that he agree with well look forward to he support our clean energy superpower mission welcome this phenomenal record break achievement from the secretary of state which represent significant milestone towards clean power by let we see more project in burnley do he agree that the good way to protect my constituent energy bill from price shock and the patriotic thing to do be to ensure our nation energy security through home grow clean power that will lower energy bill and give tyrant like putin bloody nose at the same time agree the notion that our exposure to fossil fuel as country give we security be belie by what have happen over the last few year as the prime minister often say it mean that putin boot be on our throat my hon friend talk about this patriotic mission and he be completely right other party in this house have decision to make on thursday will they support the great british energy bill we have public ownership of our energy system in britain foreign public ownership by state own company from abroad we welcome that investment but we also want british public ownership very much hope that other party will learn the lesson of their election defeat and support our bill on thursday to be helpful to member gently point out that it be important that they be here for the start of statement if they wish to be call to ask question will be very kind today call claire young thank you madam deputy speaker thank the secretary of state for his statement the late allocation round be good news and should be welcome especially after the fiasco of the last round it be vital that britain invest in our sustainable green energy production so that we can guarantee our energy security and lead the world as green powerhouse however the only way that we can achieve that be if we also push ahead with energy storage and ensure that we boost our capacity to retain the energy that be generate so what step be the department take to accelerate the roll out of new storage solution include green hydrogen the hon lady whom welcome to her place make an important point we often get question about what to do in an intermittent system we need different form of both dispatchable power and energy storage one project that my department be work on continue some of the work of the previous government be long duration energy storage and battery technology personally think that the system continue to underestimate the potential role of battery and long duration storage and we will say more about that in the month ahead the conservatives continue to oppose our publicly own clean power company despite widespread public support for it include in my constituency do the secretary of state recognise the absurdity of the opposition argument they be quite happy for public ownership of energy in this country as long it be by foreign government not uk citizen my hon friend who have great expertise on these issue make an important point we welcome the success of ørsted in today allocation round for the hornsea wind farm it be great for danish taxpayer that they will get some benefit from it and it be great for britain that we will get the investment but as the prime minister often ask why not britain as well why should we not invest in clean energy why should our taxpayer not benefit from this why should we not create job in this country as well as accelerate clean power it seem simple and logical proposition to the secretary of state will know from his recent visit to telford that business right across the country include in my constituency want to partner with the government on this agenda will this statement and future announcement mean that those private sector business which want to put their skill and money into this agenda and take risk on behalf of the government and the country to make we clean energy superpower have the secretary of state backing my hon friend be absolutely right very much enjoy my visit to telford where speak with local business it be easy to think about these thing in very macro term of how many gigawatt and so on the kind of thing like talk about but he be right that this be as much if not more about all the job that we can create in the supply chain people in this country want hope and change and this will deliver it welcome the auction increase solar capacity there be great project in my constituency fund via that scheme such as hessay solar will the secretary of state visit sunny york to see the site once it be complete and do he share my conviction that solar will be critical in the energy mix if we be to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and gas very much welcome my hon friend embrace of solar as part of the energy mix it be really important to say this we need more rooftop solar lot of people in this house ask why do we do more on rooftop and agree with they there be also an important role for ground mount solar however very much look forward to come to york at some point to see the project he talk about welcome my right hon friend statement for which thank he it be incredibly exciting and mark complete change from conservative party policy the celtic sea off the coast of my constituency have the unique condition of deep water and strong wind offer we the opportunity to be global leader in the new technology of float offshore wind however those unique condition require unique approach from government as we look forward to allocation round will the secretary of state join in work to refresh the approach in the auction so that more support go towards flow project in autumn my hon friend be great champion of float wind in the celtic sea he be right we be proud of the mw project in this round we need to look include in the auction round through gb energy and in other way at how we can build on our advantage in crucial float wind technology take the opportunity that they provide and have the industrial capacity look forward to discussion with he and other colleague on how we make that happen point of order on point of order madam deputy speaker on july the main estimate be lay before the house and pass without debate or vote on july the chancellor come to the house and make statement about the public finance and lay further document call fix the foundations which show wildly different picture of the public finance from that which have be present to we just one work day before naturally that raise concern in the house and number of member question the chancellor of exchequer about it at the time the fact that she be evasive in the debate and frankly look rattle raise further concern today letter from the cabinet secretary to my right hon friend the shadow chancellor have be leak it explain that official know at the time that the estimate lay by the chancellor be incorrect also have letter from the office for budget responsibility in response to freedom of information request that make prior to the recess it explain that the obr be show the content of that document two day before the estimate be lay before the house indeed the obr be give the fix the foundations document in order to fact check it on the day that the estimate be lay before the house of commons that raise number of issue for the house but the one that be most concerned about be whether the chancellor of the exchequer have knowingly mislead the house of commons on the state of the public finance and her knowledge at the time knowingly mislead the house be breach of the ministerial code and want your guidance madam deputy speaker on what the appropriate course of action might be for the house if we can not rely on the financial information lay before we but trust that it be accurate and wave it through we be in very difficult place indeed have notify the chancellor of the exchequer of my intention to raise this point of order obviously once an independent adviser on the ministerial code be appoint can make representation to they but in the meantime we be face with situation where either the estimate or the fix the foundations document be knowingly wrong in either case the house may have be significantly mislead and would be interested to hear your guidance on what we can do about it madam deputy speaker thank the right hon gentleman for his point of order and for advance notice of it he indicate that he have inform the chancellor of his intention to make the point of order which of course be the correct thing to do there be two separate point here the first be one of privilege he should write to the speaker to make the point that he be concerned that the chancellor may have mislead the house the second be about the accuracy of the estimate that be not matter for the speaker but it may be something that the right hon gentleman choose to raise with the chair of the public accounts committee once they be elect next week passenger railway services public ownership bill consider in

before the end of july in each subsequent calendar year clause to stand part the schedule it be good to see hon member so soon after the summer recess know that the secretary of state for transport the right hon member for sheffield heeley louise haigh have be busy over the summer but hope that she manage like the deputy prime minister to find some time to let her hair down when we last meet set out why the conservatives can not support the bill do not doubt that government members sincerely believe in their plan in get rid of privately run train operator and in put politician in charge of run train service but just because an ideological belief be deeply hold that do not make it right it be certainly not the same as use evidence as basis for decision making our railway be vital to our economy million of people rely on train whether to get they to work or school to make essential journey to see family and friend or simply to visit other part of the country our rail system be complex mix of public and private build up over many year one thing it be not though be toy train set to be play with but fear that be the approach this government be take they be rush through this ideological reworking of our rail system despite the absence of solid evidence to back up their approach at time when other country be choose to increase private sector involvement and competition in their rail system there be no good reason for this committee stage to be race through in one day rather than through normal bill committee that would allow proper time for consideration and discussion the time appropriate for such substantial and significant change proper time would allow this legislation to be make well indeed fit for purpose draw on the strength of our rail system as well as the weakness and use the lesson of our experience and that of other while still fulfil the government intention as set out in their manifesto instead in their haste this bill simply take one size fit all approach pull the plug on even the good train operating company despite the mixed record of the department for transport when it come to the performance of the franchise it run already in the government haste the bill lack any control or incentive to reduce the risk of increase cost to taxpayer and passenger we can say the same for performance where in this bill be the incentive to improve that or the protection for passenger should performance worsen when the right hon member for sheffield heeley be at the control of our train in the government haste those thing be miss too in their haste if they do what they say in their manifesto they be go to bring thousand of rail worker into the public sector all under single government employer we will have union recline comfortably on ministerial sofa as they discuss pay for thousand of people fund by the taxpayer with no safeguard to speak of to make sure the taxpayer get good deal on second reading say that some more thought should go into the bill over the summer ask series of question and make number of suggestion at the very least be expect the government to table some amendment but be sorry to report that as far as can see they be go full steam ahead there be no sign that any serious thought have be give to the long term impact of government run train company on growth or on the efficiency of our railway there be barely word on the liability that this bill would transfer on to the government balance sheet and crucially no evidence have be share about how passenger and their journey will be affect fundamentally the government be rush ahead but travel blind press on irrespective of the impact on passenger or taxpayer which they simply do not know the right hon lady have make herself passenger in chief and then set off on journey without know the destination that be not sensible way to govern passenger should always come first above provider union and ideology that be why our first amendment would require the government to set out what impact they believe the bill will have find the hon member comment on public ownership bit rich give that privatisation of our railway have spell year of year of delay and price increase for passenger and eye water profit for private company most people in the uk oppose privatisation at the time and most people still oppose it today in fact clear majority of her own party voter oppose the privatisation of the railway can she not see that the secretary of state in bring forward this bill be serve the interest of our constituent unfortunately the hon member be simply wrong in some of the statement she make be not ideological about this know that there be place for the public sector and place for the private sector in our reform we propose close work together of track and train through great british railways much of which this government be plan to bring forward however there have also be benefit to this country from privatisation include significant growth in passenger number which have not be see in many other country that be one reason why several european country be plan to follow our model and increase competition in their rail service in order to drive up passenger number and provide great efficiency as say moment ago amendment would require the government to set out what impact they believe the bill will have for instance what impact will get rid of private sector train company the good performer as well as the weak one have on passenger fare reliability and the cost of the railway to taxpayer the amendment propose that the government should set that information out clearly in report within the next six month be sure that hon member do not consider that to be unreasonable surely it be the least that any of we would want to see since we all represent both rail user and taxpayer it would mean that we would all know what difference the government expect the legislation to make would hope that the report would be set out in way that stand up to scrutiny that it draw on evidence and that it have suitable level of rigour for something so significant it would also give we all something to hold the government to account against as well as the manager who take over responsibility for train operator to that end our first amendment also propose follow up report in five year time which would articulate the actual impact of these reform that be not lot to ask so hope the government will seriously consider the amendment passenger and taxpayer deserve to know what difference this change be likely to make and then what difference it have make to service and cost to what their money will buy and how wisely it have be spend and to be able to compare the impact of the choice this government be make with those make by government across europe as say several of those government be reform railway in the other direction by unwind their public model and introduce more private provision into their network the shadow minister ask about the benefit that will accrue if this change be make we on the labour benches have be work on it for year so the suggestion that it have somehow be rush be nonsense may gently point out to she that over the year that this change have not be make million if not billion of pound have be ship out of this industry to subsidise and support other nation state railway system if ever there be nonsense that be it star we in the face she talk about ideology the ideology of privatisation have be ruinous for the railway and it be about time that it be correct there be few problem with what the hon member have just say one be that he talk about those figure but the government have not take the time or trouble to set out what the impact of the bill on passenger and taxpayer be expect to be be the government confident about that impact be sure they would have set it out but they have not that be why our amendment propose that they should set it out we also know that while on the one hand there be some saving to be make from management fee will come to that later in my speech the benefit of competition and the pressure of profit and loss and the bottom line drive innovation and bring efficiency that do not necessarily happen to the same extent in the public sector will the hon lady give way no will make some progress for the reason have describe we have also table amendment to put some condition on franchise move into the public sector under the secretary of state plan the running of train on our network will increasingly be task to little know government company call dft olr holdings ltd or dohl the current operator of last resort it seem to huge risk to expect dohl to successfully take over and run every franchise in the country dohl have have shall we say mixed result with the franchise it have take over and expect it to run further on top of the four it be currently operate strike as lot to ask recognise that the bill make reference to that risk by provide for franchise extension where it would not be practical to bring the service in house but under the current plan that would be decide by the secretary of state it be not that do not trust the right hon lady but she have show herself to have great deal of confidence in public operator in the absence of any substantial ground for that confidence have be tell that there be no plan to increase headcount budget or resource of any kind for dohl as it take on that increase in workload from four to franchise welcome the government make an effort to achieve efficiency at the centre but struggle to believe that more than triple the number of franchise bring in house will not involve some increase in resource we therefore think it would be prudent for the office of rail and road to form an independent judgment on whether dohl have the capacity and expertise to take on each new franchise as it come up and to run it at minimum as well as it be already be run that could be do well in advance of most contract end so it would not really be hindrance to the secretary of state plan but it would provide great deal of reassurance to passenger and all of we as their representative about the capacity of the government to successfully take over the function of so many train operating company on impact assessment and how we can have confidence that dohl will improve performance we can look at past performance remind the shadow minister that the operator of last resort currently run franchise since the east coast main line which serve my region be take over by lner revenue have grow substantially since transpennine express be bring back into public sector operation in may we have see cancellation decrease from an average of around to in the last quarter transpennine which be run by the operator of last resort dohl be the most improved operator in term of cancellation score compare with the same period last year accept some of the point that the hon gentleman make that be why say that the record of dohl have be mix sometimes there have be improvement in performance but that be not the case for all the franchise it run that be my reason for not be confident that it be the right organisation to take on such large increase in its workload particularly without any further increase in its resource include some operator that be perform well than the train company that he mention we want every contract that be award to place duty on dohl to look at how to modernise our network and to ensure that passenger be at the forefront of all decision making passenger not just in urban area and around london but crucially in rural area and place that have traditionally be under serve by the rail network time and again the secretary of state have say that her no priority be passenger that she will protect their interest above all else and that it be for they that she be seek this change this be chance to put her money where her mouth be and create legal duty that promote the need of passenger in all future agreement with public sector operator that will build in layer of accountability on thing that we all agree be important on amendment public body mark their own homework be not something that opposition member believe lead to good result know from my time in government that independent scrutiny make life hard for ministers but it also improve accountability and with that outcome that be why we seek to introduce proper financial reporting and oversight for public sector operator under the franchise system whatever its shortcoming train operator be incentivise to increase passenger number and control cost that have be an undeniable success of privatisation passenger number have double and cost have be control increase at far slow rate than revenue in future passenger and taxpayer will have to foot the bill for any loss of control on cost any inefficiency or any failure to innovate that be serious implication and something we should do our good to protect people from create or recreate some incentive be good place to start we will need to know how well the public train company be perform what they be do to increase passenger number and drive growth in rail service how reliable their service be how well they be keep cost under control and how satisfied passenger be with the service they provide our proposal will allow we to identify both good and bad performance hold the manager of those company to account and reward they accordingly such as by link managerial pay to performance those company will no long have shareholder to answer to or the financial incentive that go with senior role in the private sector the government have tell we that part of their rationale for these change be to well align the incentive of train operator with the interest of passenger but the bill currently provide no mechanism for that we be not seek to frustrate change that this government be elect to deliver we simply wish to bring proper transparency and accountability to the process that include report on the cost involve in bring operate company into public ownership government members will no doubt point to the money that will be save by remove management fee but this equation be not one sided while the secretary of state might be save million each year on fee industry expert have predict that the bill could cost passenger and taxpayer up to billion year in lose productivity and growth and that be before account for the government take on all the long term liability of the company pension obligation roll stock and long term lease will all be transfer on to the government balance sheet and we have have alarmingly little information on what that figure will be the shadow secretary of state be make case from her ideological point of view although she deny it run through her speech be deep suspicion of the public sector suddenly she be suspicious about the quality of service for passenger suddenly she be suspicious about the quality of service provide and the amount of money be spend on it if only those suspicion and that scrutiny have be apply by the shadow secretary of state and her colleague while they be in government to the disastrous privatised railway service be she really try to convince this house that privatisation of the railway be in any way success it seem to that she be try to stand as barrier to public opinion and the bill progress because the majority of people in this country support public ownership of the railway and the labour government be elect with that as clear manifesto pledge be sure the hon gentleman be about to finish be thank you will bring my remark to close by ask be it not the case that the shadow secretary of state be be deeply ideological and be only interested in the privatised model and the pursuit of profit regardless of the effect on the public the hon gentleman and probably do have different view ideologically will acknowledge that think that he probably as be imply in his intervention think that profit be bad think that profit can be helpful thing and it be thank to the motivation of people to make profit that we in this economy and those in many similar economy have the prosperity that we enjoy today think that government can do lot but be also thoughtful about when government can help and when government might hinder that be why take the view that in rail sometimes it be right for the public sector to do thing and sometimes it be right for the private sector to do thing one thing that fundamentally think be miss from the bill be scrutiny be not try to frustrate the mandate that the hon gentleman party have to bring forward this legislation think make that clear but want to improve it and improve it involve introduce level of transparency and accountability that simply be not in the bill that be why table my amendment we also seek clarity on how the bill will affect other privately run passenger service on the network it be clear that deep down those on the government benches know that the public sector can not and should not run every service on the network that be why open access operator like eurostar and gatwick express have rightly be allow to continue under these plan open access represent huge opportunity for passenger rail in this country when do right it can provide nimble cost effective service that give passenger great choice and bring in revenue for the network in fact the eu have enshrine in law the right of open access operator in tender for passenger service we be not propose that at this stage but be concerned about how this change will impact on those already operate on the network and what opportunity will remain open to they or other to offer new open access service in future the same go for the future of devolved concessionary model why if government member truly believe that private provider be simply siphon off cash can transport for london and merseyside still run concessionary model while happen to think they should be allow to do so it do not seem fair to have one rule for sadiq khan and another for everyone else what about manchester leeds or birmingham what if they want to run their own transport system in way that suit they my understanding be that the labour government want to build on the progress we have make in devolve responsibility to city and region but this bill look more likely to reduce the option for other devolved authority leave they able to run concessionary model only if they get an exemption under section of the railways act to do so that bring to union and pay the bill will over time create ten of thousand of new public sector rail worker on jumble of anachronistic term and condition there should be an independent body to look at what we be inherit and to advise on what be fair to those employee and the taxpayer each year when it come to pay teacher nurse doctor and our armed force all have independent body that help take the politic out of pay how can it be good idea for rail union boss to sit around the table with ministers negotiate pay without the assistance of an independent pay review body especially ministers who from time to time benefit from generous union donation imagine that the secretary of state herself can see how that would look she must know that it would not pass the sniff test this look like the return of the return to deal do over beer and sandwich in no surely nobody in this country beside the union want to see that happen we have actually just have taste of it with the government recent aslef deal in which ministers skilfully negotiate bumper pay rise for train driver for nothing in return nothing for passenger and taxpayer this no string pay deal mean remove all reform to working practice in other word all the thing that might help modernise the network and drive down fare shortly follow by aslef announce another strike anyway who know what deal be do to get that call off perhaps the secretary of state will be make statement on that we on the opposition benches be blue in the face from make this argument living standard be not raise through inflationary pay rise they be raise by improve productivity would be interested to know whether the hon lady have speak to her immediate predecessor to understand exactly the value of the reform he be pursue as secretary of state and if she be aware that they be worth less than half the cost of every time the railway go on strike under his leadership unfortunately the right hon lady approach be deeply flawed and risk our face more strike in future rather than few interruption yes to directly answer her question can assure she that have speak to her predecessor in the role and know that the reform propose to modernise the railway be crucial not only to control increase cost and fare but to improve the reliability of our train service unfortunately she give all that up overnight when she give away bumper pay deal of almost with nothing from the other side to improve service the independent body be propose would look at pay and term and condition in the round it could shed some light on who be get fair deal and help put modernisation at the top of the agenda in negotiation give that this government seem to be set on create single huge employer across the network as set out in their manifesto which surely mean harmonise pay and term and condition across many thousand of employee none of whom suspect will want to give up whatever term they most value four day working week day of annual leave and the extra money they negotiate to start use ipad be some example can the right hon lady imagine what effect this might have on ticket price and the efficiency of our network an independent pay review body could at least gather evidence and advise government on what make sense to fill job and provide value for money for the taxpayer madam chair be grateful to you for give some time to outline our amendment and be mindful that other member wish to talk to their amendment or make maiden speech so will wrap up my comment with couple of final point as we make clear on second reading his majesty official opposition do not support this bill our rail system need reform and we have set out plan to do that but this bill be not the right way to go about it on the contrary the government be be drive by flawed ideological belief along the line of public sector good private sector bad it be not underpin by evidence of what work and they be not be straight with people about the possible downside such as high fare for passenger high cost for taxpayer and less reliable train why be the government rush through this bill be it to please their back benchers who we know be deeply unhappy about scrap the winter fuel allowance or be it to please their union paymaster know the right hon lady have promise everyone that she be go to move fast and fix thing but this look more like move fast and break thing say sincerely to she as be sure she will want to make this legislation as good as it can be and like want to do the well possible job for all our constituent and for the country we serve that she should please consider the amendment we have table and think hard about give they the government support as point of information and for my assistance it would be very helpful if member wish to be call could indicate clearly that they wish to speak rise thank you call graham stringer that be early than expect ms nokes before come to the amendment have table should say that be probably the only member in the chamber who remember the debate on the national audit office report after the original privatisation of rail and if the hon member for faversham and mid kent helen whately apply her proposal to the original decision to privatise rail against the criterion the then government be use she would find that it have be complete failure remember that when in this chamber ask teddy taylor conservative respect greatly how he justify sell off the railway for less than they be worth which be what the national audit office report say his justification the policy of the then conservative government be that it do not matter because they would take all the subsidy out of the railway have the hon lady be present then and have those test be apply to the original policy the conservatives policy of privatisation would be see to be complete failure the other point would like to make about what the hon lady say which number of intervention from the government side bring out be that huge amount of money have be transfer to other rail system and to pension fund in north america and elsewhere that could have be use to benefit the transport system in this country incidentally one of the reason why passenger number have increase on the railway be that the previous government do not invest in road over many year that have lead to congestion which have force people on to the railway it be not the privatisation of the railway that have attract those passenger those profit have go out precisely because the treasury do not want the debt on the balance sheet but one can not have it both way if we be to repatriate those profit which believe take the railway back into public ownership will do we of course have to take the debt an accountancy sleight of hand because the treasury do not like see the debt on the balance sheet be the direct cause of the profit be take out of this country on the government side of the house there be real enthusiasm for this bill and the soon the train operate company be back in public hand and that money be repatriate to this country the well however share with the shadow transport secretary worry that official in the department for transport may not be up to it excuse may be use to slow thing down because the operator of last resort be not ready and they be worried about take on the extra capacity it be genuine worry but it be problem that should and have to be overcome if we want publicly own railway work for the benefit of passenger and the taxpayer of this country not privatised system have therefore table an amendment to remove clause which could be use as loophole as it would allow the secretary of state to carry on with franchise under certain circumstance ask my colleague on the front bench to be explicit about what those circumstance might be because my worry be that they will be get advice from official in the department for transport who have not cover themselves in glory and have fail with the railway over many many year as the hon member for faversham and mid kent like evidence refer she to public accounts committee report in may that be excoriate in describe the official in the department for transport and how they have deal with the railway system will read some of the conclusion from that report because it should worry we all if we want this bill to work not just to be pass into legislation but actually to work the first point make by this all party committee with conservative majority in may this year be this it have be six year since the department identify the need for root and branch review of the railway but it have achieve very little in this time it then say there have be too little focus on passenger and taxpayer and how to get they well deal those be the first very worrying point from labour perspective the report also say six year since the department start work on rail reform it have fail to resolve fundamental disagreement and clarify key aspect of reform there be other point too but do not want to bore the committee too much the last point be the department have fail to engage with the workforce to successfully deliver its reform ambition that be also very worrying note as well the comment of an official from the department when discuss the appalling performance of avanti which think be permanently in breach of its contract and which have laugh at the government and the travel public as it have receive massive subsidy it be not work for profit it be not at risk it have just be rip off the taxpayer for many year since it take over from virgin in fact dft spokesperson say strip avanti contract would just cause more upheaval for passenger rather than solve the challenge the operator be face these include restrictive working practice that can be reform without aslef agreement think those official could be and have be barrier to reform would not expect my colleague on the front bench to do anything but be loyal to the official who work in the department but would like they to respond on how they be go to overcome some of the potential problem they will find in department they control there be not only the problem where there will be resistance owe to the way the franchise be deal with some of the well train operate company such as greater anglia which have reasonable record will come up first whereas avanti have eight year leave on its contract it seem to that it would be easy for official to recommend deal with the good first rather than the bad which be not in the interest of passenger or the taxpayer we really need as government to get control of that and deal with the bad first because that be where we be lose money that be where passenger be suffer and that be where money be be take out of the system as say do not expect the front bench team to criticise the official they have to work with but hope they will take on board the fact that there be real problem and that we need to deliver right across the rail system to create wholly publicly own industry as soon as possible the liberal democrats first principle be to put the rail user at the heart of any new arrangement for rail passenger service we be ultimately agnostic about public or private ownership so long as what the government propose clearly deliver the improvement on our railway that be so desperately need thank ministers for their prior engagement and for today debate be aware that the bill be only step towards more comprehensive legislation later in this parliament we liberal democrats have table three amendment to address three core issue that be relevant to the bill but might become even more relevant to any future government plan amendment be aim at keep passenger experience under review public confidence in our rail system have be fall year on year great scrutiny be need of how nationalisation will impact day to day travel our amendment will ensure that get fair deal for passenger be the guide principle of the bill do my hon friend agree that an essential part of that be address the problem that the railway face now although the liberal democrats be agnostic on nationalisation as my hon friend say the problem that customer face now be about pricing and timetabling and this bill will not address they thank my hon friend for that intervention and repeat that it remain to be see how quickly that can be address that be really our main point we will scrutinise the government on how quickly these change can be deliver because that be what all our constituent be really ask for our amendment would ensure that an annual report be publish on the effect of public sector contract particularly on the ticketing system fare hike delay and cancellation all contribute to loss of confidence despite that passenger number be up people want to use our railway as clean green way to travel we agree with the government that competition be not work as intend but we can not expect nationalisation to be silver bullet that solve all the issue with our rail service it be therefore vital that the government get clear picture and be fully transparent about the public experience throughout the change the current ticketing system be simply not fit for purpose complicated and inconsistent ticketing be barrier to rail travel if we be to meet our climate commitment green travel must be encourage often hear from my constituent that they find it hard to understand when ticket be good value for money which highlight the need to simplify the entire system when people buy ticket the good value fare should be clear and should be display first there have be case where operator own ticket machine have have an in build bias to sell their own company ticket even if they be not the good value commuter should not have to jump through hoop to find the most effective price amendment would also require look at the effect of nationalisation on digital season ticket and compensation for delay and cancellation delay repay be another big issue on our rail network in the last reporting year train operator close million delay compensation claim that figure be high than the previous year even though passenger journey be only high however current operator treat delay repay claim differently while some passenger can get automatic compensation if their journey be delay other have to fill in complicated form and have to wait unified approach to delay repay be clearly need to improve passenger experience and agree with my hon friend the member for edinburgh west christine jardine that it be absolutely vital that passenger see such change very quickly rather than have to wait for whole system change the same be also the case with season ticket annual pass for similar length rail journey differ immensely across the country depend on the operator an annual report scrutinise how nationalisation affect those inconsistency be essential to reduce they to ensure that passenger get fair deal from nationalisation urge member to support our amendment amendment aim to bring people further confidence as rail company be bring into public ownership the amendment would establish an independent body to review contract make by the transport secretary and public company that body would put the customer at the heart of service as well as deliver put commuter first and hold operator to account the amendment would ensure that if the independent body do not agree with propose contract the secretary of state must explain to parliament why they be go ahead to give the public confidence in our railway the process of contract allocation must be keep under scrutiny and be fully transparent our third amendment be amendment which would require the government to review how the transition to public ownership affect service such as merseyrail and transport for london those service be already under public control but in those case the control be local not national the amendment would allow more service to be operate by local public body in the future we have discuss that in our pre meeting the review would not simply look at direct impact but engage with the local public body themselves on their capacity and their wish to deliver such service if the new government be serious about devolution the option for combined authority to deliver service must be on the table we have already see how devolved authority can deliver rail service effectively transport for london and merseyrail be two such example if devolved authority wish to deliver rail service there must be way for they to have discussion with central government understand that such proposal might be for the future but it be important we put marker down here amendment provide mechanism for that process nationalisation must be means to an end the public at large do not care who be run the train as long as there be good service and travel be affordable our liberal democrat amendment would ensure that the legislation have the passenger at the heart of any change and that the public get value for money rise be come to the end of my remark the liberal democrats want to work with the new government to improve our railway and deliver fair deal for passenger call on all colleague to support our amendment will address my remark to my amendment it be probe amendment whose main purpose be to raise and discuss procurement reform start with good news new job at alstom derby refurbish crosscountry voyager fleet in an upgrade worth million train manufacturing in derby be at death door some month ago and now it have heartbeat with train for the elizabeth line in the pipeline thank the transport secretary and many other hon member for their extraordinary support in the dark day some month ago when hundred of job at alstom thousand when we consider the supply chain and agency worker be be lose the city come together to demand action no one want to see their city or their workplace go through that so we need to see an end to boom and bust replace with consistency and certainty we need crisis and stick plaster to be replace with long term funding and stable project we see failure to act in that way when privatisation happen when british rail be split up there be real concern that the upheaval would crush the world renowne expertise in the supply chain in derbyshire accord to hansard on december in that year alone job be lose nationally that be one of the first unnecessary tragedy of privatisation in spite of that setback more than worker be employ today in europe large and most diverse rail cluster centre around derby it cover every aspect of the railway supply chain since the bill second reading have be pleased to visit and meet with rail forum member include hübner serco db esg resonate and millennium site services which be all enthusiastic about work with this government to deliver improvement to rail the transport secretary say on second reading as private operator be bring in their contract and supply chain will be consider to ensure that they be deliver the good possible service for passenger official report july vol my amendment seek to establish what detail publication relate to that consideration should include specifically the amendment suggest that detail should include the approach towards technological development the management of demand and supply the supply chain future sectoral planning through well procurement we can also speed up delivery reduce cost and create social value that point be make in the maier rail and urban transport review which be recently publish commend the transport secretary on commission it one of its valuable recommendation be that the rail minister should be give responsibility for work in partnership with business to support the establishment of local supply chain capability it make the point that as supply chain capability go up cost and skill shortage come down start with the good news of job at alstom but there be no complacency in derby because we be look five and year ahead and know there be no complacency from the transport secretary on second reading my hon friend the member for easington grahame morris remind the house that to meet decarbonisation goal the uk need to upgrade up to roll stock unit with management of contract and sectoral planning there be enough domestic work to create stable base for train builder and their supplier who can then top that up with export therefore look forward to hear from the minister how we can get the structure right now for delivery in the future will not speak for great deal of time as this issue be largely devolve in scotland however welcome the bill and the scottish government have be keen to support it through legislative consent motion that support the work that have already be do in scotland we have put the railway into public ownership as last resort but the bill will provide stability go forward for the government and the operator and enable they to do much well on medium and long term planning with certainty on what the future hold my amendment bring into the debate the role of roll stock leasing company or rosco many member on the government benches will agree that the rosco be take huge profit out of the public sector roll stock contract in the past couple of year take more than billion each year and the amount of profit be take from that be in the billion over the lifetime of the contract that money could be reinveste in the railway appreciate that it be not for this bill but would like the government to come forward with proposal on rosco in the next bill that will come forward later in the session that be all want to say at the moment do not intend to press my amendment to division but would like some assurance from those on the government front bench that serious consideration will be give to how we deal with rosco and the amount of profit be take start by declare an interest be proud of the fact that be trade unionist and have strong link to the transport union particularly unite the national union of rail maritime and transport workers and aslef indeed as point out on second reading when be young fellow many year ago my first job be on the railway when they be part of british rail in those day be member of the national union of railwaymen more recently serve on the transport committee for almost six year and be delighted that many of the argument and issue that and many other stakeholder raise in numerous session have finally find their way into government bill and on to the floor of the house of commons have serve year in opposition understand the opposition call in their amendment for report performance assessment and impact assessment be familiar with the argument however the bill integrity must remain intact much of the information request by the opposition about performance will be produce routinely so there be no need for separate clause request it thank my right hon friend the secretary of state for transport and her team for prioritise the bill bring it to committee so soon after the recess and keep up the momentum from before the summer believe that the bill will fix structural failure in uk railway by end the presumption in favour of the private sector for passenger service delivery contrary to the view express by the opposition and set out eloquently by the shadow secretary of state the bill will save taxpayer money as profit will be use to improve rail service rather than inflate considerable unwarranted dividend payment to private train operator as my hon friend the member for middlesbrough and thornaby east andy mcdonald indicate the private train operating company be often own by foreign government so in fact we be subsidise the rail fare of passenger in other european country the previous government allow train operating company to pay out hundred of million in dividend while take public subsidy that be financial mismanagement it be bad value for money and exploitative of the taxpayer and commuter the privatisation of the railway be privatisation too far even for she whose portrait should be remove do my hon friend agree that it be utterly ridiculous that the only nation state on the planet not able to run the railway in this country be this one absolutely if ever there be charge of political dogma to be make it must be about the fact that under the term of the privatisation the british taxpayer and the british government be not allow to own stake in our own railway for too long private company have provide substandard service while make substantial profit over the last seven year the remain private train operating company apologise for mislead the committee but misspoke early when say that there be of they there be franchise in total four of which be operate by the state through the operator of last resort have pay out an average of million annually to their shareholder those company be often own by foreign government in germany italy france and across europe and the world meanwhile passenger day to day experience have be of overcrowded carriage delay service failure and bad of all some of the high fare in europe it be worth think about the cost and the profit that some private train operator have be able to generate for shareholder figure release just this week show that govia thameslink railway pay out staggering million in dividend with million of that be for the financial year that represent increase from the previous year in return for those princely profit govia consistently fail to meet two third of its customer service quality target as report in the financial times the situation be encourage to persist under the last conservative government welcome the fact that labour be make this priority from day one as that be fundamental to fix the foundation and deliver the economic growth promise by the prime minister support the comment make by my hon friend the member for derby north catherine atkinson and the hon member for moray west nairn and strathspey graham leadbitter about the roll stock company the so call rosco many commentator see problem with the newly form great british railways have to continue to lease roll stock from rosco as that would allow those company to profit from taxpayer money my view be that rosco be an unnecessary link in the chain frequently raise the issue with expert and industry leader on the transport committee and believe that we would benefit from meet our roll stock need by place order directly with uk base manufacturer such as alstom and hitachi rather than enrich the rosco despite be in post for relatively short time the secretary of state have make strong start with the bill however urge she to consider the point raise by and member on both side of the committee about how we continue to procure roll stock as we move forward on second reading the under secretary of state for transport my hon friend the member for wakefield and rothwell simon lightwood say that purchase exist roll stock would not be responsible use of taxpayer money understand that but will the minister in respond clarify whether in the future under gbr there will be an option to purchase new rolling stock directly instead of have to continue to lease through the rosco as my hon friend the member for derby north say the uk need to upgrade to unit of roll stock over the come decade with network rail estimate cost in the ten of billion of pound so this be an ideal opportunity to explore new financing model for roll stock be not naive understand the financial situation that we have inherit from the last government but ask the government to explore not for profit financier if roll stock can not be nationalise under gbr may point out respectfully that eurofima supranational not for profit financier have state that for every billion of financing on uk railway it could save the taxpayer million over year due to its low financing cost that be compare to use the exist rosco will the secretary of state update we on the possibility of use not for profit financier for roll stock in preference to the rosco will take up the point make by the shadow secretary of state about the pay review body may point out that they be not universally welcome have be look at response to pay review body in the health service and the last government have less than wonderful record when it come to implement the recommendation of pay review body not least those relate to junior doctor the royal college of nursing have say of pay review body that there be nothing independent about they the chair and member of pay review body be hand pick by the prime minister and government ministers and the term of reference be decide by the government there be some scepticism about how independent they truly be and about whether when they make recommendation the government be oblige to implement they in full ask the minister if it be possible to provide timetable for the next step when will future bills be introduce to the house and when be great british railways expect to be fully establish acknowledge and express my appreciation for the engagement of the front bench team stress that support the bill because believe that it represent critical step in fix the long stand issue in our rail system the current privatised framework be give fragmented railway and have fail to deliver value for money an efficient service or customer satisfaction be pleased that we be move towards model that prioritise the need of passenger over the profit of shareholder rethink our approach to rail management and financing be crucial first step towards fix the foundation and put great british railways at the service of the travel public the greens be not agnostic on privatisation we very much support the principle of the bill and look forward to its progress want to make short speech on amendment to which table they be very simple and common sense their goal be to leave open the opportunity for elect devolve body to set up company that they own in order to bid to run railway service under the overall guidance and wing of great british railways the bill which restrict the definition of public sector company to those own by ministers either here or in wales or scotland do not allow for that that seem to clash with the direction of travel towards more public sector devolution with which my party and agree it would improve and future proof the bill if we amend propose new section of the railways act so that ministers could in future choose company set up or own by combined authority or by group of unitary county district or borough council who decide to co operate ahead of further devolution on improve their railway any decision on the award of franchise on the suitability of body to run and own local railway and on where investment should go would remain fully with ministers table the amendment in constructive spirit and hope that they will start

central abtisam mohamed her passion for the constituency that she have be elect to represent shone through in her speech and congratulate she on be the first british arab woman to be elect to parliament really enjoy listen to what would well describe as picture portrait in her word of her constituency will reflect on that next time drive up or down the while also concentrate on my driving of course let now turn to the bill rise to support the opposition amendment particularly amendment and as other have say this be short bill but believe that its aim be radical and ideological it will completely change our rail system remove the presumption in favour of private sector operation of passenger service and allow the government to bring those operator into public ownership when franchise end in short see this move as nationalisation and indeed ideologicalisation although the bill introduce such fundamental change it be also be rush through this place with limited scrutiny for just four hour for committee consideration small bills have sit in bill committees for many more session in fact think that private member bill of mine spend more time in committee than this be disappoint because there seem to be scant regard for what these change will cost be also disappointed because think the bill should be consider alongside the railway bill which be yet to be publish and from my perspective that make the scrutiny of the bill particularly at this stage even more important agree that the current model be not work be former rail minister and when we be in government we acknowledge the need to change and make the case for rail reform however that reform be about simplification not nationalisation it be about bring the track close to the train and put the passenger first let begin with amendment and do not think we should underestimate the need for strict scrutiny accountability and transparency at the end of the day that be what we on the opposition side of the chamber be here to provide without the additional measure propose in the amendment it seem very unclear how the shift from franchise to public ownership will work and how its impact will be assess how will the cost be monitor and where will investment in future roll stock come from another problem with the bill in its current form be the arbitrary transfer of franchise to public ownership base not on performance but simply on chronological franchise date raise that on second reading west midlands trains for example be one of the well performer but its contract expire this month contrast that with avanti west coast as many member have probably experience when travel to this place it be currently one of the bad operator yet its contract expire in my reason for support the amendment be to ensure that through strict reporting and oversight of the new operator we will see target that be link to performance and innovation it be important that they be also link to managerial pay and it be all about keep the passenger at the heart of what we be do it be also important to look closely at how the operator of last resort will manage the many more train service that will fall under its remit be not quite sure whether the olr will have more resource to do that hence the need to have account and monitor what be happen it be also important to understand how and where decision about infrastructure and investment be be make will cite the example of the midland rail hub which the last conservative government commit to it be absolutely critical to growth and improvement in service and not just in birmingham but across the west midland and other region would like to understand how some of the investment will be progress under the new model and how they will be hold to account amendment seek to address the issue of open access operator again raise this issue at second reading and to be fair the rail minister write to and confirm that there will remain role for open access service alongside publicly own service welcome that not least because it give reason to continue to bang on about the need for the government to support the bid for open access for service from wales to london euston via aldridge however we need train station in order for the train to stop in aldridge and we want it to be build by and not push into the siding by the new labour mayor so forgive madam chairman but will keep talk about that until we see it deliver not least because resident be expect it to happen amendment seek to carve out the space for open access operator and ensure that there be fairness in the awarding of contract which will be critical move forward genuinely believe that there be place for both the current system of provide train service and open access operator generally speak lot of they have prove their value to the passenger and the taxpayer will touch briefly on amendment which be about reform term and condition welcome the breakthrough in the pay talk which be very positive but it be really disappointing that it have do nothing to address the urgent need for reform of some of the term and condition see that as be crucial for the future stability of rail passenger service and for have the passenger focus seven day week service that the fare pay passenger expect without the tool to scrutinise the ideologically drive change there be real risk that the bill fail not just the taxpayer but fare pay passenger as many member have highlight this afternoon finally for constituent to be able to enjoy any benefit of rail travel they need access to local station will close my remark by refer to aldridge because it be just one of handful of constituency that have track but no train station urge the minister to join in push his colleague in the treasury and the west midlands combine authority to help deliver train station for aldridge on time call julia buckley to make her maiden speech thank you very much madam chair for allow to make my maiden speech what privilege it be to follow my hon friend the member for sheffield central abtisam mohamed and her move story of her family overcome racism and her personal passion for change be delighted to contribute to this afternoon debate on our plan to introduce great british railways and bring train back into public ownership nowhere will these benefit be feel more keenly than in my constituency of shrewsbury where service be thin on the ground lack carriage and frequent and reliable service most resident and visitor to shrewsbury would very quickly conclude that our town be beauty spot with so much potential but cut off from the wide economic region by lack of robust public transport this be mirror by our inadequate bus service with over route cut since shrewsbury be dream of sunday service or bus after pm to support our young people and our night time economy public bus franchise will make huge impact on so many life we also have high hope for midlands connect plan to electrify

tell they what people feel about certain issue while other create divisive culture war to distract we from what really matter but it should be as clear as day that people do not want more of the same they do not need to be tell that it be go to be painful because they have be in pain for long long time the message need to be one of hope ambition vision and inspiration from listen to the speech not just today but over the past few day and week in the house know that that be not something we be short of people know that underfunded and unfunded promise be make and nowhere have that be feel more than in northern ireland and in my constituency lagan valley alliance proudly go out before the election and campaign primarily on two thing first reform of the institution and end the veto which so often have lead to have no government for the gut of year where be from that be not acceptable we also campaign strongly for fair funding package for northern ireland that be not just political opinion of mine the fiscal commission for northern ireland say that northern ireland be not fund base on need will certainly be make no bone about fight for that in this house it be one thing to say that we need reform of the institution and for the uk government to say that we have win the intellectual argument well guess what we have also win the argument at the ballot box time and time again that be not something will shy away from championing in my time in this house sit around in ballymacash estate on friday and talk to people there about number of thing they be do in that area that be absolutely fantastic that community have go on from year of social exclusion and isolation to develop so much we talk about funding stream and one we mention be the uk share prosperity fund they say

devolve the concept of the nhs definitely be not and will certainly be fight tooth and nail to make sure that it remain the way that it be mean to be so that we do not underfund it and gaslight the patient who need it or the staff who be work in it britain have the few ct mri and pet scanner per person of comparable country as well as shortage of radiographer to run they this have direct impact on cancer diagnostic and the life prospect of our constituent be not one to just highlight problem and walk away there be solution an enhanced windfall tax on energy giant would create revenue that could be use to help safeguard the wellbeing and health of vulnerable individual and in do so prevent future hardship and illness which be costly to the nhs phase carbon tax could help capture environmental cost and cost of inaction allow for investment in green technology and create new job today debate be about the public railway ownership bill if can be brutally honest be not sure that

at their good both be honourable trade and they be trade they be not profession but the big difference between we be the difference between criticism and action between commentary and do in the end could no long just write about the appalling state of our public service want to do something about it want to do something about the nhs worker like my wife who come home every night exhaust by sheer lack of staff want to do something about all those work class kid like whose destiny be still too often determine by their postcode not by their potential also want to do something about this misinformation age that we live in and to combat the rise of extremism that disfigure too much of our discourse it be stanley baldwin who denounce the newspaper baron for want power without responsibility today too many social medium company have exactly that this summer spread of online hate and falsehood be challenge to which this government will have to rise just as they rise to the challenge of crack down on the thug who attack our community and our brave police officer tackle online publisher that be what they be publisher not platform may sound radical but in reality radicalism be often just common sense ahead of its time reminder that all our right be hard win what could be more commonsensical than demand that the vote be give to the working class and to woman more than year ago what could be more commonsensical than this railway bill give the public control over the service that spend billion of pound of their own money what could be more commonsensical than tackle climate change or give town like rochdale more control over their own future town that do not want handout but deserve fair share of the national resource the pennines be famously the backbone of england but the people of rochdale be the backbone of england too common sense radicalism resilience and renewal those be the watchword of my home town of this country and of this government and will do my utmost to live up to they call charlie dewhirst to make his maiden speech thank you madam chair for allow to catch your eye during this very important debate congratulate the

yorkshire well place to live and work before depart this place will hope have do some good return to the topic of today debate privatisation of the railway be necessary because british rail be not work either for rail user or the british taxpayer however the process of privatise rail operator have not be perfect in part because franchise operate monopoly in that respect they be no different from the nationalise service that they replace however where genuine competition exist rail privatisation have be success on the east coast main line the government subsidise franchise london north eastern railway compete with open access operator hull train grand central and lumo that have lead to cheap price for user high satisfaction and great punctuality and inter city service have be extend to new town and city across yorkshire and the north east one of those operator hull train now run two direct service day between beverley and london and would love to see they extend to bridlington and driffield just up the line in my constituency however the legislation put those efficient non subsidise open access operator under threat instead of learn the lesson of those success story and expand they across the network the government be slide back to nostalgic vision of the even though public service be in fact inefficient and expensive for rail user and the public purse the legislation failure to provide specific guarantee to open access operator will mean that there be no incentive for they to invest in new rolling stock or expand their service we need more open access not less minister claim that there be continued role for open access operator where they add value and capacity to the network but they will soon be at the mercy of an entirely nationalise infrastructure and provider do ministers not realise that reborn british rail will work for passenger only if its inter city service face stiff open access competition across the network the east coast main line be mature and successful test case and it should be expand otherwise what incentive will there be for new british rail to deliver cheap and well service none suspect the legislation be as rush as it be ideological the only loser will be rail user and the taxpayer call paul davy to make his maiden speech express my gratitude to you ms cummins for the chance to address the house for

quarter of century to the day since first set foot in parliament forgive the cliché but if someone have tell the year old who be spend week work experience with the mp for south west devon sir gary streeter that one day would follow in his actual footstep would not have believe they everybody have meet since enter this place who know my predecessor tell that have big shoe to fill for some that

west devon today long term battle that he fight and that remain in need of victory one such issue relate to our great western railway line through devon today debate therefore provide the perfect

the line through devon the sight of railway track suspend in mid air with nothing between it and the sea be not easily forget will therefore be campaign cross party alongside colleague to see the new government commit to complete the remedial work at dawlish they must also ensure that forthcoming work at old oak common in london do not hamper the progress make on our journey time between london and the south west the main line through devon do not just take holidaymaker to our beautiful county it be vital for those who live and work there too the west side of plymouth be serve effectively by several small station but to the east in my constituency there be very few option for train travel between plymouth and totnes some minute away indeed the current level of service make mockery of the exist park and ride by train that be advertise as people drive down the will therefore continue to fight for crosscountry train not just great western railway service to call at ivybridge station as the population of that town and of nearby sherford grow have adequate access to mainline train service close than plymouth totnes or in some case tiverton parkway be essential to see the full economic benefit of the plymouth and south devon freeport with its key site at langage and sherford we must see the delivery of metro railway link plymouth with tavistock and ivybridge include stop in plympton that would also enhance connectivity for the dartmoor village which be now welcome part of south west devon follow the recent parliamentary boundary change the previous government plan to reopen the line between plymouth and tavistock be critical to deliver that metro service therefore call on the new government to push forward with that proposal and enable we to get the metro scheme off the ground can only hope that the new government be as commit to support those much need improvement in south west devon as they be to the new legislation that we be hastily debate today bill that seem to indicate ideological time travel back to the nationalise railway system of the past and mistaken belief that state run institution be the answer to all our woe our railway system need to drive forward into the middle of the century not creep backwards to the in the case of south west devon that mean the difference between reach our full potential and miss the mark would waste the opportunity to extol the virtue of south west devon far if leave thing there yes transport be big issue locally whether that be about the need for bus route between plymstock and plympton cycle path in the south hams that do not require mountaineering experience to navigate or improve junction on and off the at lee mill but hope will be allow just few moment to introduce hon member more fully to south west

government propose to award with the end of competitive tendering of franchise contract which historically despite their flaw have contribute to some improvement to cost control and passenger growth it will at least ensure that quality and accountability be present in the process and will be important welcome the government desire to improve our railway but it be important that there be accountability and to remember that public ownership and direction have historically cause problem as well as improvement although the majority of current train operating contract be in the private

important than the delivery in oxfordshire there be many example of action with negative effect that have be take with at least partial public sector approval or sign off they include the withdrawal of high speed train from great western railway lead to inter city train with few carriage elsewhere crosscountry current temporary timetable lead to major service gap through oxford particularly in the evening peak period which be pleased to say the secretary of state have heavily criticise and timetable cut on chiltern railways since the pandemic combine with rolling stock reliability problem that contribute to overcrowding ensure that the good quality public sector arrangement be in place will make it easy for the government to focus on the investment that our railway need so that it can

crucial first step in create reliable well integrate railway that serve every part of our country regional inequality in our country be stark and we need serious investment in infrastructure such as by reinstate the short rail link between colne in lancashire and skipton in yorkshire if we be to see small town in the north of england thrive and prosper believe that public service should be in

will be your champion will fight for you it be my privilege to serve you call david smith to make his maiden speech thank you madam chair it be real honour and privilege to be able to make my maiden speech today as the house debate the role of our railway before continue must give credit to all those who have give their maiden speech today it be quite daunting prospect to follow they all must comment on few of the amazing journey that have bring people here think of my hon friend the member for sheffield central abtisam mohamed and the hon member for lagan valley sorcha eastwood it be quite inspiring to hear their story must also comment on the speech of the hon member for south west devon rebecca smith as we be mutual friend of sir gary streeter it must have be quite sight to see he do the loco motion all those year ago it be of special importance to to talk in the debate today on the role of our railway the east coast main line go right through my constituency in fact think about half of it do because we be the third large constituency in england with station in morpeth alnmouth and berwick today we be debate the government plan over time to put the railway back into public ownership or as some might say into public service that be really what want to address today the idea and ideal of public service all of we be here to serve the public but we can only serve here because of the people who have go before we the people who support we and of course the people who vote for we so first my thank must go to the people of north northumberland include those who vote labour for the first time indeed whether they vote for or not will serve they to the good of my ability my thank also go to my family first and foremost my wife daughter and son who be my bedrock and whose patience with be frankly astonishing but also to the generation that have go before when think about public service think of my grandparent world war two generation we have already hear about monte cassino couple of time well my grandfather fight at monte cassino el alamein and elsewhere and it would have be beyond his wild dream that his grandson would one day be stand here speak of those who have go before in public service must recognise the great work of my predecessor as member of parliament for what be now north northumberland first those two political pea in pod the right hon former member for berwick upon tweed anne marie trevelyan and my hon friend the former member for wansbeck now the member for blyth and ashington ian lavery as former miner and engineer my hon friend will have great interest in the success of the railway and he have also serve his constituent with great distinction and tenacity for many year now anne marie trevelyan public service include many significant role in government include secretary of state for transport and would like to thank she for her graciousness in the handover of the constituency casework must also mention lord beith although he retire from this place in he be still hold in very high regard in northumberland for his nearly year of service if can earn just small portion of the respect that he garner will consider myself fortunate so now pick up the baton and confess that one of the first thing check with name as distinctive as my own be whether be the only david smith mp elect on july imagine my surprise and disappointment then when on the follow day receive congratulatory email from labour member of parliament call david smith thankfully that particular david smith mp be member of the australian parliament be for now at least the only david smith in this place it be convention for member to try and mention every settlement in their constituency when give their maiden speech have mention that mine be the third large in england so that may be challenge it be also traditional for member of this place to make compete claim about how theirs be the most beautiful constituency in the land so be pleased to be able to put that debate to bed surely it be certainty that the land of bamburgh and warkworth castle of druridge bay and holy island of rothbury wooler and the cheviot hill and of the historic county town of berwick alnwick and morpeth be the most beautiful in england the number of member who have holiday in my constituency seem to confirm my conclusion be sure that those who have travel on the east coast main line through my constituency along our magnificent coastline will agree north northumberland be not only beautiful but have produce and give home to some of the most notable public servant in british history who can look past the role that northumberland play in the establishment of early british christianity the northumbrian saint especially cuthbert and aidan be renowned for their faith wisdom compassion and miracle even if today at least accord to my daughter the most famous north northumberland resident with magical power be certain mr harry potter emily wilding davison the suffragette from morpeth be another north northumbrian who fight for what be right emily famously hide herself in broom cupboard here in parliament on the night of the census so that she could record her address as the house of commons to confound those who would deny woman the right to vote be delighted to follow in her footstep and those of william beveridge the mp for berwick upon tweed who author the eponymous beveridge report which serve as the basis for that great innovation the welfare state introduce by the labour government in what would so many of we do without it north northumberland be also home to vibrant and hard work community that serve in their own way whether it be those in the fishery of amble and seahouses the farmer work the land across the constituency from alwinton to norham to keep we feed or the serviceman and woman at raf boulmer who protect the uk airspace the people of north northumberland rightly take great pride in the work of their hand in the county that they call home and in the contribution that they make to the common good nowhere be that more true than in the grand town of berwick upon tweed with its historic wall and majestic bridge one of which the royal border bridge serve the east coast main line my particular favourite though be the union chain bridge for all that it represent for the union between scotland and england we truly have cross border life in north northumberland today we have choice to build either wall or bridge across that border and choose to be bridge builder the truth be that when it come to transport infrastructure and even public service we have choice will we use it for private benefit or for the common good for the common good must be paramount we be of equal value by virtue of our humanity but not all of we have the same opportunity the same start in life or the same challenge to overcome many community in my constituency feel left behind and many feel out of sight and out of mind see the humanity in each other be proactive choice at time over the summer some people in our country choose to ignore the humanity of other with terrible consequence one of the most famous piece of literature in our country history national treasure come from my constituency the lindisfarne gospel how good it would be if they could return home to holy island one day perhaps on the east coast main line as beautiful as their calligraphy be to their primary value come in the wisdom they contain and the story they tell as set out on the task of be member of parliament my thought turn to the wisdom of another part of the good book proverb chapter say speak up for those who can not speak for themselves for the right of all who be destitute speak up and judge fairly defend the right of the poor and needy those be wise word for all with heart for public service especially those of we who call ourselves parliamentarian as for they will be the axiom by which expect my public service to be judge however long remain in this place call katrina murray to make her maiden speech thank you madam chair for call to speak in this debate on public ownership of the railway as lifelong trade unionist who have spend the last year campaign to bring public service back from the private sector this issue be understandably close to my heart congratulate all the other member who have make their maiden speech today new members from across the house have show their passion and their reason for be here very much appreciate the comment make by my hon friend the member for north northumberland david smith for reason that may become apparent it be great honour to be the first member of parliament for the new constituency of cumbernauld and kirkintilloch my thank go to the people of the community that make up the constituency for place their trust in pay tribute to my immediate predecessor stuart mcdonald who be mp for cumbernauld kilsyth and kirkintilloch east for the last nine year it be appropriate that be make my maiden speech as the ballot for private member bills take place in the lobby because the progression into law of his private member bill protect the right of parent of premature baby show that we can all make difference when we work together in the house as stuart mcdonald say in his maiden speech the former member for glasgow south be also call stewart mcdonald and there continue to be significant confusion many member may not be aware well the hon member for mid dunbartonshire susan murray will know that there be far complicate factor locally in that east dunbartonshire council kirkintilloch east and north and twechar ward be very ably represent by councillor stewart macdonald thank all of they for the commitment that they have show to their community wish to thank further predecessor rosemary mckenna she serve initially as member for cumbernauld and kilsyth then as member for cumbernauld kilsyth and kirkintilloch east from to when be young woman activist in the scottish labour party rosemary be one of the big influence on that eventually bring to this place she be one of the people who sit down and say maybe you should think about stand the new constituency of cumbernauld and kirkintilloch run from the boundary of glasgow in millerston to the boundary with falkirk at castlecary and be bisect by the motorway it be serve by croy station on the main glasgow to edinburgh express railway line with stepps greenfaulds and cumbernauld be on the local line from glasgow rail service be vital in constituency where people travel to work cumbernauld be designate new town in but it have very rich history it include cumbernauld village and its weaver and condorrat and the rich farmland between the campsie hill to the north and the luggie water to the south there have be settlement there since before roman time the northern boundary of roman britain the antonine wall run through the constituency the bar hill fort garrison by people from across ancient europe and the middle east which be establish to protect the wall be still accessible from twechar evidence of the mining history of the constituency remain strong there be the kilsyth victoria cottage hospital one of the place in the constituency where first go to work the remnant of the miner row which be now farm outhouse and the vast swathe of new housing build on former colliery land in cardowan chryston kilsyth and twechar it would take far braver woman than to make comment about football in the week lead up to or follow an old firm game cumbernauld most famous outing on film be in the bill forsyth classic gregory girl for those who be not familiar with the film it centre around school football team who experience significant improvement in form when one of the girl dorothy turn up for the trial and subsequently play up front as striker this film be firm murray family favourite our house be burgle when be quite young and the young member of the murray family be probably more upset that the gregory girl video be in the recorder that have be steal so it be poetic that one of scotland big woman team rangers women play all their home match at broadwood in cumbernauld be sure that can pass on the good wish of probably most in this house for when the team face arsenal woman team in the semi final of the first qualifying round of the champion league tomorrow as have say one of the big selling point of the constituency be its connectivity to scotland central belt city if there be to be that connectivity we need proper integrated public transport system base on public need rather than on the most profitable route no matter which part of the constituency be in what people want to talk to about most be public transport whether it be an amend railway timetable that mean that there be no service after be on sunday or bus service that get cancel because there be no cover to allow the driver to take break during the summer holiday the youth group at twechar healthy living and enterprise centre plan day trip to millport use the bus service it involve multiple bus and ferry but it require phone around to get lift back to the village for the last leg of the journey as the twechar bus stop run at pm like most of we have spend more time than be healthy consider the basis of my politic and value one benefit of make my speech later on be that have be able to listen to the maiden speech of so many other member when the hon member for dumfries and galloway john cooper make his maiden speech he

to university and when we have get our qualification embrace life of service be proud to come from family of teacher doctor civil servant health worker school staff and social care staff be also proud of the fact that my parent be here today we be support in challenge thing that be not fair and stand up for ourselves it be probably no surprise that end up trade unionist in the health service fight

have deliver some fabulous maiden speech today with such quality passion and dedication to serve and love for their community it make really proud to be member of this house and be certain that the memory of deliver their maiden speech will live with they forever will begin with amendment and to table by the hon member for faversham and mid kent helen whately these relate to monitoring report and scrutinise the impact of public ownership and the effectiveness of train operator amendment would require the publication of two report the first would outline the anticipated impact of public ownership that would simply duplicate the impact assessment publish early this year and therefore would be redundant the second report would assess the actual impact of public ownership some year after implementation wide variety of datum be already routinely publish about both public and private sector train operator performance that include reliability punctuality service quality customer complaint and financial performance among other measure the bill do not change any of that and there be no need to wait five year to consider whether train operator performance be improve amendment would require the secretary of state to procure independent report about the cost of the contract award to public sector operator the department already publish information on payment make to operator whether private or public there be therefore no need for the taxpayer to fund separate body to report the same datum nevertheless the hon lady be entirely right to take an interest in the cost of these contract in that spirit would gently remind she that end the taxpayer funding of private profit will result in an immediate and endure reduction in these cost amendment also raise the specific question of whether public ownership will expose the government to liability that have previously sit with private operator under the current national rail contract the government fund the cost legitimately incur by train operating company that include for example the net operational cost of run service and the cost of meet pension liability prior to the pandemic franchised operator bear some cost risk but be protect by the taxpayer against among other thing inflation and in more recent contract risk on movement in pension deficit recovery payment the franchising system mean that bidder simply price any change in liability into their bid mean that the taxpayer be expose to liability in the long term public ownership therefore do not materially change the government exposure to liability in the long run amendment would require the annual reporting to parliament on various aspect of the performance of public sector operator and amendment would require an independent report on the impact of public ownership on the performance and efficiency of the uk rail network again datum be already publish on wide variety of aspect of train operator performance include by the office of rail and road in its role as regulator the bill do not change that the office of rail and road also provide independent scrutiny of the performance and effectiveness of network rail enforce compliance with its licence and conduct five yearly review that set its funding and what must be deliver with that funding amendment and look to require independent monitoring of the financial and operational performance of public sector train operator the department hold train operate company to account for their financial management through regular review of their management account and business plan that apply to both public and privately own operator in addition in england publicly own operator be oversee by dft olr holdings ltd know as dohl as hold company own by the secretary of state dohl be experience in review and monitor the financial arrangement of the company it manage and contrary to what the hon lady say it be build its capacity in readiness to take over more service at the same time public ownership will reduce the other contract management cost because there will no long be the same commercial tension of the taxpayer interact with private profit amendment refer specifically to the auditing of publicly own train operating company account it be already the case that dohl and the operator it oversee must publish their audit account annually turn to amendment train operator be already monitor under their exist contract against target for punctuality reliability and service quality they be also hold to account for manage within pre set cost budget limit each financial year drive up operator performance in those area be vital and the government will continue to review train operator performance regularly in those and other area this have be an early priority for my right hon friend the secretary of state for example in her first week in office ministers hold meeting with the manage director of avanti west coast transpennine express and their network rail counterpart to set clear expectation for immediate improvement in parallel with these arrangement the government be develop detailed proposal for hold the future great british railways to account for performance this will form part of the broad package of reform that we will set out in the forthcoming railway bill we expect these arrangement will be in place long before the five year review propose in number of amendment table amendment also refer to performance improvement plan mechanism to require improvement plan be already feature of the government contract with both public and private sector operator the secretary of state have recently put in place formal remedial plan with crosscountry in view of its unacceptable level of cancellation and service reduction finally amendment raise the question of senior management remuneration when performance be poor this matter can be consider when remedial plan be be put in place take account of the circumstance in each case amendment also table by the hon lady and amendment from the hon member for bath wera hobhouse both propose additional procedural step to be follow before contract be award to public sector operator amendment would require the office of rail and road to publish an opinion on the practicability of transfer service to each public sector operator clearly it be vital that service be transfer to public ownership smoothly without detriment to the quality of service during the transition for that reason the transfer of service will take place use well establish arrangement and process dohl have significant experience of manage the transition of service from private to public operation in recent year will the hon gentleman give way will not give way to the hon lady as she have have plenty of time to put her case those transfer of service have be complete successfully and smoothly despite the challenge timescale and circumstance which have include financial failure and poor operator performance we have also make it clear that we will transfer service on phase basis as exist contract expire over the next few year this be measured responsible approach that will far de risk the process the bill do not alter the orr role in grant operator licence and issue their safety certificate in that role the orr already independently assess the suitability and readiness of any operator public or private to take over service and operate they safely in light of those safeguard the government do not see the need to commission further analysis from the orr as amendment propose on amendment the department for transport have already award multiple contract to publicly own operator and have considerable experience of manage they in practice take legal financial and technical advice as need we consider new independent advisory body to be an unnecessary additional step that would add cost and risk delay progress can assure the hon member for faversham and mid kent that the department for transport be conduct full review of the standard term of service contract enter into with public sector operator reflect the fact that public sector operation be to be the government long term approach not just temporary measure of last resort on amendment and the government do not consider it appropriate to spell out such specific contractual requirement in primary legislation which would risk constrain future flexibility to adapt operator contractual obligation to suit change circumstance on amendment specifically it would not be efficient for the taxpayer to require up to different operator in england plus those in scotland and wales to each pursue its own separate wide range innovation strategy indeed key purpose of our wide reform plan be to drive much more coherent cross industry approach in such area on amendment question why the four group identify while clearly of course very important should be single out for specific mention when there be many other relevant consideration to take into account in service design include the interest of the taxpayer freight user people with disability and resident of urban area to name just few the list could be endless and the important point be that decision about future service level should take into account all relevant consideration amendment table by my hon friend the member for blackley and middleton south graham stringer would remove the power of the secretary of state to continue exist franchise be happy to reassure my hon friend that this provision be include in the bill as contingency measure only it exist in case short continuation be need to ensure that service transfer to public ownership smoothly and without disruption to passenger it be intend to be use only in exceptional circumstance and only for so long as necessary to ensure the smooth transfer it will be available to the secretary of state only when it will not be reasonably practicable for transfer to proceed any continuation would be limit by procurement regulation to maximum of two year in duration but in practice we would expect the period to be much short the power be clearly transitional in nature once service be transfer to the public sector it will no long be relevant and clause therefore give we the power to repeal it in its entirety this be sensible pragmatic precaution that exist simply to smooth the transition to public ownership and protect the travel public from disruption hope that explanation offer my hon friend some reassurance move now to amendment table by the hon member for moray west nairn and strathspey graham leadbitter the bill do not affect the provision of roll stock it would not be responsible or affordable for the government to take on the cost of renationalise billion of pound worth of roll stock when there be so many other urgent pressure on the public purse however public ownership will open the door for much more coherent approach to plan the long term roll stock need of the whole industry once great british railways be establish plan the provision of roll stock across the network will be one of many area where single direct mind for the railway will add real value we will develop long term industrial strategy for roll stock that support manufacturing innovation and interoperability and align with the wide objective of the industry it will look to end the boom and bust cycle of roll stock procurement ensure sustainable pipeline for future work and consider the good financing structure for future order in partnership with private capital can assure my hon friend the member for easington grahame morris that we will consider the point he have raise as we undertake work on this matter my official be engage with eurofima to consider the potential of uk membership and the role that could play in the uk market we will set out more plan on that in due course report mandate that in primary legislation be therefore not necessary in the government view amendment table by my hon friend the member for derby north catherine atkinson seek detail of the government propose approach to procurement and the impact of public ownership on the procurement process and the supply chain she be absolutely right to highlight the crucial role of the broad and diverse private sector supply chain in help to deliver high quality rail service and very much welcome the contribution make by business in her constituency and right across the country can assure she and those business that innovation and technical progress will remain as fundamental as they have ever be in deliver improvement for passenger cost efficiency for taxpayer and benefit for the environment can confirm that there will be no immediate impact on the approach to procurement when service transfer to public ownership exist private sector operator be already require to follow the same procurement rule as public sector operator under the governance reform great british railways will provide much clear long term direction across the whole railway system give business and the supply chain the certainty and confidence they need to plan invest and innovate for the future amendment table by the hon member for faversham and mid kent consider the bill potential effect on open access operator the bill be specifically about the ownership of service currently operate under the contract with the secretary of state and scottish and welsh ministers public ownership of those service will not prevent open access service from run as they do now the report propose by her amendment be therefore unnecessary however take this opportunity to reassure she about the role of open access in the future in the context of the government wide reform how we make use of network capacity and grant access be fundamental to the performance of the railway and what it deliver for all its user open access operator such as hull train lumo and grand central be valuable part of our railway we be keen for such service to continue to operate alongside publicly own service where they add value and capacity to the network the hon lady amendment along with amendment from the hon member for bath and amendment to from the hon member for brighton pavilion siân berry touch on the role of devolved and local authority in the planning and delivery of rail service amendment and each refer to exemption grant under section of the railways act those exemption allow service in london and the liverpool city region to be procure by the relevant authority in those area outside the franchising system the bill make no change to those exist arrangement and it will remain for those authority to decide how good to deliver the service for which they be responsible amendment to would allow the secretary of state and scottish and welsh ministers to award contract to company own by certain elect public body while the government be commit to strengthen local involvement in the planning and delivery of rail service it will be important to ensure that do not undermine the plan for great british railways to act as direct mind that provide coherence consistency and clarity for the whole railway to support that the government intend to award contract specifically to public sector company own by the secretary of state via dohl our amendment be not just about the current arrangement with merseyrail and transport for london it be much more about have the discussion about how local authority and local area can enter into franchising agreement in future if they so wish do not think that the bill stop they do that now though we have no plan to extend the scope of that look ahead to the railway bill the government have already say that there will be statutory role for devolved leader in scotland wales and mayoral combined authority in govern managing and planning and develop the railway network that will ensure that decision making be bring as close as possible to local community turn to amendment table by the hon member for faversham and mid kent which propose an independent body to advise the government on employment term and pay for rail staff under public ownership that be an important issue and one that the government be determined to get right my official be at the early stage of explore number of option include pay review body so that we can consider the most appropriate approach to meet the need of transformed industry last but by no mean least come to amendment table by the hon member for bath which deal with fare ticketing and passenger compensation naturally we be keen to see rapid progress in those area we be commit to review the overly complicated fare system change be already be deliver by extend pay as you go in the south east and through fare reform on lner we will explore the option for expand ticket innovation such as digital pay as you go and digital season ticket across the network and we will hold operator and in due course great british railways accountable for progress on these vital reform we also intend that powerful new passenger watchdog the passenger standard authority will independently monitor standard and champion improvement in service performance against range of measure thank hon member on both side of the committee for their contribution to the debate hope that my response will have provide the explanation and reassurance that colleague be seek and that that will enable they not to press their amendment and to support the bill on third reading it be pleasure to conclude the committee of the whole house for the opposition and it have be pleasure to sit and listen to another set of distinguished maiden speech from member on both side join the minister in the tribute he pay to the speech make from the government benches pay tribute in particular to the hon member for thurrock jen craft for her move remark about her commitment to her daughter and to the hon member for hendon david pinto duschinsky for his powerful remark about how his life be inspire by the bravery of the woman who save his father life on the opposition side of the house we have maiden speech from my hon friend the members for bridlington and the wolds charlie dewhirst and for south west devon rebecca smith my hon friend the member for bridlington and the wolds do fantastic job of sell the tourist credential of his constituency and proudly declare himself the member for both pig and lobster be sure that his passion for the place where he grow up will serve his constituent well my hon friend the member for south west devon speak proudly of the history and beauty of her constituency the house will be rich for her experience work for the war graves commission and her interest in foster caring we also hear from my right hon friend the member for aldridge brownhills wendy morton who use her previous experience as rail minister to explain clearly the change that we need and have seek she also highlight the lack of evidence and arbitrary nature of the government approach as well as the lack of thinking about the bill implication at local level for project such as the west midland rail hub that bring to the matter before we where be afraid my ability to find word of praise dry up as my hon friend the shadow transport secretary outline we have be ask today to rush through major change to the operation of our railway on the back of rush second reading and without all the benefit of full bill committee what exactly be it about give stakeholder in the railway industry the chance to share their view in bill evidence session that the secretary of state be so afraid of wonder what witness might have raise perhaps the fact that the facade of simple solution to the challenge on the railway present by the secretary of state have already fall away in the intervene week since second reading on second reading she praise the already nationalise lner service while chastise private sector operator warn they that they need to get their house in order can not decide whether the aslef leadership be just be unkind to she or have mischievous sense of humour because the day after crudely champion the no string deal they have secure from the government where do union boss announce they intend their next round of industrial action to be not in one of the private sector operator that the secretary of state be rush to wrest back into public control but in the publicly own and run lner there could be no more definitive answer to the question of whether the bill will make any real difference if public sector operator be the answer the secretary of state might want to ask aslef why it describe its public sector manager as brutal bullying promise breaker the risk for passenger and taxpayer be in stark headlight thankfully the industrial action have be call off though passenger travel plan be disrupt this weekend it seem that we will avoid protract strike but what concession be make to aslef and what involvement do ministers have we have no idea and we will have similar lack of transparency in future if the bill pass unamended what of the private sector operator that the secretary of state have be so critical of and critical of we for allow to continue what can we learn from her dealing with they despite all her warm word to her back benchers what have she do since second reading use her exist contractual power to bring operator such as avanti back into public ownership if she really believe that will make difference she have quite literally spend year repeatedly describe it as fail she have have almost two month to remove the franchise from it which she could legally do if it be in breach of contract and not deliver as she have repeatedly imply be sure that some of her back benchers will have notice that she have not do that it be yet further proof that she know that the question of who run the railway will not make material difference the secretary of state know that bring avanti and other into public ownership will not miraculously solve anything in fact the seven most punctual operator last year be private sector operator of the seven bad perform operator for cancellation in four be publicly run at the start of the committee the shadow transport secretary outline number of important question which hop the minister would answer in support of his argument that we should vote with he tonight how will accountability for improve performance be achieve how will cost be control how will innovation and reform be drive forward how will pay negotiation be conduct fairly for taxpayer those be basic question that after year labour should be able to answer but we will vote tonight with they unanswered want service to improve in that respect we all want the same thing but the bill as be have little chance of make that happen it will just result in back room deal that will more likely put union boss first and bring no guarantee of improve performance for passenger respect and value railway staff but government have wide responsibility to taxpayer the government have the right to proceed anyway but our amendment aim to at least ensure accountability and transparency and would make passenger not union boss the focus we seek to ensure the good use of the committee time so we will not press amendment to division but with permission of the chair we will press amendment and to vote as the one most able to secure the good version of the bill amendment make it crystal clear that the primary duty of public sector operator be to passenger whatever ideological change this government make to the ownership of the railway that should never change amendment aim to prevent repetition of the no string deal give by labour to its union boss donor and to ensure independence in the process time and again labour ministers have support the importance of independent advice in determine the pay of public sector worker every single labour mp voting against this amendment lay bare the stranglehold that the rail union boss have over their prime minister and secretary of state if they single they out for special treatment they will need to justify to other public sector worker in their constituency why rail union boss be exempt from the process that to apply to teacher soldier nurse and million of other staff to reiterate we on the opposition benches be in agreement that change be need but practicality and what work should come first not this rush ideological approach member in all part of the chamber can see that our amendment simply create safeguard for passenger and taxpayer and ensure transparency and fairness hope that government members can see the benefit of that and agree even if they be convinced of the benefit of nationalisation that there be well way to do it in that spirit call on they and all member to support our amendment and to deliver well bill in the division lobbies this evening amendment by leave withdraw clause order to stand part of the bill clause future provision of service amendment propose page line at end insert every contract make in accordance with subsection shall place duty on the public sector company to consider the need of passenger resident of rural area resident of area underserve by the rail network and the wide rail network when consider make change to exist service level helen whately question put that the amendment be make the committee proceed to division will the serjeant at arm investigate the delay in the no lobby

clause to order to stand part of the bill schedule agree to the deputy speaker resume the chair bill not amend report bill not amend in the committee consider third read beg to move that the bill be now read the third time it have be an extraordinary privilege to take this bill through the house as the first major piece of legislation to pass through the commons under this labour government the work to rebuild britain and return to politic of service start the moment we enter office we pledge to act decisively to get our country move and our public service work set out my motto for the department for transport to move fast and fix thing which be why this bill waste no time in fulfil one of our central manifesto commitment call time on the year ideological privatised experiment on our railway that fail passenger fail to modernise our railway and fail our economy it be why this government have begin the work of reform by bring service back into public ownership so that our railway will finally be run in the interest of passenger there will be immediate benefit our railway will serve the british public be they passenger or the taxpayer and as we bring service into public ownership we will drive up performance we will remove the burden of the million of pound squander every year in private sector management fee we will bring service into public hand as soon as their contract expire but if operator fail to deliver in line with those contract if they continue to let passenger down time and time again will not hesitate to use every tool at my disposal to drive up standard include terminate contract early where appropriate in my meeting with avanti and transpennine and in the rail minister meeting with northern london north eastern railway east midlands railway and crosscountry as well as their network rail counterpart we have be clear that we will not tolerate for any long the poor performance that the last government tolerate my official will drive improvement use the mechanism in those contract that work be already bear fruit last week lner and aslef resolve their long stand local dispute at no cost to the taxpayer prevent day of industrial action while ensure an improved service for passenger as result there be no driver cancellation over the weekend or this morning the first time that have occur for many year last month we end the long strike in our railway history it be strike that cost the taxpayer hundred of million of pound in lose revenue and cost the economy more than billion pound and strike that the conservative party deliberately prolong and provoke at enormous cost to the taxpayer and passenger passenger centre railway need workforce reform do not shy away from that fact as we move towards great british railways we will waste no time drive those reform forward this be an area where the party opposite totally fail that be quote from the former conservative rail minister who be no long in this place to his credit unlike his colleague he have at least have the decency to apologise for what he put our country and our railway through we be under no illusion the bill be not silver bullet it be the first stop on our journey to modern railway for modern britain we will introduce separate legislation later in the session on the wide reform that be require fix the industry crumble foundation be the only way to deliver the last improvement that passenger expect and deserve provide national leadership and single point of accountability great british railways will bring track and train together it will plan service on whole system basis it will increase innovation while cut waste it will put an end to outdated working and management practice and end the operational meddling of whitehall that have characterise the industry particularly post covid in short we will create simple safe and more reliable rail industry relentlessly focus on passenger and on grow our economy that of course can not happen overnight but as passenger in chief be not prepared to wait that be why today have make write ministerial statement formally stand up shadow great british railways in order to bring together the department passenger service network rail and the operator of last resort for the first time in year the railway will begin to act as one coherent system and there will be the political backing for decision to be make in the public interest shadow great british railways will review performance and finance it will begin work to modernise our railway and unblock barrier to ticket reform and will start to make urgent improvement now for passenger and freight before finish thank the under secretary of state for transport my hon friend the member for wakefield and rothwell simon lightwood for his excellent work support and dedication of time to get the bill through the house also thank the clerks chairs and parliamentary counsel and of course my fantastic official who have work at pace and do an excellent job support we in our first two very short month in office finally be hugely grateful to hon member from all part of the house for their scrutiny and collaborative approach add my congratulation to the many hon member who make their maiden speech during the bill passage the bill represent line in the sand it show that the government be willing to roll up their sleeve and do the hard work to fix what be break and reform what do not work get this right matter for people up and down the country for whom the railway be their route to opportunity it matter for community that need reliable railway to support business retain talent and attract investment and it matter for this mission focused government because the railway underpin our effort to rebuild britain from build economic growth to provide clean energy and to deliver hope and opportunity to everyone wherever they live commend the bill to the house call the shadow secretary of state we recognise the government mandate to nationalise the railway we be not seek to frustrate that but simply to improve their legislation have hear the argument of government members and the secretary of state in support of the bill but remain unconvinced and unreassured we agree that rail need reform but we disagree on how to do that think we agree that passenger be the priority but it seem that we disagree on that too because government members have just vote against simple amendment that would have ensure that public operator serve the need of passenger include in rural and underserved area would have hop that we could agree on the importance of control cost include one of the big cost that the railway face which be that of the workforce but again we clearly disagree on that the government have cave into aslef pay demand with no string no modernisation pay deal and now government members have vote against our proposal for an independent pay review body simple mechanism to help the right hon lady make sure she be not steamroller into concede to excessive and expensive pay demand by labour powerful union paymaster however welcome the hint from the minister with responsibility for local transport that the government may be consider introduce something along those line and look forward to hear more about that here we be on third reading of the bill after just few hour of debate rush this bill through make no sense at all why be the government throw bone to their back benchers in return for their backing cut to the winter fuel allowance be it to please the union that donate to labour member campaign be it distraction from dodgy appointment and the conduct of their rail minister in the other place or do the government front bencher believe this to be minor change though it be not be that why they think so little scrutiny and parliamentary time be require urge the government to think long and hard about the amendment we have put forward although we do not agree with this plan as have say we accept their mandate to deliver it we be simply propose sensible change to protect passenger and taxpayer and urge they to reconsider during the lords stage of the bill question put and agree to bill accordingly read the third time and pass petition closure of high lane post office rise to present this petition on behalf of the resident of hazel grove constituency it relate to the propose closure of high line post office should also mention the relate petition with over signature collect by the staff from the post office anita natalie and georgia and the online petition on my website which have over signature the petitioner request that the house of commons urge the government to keep the post office open in its current location and not to close it follow be the full text of the petition the petition of resident of the hazel grove constituency declare that high lane post office should not close on september and far declare that the post office service be vital for the local community the petitioner therefore request that the house of commons urge the government to remain open the post office in its current location and not to close and the petitioner remain etc unpaid carers motion make and question propose that this house do now wakeford call wendy chamberlain thank you madam deputy speaker it be great to be back and to see you in the chair congratulate you on your new position care or be care for be an almost universal experience almost everybody will find themselves be an unpaid carer for their love one at some point in their life or be care for by love one who among we do not know somebody who be help an elderly parent or support family member with long term illness as new mps will come to learn almost every week here we have an opportunity to learn about and mark national awareness day for different devastating illness for every person suffer from those illness there will inevitably be family member unseen support and care for they accord to the recent census there be million unpaid carer in england and wales but those be just the people who recognise themselves as such in carers uk research estimate that there be up to million unpaid carer whichever figure we use that be huge number and the figure be grow accord to very recent research publish by the joseph rowntree foundation by there will be an increase in the number of unpaid carer and as degenerative condition include chronic degenerative condition become more prevalent the amount of care that carer do be predict to go up it be expect that ever more will provide more than hour of care each week the government should care about carer not just because that be the right thing to do and not even because unpaid carer be in home across every constituency in the uk but because we need they unpaid carer be absolutely vital to our economy and our society commend the hon lady for bring this debate forward the house be full than usual for this adjournment debate which indicate the importance of the issue every one of we know people who be carer care for my brother who have big accident year ago and understand what it mean to be carer and to be available at all time as other do do the hon lady agree that respite for carer be an essential component of support and that inability to access respite care will push many into make the unwanted decision to give up care and instead institutionalise the people they care for due to the unbearable pressure on their mental health be grateful to the hon member for that intervention he be absolutely right and as he and know have serve in the last parliament during covid the lack of respite care be critical factor for many carer it be clear that we all need to do more in that area we be talk about how vital carer be to our economy and society the economic value of unpaid care be billion year in england and wales billion in scotland and billion in northern ireland we know the country finance have be leave in ruinous state by the last government and that the social care system be already stretch to breaking point we must also know that we can not take the contribution of unpaid carer for grant so hope that the minister will take tonight as an opportunity to show that the government do care about unpaid carer in debate shortly before the general election be call the then shadow minister for care who be now minister the hon member for gorton and denton andrew gwynne commit labour to develop new carer strategy if it form the next government there will be carer strategy under the next labour government because we value the vital work our carer do it will be cross government strategy with the department for work and pensions department for education and the future of work review all feed into it along with the department of health and social care there be bright future for those live with dementia and their family and carer labour will deliver it give that promise hope that the minister can understand why and many whom have speak to in the care third sector be disappoint that unpaid carer be not mention at all in the labour manifesto at the same point in the speech just refer to the then shadow minister say that unpaid carer will be at the heart of labour plan in government official report may vol hope the minister will take tonight debate as an opportunity to make that case thank my hon friend for bring forward this adjournment debate and of course for the work she do before this parliamentary session on what be now the carer leave act one of the reason why become involved in politic be that the day before start my master degree my mum be diagnose with breast cancer study my degree part time over two year to look after she and my little sister who be just five look back it be clear that be fill the role of carer but do not identify as one that be key point to note if we be to have carer strategy recent carers trust survey find that of those who provide or have provide unpaid care do not identify as unpaid carer do my hon friend agree that national carer strategy should prioritise the identification of carer across all sector order this be an adjournment debate and intervention must be super short be grateful to my hon friend it demonstrate how prevalent caring be in our society when we have member who have direct experience of it identification of carer or people identify themselves as carer be key issue that any strategy should address the then shadow minister be right that we need cross government strategy this be not new idea because we have have such strategy before the last one be draw up all the way back in but the problem that unpaid carer face have not go away unpaid carer be significantly more likely to be in poverty than the rest of the population the most recent datum available from the department for work and pensions the family resource survey show that just under third of household in receipt of carer allowance be food insecure compare with of household as whole that be huge difference to assess food insecurity the survey ask the respondent whether in the past day they have have eat less than they feel they should because of lack of fund they have be hungry but not eat due to lack of fund or they have lose weight due to not enough money for food it also ask whether they or someone in their household have go without eat for an entire day because they lack money for food far the survey find that of household in receipt of carer allowance that be just more than one in every eight have use food bank in the previous month compare with just of household overall commend the hon lady for her work to ensure that the million of unpaid carer in the uk be both value and support as have already be mention commend she for successfully bring forward her private member bill the carer leave act under that act carer have an entitlement to week of unpaid leave do she agree that further action be need to ensure that those carer juggle work and care can continue to stay in employment avoid the poverty trap that she describe absolutely agree with the hon member my party policy be that carer leave should be pay at the moment we be formalise system that already work for people in ask for time off unpaid with the employer agreement and potentially not take sickness or annual leave they be not get remunerate for take that leave and be cognisant of that go back to my evidence on food bank the research from the sector align with that survey datum the joseph rowntree foundation report on uk poverty find that of carer live in poverty more than half of the carer who respond to the carers trust adult carer survey in say that they be struggle to make end meet as result of those caring responsibility as the hon member just say one of the main reason for unpaid carer be in poverty be that it be difficult to stay in work as carer especially full time work commend the hon member for secure this excellent debate across the united kingdom some of carer be woman with many have to give up employment reduce their hour or take less qualified job do she agree that need to be top priority when the government be look at this issue yes absolutely agree when we think about pension inequality we know that woman be more likely to be care and so be unlikely to be able to build up full pension entitlement which compound the poverty that the hon member describe carers uk report on the difficulty of juggle unpaid care with employment find that around people day be give up work snapshot from the family resource survey refer to early show that of adult informal carer be retire and be economically inactive be proud to acknowledge that since then we have hopefully see some improvement in the ability of carer to balance work and care have pass my carer leave act in give employment right for the very first time to unpaid carer however know from the work that have do that that be not enough one of the reason for this debate be because there be minister in the department responsible for unpaid carer the dwp see the impact of family live in poverty the treasury be in charge of the overall picture but the department for business and trade have responsibility for employment practice want to highlight the need which the government previously recognise for cross government work on support unpaid carer the one thing that the dwp be responsible for that could help unpaid carer would be grateful if the minister take this away be carer leave as the minister know could give whole speech on how that benefit need reform which would help rather than hinder unpaid carer but accept that be not his remit appreciate the hon member bring this matter to the house we can see clearly from the cross party representation in the chamber that it matter to everybody many in those role be actually young people whenever we be talk about employment right and worker right it be important that we remember young people and particularly young carer who may be care experience on top of that do she have an opinion on that be grateful to the hon member will be say bit about young carer but carer allowance which be talk about at the moment do need reform my understanding from speak to colleague be that young people undertake level be potentially lose out on carer allowance because of the number of hour they be require to do be sure that that oversight need to be correct when unpaid carer be tell that they can work only hour week at the national minimum wage the number of hour keep go down because of how the calculation be make without lose their benefit when they be leave struggle because carer allowance provide the low level of benefit of its kind and when system be set up so that unpaid carer find themselves thousand of pound in debt from inadvertent overpayment that inevitably have an impact on their own health and ability to provide care to their love one the resilience of our age population be also very much in the remit of the department of health and social care we know that pensioner poverty be deeply link to health outcome and the demand for nhs service during the cold winter month we also know that provide care during someone work year mean miss out on vital opportunity to save for retirement lead to much high prevalence of poverty among unpaid carer appreciate that the minister can control pension but want to mention another thing outwith his remit education be young carer be more uncommon than be an adult carer but the impact over that person whole life be so much great as my hon friend the member for harrogate and knaresborough tom gordon say do my hon friend agree that one other department that might be quite interested in cross government strategy be the treasury my constituent amanda have civil penalty apply on the basis that she misrepresent her earning which have make she frightened to go back to work or to work more hour do my hon friend agree that it be damaging to the economy if we have people not go out to work agree with my hon friend if the government aim be to grow the economy they must in addition to other measure be target those people who be economically inactive not because they can not work as result of their skill knowledge or capacity but because their caring responsibility prevent they from do so be conscious of your direction madam deputy speaker so if the house allow intend not to take any further intervention otherwise will not get through the remark that want to make want to mention fife young carers which support young people in north east fife and about overall across fife some of those carer be as young as five year old care for love one as child have significant impact on their education in the last parliament the all party parliamentary group on young carer and young adult carer carry out an inquiry that find that young carer be miss on average day of school each year and be less likely to go to university than their peer we know that how child do in school have vital long term impact on their future employment indeed the education secretary be talk about that the other day and just about everything in their future the position of young carer give we clear example of how the lack of an overarching strategy fail unpaid carer early this year want to question the then government over the exclusion of young carer from carer allowance build on question ask by the hon member for slough mr dhesi the reason that the dwp give be that supposedly young carer in education can rely on educational grant for support therefore ask the department for education about support for young carer it turn out that there be no specific support for they because they be not consider to be part of vulnerable group it mean that the dwp can abandon financial support of young carer to the department for education which seem to think that young carer can rely on their parent for income that show what happen and how support for arguably an incredibly vulnerable group can get lose without overall leadership yet more government departments have role in the health and wellbeing of unpaid carer accord to carers uk state of caring report of unpaid carer be lonely and of carer have to cut down on their hobby and leisure activity care for love one should not mean be isolate from your own support network or have to give up the thing that bring meaning and joy but clearly it do for many either because they can not find the time in the day for themselves between work if they can stay in it and caring or because often they simply can not afford to participate any more this be the moment for the ministry of housing communities and local government to get involve with its overarching responsibility for leisure and the service provide at local level be talk about respite break which the hon member for strangford jim shannon mention support service and access to local leisure facility cross government strategy could also engage the scotland wales and northern ireland offices and ensure that similar priority be discuss in intergovernmental meeting with the devolved nation there be many root cause and solution to the problem face by unpaid carer and they span all government departments the minister be here as the minister for care but hope that he be also aware of the impact of all the cross government issue that have set out on the health of unpaid carer be sure that he have learn much in recent week last year state of caring report on health find that of unpaid carer say that the impact of care on their physical and mental health would be challenge it find significant impact on mental health with say that they be stress or anxious and say that they be depressed it be therefore no surprise that research carry out by dr at the university of birmingham have find that unpaid carer be group at high risk of suicide that be particularly true for parent carer of child with long term illness or disability of the participant in her study of unpaid carer have think about kill themselves it be clear that we need vital preventive healthcare for unpaid carer but clearly that be not in the remit just of the department of health and social care again reiterate why we need cross government strategy appreciate that even if strategy be announce this evening it would not just be in place overnight it could not be and it should not be its goal need to be co design with unpaid carer and the organisation that represent they it need organisation buy in and leadership for it to work and take meaningful action it ought to be sponsor at the high level of government and engage all the departments that have mention it need ringfence funding it will not surprise the house that have mention funding the last strategy be support by million in funding that may sound like big figure when we keep be tell that difficult decision have to be make but it be nothing compare with the economic value of unpaid care which as have say amount to billion per year do not want to pre empt the goal of the strategy they need to be design with unpaid carer themselves but first priority should be as my hon friend the member for harrogate and knaresborough say the proper identification of unpaid carer unpaid carer may not recognise themselves as such or know what support service be available to they professional and organisation play vital role in identify they through gps hospital local authority workplace and educational setting national carer strategy will provide leadership and strategic direction it will put the need of unpaid carer at the high level of government morally practically and politically it be the right thing for the government to do do not particularly like the title of this debate on the order paper the word potential be insert to keep in line with the rule on neutrality in debate title it make it sound like the merit of the strategy be arguable which clearly they be not choose to read potential in different way national carer strategy have an abundance of potential to create improvement that have not yet be realise look forward to hear the minister remark thank the hon member for north east fife wendy chamberlain for secure this debate on this critical issue as she rightly state it touch the life of million of people across our country and agree that it require our full attention want to start by pay tribute to our unpaid carer and young carer who play such an important role in our community they give so much to other and want to take moment to thank they for the enormous contribution that they make let we also recognise and appreciate the work that the hon member have accomplish in bring about the carer leave act last year it be an important piece of legislation which take significant step towards help unpaid carer juggle work and their caring responsibility as she will be aware this government be commit to review the implementation of carer leave and to examine all the benefit of introduce pay carer leave this government be also commit to ensure that family have the support that they need we want to ensure that family be well able to look after their own health and wellbeing not just that of those they care for we be aware of the importance of unpaid carer have break from
