impartiality and complaint regularly meet the bbc chair and director general and will continue to use those meeting to raise these important issue start my career as bbc reporter and firmly believe in the importance of our national broadcaster be both independent particularly at moment and era such as this and completely impartial however every year many people complain that the bbc be not as impartial as it should be even that it be biased and the bbc then dismiss the vast majority of those complaint do my right hon and learn friend think that the public would perhaps have more confidence in how those complaint be investigate if they be investigate independently from the outset my hon friend be absolutely right the public rightly expect the bbc to be an exemplar of impartiality our review highlight issue in relation to both impartiality and complaint as result the bbc will undertake significant reform on both impartiality and complaint at the charter review as have already say

biased comment and social medium of have space in which information and news be present impartially and in accordance with editorial guideline the bbc be criticise from the left and the right which probably reflect the fact that it generally get thing right the hon gentleman be absolutely right that the bbc play critical role it be extremely trust not only here but across the world the bbc be an important institution which be why it be so important that it remain impartial know that the director general agree and like think there be more to do that be why in the mid term review we set out thing that the bbc continue to need to look at the bbc agree with our mid term review and have accept all our recommendation short term lets national registration what progress her department have

course to implement the change by the summer call the shadow secretary of state the unregulated black market for gambling cause untold devastation to people life even when they be try to quit so what be the government do to protect family from the illegal black market in gambling the hon lady be right to highlight the danger of the black market that be why as part of the white paper we say that we

announce last week that swimming pool and leisure centre be at the top of its list for significant budget cut in the come year give the lack of public transport be concerned that young people will not be able to learn to swim and the wide community will lose access to the healthy lifestyle that leisure centre offer will the minister meet to discuss how we ensure people in such stretch out rural area will be able to access leisure centre go forward we provide that funding for swimming pool precisely because we recognise the particular challenge they face give high energy bill more broadly we be provide over million of support for facility up and down the country include rural area that will help we to get more people active which be key strand of our get active sport strategy would my right hon friend the minister be willing to meet to discuss the challenge face by leisure centre in local authority area face budgetary pressure such as shropshire he mention the swimming pool fund but there might be other opportunity to sustain these vital resource for local people include those in shropshire it sound as if need to have cross shropshire meeting to discuss facility in that area we have be clear about the funding provide for swimming pool as part of our strategy and determination to get more people active we will be do piece of work to understand the location of black spot where we need to do more to provide more facility and what those facility should be to address local need charity cost of live what step her department be take to help support charity with increase in the cost of living the government have invest million of pound to support charity across england with the cost of living pressure include the million community organisation cost of live fund which

today triple threat of rise cost fall income and high demand have create what the national council for voluntary organisations have call cost of give crisis with half of all charity say they be at full capacity and some have to turn people away what further step can the government take to ensure charity can continue with their vital work have be head of fundraising for charity recognise the position charity face when donation fall at the minute they need to help more people that be why we have provide million in funding and add another million from dormant asset to help charity in that difficult situation call the shadow secretary of state on monday it be privilege to speak at the launch of the state of the sector report which find that charity be prop up government service by billion year will the minister tell why the government expect the charitable sector to pick up the tab for government responsibility in the first place clearly the hon lady do not understand the charity sector if that be the position she be take have work in it for year will not be lecture on this for example find that the hospice work in be able to respond to the need of family in much well and more holistic way than the state sector could be proud of the contribution that charity make to this country and long may that continue ai creative industries what discussion she have have with representative of the creative industry on the impact of ai on that sector recognise the enormous potential of ai but also its risk have have extensive engagement with the creative sector on these issue include series of roundtable talk on ai with among other medium music and film representative be now work closely with the secretary of state for science innovation and technology on programme of further engagement with the sector thank the secretary of state for that answer but creator across the creative industry be concerned about ai developer some of whom be worth as much as billion use their work without consent and without compensation the inability of the government work group to agree code of practice on ai and intellectual property fuel concern that the status quo be work only for the developer this will be grow problem if voluntary code be not go to be possible how will the government and her department in particular ensure that creator will be pay fairly when their work be exploit understand this issue and the concern that my hon friend have mention know that as chair of the culture media and sport committee she understand and appreciate these matter want to assure she that the conclusion of the initial public offering working group be absolutely not the end of our work to find an appropriate regulatory solution for ai we be absolutely committed to ensure that ai development support rather than undermine human creativity for example we will be focus on ensure great transparency from ai developer and that ai output be properly attribute it be also right as she highlight that creator should be compensate for their work good morning mr speaker ai firm be commit large scale abuse of copyright material use copyright image and piece of medium to train their ai tool without consent or compensation for copyright owner the united kingdom government say that they want to reduce barrier to ai company but that can only come at the expense of creator and artist how do it make sense to sacrifice the of uk gdp that come from the creative sector in favour of less than quarter of per cent of gdp that ai produce recognise the point that the hon member make in relation to the importance of protect creative right the creative ingenuity that be such an important part of both our british culture and economic value that be why be hear from the sector and why in the government ai white paper we recognise the importance of ensure great transparency from ai developer we be continue to work on that across government call the shadow minister be sorry but the government answer to the chair of the culture media and sport committee be load of hot air that could have be write by chatgpt except chatgpt would have do well job of it the truth of the matter be that the government flagship on ai as it relate to creative industry which be mean to be protect the moral and economic right of artist musician and author while at the same time recognise the important advance that ai can bring have sink last june the secretary of state say that if the code of practice be not achieve legislation could be consider so in the word of paul simon when be she go to make new plan stan would just point out that the labour party have say absolutely nothing in relation to what it would do so to stand up here and say that we have no plan be absolutely unacceptable can be absolutely clear that we do have plan we have work very hard with the sector we have already set out in our white paper the step that we be take on very important aspect in relation to transparency will continue to work with the sector on all these area to ensure that this extremely complex matter come to satisfactory conclusion for the creative industry charity lotteries annual sale limits for what reason charity lottery have annual sale limit if she will take step to remove annual sale limit on charity lottery the limit for society lottery allow they to raise funding for charity but to remain distinct from other form of gambling and from the national lottery the limit be last increase recently in but be aware that some operator want to see the limit raise or remove entirely it be important that any decision that be make be base on strong evidence as such have commission research in this area which hope we will review by the end of the year the people postcode lottery fund some brilliant organisation across batley and spen include the fantastic rainbow baby bank in heckmondwike and the game changerz youth provision in birstall however the current sale limit prevent the people postcode lottery from give away even more grant to worthy community organisation across the country in all our constituency will the minister therefore explain why casino and bookie for example do not face sale limit but charity lottery which be low risk and fund so many valuable local charity face that barrier as say at the reception that the people postcode lottery hold the other night it be my privilege to set up society lottery when work in hospice recognise the value of such lottery to charity and be aware of the issue that the ppl have raise have work with the gambling commission to suggest way that it can grow under the current network as it be the large brand in the sector but as say want to see more research we need to understand what the potential harm be and what the potential effect be on the national lottery there be not enough datum at the moment that be why be commission independent research so that we can make decision base on evidence clearly in my vast and far flung constituency it be difficult for charity to raise money as member can imagine to date some in community grant have be award to those charity that be very welcome indeed the minister mention that consideration will be give to raise limit or perhaps abolish they altogether may make an impassioned plea that the particular circumstance of remote part of the uk be consider when the decision be make recognise the vast contribution that these lottery make to charity particularly those that work in rural area of course we will make sure that we take evidence on all those issue be sure the hon gentleman would agree that we want to make sure that we be develop policy base on evidence but that do not detract from our recognition of the enormous work that these lottery do and we be incredibly grateful to they multi sport grassroots facilities what recent progress she have make on implement her department multi sport grassroot facility programme the government have commit over million to multi sport grassroots site across the whole of the uk this be part of our mission to ensure that every community have the pitch and facility it need so far site have be support that include funding for grass pitch maintenance at waveney football club in my hon friend constituency create many more opportunity for people of all background to get active the development of multi sport grassroots facility be very often lead by one sport which then face variety of obstacle in get other sport authority to participate in particular project what step be my right hon and learn friend take to remove those barrier and to promote collaboration between different sport authority so that much need facility can be build welcome my hon friend question because it allow to champion the fact that as requirement of the government investment in grassroots facility of project need to clearly benefit sport other than football such as cricket rugby basketball or netball in england the football foundation and sport england work closely with the national governing body of other sport to encourage the development of multi sport project to promote collaboration between club at local level over million girl lose interest in sport when they become teenager mainly due to lack of confidence and feeling judge but we know how beneficial sport be for mental health and there be many other benefit how have the department include gender in the implementation of the multi sport grassroot facility programme welcome that question we have national sport strategy to get million people more active that be focus on try to get those who be currently inactive into sport as the hon lady rightly mention woman and girl be less active in sport than boy and man so we be focus in particular on that with national taskforce that bring together all relevant departments and national govern body to ensure that we get more woman and girl involve in sport across the board do the secretary of state accept that grassroots sport can play hugely important part in level up as part of darwen million town deal we have invest in our football club our cricket club and our skate park and we be about to open brand new five side pitch will she talk with the secretary of state for levelling up housing and communities to see what part her department can play in ensure that sport play its proper part in enrich the cultural life of people in area with levelling up bid my right hon friend be huge champion for his area and for the north in general he be absolutely right that sport drama creativity all those thing level up an area be very happy to talk to my right hon friend in the levelling up department to consider how we can continue across government to support the north have recently visit sport club in honiton include youth rugby gymnastic and football they be all seek support from the local authority east devon district council on the basis of its sport pitch strategy the government multi sport grassroot facility programme be very welcome but do the secretary of state consider it generous enough for youth sport give that the co benefit of sport for young people include sense of camaraderie good health and civic pride our strategy be help sport across the board but recognise in particular the importance of get young people involve in sport we have invest around billion in sport for young people include million for multi sport pitch and million in school so that more child get the required two hour of physical education we be also invest across the board in youth service to get more young child active in constructive activity rather than in less appropriate one topical questions if she will make statement on her departmental responsibility be proud of our government record in support the creative industry figure publish last week which be sure opposition members will welcome show that our powerhouse creative industry grow by in generate an enormous billion for uk plc put we ahead of our ambition to grow those sector by an extra billion by of course much of that depend on the amazing talent of britain many in the creative industry be benefit from the government target tax break which be power those industry do the secretary of state agree that we need to support local initiative to encourage more girl to get into or back into and remain in sport myself enjoy long and prosperous rugby career playing in national league will she join in congratulate somerton rugby football club on its new girl rugby skill and social night more girl should have the opportunity to play sport that be traditionally the preserve of the boy that be why we be encourage all school to offer all sport to all their pupil whatever their gender in addition we be back woman football with million for pitch across the country to which girl will have priority access it be absolutely right that we continue to encourage girl and woman to take up more sport gainsborough be once the capital of england under the incomparable sweyn forkbeard it be an historic market town with the old hall at its heart what plan do the government have to preserve the character of historic market town such as gainsborough thank my right hon friend for raise the beauty and heritage of gainsborough heritage of course have vital role to play in level up and can act as powerful catalyst to increase opportunity and prosperity we recognise the opportunity that historic high street give we and we have million high street heritage action zone programme that be drive the regeneration of of our town and city believe that gainsborough have previously be recipient of heritage lottery programme and we also have scheme to help with historic church call the snp spokesperson coverage of yesterday commons chaos show how desperately we need good quality journalism so be concern about bbc scotland request to ofcom for reduction in its broadcast news output especially the loss of the nine bbc scotland tv news have something of couthie image until the nine come along place scottish news in the context of uk and international news it be compromise offering for those who want scottish six on bbc although the nine create pathway for young talent say at the time that its slot tuck away on channel that many struggle to find could be its undoing and now it have be pull in an election year we need more scrutiny of politician not less and the need for properly resource scottish six remain hope ofcom will say no to the proposal and know that the cabinet secretary for culture angus robertson oppose the reduction in news output do the minister be aware that the bbc be look at change its programme mix in relation to news in scotland my understanding be that those change be cost neutral but hear what the hon gentleman say and appreciate that he have concern about they he will be aware that we do not hold direct power over the bbc programming mix be sure that the director general have hear his concern as say think the bbc be still invest in quality news content in scotland but it may be that the mix be change and the hon gentleman be clearly unhappy about that cheadle town fc have be member of the north west counties football league since however the oversubscribed division leave cheadle town and other south manchester club at risk of be move laterally into midland division mean significant increase in the club travel cost and an impact on gate break their identity as northern club and challenge their future viability have meet the football association and raise the club concern will my right hon and learn friend join in urge the fa to review its process and listen to south manchester club that want to keep their team northern my hon friend be massive champion for her area she have previously raise this issue with and with the sport minister as she rightly recognise level five to of the english football league system be administer by the fa and decision regard which league team play in at those level be for the fa in its role as govern body be sure the fa be listen to my hon friend concern and will have hear her plea this morning call the shadow minister this week in the house raise with the economic secretary to the treasury the fact that serious delay in his majesty revenue and customs issue form mean that tour musician be wait month to be pay form ensure that musician do not have to pay additional tax when tour in the eu but some musician be wait six to nine month or even year for those form one lead singer tell that musician feel like hostage of hmrc incompetence so what be the secretary of state do alongside treasury ministers to sort out this mess which be hit uk musician so hard recognise the importance of tour to many of our fantastic industry we have bilateral agreement with many other country to ensure that touring can take place but will continue to ensure that as government we take every step across the board to make sure that our musician can tour appropriately what assessment have the minister make of the bbc proposal to launch four new national music radio station and to relaunch an exist station radio sports extra to my mind those proposal be direct imitation of commercial broadcaster innovation and the time and resource that the bbc be invest could be well spend in reverse the cut to bbc local radio source of distinctive public service content that be not available anywhere else on the same medium my hon friend be stalwart of the radio scene would like to pay tribute to the year career of steve wright another stalwart of bbc radio have speak to the director general about the launch of new radio service and he be very aware of the strength of feeling in this house about the proposal for local radio the mid term review say that the bbc should engage much more closely with the market ahead of the launch of any new station but ofcom also have power to make judgment on these matter before any new station be launch now that the government have move to repeal section of the crime and courts act there remain no legislative measure to convince print medium to sign up to the state regulator so how do the government plan to finally give the state regulator the power to do its job as call for by the national union of journalists be very proud that we have free press and think it be really important that we repeal section to ensure there be not chilling effect on our reporting of course since that be first propose we have have great self regulation and be sure the press will continue to ensure that they do their outstanding job in an appropriate fashion can we recognise pickleball as national sport and will the sport minister come to the dunstable hunters pickleball club where he will see man woman grandparent and grandchild have wonderful time how can possibly resist such an invitation laughter people be laugh but this be become more and more popular sport for anything that get people active and enjoy sport can only be positive so be happy to come to see it in action on the annual sale limit on the people postcode lottery the minister say that he want to have some evidence on why an additional increase be necessary since the advent of the pandemic funding and fundraising have come under increase pressure and that have lead to charity in my constituency closing saje scotland domestic violence charity be unable to access funding so the evidence of the need be there for everyone to see will he at least consider an additional uplift to the annual sale limit in the interim so that charity can access meaningful funding and be not force to close down because of lack thereof think it be important to put it on record that almost every other society lottery be nowhere near those limit but do recognise that it may be get tight for some of the individual trust in the people postcode lottery we have be speak to the gambling commission to see what else it can do by use some of the other trust at its disposal to increase that funding but take on board the point the hon member make do my right hon and learn friend agree that individual sport club have role to play in provide youth service in that respect can thank the government for fund lichfield sport club and chasetown football club which have both receive grant for the work they do grant that reach up to million my hon friend be absolutely right he be fabulous champion for lichfield and be pleased that young people in lichfield be get the benefit of government funding the government promise to protect music creator from the potential negative impact of artificial intelligence rely on deal between tech company and the music industry however it emerge early this month that those discussion have collapse will the secretary of state admit that their plan have fail and say what the government be go to do about it to support the creative sector wish labour members would actually read our white paper on ai because in that paper we recognise the importance of this issue and the importance of protect the creative industry the white paper set out what we be do about transparency which be key issue we be of course continue to work with both side of the industry the ai tech giant and the creator to ensure we come to an appropriate resolution of this issue refer member to my entry in the register of members financial interests will the minister please update we on the independent regulator and can he quite literally get the ball roll to get this bill in front of the house my hon friend have be doughty campaigner when it come to the issue of football regulation and it be good for she do say that do you know be tell that the hon gentleman be difficult man to ignore but it be always worth try try hard be do you worry order maybe you can carry on that conversation afterwards my hon friend have do lot of work in this area we be absolutely committed to introduce the recommendation of the white paper which we have publish and bill will be publish shortly the chair of girlguiding uk have recently inform that with government funding girlguiding can at least be sustain in three overseas military basis will the minister update on his discussion to ensure that girl live on uk overseas military basis can continue to access girlguiding know the hon lady have do lot of work in this area and we have good westminster hall debate on this girlguiding be an independent organisation and must make its own organisational and directional decision the department be work closely with the foreign commonwealth and development office the ministry of defence girlguiding and representative from overseas territory to see whether we can come up with solution what be the government do to promote facility for padel tennis we work closely with national governing body such as the lawn tennis association it have do amazing work train teacher across the country to teach tennis padel tennis and so on go to see it myself recently at the national be not do very well here know that but my hon friend raise an important point and will continue to raise it with the national govern body in due course there have be number of late postponement of football match recently cause massive inconvenience and put many fan include barnsley football club fan seriously out of pocket have suggest to the english football league that it adopt postponement promise that would stop that from happen will the minister work with on that the hon gentleman raise an important point and have hear that from fan in my constituency it be decision for football but will be happy to raise the issue with the various league recognise the impact that such postponement have on fan up and down the country do my right hon friend share my concern that the large number of inquiry that ofcom have launch against gb news for conduct itself in exactly the same fashion as other channel routinely do be in danger of look biased and political and that ofcom be in danger of put itself in judicial review territory the government and be in favour of medium plurality and it be important that different channel express different view across our vast political landscape be pleased that gb news have choose to be regulate by ofcom and know that ofcom carry out its job appropriately house of commons commission the hon member for broxbourne represent the house of commons commission be ask protection for members of parliament what support and protection be

close contact with the diocese of london and local church but there clearly need to be more dialogue will ensure that that happen recently have the pleasure of visit the holy trinity church at

be lover of our rural church suggest that he point the churchwarden and the priest to the comprehensive advice on the church of england website and perhaps have further conversation with the diocese and local police if there be still issue ask he to come back to about that thank the second church estates commissioner for that answer we live in an age where modern technology be available as method of address these issue but be incredibly expensive what fund be issue to we in northern ireland through barnett consequential to ensure that church can adequately secure building with security camera and cctv if there be currently no funding could that be consider when we take into account the rural and isolated status of so many church building be sorry to tell the hon gentleman that as far as be aware this area be not cover by barnett consequential again direct he to the advice on the church of england website which can be see by church in northern ireland if there be particular issue be happy to have quiet conversation with he in the tea room to see how we can share good practice to try to help his church asylum seeker if the church will have discussion with the secretary of state for the home department on the church guidance for clergy on support asylum seeker whether the church provide training for clergy on support asylum seeker wish to convert to christianity what guidance the church issue for clergy on support asylum seeker wish to convert to christianity both archbishop have offer to meet the home secretary and the church have provide advice and guidance for clergy to consider when deal with request for baptism from asylum seeker the guidance refer to the need for discernment and recognise that there may be mixed motif on the part of asylum seeker request baptism welcome that meeting those who be genuinely seek to convert to christianity should of course be allow to do so but be my hon friend aware that there be grow concern in this country that the church of england naively at good and deliberately at bad be be see to aid and abet asylum seeker in get around the law of this country and remain in the united kingdom may urge the church of england to update its guidance entitle support asylum seekers guidance for church of england clergy as soon as possible to ensure that it be in alignment with new legislation pass in this house that guidance be be

east worthing and shoreham tim loughton as well when there be plenty wrong and plenty to complain about it be not always the case that we should blame the establish church be it be grateful to my

pain to say this but do the hon gentleman agree that deal with both those very important historical challenge for the church appear to be beyond the capacity and will of its current leadership and that perhaps our establish church might benefit from fresh start at the top the right hon gentleman take these issue very seriously and have long involvement with the church of england start with the

vital next step we be not in denial and we will put thing right the right hon gentleman also know very well how the general synod of the church of england work it be sovereign body it meet again this

government other government around the world and multilateral body such as the united nations to advocate forcefully for freedom of religion or belief follow the implementation of much of the groundbreaking truro review the uk be now see as global leader on religious freedom however sadly persecution be exponentially increase across the world so we need to embed that work do my hon friend agree that like government religious leader need to commit to strategic thinking structural change and the provision of additional resource if together we be to effectively tackle this global scourge indeed do on embed that work it be good news that my hon friend international freedom of religion or belief bill have successful second reading in this house on january and that it go to committee in april be glad that the bill be strongly support by the foreign secretary and that the bishop of winchester have offer to take it forward in the other place of course he be the person who write the original report however my hon friend challenge be fair as our government step up on this global challenge the church of england and the anglican communion need to as well will pass her remark back to lambeth palace that complete the question but would like to answer sir charles the security of all member really matter it be take very seriously in this house work be ongoing and be have serious conversation about what we do go forward can tell you that we have some of the good people work on it and would like to thank they for what they do post office horizon scandal urgent question to ask the secretary of state for business and trade if she will make statement on financial redress for sub postmaster and outstanding issue relate to the post office horizon scandal as back bencher first speak on the matter of compensation for victim in march which be obviously long after the right hon gentleman first campaign for it pay tribute to his campaigning on this subject which remain undiminished my appetite for compensation for postmaster be equally undiminishe although accept the need to increase the pace of delivery as of this month million have be pay in financial redress to more than victim affect by the horizon scandal more than of eligible full claim receive have be settle as follow conviction have be overturn and full claim have be submit of which have be settle application to the horizon shortfall scheme have be receive and have be settle full claim have be submit to the group litigation order scheme and have be settle our top priority remain ensure that victim can access swift and fair compensation we have introduce optional fix sum award of for victim with overturn conviction and of for group litigation order member as swift mean of settlement and of original applicant to the horizon shortfall scheme have receive offer of compensation today we be discuss what other measure can be take to speed up compensation with the horizon compensation advisory board on which the right hon gentleman sit since the prime minister announcement on january official in the department for business and trade and the ministry of justice have be work at pace to progress legislation for overturn conviction relate to the post office prosecutorial behaviour and horizon evidence will provide further update to the house very soon thank you mr speaker for grant the urgent question draw the attention of the house to my interest as member of the horizon compensation advisory board like the minister he campaign on this issue before he be minister and he have be very good minister but lot of that good work be undo on monday by the performance of the secretary of state for business and trade be disappointed that he have not take the opportunity today to talk about the overturned conviction understand that later today at there will be write ministerial statement on the subject do not think that be the way to do it as the house need an opportunity to discuss the overturned conviction will ask the minister few question it be quite clear now that nick read the post office chief executive write to the lord chancellor basically oppose the overturning of all conviction say that up to people be guilty it be not yet clear who instruct he to do that on monday the secretary of state say it be do off his own bat would like to hear what the minister have to say on that if there be to be overturn conviction they can not just be about horizon they should also be about capture evidence that have put to the public inquiry and send to the minister yesterday clearly indicate that the scandal predate horizon those affect need to be include in both the compensation scheme and among those with overturn conviction the board be meet this afternoon and we have make recommendation to the minister on how to simplify and speed up the compensation scheme will he give an assurance to the house that once the recommendation be agree we can announce they quite quickly primarily to restore to the sub postmaster some faith which be wreck by the performance of the secretary of state on monday if the minister write ministerial statement at be about overturn conviction will he give commitment to come back to the house on monday to give an oral statement so that the house can interrogate he and discuss that issue thank the right hon gentleman for his question the overturned conviction be key priority for and my department be always keen to update the house whenever can there always have to be sequence to ensure that we follow proper process what we be do potentially affect the devolved administration so it be really important that we engage with they properly that be one of the reason why we need to make the write statement later today have never be unwilling to come before the house and report on what we be do will of course continue to do that on the letter from the chief executive to the justice secretary be aware of the allegation by mr staunton they be very serious allegation that should not be make lightly or be base on vague recollection if the right hon gentleman look at the letter from the former permanent secretary it be clear that she believe the allegation be incorrect and that there be never any conversation along the line refer to by mr staunton think it be pretty clear that those allegation be false the right hon gentleman have regularly bring up capture we be keen to continue to engage with he on that to ensure that those affect be include in any compensation where detriment have occur note his point about an oral statement as say be always keen to give such statement whenever possible and to be interrogate on our plan do not think he will be disappoint by what we announce later today now that the then permanent secretary have outline that she do not implicitly or explicitly tell the then chairman of the post office to slow down compensation hope we can spend time less time talk about someone who have lose his job and more time talk about postmaster who have lose everything will the minister who be do great work in sort this out recommit to august as his target date for get compensation life change compensation out of the door as soon as possible thank my hon friend for his work on this matter as my predecessor he do tremendous job the most concern allegation we hear over the weekend be about the delay in the payment of compensation in her letter which be publicly available the permanent secretary write it be not true that make any instruction either explicitly or implicitly in fact no mention of delay compensation appear in either note so agree with my hon friend that we should move on from that and focus on what really matter which be get what he rightly describe as life change compensation to postmaster as quickly as possible that be his and will remain our no priority call the shadow minister let first pay tribute to my right hon friend the member for north durham mr jones for secure the urgent question and indeed for all the work he have do over many year along with other member in try to secure justice for sub postmaster the post office horizon scandal be one of the most insidious injustice in our country history it have rob innocent people of their livelihood their liberty and all too sadly their life at least sub postmaster have die without see justice or receive compensation and at least four have take their own life more than year on the victim and their family be still suffer from the consequence and the trauma of all that they have be put through they have be trap in nightmare for too long we all want to see the exoneration of all who remain convict and the delivery of rightful compensation to all affected sub postmaster as quickly as possible labour want to see swift and comprehensive solution to this insidious injustice and we be willing to work with the government to ensure that happen will the minister please provide an update on the timeline to which he be work to amend the seismic damage that this scandal have cause and will he please give an assurance that he be act with the appropriate speed that be require for necessary legislation to go through victim have already wait too long for justice and we must act now with the speed and urgency that this awful scandal require thank the hon gentleman for the way in which he have approach this matter there be nothing in his remark that disagree with as say early of claimant have receive full and final compensation but we fully share his wish and that of his party for swift resolution and swift end to this and we have engage significantly and extensively with his colleague on the front bench as for how we overturn conviction the measure that we be take be clearly unprecedented but this be an unprecedented situation the hon gentleman ask about the timeline we have always say that it be week but it be few week now than it be do not think he will be disappoint say this to the right hon member for north durham as well by what we will say hopefully later today but this have take too long we be work daily to resolve these issue and the overturning of conviction the legislation and the compensation can not come too quickly my hon friend have do great job but be conscious that there be still many people wait to settle much of that be due to the fact that the post office be not release information that have be request by my constituent or indeed their solicitor hope that my hon friend can put across to the chief executive of the post office how critical it be to regain trust by release that information because fear that other sub postmaster or people who might otherwise have be interested in deal with the post office will start either to move away or not to take up those business opportunity which would also damage community and that be already happen in my constituency thank my right hon friend for her question and for make that point she be absolutely right disclosure both to the inquiry and on individual case which be require to be able to compile claim have be too slow if post office ltd and its management team be go to rebuild trust with claimant and the wide public it be absolutely incumbent on they that this be do properly and that the governance around it be do properly that be part of the reason why the secretary of state act as decisively as she do but absolutely concur with my right hon friend alongside she urge post office ltd to deliver disclosure more quickly call the snp spokesperson document publish this week by the bbc reveal that the swift review date february note that post office ltd have always know about the balance transaction capability that allow transaction to be addende remotely which be what happen the lawyer for post office ltd do nothing about that and many people still do not trust it letter have be circulate and the right hon member for north durham mr jones deserve all the praise we can give he today have copy of his memo which say that anyone can write to he on any issue and get advice on how to pursue claim the minister have give we list of percentage and so on but it be still not fast enough it be still not good enough and one of the reason be that post office ltd be still not trust people want nothing to do with it can not fix that but do not think that the spat between the secretary of state and henry staunton this week do anything to increase sub postmaster confidence and we really need to get this sorted yes the horizon shortfall scheme have be well manage in some regard and claim be go through and be pay but how much be be pay so many sub postmaster be get derisory offer not just people in the glo scheme but normal everyday sub postmaster who have be put in money for year we need to get this sorted appeal to all sub postmaster affect to put in claim entirely agree with the hon lady on that point and on number of other point she raise and thank she again for the work she have do in this area for many year too be concerned about some of the information that come to light this week and the public inquiry be there to examine any allegation relate to who know what and when it would be wrong of we to duplicate the inquiry effort because it be public inquiry that have the power to summon witness to give evidence and to carry out other form of evidence gathering which be the right way to do this agree with the hon lady that compensation can not come fast enough and that post office ltd have to rebuild trust not just with the wide public key to this be the postmaster yes of course we want to make sure that people get fair compensation may point gently to the performance so far of the group litigation order scheme fifty eight full claim have be receive offer have be make and have be accept without go to the next level which be the independent panel that tend to indicate that those offer be fair because people have recourse to the appeal process be aware of one or two high profile case where people say they have not be offer fair amount can not talk about individual case but we urge any of those individual to go to the next stage of the process which be the independent panel the whole scheme be oversee by sir ross cranston who have very good reputation both in this house and far afield we absolutely believe that the process will offer fair compensation but we urge people to return to the table and ensure that their claim be properly consider by all mean available thank my hon friend for all the work he have do on this issue not only on the front bench but on the back benches no amount of compensation can compensate the victim of this complete scandal however it do help and speed up the process be obviously important will he during the passage of the legislation that the government have promise to introduce ensure that innocent victim be not only compensate but completely exonerate in their community they have suffer the stigma attach to all this and they need to have their name clear and their reputation restore thank my hon friend for his regular contribution on this subject which he frequently raise prior to the itv series appreciate his work my hon friend be right to say that no amount of compensation can make up for what happen to many people life we want all the innocent people to be exonerate we know there be nervousness with some victim not trust the process they have simply have enough we meet howe one of the solicitor to talk about this issue yesterday and its contention be that around of the people who receive letter say we will not oppose an appeal still will not come forward we need process that do not require people to come forward if we be to have mass exoneration of those affect by this horrendous scandal we hope to announce that later today call the chair of the business and trade committee associate myself with the word of praise for the minister speed and attention on this issue think legally bind instruction for the post office and the department to deliver at speed be necessity in the new bill the minister have tell we today that about million have be pay in compensation but there be provision for about billion which mean that only of the money have be pay out he update the house on the number of claimant and there be people in the glo group and who be convict as the minister tell we only people have have their final compensation fully pay which be only of the two group the confusion at the beginning of the week about who say what to whom show there be confusion about the instruction to deliver at speed when the bill come before we will the minister reflect on the necessity for legally bind deadline under which the post office must make information available in to day and an offer must be make to settle within to day with legally bind deadline for final resolution otherwise frankly worry that the ambiguity will still cause delay he know as well as do that justice delay be justice deny thank the right hon gentleman for pay regular attention to this issue know that the committee have session next week and will be ask some of those question we be keen to get compensation to victim as soon as possible we be somewhat at the mercy of claim and we can not offer compensation if claim do not come in like other be very keen for people to come forward to submit claim one of the reason why we put forward the fix sum award of for overturn conviction and for member of the glo scheme be to try to accelerate the payment of compensation which contradict the claim that people be try to slow thing down be meet the horizon compensation advisory board this afternoon to look at its recommendation for accelerate compensation we have take nothing off the table and remind the right hon gentleman that the house recently vote to extend the compensation deadline from august on the recommendation of sir wyn williams because we do not want people to be time out of compensation the maximum budget for compensation have thus far be set at billion one of the issue we be try to resolve urgently be the fact that people be reluctant to come forward to have their conviction overturn by the court of appeal which be one of the reason why we have not compensate enough people with conviction we can not compensate they until we overturn their conviction which be exactly why we have propose the legislation once we have do that the door will be open for compensation to flow freely that be exactly what the right hon gentleman and want to see there have never be any confusion in our mind about the need to deliver this quickly have focus on that every single day both since have be in office and before have never be resist by anyone in my department or in other part of government there may be confusion but promise that there have be no confusion in government add my thank to the minister for his work in help to advise my constituent who have come forward ask many question about the situation that they find themselves in be very pleased that the government be work to compensate postmaster who be convict in court of law but there be many individual who work for the post office and face disciplinary proceeding who do not end up in court however their professional reputation be trash they have no ability to find job when they be dismiss and they be significantly out of pocket the post office must know whom it discipline it must have record through the disciplinary procedure will the minister outline what step the post office have take to contact those individual so that they can get the compensation that they rightly deserve thank my hon friend for so ably represent his constituent who have fall victim to this scandal people do not need to have go before court of law to be compensate postmaster with contract with the post office can access either the horizon shortfall scheme or the glo prosecution of any form be not require to be able to claim through those scheme think he raise point about somebody who work for postmaster or for the post office that be separate and be very happy to talk to he about that point which have be raise by number of member the post office would not necessarily know whether postmaster who be work independently and run an independent business have discipline their member of staff so it might not be as straightforward as he set out nevertheless be happy to engage with he on that the problem for many sub postmaster and sub postmistress be the quantification of what they be due to be repay under the shortfall scheme because payment be make out of their own pocket on several occasion over long period it be difficult in those circumstance for the claimant to know that they have be properly compensate because the post office can not tell they how much it should be repay to take step back be it not apparent that we can not continue to leave the post office to mark its own homework and that the independent element of scrutiny need to be strengthen somebody independent of government and the post office must be put in charge of not just sort this out but do so at speed agree with the right hon member point and he be right that quantification be very difficult these situation be complex it be about not just financial loss but the personal impact include the impact on mental health physical health reputation all those thing in those situation we should give the claimant the benefit of the doubt where this can not be evidence in many case the record be no long available we have independent people in all part of the process member of the horizon shortfall scheme include eminent kc such as lord garnier from the other place we have sir ross cranston oversee the glo scheme and in the overturn conviction scheme we have sir gary hickinbottom they be eminent retired high court judge have great faith in their hold our foot to the fire and get the right quantum of compensation to the right people at the right time indeed the horizon compensation advisory board with the right hon member for north durham mr jones and lord arbuthnot be also hold our foot to the fire make sure that we do the right thing and deliver the right amount of compensation will meet it again later today know that the minister mean well and that he also understand that my affected constituent have have enough of be tell that the government be work hard to get they the justice they deserve and promise of swift compensation one of my constituent claim be submit in october she hear the minister say in january that all claim would have offer within day but she still have not have an offer she be right to conclude that the allegation of delay payment to benefit the treasury be true be she not be sorry that the hon member have take that tone but that be not true as set out think henry staunton have get this completely wrong it be not the case and there have never be any situation while have be in this role my predecessor have say the same where we have try to delay compensation if the hon member want to write to be very happy to look at an individual case our commitment on the glo scheme be that once we have receive full claim we will respond to of case within day some case be more complex but be very happy to look at her specific case as have for other member when people have contact we directly be very keen to make sure that we get resolution to her constituent case as quickly as possible congratulate the minister on his tenacity in relation to this issue when do he expect the inquiry to be complete it seem that fujitsu be hide behind that inquiry and be unwilling to commit itself to compensate the taxpayer for the compensation the taxpayer will be pay thank my hon friend for raise that important point the inquiry be due to conclude by the end of this year and to report some time early hope next year at that point we will know more about fujitsu exact role and the amount of the final compensation bill welcome the fact that at the select committee fujitsu acknowledge its moral obligation to the victim and the taxpayer in contribute to the compensation bill and we will hold it to its promise in that regard the minister be perceptive man he must see the problem of his reassure the house from the dispatch box on thursday after the secretary of state reassurance at the dispatch box on monday the house and the country patience be wear thin many of the sub postmaster who be the victim in all this include my constituent have have their life blight and scar for well over decade the delay to the compensation scheme be only exacerbate the pain and the problem the public can see pattern whether it be the horizon compensation scheme the infected blood compensation scheme or the vaccine harm compensation and it do not reflect well on the government will be the first to admit that we want to deliver compensation more quickly than have happen in the past as say of claimant have receive full and final compensation it be absolutely right that the remain as well as any more who come forward and be pleased that more be come forward receive that compensation too it have never be case of our try to delay compensation do not believe there be pattern here these issue be complex but we be do much to accelerate the process we do much to accelerate compensation payment prior to the itv series which be critical the fix sum award which have be very effective in deliver rapid compensation be bring in last october we be look at blanket overturn in conviction some month before that series we be try to deliver the scheme at pace it be not always straightforward to do that but the hon gentleman have my commitment that we will do everything we can to deliver that compensation as quickly as possible the post office horizon scandal be now commonly call one of the great miscarriage of justice in british history so many life devastate some lose an inevitable consequence of that be to undermine public confidence in the post office in technology as misrepresent by the post office and fujitsu and in the minister department particularly follow the performance that be the right word for it of the secretary of state on monday what be he do to restore public confidence in the post office in technology and in his department do he recognise that swift payment of compensation be an important part of that yes it be the most important part of that it be right that the secretary of state respond to the serious and false allegation in the newspaper over the weekend hasten to add that those allegation be not about the secretary of state but about senior civil servant who have be very clear that the allegation be false the no way we can give confidence to those who might be submit claim or have do so be the fact that the process do work for the vast majority of claimant of course we want to improve the process but we also want to reassure claimant that there be independence run through every single part of they the no message we can give from the house be that if people come forward they will be treat fairly and receive compensation as quickly as possible how can the public have trust in the government to stand up for whistleblower when by her own account the secretary of state attempt to cover up the departure of henry staunton do not think that be an accurate portrayal of event at all be very happy to talk to the hon member about that particular issue it be decide that henry staunton be no long the right person to lead the post office he then decide to make some allegation about what happen during his tenure which have prove in my view to be completely false do not believe that mr staunton be whistleblower he speak out but think the allegation he make have be clearly demonstrate to be not accurate what the hon gentleman have just say be not an accurate portrayal of event the no thing we should all focus on now be ensure that people be properly compensate that the inquiry be allow to do its work and identify those responsible and that those responsible be they individual or corporate be hold to account have constituent who be part of the group litigation order they be not convict because the process be pause in but they have pretty much lose everything have borrow substantial amount of money to make up the shortfall over long period of time they have now be tell that the up front payment would be net of any interim payment that they have receive they be not confident to go forward with the full assessment because of some of the highly publicise very low derisory compensation that have be offer can the minister offer my constituent any reassurance that it be worthwhile pursue that extensive and independently assess claim my assessment be that they have lose significantly more than if that be the case they should definitely submit claim be very happy to meet the hon lady to talk about her particular constituent be aware that some individual have come forward and say that they receive derisory offer we urge they to engage with the rest of the process which have not yet happen there be an independent panel for the glo scheme again would direct she to the actual performance of the glo compensation scheme so far full claim receive offer make and offer accept without reference to the independent panel which would tend to indicate that the offer be make be fair however do understand that the people affect by this will not be satisfied by my assurance until they have go through the process urge she to tell her constituent to do exactly that may also add my thank to the minister for his very dedicated response to all the question that we have ask and for his energy in try to make this scheme success for those who have be victimise on those who have have to take out loan to repay money that they never owe anyway will calculation be carry out to allow repayment of not simply substantive amount but money borrow from family friend or banking institution and the interest that they have have to pay they thank the hon member for all the work that he have do in this area think he have speak in every single debate that have respond to in the house on this particular matter laughter and every single debate across this house as well that be also the case when we be work together fight for justice for banking victim pay tribute to all the work that he have do in this house in all these different area on the hon member question the key principle be that somebody be return to the position that they would have be in financially prior to the detriment taking place that could take into account for example consequential loss pecuniary loss financial loss as well as non pecuniary loss which be other impact such as those on reputation or on health the short answer to the hon member question be yes absolutely that complete the urgent question we now move to the next one inter faith network closure urgent question will the minister make statement about the closure that have be announce today of the inter faith network may thank the right hon gentleman for raise the issue of the inter faith network be grateful for all his work as chair of the all party group on faith and society and as long stand advocate for dialogue across faith as the under secretary of state for levelling up housing and communities my hon friend the member for north dorset simon hoare say during an adjournment debate in january we know full well the role that faith community play in our society we be extremely supportive of effort by faith group and other to bring together people of different faith and belief the secretary of state write to the co chair of the inter faith network on january this year to inform they that he be minded to withdraw the offer of funding for the financial year this be because of the appointment of member of the muslim council of britain to the board of trustee of the ifn as the house will be aware successive government have have long stand policy of non engagement with the mcb the appointment of an mcb member to the core governance structure of government fund organisation therefore pose reputational risk to the government the secretary of state invite the ifn to make representation on this matter which it subsequently do he carefully consider the point raise by the ifn before conclude that its point be outweigh by the need to maintain the government policy of engagement with the mcb and the risk of compromise the credibility and effectiveness of that policy inter faith work be valuable but that do not require we to use taxpayer money in way that legitimise the influence of organisation such as the mcb the department regularly remind our partner include the ifn of the importance of develop sustainable funding arrangement rather than rely on taxpayer money which can never be guarantee the potential closure of the organisation be therefore matter for the ifn as an independent charity and not the government the government continue to be fully supportive of develop and maintain strong relationship across faith and belief since the inter faith network have be the uk principal vehicle for inter faith dialogue support the annual inter faith week and activity and dialogue undertake by inter faith group across the whole country the network have be support by government funding for some year the ifn be tell on march last year before the trustee appointment that the minister refer to that its funding would be end from the follow day why have the organisation be treat in that extraordinary way last july the network receive letter from the secretary of state to inform it that it would after all receive funding for the current financial year that promise have never be honour why not give the debate in this chamber yesterday be it not extraordinarily stupid to be shut down at this precise point our principal vehicle in the uk for muslim jewish dialogue surely we need more not to be shut it down why have the secretary of state not honour the commitment that he make to to meet the right hon member for chipping barnet theresa villiers and the noble lord singh to discuss this matter before make his decision and will the minister pay tribute and express thank to the trustee and officer of the inter faith network for the very important contribution that they have make to uk national life over the last year truly believe that inter faith work make good contribution to our society my constituency be one of the most diverse in the entire country and have on number of occasion bring together my mosque my synagogue christian church and my gurdwara we recognise the benefit of inter faith activity thank the inter faith network for its work however we have always be clear with that organisation and any other organisation or charity that the department for levelling up housing and communities fund that they need to put in place alternative source of funding as say the government can not fund this organisation when trustee be part of the mcb be contact last year by my constituent esmond rosen of the barnet multi faith forum who express concern about the imminent withdrawal of funding from the ifn as we have hear it look in july as if the problem be resolve at least for the financial year so it be regrettable that we be in this position completely understand the importance of not engage with organisation that have hard line view but surely we can find some compromise to keep the ifn in business because it do incredibly valuable work to foster respect and mutual understanding between different faith group thank my right hon friend for all her work on inter faith matter what have change since july be the appointment in november of trustee who be member of the mcb in term of inter faith work there be so many example of positive thriving initiative across the country that be bring people together the department for levelling up housing and communities fund number of those partner include near neighbours and strengthen faith institutions which organise local level inter faith event to foster community cohesion call the shadow minister thank my right hon friend the member for east ham sir stephen timms for secure the urgent question inter faith and multi faith dialogue be absolutely essential component of society not only to resolve difference but to build strong and collaborative community that be able to come together in time of need give recent event the war and violence in gaza that be more important than ever as be sure the whole house recognise the government have special responsibility to facilitate positive relationship between different faith community and although appreciate that the minister have now give some explanation of why they have choose to withdraw funding for the ifn outstanding question remain let ask the minister some straightforward question when be the decision to withdraw funding from the network make what impact assessment be make and what discussion be have about the vital need to continue to promote understanding about and between different faith group and to encourage co operation when be the inter faith network notify of the decision do the minister have plan to increase support for other group to make up for any loss of provision arise from this decision every department will inevitably monitor and review the grant that they award but the house should expect that to be do in the spirit of due process as politician we have responsibility to bring community together at time when division be be expose hope that the minister can assure the house that the government remain committed to inter faith and multi faith dialogue thank the hon member for her comment again stress the importance of inter faith work see it in my own constituency it be very important the government be already support other institution that do such work the hon member ask specifically for timeline the secretary of state write to the ifn on january say that he be minded to withdraw the offer of funding in light of what we have discuss he invite the inter faith network to make representation to he on this matter and he receive its response on january after careful consideration of those representation he confirm that he wish to withdraw the offer of funding to the inter faith network for the reason that we have discuss he write to the co chair on february to inform they of his decision stress again that the department have be very clear that the inter faith network should have be develop other sustainable source of funding be proud to represent the constituency in this country with the great adherence to religious faith and many of those faith be minority religion we have very strong inter faith council that bring together people of all religion to sort out their difference and sort out tension have have representation from the jain community the zoroastrian community and other express their concern that the majority religion the large religion in this country will always be able to have their say because of their strength and power but the minority religion will not give the government decision to withdraw funding from the inter faith network what be go to take the place of that important organisation that bring together people of all faith enable they to settle their difference thank my hon friend for everything he do with his faith community in his constituency as have say dluhc continue to fund range of partner include near neighbours and strengthen faith institutions we believe in inter faith work to strengthen community cohesion thank my right hon friend the member for east ham sir stephen timms for have secure this urgent question back in january secure an adjournment debate urge the government to think again about their decision one of the thing find most concern about how this decision have be handle be that on occasion journalist seem to have be in possession of letter from the secretary of state to the inter faith network at the same time as the ifn receive they or possibly before that be no way to carry on there have be very little attempt to have any serious conversation with the inter faith network without those letter be in the public domain almost immediately this work be more important now than ever before so will the minister think again about fund this organisation into the future it be not too late as have say very proper consideration go into this decision after we have hear representation from the inter faith network the decision on government funding have now be make we have always be clear that the inter faith network need to develop alternative source of funding institution such as these can not be solely reliant on government funding be that not the point this organisation have have about million in income in the past five year and three quarter of that income have come from the government from the taxpayer be not the message for other organisation that they should not be too dependent on taxpayer funding my hon friend have express that point very well have be contact by my constituent diana francis who be quaker about her deep concern regard the sudden withdrawal of fund for the inter faith network my inter faith group in bath have do invaluable work to bring community together nurture tolerance understanding and the dialogue that be so important between people of different religious background can the minister not see how this sudden decision to withdraw funding at time of heighten tension only drive division and that people in my constituency be really concerned that there be nothing that will replace an organisation as unique as the inter faith network as have say we strongly welcome all of the inter faith work that happen across our community we have always be clear that the inter faith network need to diversify its funding source and we be also very clear that funding would not be give after in any instance that be communicate to the ifn back in july declare an interest be an active member of christians in parliament and former parliamentary churchwarden of st margaret the closure of the inter faith network be not seriously about relatively small amount of money it be about the message it send at this time in our country when all of we in this house be work for inter faith dialogue try to cool the atmosphere and address the problem we know about in many community in this country psychologically it be the wrong time and the wrong move please for the good of our country and for community relation will the government think again as have say inter faith work be very important and we fund number of organisation to do it will not repeat the name have already mention they this decision be take because as part of the core governance of the inter faith network there be member of the mcb with which the government do not maintain relation reiterate the point that other member have make particularly those of my right hon friend the member for east ham sir stephen timms and my hon friend the member for halifax holly lynch for this to happen in the current international context be absolutely outrageous it be politically obtuse decision may press the minister on the question ask by my hon friend the member for blaydon liz twist about the risk assessment the government have do to understand the impact on community relation thank the hon lady for her question as have say very careful consideration go into this decision it have be long stand policy of successive government first introduce in by labour government not to engage with the mcb listen carefully to the minister response to my right hon friend the member for east ham sir stephen timms when she say that the government take inter faith work very seriously but action speak louder than word cut off funding with just few hour notice be not helpful to this important organisation what step will dluhc now take to support dialogue in any area where it have be lose thank the hon lady for her question as say dluhc fund number of organisation that work very intensively at local level to support inter faith work and community cohesion declare an interest as chair of the all party parliamentary group for international freedom of religion or belief as image from outside this house last night make clear it be very important that people of all faith have point at which to meet and to focus on the thing that draw we together rather than those that divide we how will the government and the minister achieve that when this body the inter faith network close how can we that mean all of we in this house together and those outside this house continue on journey of embrace all faith and increase awareness of those faith think understanding of faith be incredibly important and that be why we encourage inter faith work especially at local level have already talk about what do in my constituency and find it very valuable in this particular instance we can not continue to fund the inter faith network but we do fund other organisation and we wish they well we have always make it clear to the inter faith network that it need to develop alternative source of funding thank the minister for answer the urgent question business of the house ask the leader of the

personally as he do his utmost to do what he think be in the good interest of the house we should all reflect on how we get to where we get to and accept our part in it welcome mr speaker desire to resolve these matter in discussion with we and other across the house and be sure that the vast majority of members accept his genuine and heartfelt commitment to this house and that he always have the good intention in make his decision do not want to go over those issue now except to say that be grateful to mr speaker for seek to enable the wide possible range of view to be express no one could have foresee event unfold as they do as it order let we not have repeat of the behaviour last night can we listen to each other with respect it be not good to have this shouting at the shadow leader of the house calmness please as you say madam deputy speaker it really be not good look no one could have foresee what happen as it be with the scottish national party indicate that it would vote for our amendment along with many conservative members it be right that it should be put the government make an extraordinary decision to withdraw from the debate raise number of question however let we not forget that we be discuss the most serious of matter those of life and death war and conflict and how we as country and as parliament can play our part in bring about much long for last peace base on two state solution it be to be regret that at such time we do not show ourselves at our good and that parliamentary antic be the story not parliament come together with one voice say we want the fighting to stop with an immediate humanitarian ceasefire and meaningful process we can all reflect on that my final reflection be that hope this place will have more time not less to debate and discuss these profound matter it should not be leave to opposition day debate and urgent question to get they air in the first place as we debate these important matter long shadow be increasingly cast over we threat intimidation and security mean it remarkable know that this issue be of huge concern to mr speaker too it be something that keep he awake at night and be his first priority join he in praise the security team work to keep we safe the legitimate lobbying of members be part and parcel of our job and our democracy that at time can be robust and we can all disagree strongly yet increasingly we be see line be cross know that member feel uncomfortable discuss their experience for fear of attract more unwanted attention or because we do not want to come across as whingeing when we have such privileged position but during recess we see another line be cross with the intimidation of member and their family at their family home report that other organisation will be target the home of mps ahead of and during the election have cause huge anxiety it be totally unacceptable development oh there be no noise for that one it not only cause anxiety for mps and their family neighbour and staff it be antidemocratic and be undoubtedly start to affect people decision and behaviour that be wrong and we must do more to address it do the leader of the house agree that the police should take much more hard line approach to so call protest outside the home of member of parliament can she confirm that the police should use the power they have to stop such protest and say whether further guidance can be issue do the leader of the house agree that we need to look at the cause not just the symptom of this sometimes toxic and febrile environment first do she agree that we have duty to be careful with our language and in how we conduct ourselves and challenge one another and that we should avoid stoke division next do she agree that more should be do with extra power give to regulate social medium and elsewhere to tackle the spread of misinformation disinformation deepfake and other dangerous material with the rise in antisemitism islamophobia and hate can the leader of the house confirm that the government will bring forward hate crime and extremism strategy with urgency finally do she agree that the defend democracy taskforce should have broad remit to defend democracy from threat within our border and that we should take more cross party approach as we head towards what be likely to be very testing general election first may join with all those who have pay tribute to alexei navalny in the wake of an assassination attempt he return to stand with his fellow countryman against putin tyranny know full well what that might mean for he and his family he put his country and his countryman before himself remind the house that the government will again outline our position on the very serious matter of israel and gaza in write ministerial statement soon join the hon lady in her thank to the security service particularly those of the house authority for keep we safe point to our record on adapt legislation to cope with the evolve nature of some pretty awful protest that not just mps but the general public have be put up with there be also the work we have be do in the house on social medium the new service in the house of commons library and the defend democracy taskforce it would be nice to have the opposition support on those matter in particular on the legislation that we will bring forward want to say that this house will never bow to extremist threat or intimidation it have not it will not it must not ask all member not to do this house further disservice by suggest that the shameful event that take place yesterday be anything other than party politic on behalf of the labour party let bring the house up to date two significant thing happen yesterday and be not sure all hon member have clock they first it fall to those on the government benches to defend the right of minority party in this house if the hon lady can not bring herself to reflect on the appalling consequence of her party action yesterday if she can not rise above the narrow and immediate need of her weak and fickle leader to fulfil her duty to this house as its shadow leader perhaps she might like to reflect on the damage her party have do to the office of the speaker would never have do to he what the labour party have do to he secondly we have see into the heart of labour leadership nothing be more important than the interest of the labour party the labour party before principle the labour party before individual right the labour party before the reputation and honour of the decent man who sit in the speaker chair the labour party before fairness integrity and democracy in rochdale the labour party before zero tolerance policy on antisemitism and many of we know this about the labour leader see it in his frustration at our country get the good deal possible when we leave the eu the labour party before country must tell the hon lady that the people of this country do not have copy of the standing orders of this house lie around their home and they have not be chat about parliamentary procedure over their cornflake this morning but they value fairness and they want the right of all to be protect they can not abide bully and cheat they can not abide people who trash our nation or fail to defend its interest or the institution that protect they government members often rightly criticise the former leader of the labour party the right hon member for islington north jeremy corbyn for the thing he stand for and for be wrong on matter but will say one thing about he at least he think he be right on they the current leader of the labour party be quite happy to do what he know to be wrong he put the interest of the labour party before the interest of the british people it be the labour leader who do not get britain and the past week have show that he be not fit to lead it may suggest that the priority of the house should be to command the confidence of our voter do not think that they or indeed majority in the house feel that we resolve anything on the question of gaza and israel yesterday so may suggest to my right hon friend that the government take up the suggestion make by the shadow leader of the house and hold debate on the subject in government time on government motion so that the motion and every amendment can be consider that would draw line under this matter thank my hon friend for his suggestion it be sad that what happen yesterday with regard to the speaker happen when the snp be try to hold an opposition day debate on the most serious of issue hear what he say and will be speak to business manager call the snp spokesperson yesterday be incredibly disappointing from our point of view it be mean to be an opposition day and it be one of only three time in calendar year when our party get an opportunity to put forward its business to the house do not think that what we come forward with be surprise to anyone we be allocate an opposition day four or five week ago but totally understandably it have to be move when the northern ireland assembly be reconvening at that stage there be conversation and be ask when people would have sight of the gaza motion that we would bring forward so it be quite extraordinary for anyone to suggest that they do not know we might come forward with motion on that topic when it get to our opposition day one of the very few time when we can put forward our policy our voice be silence our motion could not be vote on that be incredibly disappointing for and significant number of my constituent and those of my hon friend and hon member from across the chamber who want to support the motion give that in effect we do not get an opposition day yesterday can we be allocate an alternative date as other have say we lose significant amount of time at the start of the debate and because of the speaker decision unfortunately we lose minute at the end of the debate that mean that colleague be cut short and some withdraw from the debate what consideration will the leader of the house give to that suggestion and beyond that to protection for the small party so that they be not simply railroad for the political purpose of either of the big party echo the comment of the shadow leader of the house but it be critical that all member of this place whatever their position or status be protect from bullying and intimidation if report from many medium outlet be to be believe it be entirely unacceptable that significant pressure be put on mr speaker to come to his decision yesterday what step will the leader of the house take to investigate those very serious claim if there be any substance to they it be an affront to democracy that party leader can direct decision of the chair of this place as you know madam deputy speaker be as chief whip involve in number of conversation on how business come forward have direct assurance that would have vote on the word of my motion yesterday everyone know well in advance what the potential outcome would be at the end of yesterday debate so to suggest that no one know be utter nonsense the reason we be in this position be that convention and the standing orders of this house be overrule against the advice of the clerks that only happen because the labour party want to be dig out of hole that be unacceptable it be no secret to anyone who regularly tune into these session that frequently disagree with scottish national party member on every point that they raise but they have right to say these thing on the floor of the house and to debate their issue if be able to speak in yesterday debate would have be critical of how they bring forward their motion and perhaps of their motif for do so but it be their right to do as they do our standing orders protect the ability of minority party in particular to have those debate yesterday decision have serious consequence for minority party and for the government for instance our amendment be the only one that mention the violence against woman and girl that have take place it be important to ensure that the right of minority party be protect be very sympathetic to the snp be give more time and to it be knock off the labour party allocation with regard to the serious matter of mr speaker he come to the house yesterday and apologise know that he be meet all party on this matter and will meet he later today the leader of the house will be aware that represent romford in the london borough of havering historical essex market town will she please arrange for debate to take place on the floor of the house about the fairness of local government funding my borough be near bankruptcy because of the failure to have fair funding system we be also fleece by the mayor of london who take huge sum of money from place like havering to fund the greater london authority can we have debate about reform to local government in greater london and fair funding for borough such as havering and hopefully referendum so that we can go back to be fully part of essex welcome my hon friend back to his place he be quite right to raise the matter of pressure on his council particularly those bear of the action of the mayor of london whose budget be in crisis local government have have about uplift across the board but london borough clearly face local issue and particular pressure because of the mayor mismanagement my hon friend will know that the next question to the relevant secretary of state be on march call the chairman of the backbench business committee thank the leader of the house for the business statement and in particular for announce the backbench business debate for next thursday think the leader of the house will be aware that between now and easter the backbench business committee have little or no time to allocate for debate in the chamber beyond next thursday due to other business encroach into thursdays include the budget debate therefore wonder whether if there be any additional time between now and the easter recess the leader of the house could tip the wink as soon as possible and if she could tip we the wink via the normal channel when the date of the estimate day debate be know we would really appreciate that so that we can get the wheel in motion of course we continue to welcome application for debate in westminster hall on tuesdays and thursdays our committee have write to the procedure committee to ask for change to standing orders so that westminster hall debate on thursdays can begin at pm instead of pm it seem that the start time have not catch up with change to the parliamentary timetable over the year the change might facilitate well attendance at debate on thursday afternoon thank the hon gentleman again for his advert for the backbench business committee he know that be keen to give he time and early sight of the allocation so that he can fill in slot for debate and will certainly make he aware of the date for estimate day debate hope to be able to update he very shortly do my right hon friend agree that it be hard for market town to thrive without an open bank that be why hope she will join in congratulate the people and business in bacup in lancashire as well as link cash access uk and the atm network which have work with to deliver on my pledge to bring banking back to bacup hope we can find time in this house to have debate on the new banking hub that be open in fantastic historical market town in lancashire congratulate my right hon friend and his constituent who have work to ensure that these service continue it be understandable as bank look to cut cost that they give up brick and mortar but that do not mean the disappearance of those vital service from our community well do to all be sure that many hon member will ask he for advice in the future devon and cornwall police have be in special measure since after multiple failing last week it be reveal that seven current and former woman police officer be sue the force for fail to deal with rape beating and psychological torture by male colleague over number of year could the leader of the house arrange for home office minister to make statement reassure the people of devon and cornwall and serve woman police officer that these allegation will be thoroughly and independently investigate and any wrongdoing punish thank the right hon gentleman for raise this terrible situation he will know that the next home office question be on february and encourage he to raise it directly with the home secretary there but give the serious nature of this issue will make sure the home secretary have hear what he have say today and that at the very least his office be update do my right hon friend agree that the real issue of the event of the last hour be not the party political shenanigan suggest by the shadow leader of the house but that this house appear cow by threat of violence and intimidation the mother of parliaments appear weaken and diminish as result we have allow our street to be dominate by islamist extremist and british jews and other to be too intimidate to walk through central london week after week now we be allow islamist extremist to intimidate british members of parliament this be wrong it have to stop will my right hon friend organise debate on extremism and how we tackle this challenge which be one of the central issue face our generation could not agree more with my right hon friend british jews be suffer grotesque level of hatred and abuse which quite frankly sham our country he be absolutely right that there can not be any tolerance or quarter give to individual who threaten and try to prevent member of parliament conduct their business and honour the obligation they have to their constituent to use their judgment when they come into this place he will know that there be tremendous amount of work go on with the house and within the government to ensure that we protect democracy and protect all community in britain will make sure the home secretary have hear his remark today this be quite ticklish question be the long serve member on the opposition benches and have see scene like those we see yesterday on think only one other occasion indeed it be shameful that the bbc have to blank off the proceeding at one stage because of the crude and vile language that be come from one end of the chamber can we seriously review what go wrong yesterday and get it sort have every confidence interruption can be allow to say this we should learn from what happen yesterday rather than carry on the awful rowdy behaviour we see as this be business question may we have an early debate on people up and down the country mainly in the north of england but also in wales who have be fleece by lawyer and legal company over cavity wall insulation people who have get bad cavity wall insulation be be absolutely ruin and be lose their home because of predatory lawyer on the hon gentleman first point do not think there be any doubt about what take place yesterday it be completely shameful do not think there be any doubt about the procedural consequence if member be still in the dark about that the clerk of the house have provide some very clear advice do want to take the heat out of this think that we do need to reflect on what have happen but can tell he as leader of the house that will defend the right of all member to air view and the right voice of opposition party to be hear in this chamber it be to my great sadness that it fall to yesterday to do that for this place with regard to the other matter the hon gentleman raise shall make sure the secretary of state have hear what he have say madam deputy speaker wish to make point of order that be germane to the proceeding point of order will come after the select committee statement if the hon gentleman have want to intervene in business question would of course have call he if he have be here at the beginning but be afraid that have to direct he to make his point of order at the end of the select committee statement while be about it it might be useful for to remind right hon and hon member that any criticism of the speaker or the deputy speakers can be make only on substantive motion bear in mind what the leader of the house say about take the temperature down want to remind member that that be the case in order to be here at this time have delay give personal statement to the police on the late individual who think that member of this house be fair game to be harass stalk and threaten it be clear that the lack of transparency over the reason why we sometimes vote one way or another mean that our vote be often wilfully misinterpret and use to drum up hatred against parliamentarian and that that pervert our democracy let make suggestion the european parliament have many flaw but in that place it be possible to place write explanation of vote on the parliament website beside one voting record the opposition and government spokesman do it on behalf of their party and any individual member can submit their own write explanation of why they have vote the way they have it prevent the vote from be misinterpret it keep member safe and it stop democracy be pervert will my right hon friend take that idea on board stop the opposition wilfully misinterpret our vote on opposition day and help to keep our democracy safe be sure that speak on behalf of all in the house when say how sorry we be to hear that my right hon friend be have to endure the abuse that she have describe as say at the start of my statement this house will never kowtow to extremist or intimidation and right hon and hon member take their responsibility in this place and to their constituent extremely seriously thank my right hon friend for her very helpful suggestion and will certainly look at that let just say however that while we can update practice and do other thing in this place to help member of the public understand what be actually go on and draw clarity in relation to what our proceeding be focus on and what we be vote on and why we be all oblige to act with honour and integrity and to support democracy in this place have no jurisdiction over opposition attack ad and if there be any reflection to be do follow the last hour ask the opposition to reflect on that may add my thank to the

leader of the house will know be member of the restoration and renewal programme board we all love this magnificent place of work and appreciate be able to work in this wonderful palace of westminster

of those decision but this house need to be sight on programme that be go forward and on the option and it must have say in those too the leader of the house be right to withdraw from yesterday debate when it be clear that convention be be break those who put pressure on the speaker to break with convention should reflect on their action if it be because member of parliament could be intimidate or at risk for how they vote that be even bad and actually quite frightening have say that the speaker have say he make mistake and the house rely on we have confidence in the speaker we should move on

member very seriously despite the house disagreement know that my constituent in cardiff south and penarth be not interested in debate about procedure they be interested in the fact on the ground in gaza there be sincere concern about the suffering and horror that we have see could the leader of the house urgently provide some update guidance for how all member can respond to concern raise by

can do collectively to ensure that we have the medical facility in this country that the public rightly demand and that we have duty to provide thank my hon friend for his continued campaigning to ensure not only that his constituent have the healthcare professional uplift that they need and that they now enjoy but that the building from which those professional operate be fit for purpose the next health and social care question be on march know my hon friend be passionate advocate on this issue and will make sure that the secretary of state have hear what he say this afternoon it be important that we discuss what happen last night in moderate reasonable and respectful way we all have lesson to learn but in order for those lesson to be learn we must be clear about what actually happen and the precise chain of event so would like to ask the leader of the house simple question why do she decide to withdraw the government amendment direct the hon gentleman to the advice of the clerk of the house and the consequence that stem from it the result of yesterday decision be that minority party would never be able to vote on their own motion in an opposition day debate that be break with the procedure of this house and know there be ongoing conversation between mr speaker and the deputy speakers about how we can ensure that the office of speaker be never again put upon in the way it be yesterday we all know what happen yesterday if the hon gentleman be not aware he should talk to those on his front bench the most worrying thing about yesterday be that member be be intimidate for what they say and how they vote because of fear about their physical safety and that of their staff and family add to that we have climate of hard line support that have see antisemitism on the street of our capital city my constituent from the jewish community feel intimidate about come into the centre of london so may we have debate on how to address this intolerable climate we can not go on like this thank my right hon friend for raise this very important point it be beneficial to air these matter and to ensure that we focus the service of the house and other resource such as the police on protect members of parliament when they go out to perform their daily duty for the people who send they here know that people often like to beat up on members of parliament and what they do but we be send here by the british people what we do protect their interest and we have to be free to use our judgment to vote in the way that we think be in their interest anything that interfere with that be an assault on democracy and we need to ensure that member and the public can go about their daily life and do their duty for their country without intimidation or bad if we be to believe mr speaker that his selection of amendment yesterday be to allow the wide possible debate can the leader of the house explain why he do not select the lib dem amendment the reality be that the snp be stitch up by yesterday deal with the labour party do she share my incredulity that speaker who insist that we can not speak in this place without wear tie now want we to move on and modernise thank the hon gentleman for afford another opportunity to direct member to the clerk advice anyone who peddle the line that this decision would have lead to wide debate have not read that advice meet the watford hackney carriage drivers association last year to discuss the challenge face by our brilliant taxi driver the closure of watford pryzm nightclub in january be devastating blow to the local taxi trade how can encourage hail company such as bolt to consider include driver from the watford hackney carriage drivers association on their black cab scheme which would contribute greatly to the local night time economy thank my hon friend for raise awareness and for demonstrate that thriving night time economy be vital for local taxi driver and the reverse be also true encourage he to seek debate in which the minister can hear his view he know how to apply for that our taxi driver play an essential role in our community and he will know that the next transport question be on march many of my constituent include member of the sikh community and local gurdwara have write to regard their serious concern about the safety of protest farmer in their

confirm that second boy also sustain bullet wound but luckily he have survive with another people be treat for injury in hospital the bbc have report today that twitter admit to be compel against their wish to take down the legitimate post and account of activist do the leader of the house agree that freedom of expression the safety of protester and their human right must be protect what representation have the government make to their indian counterpart to that effect thank the hon gentleman for raise that very serious situation of course the government support the right to protest in safety shall ensure the foreign office have hear his concern and ask the relevant minister to get in touch with his office call ian liddell grainger thank you mr speaker it be good to see you in the chair may we have debate on rogue council mid devon district council which have talk about many time have now threaten its former leader other party as well with legal action for dispute what have go on with the rivers development there have be lack of scrutiny and lack of accountability this be million of pound not thousand the chair of scrutiny believe it or not have party on public fund the chief exec be up to his neck in this and the leader of the council who as we know pack perfume for living be unprepared to do the work that council leader should do regardless of persuasion can we please have debate in government time about council responsibility for deal with situation that have go wrong and not sue their former colleague who be try to do their job my hon friend be very diligent in pursue these matter at all opportunity include business question suggest that the issue be perhaps well raise with the secretary of state on march in departmental question lot have be say about the event of yesterday but let we not forget that the outcome be that this parliament have give clear mandate on our position on gaza interruption that be very important let move on to constituency matter people in oldham work very hard for house for their family to live in and they expect security for that but some be have the roof literally take from over their head include mr potter through an agreement with shade greener solar installation company thousand of people be affect by company who be not clear about the term and condition and be now take out loan on the property make remortgage almost impossible can we have debate in government time on the impact of mis selling in the solar industry on the hon member latter point will certainly make sure that the secretary of state have hear what he say and he can put that to ministers directly on february with regard to his former point it be in the interest of the british people that democracy be protect as say the interest of the labour party be trump democracy yesterday we see the politicisation of the situation in gaza by snp members to engineer an issue within the labour party their opposition day their right labour members be reportedly concerned about their security as we be but the labour party frequently confect issue towards the conservative side we have see conservative members call scum by labour member inside and outside this chamber we have be accuse of starve child and dump sewage in our sea these be false assertion to generate intolerable hatred death threat and abuse against conservative mps can my right hon friend tell whether the conservatives have ever ask for special treatment or convention to be overturn to protect we do that illustrate that both side of the house not just this side need to take responsible approach to debate in this house and public discourse and in public life my hon friend have make her point extremely well whether those debate be on storm overflow or free school meal when conservative members face very unfair slur and intimidation we do not ask that the procedure of the house be upend and put pressure on decent man in the speaker chair to change those process that be because it be at the heart of our party that we put the interest of this country first one of those interest be that democracy in this place be protect call the snp leader last evening we see the good of this house in its ability to debate and we also see the bad of this house as it descend into farce think speak for everyone in the chamber now and yesterday when express my deep sorrow that that be able to happen give the content of what we be debate nevertheless mr speaker it descend into farce because of decision that you and you alone make to ignore the advice that be give to you by the clerks in do so on the opposition day of the scottish national party my colleague and be deny the ability to vote on matter which be of grave concern to we and which over recent month we have seek to raise in this chamber at every available opportunity it ultimately turn into labour opposition day that quite frankly be not acceptable as have express to you privately prior to today proceeding we do not on these benches believe that you can continue in your role as speaker we do not have confidence in your ability to do so would therefore welcome clarity either from you or the leader of the house about how we can well facilitate the early possible vote in this chamber to that effect thank the hon gentleman for his question hope that he can see in my action yesterday that be servant of this house and that even though it may not be in the government narrow interest to do so will protect the right of all minority party to be able to air their view in this place and ensure that the party who be afford opposition day debate can have those debate in the full sense and have vote on their motion we create the rule of this house and the speaker serve at our behest give the range of view that have be express on the floor of the house today many intervention have be supportive of the speaker point out the pressure that be put on he yesterday think that we should take time to reflect mr speaker have say that his door be open to all party and individual member as be mine but as say the government will listen to this house be servant of this house and will do its bidding will also come in at this point reiterate that make judgment call that do not end up in the position where expect it to regret it and apologise to the just bear with apologise to the house make mistake we do make mistake and own up to mine we can have an to get an immediate debate because the debate be so important to the house will defend every member in this house every member matter to in this house as have be say never ever want to go through situation where pick up phone to find friend on whatever side have be murder by terrorist also do not want another attack on this house be in the chair on that day have see have witness will not share the detail but the detail of the thing that have be bring to be absolutely frightening for all member of the house on all side have duty of care and say that if my mistake be look after member be guilty be guilty have duty of care that will carry out to protect people it be the protection that lead to make wrong decision with the risk be put on all member at the moment have serious meeting yesterday with the police on these issue and on threat to politician as we head towards an election do not want anything to happen again yes will apologise as always will when make mistake as do offer an that be within my gift and power but will also do whatever it be to protect anybody in this chamber or anybody who work in this house that be my duty of care be in israel last week meet with hostage family survivor and friend actually feel safe in israel than do in this country at this moment in time have two reflection on that visit and on what happen yesterday first nobody in this house have any business or agency at all in tell the state of israel where it be able to operate to seek to rescue hostage who be be rap by the islamic terrorist who hold they secondly if we have rerun of yesterday debate exactly the same thing will happen again and member will not vote with their heart because they be frightened and scared what do we expect for month have be stand here talk about the people on our street who be demanding death for jews jihad and intifada as the police stand by and allow that to happen last night genocidal call from the river to the sea palestine will be free be project on to this building that message say no jew be welcome in the state of israel in that land this be go to continue to happen because we be not deal with it will the leader of the house explain what will be different if we have rerun of the debate how will hon member be able to vote with their heart and conscience too many will not do that at the moment because of the threat we be receive threat that in some case be tell we to leave this country and that we or our family should be subject to pain and death thank my hon friend for raise this do not think there be any member of this house who have not receive threat intimidation and increasingly death threat to they and member of their family have have many such threat and other hon member have speak about their experience on the floor of the house we can do many thing with regard to physical security and again thank the house authority for what they do yesterday the matter he raise of the projection on to this building last night be be look at by the speaker office parliamentary security the metropolitan police and westminster city council which will be responsible for pursue prosecution say again to all member of the house we be elect to carry out our duty and take our responsibility seriously it be often frightening task but we can not let those threat change this place or what we think be the right course of action if we do that they will have win they will never win we have to show courage and our constituent need we to show courage on these matter we must vote and do what we think be right despite huge and grow public interest and concern over excess death there remain reluctance to engage with the issue or in some case even to acknowledge it by front benchers across this chamber how convenient that this week the office for national statistics announce it have suddenly find large increase in the uk population not newborn but old people where have these senior be hide for all these year the effect of that increase will be to supress and mask the number of excess death can we have debate on rebuild trust in public health policy we will not do that by fudge the figure at the ons which be now in complete conflict with those issue by other government departments such as the office for health improvement and disparities be amazed that the hon gentleman be ask the government front benchers for debate while at the same time assert that we will do everything we can not to have one he know how to apply for debate he have have many debate westminster hall debate and adjournment debate and he be able to ask question in the house many member from all part of the house take these issue extremely seriously hope that the hon gentleman will reflect on what have be say on the floor of the house today about our conduct and what we say about other member and the security consequence bike and scooter be become increasingly popular as mode of transport but be concerned that last year london fire brigade attend bike fire an increase of on and blaze involve scooter three people have lose their life and approximately people have be injure in those fire will my right hon friend consider debate in government time on bike and scooter safety and regulation thank my hon friend for raise this important point she will be aware that london fire brigade have issue new guidance alongside the guidance put out by the department for transport on safety for user of bike and scooter on february the government publish guidance on consumer safety when purchase such vehicle she be right to point to the fact that future regulation might be prudent in this area give that we do not want people to have to focus on these matter in the way she have suggest mr speaker you be entirely correct that the level of intimidation against hon member be unacceptable but many of my constituent have also face level of antisemitism never see before it be welcome that commitment to prevent antisemitism be hear in this place but often action undermine that commitment my constituent remind about the call for jihad on the street of london but the metropolitan police refuse to do anything about it and about man drive through north london threaten to rape jewish woman but the crown prosecution service decline to prosecute they how do reassure my constituent that this place do not treat issue of interest to my jewish constituent differently when last night the labour motion come after the moment of interruption and be nod through without vote know hon member will be ask question about what happen with last night vote have consult the clerks of the house and the vote stand because it be matter for the chair encourage colleague to talk to the clerks of the house to understand that more but fully appreciate the anger and disappointment from all side of the house about people not be able to vote on particular motion or amendment last night and about what happen after the moment of interruption with regard to my hon friend substantive point he be right we have to end the climate that he describe we have to ensure that every community in this country can feel safe he will know that the home secretary have be do work with police force across the country particularly with the met about the additional power that they need to be able to tackle these issue and to identify the individual behind this violence and intimidation he update the house on regular basis and will continue to do so we have to end this give the unprecedented breach of convention yesterday and the unseemly antic that we see despite the fact that we be debate the very serious slaughter in the middle east will the leader of the house make statement to set out her view on the need for this house to have full disclosure on exactly what conversation take place between mr speaker and the leadership of the labour party amid grave allegation of the labour party engage in dark practice and possibly even blackmail before this unprecedented breach of convention which have very sadly undermine confidence in our speaker do she not agree that this be important in the interest of transparency may press she far and ask she to ensure that the snp will be allocate another opposition day so that we can air our view have our vote and express the concern of our constituent about the slaughter in gaza the hon lady have put her view on the record and thank she for that as have say be sympathetic to the snp be give additional time she will understand that will announce further business in the usual way but be very happy to speak to the leader of her party group wish to associate myself with the comment of my right hon friend the member for chipping barnet theresa villiers and my hon friend the members for hendon dr offord and for brigg and goole andrew percy people be intimidate every day on the street of this country have hear the heartfelt word of mr speaker yesterday it be clear that he be worried about the intimidation of people in this place we be remind by the plaque of the people who have be murder off the estate and on the estate we walk into this chamber under the shadow of world war two when this chamber be bomb by people who want to stop this parliament sit the entrance to the chamber be still there to remind we of that the only time we go through the lobbies yesterday be on my ten minute rule bill it still surprise that the labour party encourage member to vote down bill that would have help community transport and disability transport operator still find that astonishing to return to formal business the draft strategy and policy statement for energy policy in great britain be lay yesterday by my right hon friend the secretary of state for energy security and net zero it be suppose to be subject to an affirmative resolution my right hon friend the leader of the house will know that have be concern about our not be able to debate national policy statement would be grateful if she could find time for debate on this give that it be subject to an affirmative resolution will certainly raise my right hon friend latter point with the relevant department and make sure that it have hear what she have say today on her former point it be absolutely right that we do all we can to protect member of parliament it be absolutely right that we hold to account those who seek to intimidate or threaten individual elect member of parliament and those hold local government office and that they face the full force of the law however we can not adapt our process and procedure in this place to not have difficult debate we have to be able to debate difficult issue we have to stand up for our constituent and make the judgment that we think be right if we be adapt the procedure of this house because we be fearful of the consequence of stand up and say what we think be right then democracy have fail and the extremist have win we must never do that and as long as be leader of the house of commons that will never happen the leader of the house may be aware of newport wafer fab in my constituency which be part of the south wales semi conductor cluster it be currently wait for new owner but the transition process be in limbo because the site be await decision by the cabinet office

process be go through thoroughly encourage she to raise this matter in the next question session but will also make sure that we chase it up on her behalf there be business that want to establish themselves in my constituency or to extend their exist premise but they be be tell that it will take year to get grid connection in addition there be concern up and down the constituency about plan

able to get on and create business and to do all that their ambition and their calling require of they he will know that the next question session in which he can raise this matter will be on february encourage he to do that but will also make sure that the secretary of state for energy security and net zero have hear what he have say school in my constituency be far more likely to travel to the scottish parliament for educational enrichment than to this place after the event of last night when the third party voice be silence due to bullying and intimidation and for no other reason who can be surprise the uk parliament education centre subsidise travel by up to of the cost up to value of however unsurprisingly travel cost from scotland be significantly high and as consequence the vast majority of school have to cancel include two from constituency just this week can the leader of the house provide for statement to be make on how we can fix that inequity thank the hon gentleman for raise that question he will know that the finance committee of the house recently do review of the travel subsidy for different part of the country and there be some change that will be make to that with regard to school visit and the opportunity for people from all part of the uk to come to this place suggest that he speak to the chair of the finance committee about that she sit on the house of commons commission and her recommendation come to we homeowner on two recently build housing development in my constituency be promise gp surgery the development at appleton cross have be completely finish and the section money pay across but there be no gp surgery that be put extreme pressure on the exist facility that be provide elsewhere in warrington south may ask the leader of the house for debate in government time to look at how we can ensure that when planning permission be agree and the infrastructure that be need to go with it be agree the local authority responsible for approve that planning permission ensure that the gp surgery be deliver as require thank my hon friend for raise the matter on behalf of his constituent he will know that in the levelling up and regeneration act we introduce power to create new infrastructure levy to replace the exist system of developer contribution it aim to generate more funding for infrastructure such as he mention gp surgery and shop for example to mitigate the impact of new development and ensure that the need of new people move into the area and increase the population size be serve we have commit to further consult on the

great concern be pass without division disagree with snp members on many many issue but respect their position in this place as elect member of parliament right now it be on the record that the motion be pass unanimously which believe give the clear vocal opposition misrepresent the will of parliament interruption do the leader of the house share my deep concern about the implication of that for our democracy and the rule of law and do she agree that opposition day must be uphold and respect in line with order the shadow leader of the house should not be shout from the front bench simply do do the leader of the house agree that opposition day must be uphold and respect in line with convention as an essential part of the democratic operation of this house and will she work to remedy the injustice of yesterday debate agree with my hon friend which be why the government take the action that we do yesterday it be not to the government advantage to facilitate debate that be likely to be critical of the government but it be in the interest of our democracy that we do so which be why we do what we do to protect the right of minority party in this place as say in response to early question fully appreciate the frustration at how yesterday vote be record have raise it with the clerks and take advice it be matter for the chair and be afraid to tell my hon friend that it will stand as it be the kellogg factory in my constituency be an iconic reminder of the industrial heritage of trafford park like so many of my constituent be shock and sadden recently to hear of parent company kellanova plan to close the factory give the devastation that this will cause not just to my local community but particularly to the kellogg employee who now face an uncertain future could we have debate in government time on how we can safeguard manufacture job in this country now and in the future encourage the hon gentleman to raise the issue with the secretary of state at the next question time on march will also write on his behalf if he have not already do so to the minister oversee the redundancy service and the minister for employment in the department for work and pensions they will be able to provide his office with support in ensure that the interest of his constituent be take care of and that they avoid hardship we all face difficult vote in this house see the consequence of one such vote when after an opposition day debate some time ago my elderly parent be threaten with be stab to death this be the first time have reveal that information publicly know that colleague on both side of the house have face similar threat recently it be very important though that when we vote on difficult matter we all do so under the same set of rule yesterday many government members feel that change the order of business mean that while entirely legitimately labour mp be protect from potential threat of violence and murder government members be consequentially more exposed to such threat do my right hon friend agree that we can not continue like this such breach of procedure be unacceptable the right of everyone in this house to vote in the way they wish and their security should be equal across all benches completely agree with my hon friend who have say it very well hope that all member of this house have get that message with regard to intimidation as say it be not just about what be direct against we it be about what be direct against member of our family and perhaps most appallingly against hon member child there have be many instance of that we will ensure that individual who make such threat face the full force of the law while other reflect on what have happen particularly in the last hour those who be while not commit crime encourage and give licence to people on social medium ought to reflect on their behaviour as well have be in this place for about year and have spend almost all of it try to get some progress on agricultural flooding and water management board the issue be of grave concern to my constituent in rural west lancashire statutory instrument be expect on water management board last summer we have not see hide nor hair of it in answer to write question the secretary of state say that it will come after consultation but that have not be schedule can the leader of the house advise of how this relatively simple instrument can be expedite so that my constituent can move forward on this press matter thank the hon lady for her diligence in pursue this matter for her constituent she can obviously raise the matter at the next question time but sense her frustration and will write to the secretary of state for environment food and rural affairs to ask he to update her office in view of the labour party hijacking the snp opposition day debate yesterday can we have debate in government time to discuss the role of the standards and privileges committees or the procedure committee and whether there should be an inquiry into the role of the leader of the opposition and his chief of staff and the opposition chief whip in mr speaker overrule the advice of the clerks on yesterday opposition day debate refer my hon friend to the response give to the shadow leader of the house the hon member for manchester central lucy powell think that the leader of the opposition need to reflect on what he do yesterday as well as what everyone else will have be do madam deputy speaker this tuesday in respond to my point of order in relation to sinn féin short money your fellow chair the right hon member for doncaster central dame rosie winterton suggest that raise the matter during business question do so now on her advice as the house be aware the northern ireland assembly have be re establish previously the salary of member of the legislative assembly have be reduce for period of at least two year the clear rationale be that if elect mla be not do their job they should not receive full pay the general public see the sense of it and support that decision since the establishment in of representative money as scheme analogous to but separate from short money over million have be pay to small number of sinn féin mps sinn féin do not attend debate or scrutinise amend or vote on legislation so money pay from the public purse for that purpose be not use to that end that have be raise by my hon friend the member for east londonderry mr campbell by my party leader my right hon friend the member for lagan valley sir jeffrey donaldson by the hon member for upper bann carla lockhart and by and other colleague just when will sinn féin money be reduce and when will necessary step be take in this parliament to stop the continued and unacceptable abuse of representative money thank the hon gentleman for get that on record have have some correspondence with other member about it he will know that it be primarily matter for the house he will have help his particular point of view by get it on record today and have listen to it research show that those who intentionally inflict cruelty on animal be often also guilty of offence such as child abuse and domestic violence and involve in bully and organised crime can we have statement from the home secretary on the establishment of an animal offender register thank my hon friend for his question and for all his work on animal welfare for which he be very well know he can ask that of the home secretary directly on february it be an interesting suggestion such abuse be of course clear indicator of further and more serious crime to come place on the record my thank to mr speaker for return to the house last night for the clear explanation and heartfelt apology that he make then and for his

house have never kowtow to terrorist member of this house will never be dissuade from what they think be the right course of action by intimidation bullying or threat and that be not what happen yesterday what happen yesterday be that the procedure of this house be corrupt to advantage one party and to disadvantage member on the government benches and minority party that be unparliamentary

word corruption have be use sorry be the word corruption unparliamentary order please it really be time to calm down and take the heat out of this let we calm down do not hear what the leader of the

will not be move from carry out our duty to the people who send we here by intimidation and threat outside that have not happen that be not the reason why what happen yesterday be do we should do everything we can to ensure that that remain the case it be the case it will be the case and it must be the case that conclude the business question on point of order madam deputy speaker point of order be take after statement mr blackman but if yours relate directly to the business that we have just conclude will take it it do madam deputy speaker the long stand convention be that during oral question ministers may for the convenience of the house choose to group similar question to be answer together when that happen it be with the permission of the chair by custom and practice the individual whose question have be group be notify by the department in advance that that will happen twice now when my question have be low down the order paper it have be group with another but have not be grant the courtesy of be tell in advance that that would happen as result have not be present when those question have be call clearly that be unacceptable for those on all side will you madam deputy speaker through your good office encourage the leader of the house to reinforce the view that departments must notify member in advance when question have be group the hon gentleman raise very important point as it happen recall the first of the incident that he describe because be in the chair call he but he be not here know that he be an assiduous attender of this chamber be very surprised he then tell that he have not be here because he do not know that his question have be group there be absolutely no doubt whatsoever that member ought to be contact and that the department ought to be sure that member have receive the message that their question have be group grouping do indeed happen with the permission of the chair it will be stop if it be not properly carry out should think be the leader of the house happy with that or do she want to add anything far to that point of order madam deputy speaker have hear what my hon friend say and you be absolutely right if he want to give the detail of the department which be confident be not the ministry of defence will deal with it on point of order madam deputy speaker will take the point of order if it relate to this business it do indeed relate to the proceeding just now have hop that mr speaker would be in the chair for this point of order do give notice to the chair that would make this point of order and to the leader of the house it be with huge amount of regret because like mr speaker personally that have sign early day motion indicate that do not have confidence in he if my understanding be correct he outline today that his desire be to allow the house to express its view in the space of about or hour score of mps approach at the last check have sign that early day motion express no confidence in the speaker of this house can ask you madam deputy speaker to ask mr speaker to make it clear to the government as he say he would that he have no objection to that motion of no confidence be table and to allow the house to express its view whether we like it or not the conduct of the speaker of the house of commons have raise wide question the fact that member of this house have indicate that they do not have confidence in he mean that the matter now have to be put to vote he can not object to that thank the hon gentleman for his very clear point of order let clarify he be ask to convey to mr speaker the message that he have just give and the question that he have just ask indicate assent can undertake to convey that message to mr speaker on point of order madam deputy speaker be the point of order directly in relation to this business it be madam deputy speaker far to point of order that be make by my right hon friend the member for north east somerset sir jacob rees mogg seek your guidance on why division be not call yesterday it be clear that there be shout of both aye and no and it be clear from the standing orders that in such scenario division should be call understand the hon gentleman concern and thank he for his point of order will simply say this at the point just after last night when questions be put to the house the noise and turmoil in this chamber make it impossible for the then occupant of the chair my colleague madam deputy speaker who be do she good in very difficult circumstance to ascertain whether she could hear any call of no she have tell that she could not hear call of no and she act accordingly it be always very easy to go back in hindsight and examine what each of we might have think happen but can assure the house that dame rosie do she very good in difficult circumstance and that she think and think too that she be carry out the wish of the house at the time be stand beside the chair at that moment appreciate that other people have different view on the matter but hope that the hon gentleman and the house will accept my assurance that dame rosie do she very good in difficult circumstance on point of order madam deputy speaker be very reluctant to take further point of order be it directly relate to this business yes in that case call mr alan brown to make point of order thank you madam deputy speaker seek your guidance perhaps as chair of ways and means you might be able to give further clarity my point of order be regard the response that mr speaker give early to the snp group leader my hon friend the member for aberdeen south stephen flynn about the sequencing of the decision he take yesterday the guidance he give at the start of the debate be that there be precedent for select an amendment by the main opposition party to small party motion but the letter from the clerk make it quite clear that there be no precedent for that mr speaker also say that that be about have the wide possible debate but last night the rationale change to security in his response just now mr speaker really home in on security as the primary reason for his decision and he intimate that life be at risk that be very grave matter it imply that as thing stand decision that member take on the snp motion would effectively have put their life at risk it imply that somehow debate the labour amendment take away that security risk which in turn imply an assumption about how member be go to vote why be those security concern not share with other party leader what do the security service say and do this not set precedent that mob rule can change the business of the house have to stop the hon gentleman there he be try to continue the debate and he be again ask question that mr speaker have already come to the chamber and answer mr speaker have deal with those matter and it be not for to deal with they any far think there will be further opportunity to explore these matter both in public and in private and the leader of the hon gentleman party will no doubt have discussion with mr speaker but will not continue debate on these matter on point of order madam deputy speaker if it be another point of order directly relate to this business will take it now thank you for take my point of order madam deputy speaker seek your guidance on an issue of substantial constitutional importance it have be make fairly clear in my question to the leader of the house and by my hon friend the member for bassetlaw brendan clarke smith and several other member that there be concern about the motion yesterday evening the bbc be report that the house approve the motion and the labour party be put out advert say the same yet there be concern as to whether it be valid vote it be critical that the public have faith in our democratic process what mechanism be there to void yesterday motion and have rerun once again the hon gentleman have reiterate matter that have already be consider on behalf of the people whom we all represent plead that this matter should now calm down and that temper and anger should not be encourage to flourish far these be matter that might have to be far explore and mr speaker and the leader of the house have both make clear to the house this morning that there will be other opportunity to consider and fully debate they will take no further point of order on this matter recognise that member on all side of the house have strong feeling most of which have be express now plead for calm ukraine with permission madam deputy speaker would like to update the house on the conflict in ukraine as we prepare to mark two year since the start of the full scale russian invasion like many in this house remember exactly where be on february just before sunrise be wake by phone call to be tell that russia have illegally invade ukraine and that car would be outside at am head for cobra after that meeting ministers be all ask to speak to their respective ukrainian counterpart at the time be transport secretary and my arrangement be to speak via zoom with my then opposite number oleksandr kubrakov oleksandr who have subsequently get to know very well be stand in the middle of field outside kyiv ask he about the situation and he tell that quite frankly he do not know how much long the city would last the russian army be understand to be just kilometre away the wolf or in this case the russian bear be literally at the door and expert opinion suggest that kyiv would be take in perhaps three day however as this war drag into its third year far from win russia have be push back since those early day putin have achieve none of his strategic objective his invade force have suffer staggering casualty and ukraine have destroy or damage about of the russian black sea fleet and retake of the territory that russia steal from report march vol correction meanwhile oleksandr kubrakov be now the deputy prime minister and his job be the restoration of ukraine when this be over putin arrogantly assume that this conflict would be over in day and he be wrong he reckon without the strength of the international support that would rally to ukraine cause be proud that over the course of the past day britain have be at the forefront of that global response our effort always step ahead of our ally have make genuine difference from the outset we declassify intelligence specifically to scupper russian false flag our nlaw anti tank missile provide in advance of the full scale invasion and our javelins help brave ukrainians devastate putin menacing mile armoured convoy which be head directly at kyiv we be the first to send main battle tank with our challenger squadron plus armoured vehicle and anti armour weapon all of this help to degrade russia once formidable fighting force with putin loss amount to main battle tank armoured vehicle and artillery piece throughout this conflict our million round of small arm ammunition have allow ukraine to maintain rate of fire and recently help keep the russians at bay during their winter offensive meanwhile the kremlin have be unable to achieve the air superiority that it assume it would have in part thank to our donation of air defence missile and over british drone have be send to date this conflict have indeed demonstrate that drone be change the face of modern warfare and we be already learn the lesson from that that be why early today my hon friend the minister for defence procurement launch the uk defence drone strategy to stay ahead on this new frontier of technology back by at least million announce by the prime minister recently make the uk the big drone partner for ukraine yet it be actually at sea where the ally contribution to ukraine cause have be most keenly feel our mighty storm shadows and our uncrewed sea system have help ukraine achieve breakthrough in the black sea not only have russia fleet lose seven different surface ship plus submarine but black sea corridor have open up for trade allow ukraine to export million tonne of cargo include million tonne of agricultural produce at the end of last month ukrainian agricultural export from its black sea port reach the high level since the war begin far exceed what happen under putin black sea grain initiative as president zelensky say to when visit the uk contribution have be monumental he point out that since the start of the conflict the uk have send almost different type of capability to ukraine together we have show that when ukraine get what it need it can win which be why the uk be continue to step up our support last month the prime minister announce that we will be invest furth billion in military support for ukraine take our total military package so far to over billion and our total support to over billion account for humanitarian and economic support as well in that spirit today can announce new package of brimstone anti tank missile in further boost to defend ukraine these missile have previously have significant impact on the battlefield in one instance force russian force to abandon and to retreat from an attempt crossing of river member will recall that few day ago president zelensky tell the munich security conference that an artificial deficit of weapon will only help russia and he be right so today we be give ukraine more of the help it need inflate its capability so that it can defend freedom frontline other capability will also be come its way our uk found and administer international fund for ukraine have pledge more than million to help ukraine plug gap in its capability deliver cutting edge drone along with electronic warfare and mine clearance capability with million of pound of kit to come we be invest not just in weapon but in the brave personnel who serve so far britain have put more than ukrainians through their pace here in the uk but operation interflex our main training effort be go to expand even far be delighted to announce that kosovo and estonia have join we australia canada denmark new zealand norway the netherlands sweden finland lithuania and romania in all train ukrainian troop here in britain together we will train further in the first half of meanwhile we be build capability coalition alongside norway we be lead maritime capability coalition and we have be join by dozen other country in this enterprise this be about mine detection drone raid craft and sea king helicopter which have already be send its way so that ukraine can build its navy and defend its sovereign water last week meet my nato counterpart in brussels and announce that together with latvia we would lead the drone coalition that will allow we to scale up and streamline the west provision of miniature first person view fpv drone to ukraine while support the establishment of drone school for ukrainian operator and test range as well as develop ai swarm drone technology which will surely be critical in the next phase of this war britain have earmark some million to procure and produce long range strike and sea drone and become ukraine large supplier of drone yet this be far from the summit of our ambition in december we set up new taskforce to build strong defence industrial partnership with ukraine ensure that ukraine can sustain the fight for year to come in january the prime minister sign the historic security co operation agreement this be the start of year alliance that we be build with our ukrainian friend once again it be the united kingdom that have sign the first such agreement with welcome signing from france and germany have follow the ukrainians have the will and they have the skill and they have show that if they be give the tool they can do the job but their need today remain particularly urgent russia be continue to attack along almost the entire frontline only recently decimate and then capture the eastern town of avdiivka the kremlin continue to callously strike at civilian target most recently hit hospital in selydove putin be make no secret whatsoever of be in this for the long term russia economy have indeed shift on to full time war footing spend some of its federal expenditure on its defence nominal increase of almost just on last year alone if the cruel death of the remarkable brave russian opposition leader alexei navalny have teach we anything it be that putin victory be something that none of we can afford the tyrant of the kremlin be determine simply to wait out the west he believe that we lack the stomach for the fight and we must show he that we be wrong this house may not be unite on all matter as we have see in the past hour but we be unite on one thing our support for ukraine so the uk will continue to double down on that support and all freedom love country must be compel to do the same this year will be make or break for ukraine so it be time for the west and all civilised nation to step up and give ukraine the backing it need two year ago when speak to an anxious oleksandr kubrakov who have retreat to that field outside kyiv he do not know what would happen to ukraine now enter the third year of this conflict it be remarkable to see that ukrainians remain in full fight know that the whole house will join in say that the uk will not stop support the brave ukrainians our friend until they have win and have victory just for the record secretary of state think you may have misspoken those on the front bench be smile think you intend to say we must show he that he be wrong but believe you say we be wrong perhaps may take this opportunity to correct the we to he for the avoidance of doubt be sure that hansard can correct that to what be in the statement thank the defence secretary for his statement this be his first statement on ukraine and he could not have choose more important moment as we mark two year since president putin brutal illegal invasion begin two year in which city have be smash hospital hit by missile power plant bomb civilian rap and child abduct to russia two year of war in europe that have shatter wide european security his statement today give this house on behalf of the british public chance to show that the uk be totally united and commit in support for ukraine as it fight for its freedom its territorial integrity and its right as democratic country to decide its own future the uk will stand with ukraine for as long as it take to win we know that be the strong message that the prime minister and the defence secretary convey to ukraine when the labour leader meet president zelensky in kyiv last year he say that on military help for ukraine and on reinforce nato ally the uk government have have and will continue to have the full labour support two year on be proud that the uk continue to be unite on ukraine proud that british family have open up their home to ukrainians flee putin war and proud that people across britain in all walk of life have organise donation and delivery of assistance to ukraine the ukrainians be fight with huge courage the military and civilian alike they have regain half the territory take by putin and disable his black sea fleet they have develop new weapon at record speed but russia be far from spend force and if putin win he will not stop at ukraine the defence secretary mention avdiivka and the force ukrainian withdrawal there be warning to the west they have the heart to fight but they do not have the ammunition so as russia step up its war effort as the defence secretary say so must we step up uk support putin be not just fight on the battlefield this be war on the diplomatic front the economic front and the industrial front struggle on all front against russian aggression we need broad uk plan to help defend ukraine and defeat putin first we must ramp up military support throughout and beyond by implement the uk agreement extend uk training and create clear path for ukraine nato membership secondly we must reboot the diplomatic drive to maintain western unity and support and hold putin to account by work through the the un nato the international criminal court and special tribunal for the crime of aggression thirdly we must take immediate action against wide russian aggression by enforce sanction close loophole in the supply chain and reinforce nato ally on the russian border fourthly we must boost uk industrial production by fast tracking in full the spring budget billion to restock uk armed force and ukraine fifthly we must get ready for ukraine recovery with more de mining help and enable seize or frozen russian state asset to be use for the reconstruction of ukraine defence of the uk start in ukraine and be proud of uk leadership on ukraine want still to be proud in six month time so may press the defence secretary we welcome the extra brimstone antitank missile will he now go beyond these ad hoc announcement and set out full military aid action plan we welcome the billion for will every pound be spend on ukraine and not on uk operational cost at nato basis we strongly endorse the uk ukraine agreement on security co operation will he now follow that up with an implementation plan so that ukraine get the urgent and sustained help it need finally we back the ukrainian home and visa scheme will the government rethink their decision this week with no consultation and no notice to close the family visa scheme in conclusion ukrainians be watch election around the world very closely this year that be why when he meet president zelensky the labour leader pledge on behalf of britain there could be change in government this year but there will be no change in britain resolve to stand with ukraine confront russian aggression and pursue putin for his war crime thank the right hon gentleman for his support and indeed all member of this house from all party for the tremendous support that ukraine have experience from this parliament as he say whatever else our division no one should be in any doubt about the united voice with which we speak on this subject he be right to mention the exceptional work do with training imagine he have see some of the interflex training and there be no great pride than see with other world leader their own trainer training here in the uk we can be truly proud of that and as mention we will be do more of it the right hon gentleman be also right about nato membership as the ultimate path for ukraine we have the anniversary of nato come up in summer in washington and it be important that the west help to set that path for ukraine membership even more firmly he will be pleased to hear that my right hon friend the attorney general be work proactively on the legal matter as be the chancellor the prime minister and the foreign secretary on sanction which will only work as recent reporting show if they be do in collective manner include with the and other body the right hon gentleman ask about military action plan in conversation with my opposite number minister umerov as well as president zelensky and other what they want be for we to work privately with they on the billion and that be what we be do there be strategic reason for not produce publish plan on that we will release information to the house as appropriate but there be military reason to do it rather differently on this occasion reassure the right hon gentleman that not only do we spend the publish amount but we go over and above that in variety of different way the right hon gentleman be right about the importance of the partnership co operation agreement and we will be publish series of follow up for example one measure be to teach english as the second language for ukraine and know from talk to my right hon friend the education secretary that university be in the process of be link to ukrainian institution to press that plan forward and much else besides be involve with that agreement on security co operation lastly the shadow secretary of state mention the family visa scheme for ukrainians as he know have ukrainian family of three and dog live with we for year after the invasion and they be still live in this country they be keen to return home to build ukraine back when this war end in the meantime this government have put in place further visa arrangement which if not the most generous in the world be among they know from speak to the family who live with that they be delighted with that statement by the home secretary recently the defence secretary have recently draw parallel with the he speak powerfully at lancaster house about our transition from post war world to pre war one in similar vein be part of conservative friends of ukraine delegation to congress recently to lobby republican congressman to support the aid package in one such conversation republican perfectly reasonably ask why should tell the people of my district to send their taxpayer dollar to ukraine to which humbly reply because as member of nato it be ultimately cheap than send your son and daughter in that context do the defence secretary agree that while we must respect american domestic politic it be not for we to tell they what to do this again be time for the new world in all its power and might to come to the rescue and liberation of the old be grateful to my right hon friend for raise that matter be aware of his work in congress in fact think we be there at roughly the same time last month and his clear explanation and lobbying of congress to help release that money to ukraine his point be absolutely right the aid package be in america interest not just to come to the rescue of europe but because other despotic leader other autocrat and other regime of any type will be look at whether we simply lose and give up because we get bored of the fight and then walk away they will draw conclusion about that and whether they can always take on the red line of the west and the no go area if all they have to do be wait it out this be why my right hon friend be right to say that it be indubitably in america interest to step in because otherwise they will find it far more expensive in the future perhaps in other part of the world to defend the world order let thank the secretary of state for prior sight of his statement and reiterate the unequivocal support of snp members for the defence and we hope liberation of the rest of ukraine in its battle against vladimir putin know he recognise that part of be an opposition party be to highlight where we think there may be improvement and will highlight supply chain issue which be allude to by the shadow defence secretary today ed conway of sky have be highlight issue around sanction bust export from the uk critically around heavy material notably car export say let us imagine you russian unit need weapon imagine you rely on certain input or tool from the uk back in the past you get it directly but you can anymore one solution that ed allude to be the setting up of shell company in friendly caucasus state and notably in kyrgyzstan he say that since the sanction implement not only by the uk but other ally export from the uk to kyrgyzstan of the very material that those frontline russian troop need have increase by more than can the secretary of state advise the house whether he will take that information away engage with his cabinet colleague and write to or the defence committee about how the government will seek to block off those sanction bust process will he highlight to those company that be participate that they be undermine the democratic value of the future ukrainian nation thank the hon gentleman for the support from the snp add to the weight of support from this house for ukraine and for raise that issue read at length the excellent thread from ed conway this morning talk about this issue it be the case that when sanction be set up initially they tend to work but then rather like water flow around boulder in the stream people will eventually work their way around and find another route to market it be important that we continuously look at and assess whether those sanction be do the thing we initially intend they to do as ed conway point out in the thread this be an international problem he take the uk as an example but extend it out and say that it be happen elsewhere too assure the hon gentleman that the british government will be take close look at what be happen in reality this be clearly treasury and foreign commonwealth and development office lead but undertake to work with they and thank he for raise the issue can my right hon friend take this opportunity to emphasise that the light attendance in the house this afternoon be not an indication of any lack of resolve among member or any of the political party to stand up to president putin invasion of ukraine which the prime minister recently describe in the liaison committee as an existential threat to european and transatlantic security can the secretary of state also share with the house whether he believe there be evidence of an emboldening of russian aggression particularly towards moldova perhaps be threaten from belarus which appear to be prepare for an entry into this conflict can he shed any light on that on his first point my hon friend be right it be thursday and many member will have return to their constituency but the russian viewership of the chamber should not mistake the level of attendance with the level of interest the reason that people have feel confident to return to their constituency be that they know there be no dispute in this house as we have hear from all side in our solid iron resolve for ukraine on the wide picture member will see the news they understand that with putin he simply murder those who stand up to he he will go to any length he turn his entire economy on to war footing and he try to work with other to further his mean whether that be belarus at the beginning or more recently north korea iran and other pariah state have well not go into the detailed intelligence on the floor of the house although be sure more briefing can be announce it simply add to the overall need for we to stick together not just in this house but with the civilised country of the world and ensure that putin understand that no matter how long he carry on we will always be there to help defend ukraine the defence secretary be certainly in full duracell bunny mode today but it be clear that britain and this government have much to be proud of in our response to the ukraine crisis it be also clear however that right from the outset of the invasion it would be an industrial munition war hark back to the last century while russia have get itself on to full war economy foot our government machine frankly seem to have fail to mobilise british industry in the same way to highlight that will pose simple question why do it take from february to july to place the vital order for additional desperately need artillery shell do not entirely agree with the right hon member characterisation of the uk response in term of deindustrialisation do agree that it be difficult overall to suddenly ramp up from whatever level we be produce at on non war footing but it be hearten to know think this be right but it be off the top of my head will correct the figure if have get it wrong that our munition and missile production be now eight time the level it be before the war so we have certainly step report march vol correction in addition we be carry out round of procurement through the international fund for ukraine which we establish and which be still receive new contribution be delighted that australia have just donate million to that fund think again this be off the top of my head there have be round of contract procurement so far be not familiar with the particular case that the right hon member cite so will write back to he on the detail but it be encouraging that we have be able to set up mechanism so that other country that have not have our scale of ambition and footprint on ukraine can put in their own money so that we can buy in coalition on their behalf we will continue to do that yesterday and several other member of the foreign affairs committee be in warsaw to speak to member of the polish government and british military and security official base in that country will the secretary of state join in pay tribute to british military officer for the work they be do in support ukraine and other ally such as poland and the baltic state will he comment on the increase in russian air incursion into nato airspace sadly last year missile incursion kill two people and missile incursion have take place in recent week what can we do to strengthen air defence not only to defend ukraine against russia aggression but to ensure that democracy in europe be strengthen be delighted that my hon friend be in poland yesterday the poles have be right on the frontline next to ukraine on this they have be tremendous in their support for ukraine and in invest in their own defence sector he be right to highlight british military assistance which come in many different form much of which we can not discuss but it have certainly assist in poland and elsewhere in the region he will be pleased to hear that we also contribute to poland own defence before its election we provide two typhoons to prevent escalation and exacerbation by putin we also provide other air defence mechanism to poland would be happy to provide he with further briefing on behalf of the liberal democrats very much thank the government for the statement and offer our wholehearte support for it this week former russian president dmitry medvedev ask the rhetorical question where to stop medvedev who be now deputy head of russia security council answer do know he continue will it be kiev yes probably it should be kiev he go on to make an outlandish claim that there be threat to the russian federation from kyiv and he make outrageous threat include to the uk will the defence secretary first condemn the ambiguity of medvedev rhetoric on russia ambition secondly will he rebut the wild claim that the russian federation be somehow threaten thirdly will he ask his counterpart in delhi and beijing to urge medvedev to halt his nuclear sabre rattle the hon member be absolutely right to point out those irresponsible comment which very much follow in the footstep of what putin go around say it be completely irresponsible in the modern era to have world leader go about threaten other there be absolutely no justification whatsoever for an autocratic state or any state walk into demographic neighbour and claim it as its own to go far than that and to start threaten other state on trump up charge that nato somehow wish to do the same in reverse be as the whole house will know complete fiction nato have no desire to do anything but defend the exist border that be why nato be no threat whatsoever to moscow welcome the defence secretary statement he be right that the house be unite in its support for ukraine we should be proud of the uk armed force personnel who have train so many ukrainian recruit think he say early that there will be another in the first half of the year which be obviously welcome will he take the opportunity to confirm that our vital training programme will not stop in the summer but will continue for as long as it take for ukraine to win the war we be always look at the good way to train people my expectation be that that training will continue but we be always look at how to improve it far mention that our friend from estonia and latvia be join we in the training so in sense it continue to expand we always want to ensure that we be provide training that be actually need it be extraordinary to know that have have that training in the uk dramatically improve people chance when they get to the frontline towards the east of ukraine we will always want to do more the hon member be right to point out that the figure be for the first half of the year and the plan will be assess from there on may urge the secretary of state to step up pressure on his colleague to shut down sanction evasion the business and trade committee recently take evidence from the national crime agency which say that the uk be still one of the world favourite place for economic crime and sanction evasion company house and the propose new identification regime be widely criticise by the stakeholder we hear from of course we also have the whack great loophole call limited partnership which the government be not currently propose measure to shut down we must shut down the spigot of cash that be fund putin war machine and we can play role in that in the uk as well the right hon gentleman be absolutely right about that as say after period of time sanction become holed and people can get around they and through they have always take particularly tough line on the basic principle that people should not be friend with putin and be able to benefit from that indeed at least one yacht and couple of private jet be ground as result of measure take in the early day of the war when be transport secretary the right hon gentleman make wide point on seize asset the way to do that and make it work be through the and international partner so that it be completely solid again as in many other area we will try to lead that debate as have promise the house before we will also look at what may have work initially but now be not work respect the work that he have be do on it and will certainly encourage my colleague in government to follow through thank the secretary of state for defence for his important statement and for answer question from member throughout the house royal assent have to notify the house in accordance with the royal assent act that his majesty have signify his royal assent to the follow act finance act point of order on point of order mr deputy speaker be there an orderly way in which can raise the plight of my constituent marte prenga who be currently in italy with her two year old daughter starya she travel abroad for medical reason and be unable to return to the uk despite have pre settlement status because her daughter be not be allow to travel back with she before she leave she contact the settlement resolution line four time to ensure that if she travel her daughter could come back with she to the uk she be tell that there would be no problem with that however in the meantime her daughter visa for pre settlement status have be turn down and be under appeal she write to kevin be there anything you could possibly do to help return to the uk with my daughter so she can see her father again and we be able to defend she when the appeal for her visa come around the whole situation be badly affect just want to take my baby home where she belong wonder if could raise that issue on the floor of the house to draw it to the urgent attention of ministers thank the hon member for his point of order and his forward notice of it this be clearly an urgent matter and know that he be diligent mp and will have already contact the home office on it ask those on the treasury bench to bring it to the attention of the home department today so that we can at least get some clarity on where it could go appreciate that on point of order mr deputy speaker want to make helpful suggestion and seek your guidance on it the speaker be good decent and honourable man and we be lucky to have he as the speaker of the house of commons he have my full support and my total confidence he make mistake yesterday and unlike most politician he have be big enough to come to the house and admit that if only other mps would admit when they make mistake we probably would be see in well light be pretty certain that he retain the full confidence of the overwhelming majority of people on both side of the house by the way if we all have to lose our job every time we make mistake would have lose mine year ago and probably every week since let we be reasonable about this and put it in perspective may make suggestion there have be many report about what pressure be or be not place on mr speaker before his decision yesterday do not want he to be ask to breach any confidence because conversation between the speaker and members should remain private we should respect that however it would be helpful if the speaker or the chairman of ways and means could issue guidance to member of this house on what be an appropriate way to make request of the speaker and what would be consider undue influence or inappropriate over the top request if we could have some guidance on that it may stop instance in the future where member be accuse of put intolerable pressure on the chair because we would all know where we stand and what be and be not acceptable ask if you could go away and think about that mr deputy speaker hopefully we can draw line under this matter and get on with what the people who elect we want we to focus on important matter nationally and internationally be grateful for the hon member point of order he say that if he have to resign every time he make mistake he would have be go year ago expect he would never have even get here none the less be grateful for his warm word which will pass to the speaker know that there be ongoing discussion and be sure that he will be in touch with the hon member uk accession to cptpp select committee statement we now come to the select committee statement the chair of the business and trade committee the right hon member for birmingham hodge hill liam byrne will speak for up to minute during which no intervention may be take at the conclusion of his statement will call member to ask question on the subject of the statement which should be brief and not full speech emphasise that question should be direct to the select committee chair not the relevant government minister front benchers may take part in questioning call liam byrne be grateful for the chance to make brief statement about an excellent report that the business and trade committee publish on monday to coincide with the opening of the period of reflection under the constitutional reform and governance act on the comprehensive and progressive agreement for trans pacific partnership it be timely for to make this statement because like many in the chamber be old enough to remember that major brexit benefit be allegedly the freedom for we to negotiate free trade agreement more quickly than the eu and to sign those free trade deal in way that suit the uk it be fair to say that since brexit we have learn some hard truth about the difficulty of negotiate free trade deal not least because the world have change since then economic security be now much more significant issue which make trade barrier hard to bring down we have to navigate new imperative on economic security and there be new dilemma which be why statement such as this be so important the government have discover that they can not just rely on bluff bluster and bit of boosterism to get trade deal over the line remember the manifesto produce by his majesty government at the last election which say that of our trade would be cover by trade deal we be at about now the government promise around trillion in export by be not sure that we be on track to hit that the australia trade deal be criticise by uk farmer for be giveaway and the canadian trade talk be in state of some confusion the india trade deal after gruelle round have some hurdle before the indian election the broad point be that we have all learn lesson about how difficult trade deal be that be why it be important that the government do not oversell the deal before we the role of the select committee be to throw some light on what have be put before we so that we can have proper debate in this house have five brief point that want to draw from our report the first be about precise gain which in the short term be hazy and in the long term be hazy still without doubt geostrategic gain be to be have from join the cptpp that be the objective set out in the integrated review and it be good and real one there be prize there the impact assessment on economic gain say that the boost to uk gdp would be about billion year less than one tenth of per cent by even that number be in doubt because in the evidence we take from the secretary of state she resile from the model use by her department and be unable to give any alternative number we hear evidence from exporter that the treaty would be good for export growth but we note that it would be limit because we already have many trade agreement in place with cptpp member some uk sector could lose out because of international competition electronic equipment transport equipment and semi process food in our conclusion we ask the government to explain what step they will take to ensure that uk business fully exploit the treaty the second point be about the future much have be make about the future possibility of the cptpp because it be gateway to the wide indo pacific region which be expect to account for the majority of global growth between and we make the point that the member of this particular trade treaty account for about of the indo pacific market that be quite small perhaps we be expect to hear more about the government game plan for use this treaty to grow china will apply to join but the secretary of state be not willing to go on the record to explain the government road map for expand this trade agreement in future or say whether they would endorse or block china application if it materialise we be at risk of will the end and not the mean which be not necessarily good policy in our report we ask that the government update their trade model give we some number to look at and set out their idea of what future road map might look like if the great prize in the indo pacific tilt be economic trade of the future let we understand how we will use the cptpp in strategic way to cover big fraction of that market with free trade agreement for our country thirdly we look at trade standard and food standard we take lot of evidence and note the trade and agriculture commission advice to the secretary of state we note that there be lot of evidence about the risk of maintain uk ban on import on beef and pork we note that the trade and agriculture commission be pretty confident that exist protection could be keep in place we also note that protection on import use more pesticide be unlikely to be dilute there be evidence on either side of the argument about increase in palm oil although the minister address that rather well in the bill committee on tuesday the fourth point on which we take evidence be the investor state dispute settlement that be the subject of lively debate in the bill committee on tuesday again we flag that there be argument on both side of the debate the government be within their right to say that they have not lose case like this but the big strategic concern be that if such provision be in treaty it may have chilling effect on regulatory innovation in the uk the point be that there be an argument to be make that bring to my fifth and final point whatever the merit and drawback of the uk join the trade agreement the government must allow that house to play meaningful role in scrutinise trade policy there be contentious issue raise by this treaty there be no doubt about that that be why my committee recommend that government should permit the house debate on the ratification of the accession protocol that debate we say should be on substantive motion it should take place during the day scrutiny period under crag which would give the house the option of exercise its power under that legislation to delay ratification when we ask the secretary of state about this in evidence she say that she be happy to support general debate very much hope that those be not hollow word and that the house will get to debate this treaty in the way that be initially envisage when crag be pass by this parliament those be the key five point hope they be of use to the house let conclude by thank on behalf of my committee all the trade official at the department for business and trade for the hard work they have put into get this treaty sign and over the line it be in the national interest and it be appreciate commend this report to the house on behalf of the labour party thank my right hon friend and indeed the other member of the business and trade committee for their sterling work we refer to much of the select committee work in the bill committee early this week the minister will be aware of some of the amendment table by labour and of the concern not just of the labour party but of civic organisation and body such as the trades union congress on issue such as worker right and investor state dispute settlement hope that the minister will take on board all those various point do my right hon friend agree that it be imperative that before the cptpp be finally ratify labour be firmly of the view that that would be in the national interest it be important to iron out those concern to do otherwise would be to the detriment of our country we also look to the minister for clarification on issue around parliamentary scrutiny on which there be an amendment in committee be grateful to my hon friend for that question think the minister make the point in the bill committee on tuesday that this be not necessarily an under scrutinise treaty as it have be the subject of quite lot of debate my committee have certainly take lot of evidence on it however when we leave the european union one of the big argument make be that this parliament would reassert its sovereignty and in those infamous word take back control that mean that this house need to have strong hand in scrutinise trade agreement we hope that there will be many more free trade agreement to come know that they be get hard but this house none the less need to develop expertise in scrutinise free trade agreement so that we can ensure they be genuinely in the national interest that be why hope the government will within the day crag period find government time for debate on an amendable motion to give the house the opportunity to delay ratification if that be the judgment we all come to that be the process we have to test it use it and make sure it work we have to get much well as house at navigate the dilemma of free trade in world where economic security be much sharper imperative than before that mean we have to have well debate but also well number we can not have situation where we produce model use very old datum go back to in the case of the model use for this treaty impact assessment and when the secretary of state come to our committee she resile from the model of her own department that be not good way of produce evidence base policy hope we can have discussion across the house on how to ensure that the economic model that we use be good free trade agreement be choice and sometimes free trade agreement in one part of the world rule out those in other part of the world we have to judge what be in the good interest of the country and it be difficult to do that if the number be flaky would like to pick up on the point from the hon member for slough mr dhesi during the passage of the trade comprehensive and progressive agreement for trans pacific partnership bill through this place many concern have be raise about investor state dispute settlement arrangement it be good to see that the select committee be call for debate to resolve some of the contentious issue around that however do the select committee chairman consider the provision of the crag legislation to be sufficient or might this be an opportunity to look again at how the specific requirement of trade deal be deal with by parliament that be an excellent question the hon lady may have see really good report produce by not our committee but the public administration and constitutional affairs committee on january which make precisely that point we need well way of scrutinise trade agreement the crag structure allow we to delay thing but not necessarily veto they when crag be introduce back in it be an innovation because in the past that be something that government do without any scrutiny whatsoever now we be in different kind of world in which we be sign free trade agreement at hope increase pace however the house will still have to navigate when we want open trade when we want to de risk trade and when we put economic security first and free trading second these be dilemma in which there be not an obvious answer we can not prejudge the answer to those question they will have to be debate case by case it could well be that government will come to the wrong conclusion about that balance between open and free trade and maximise our economic security as country and therefore we in this house must be able to apply brake put hard stop to trade deal that we think be ultimately not in the national interest represent rural constituency in devon farmer in the west country be alarm at the sort of concession make in the australia and new zealand trade deal until yesterday we think that the uk and canada be negotiate roll over trade agreement canada be member of the cptpp and it will be crucial if the uk canada trade talk resume for the uk to avoid pay twice because we will want to avoid further market access concession can the right hon gentleman offer any reassurance that through cptpp accession we will not open up our market to unmanageable volume of produce that will damage british farming and put farming business in danger of go out of business the way that we approach our analysis be to look at food standard and whether they would be diminish by our join the treaty the trade and agriculture commission look at three question which be talk about in paragraph to of the report we report the trade and agriculture commission advice which be that there would not be diminution in the statutory protection of food standard in this country and that we would in fact be allow to reinforce some of those protection however as the hon gentleman importantly flag we be now find that sometimes the devil be in the detail despite have join cptpp with canada we now appear to be struggle to get in place free trade agreement with canada the canadian government be very clear that technical discussion have stop understand that the secretary of state or spokesman for she tell the financial times yesterday that discussion be ongoing but discussion be not trade talk if discussion be trade talk we would be have trade talk with the entire world right now because our diplomat around the world be in constant engagement with their counterpart in different part of the planet the hon gentleman be absolutely right to flag that issue the reassurance that can give he be that we do not see this treaty lead to softening of the trade standard that we so treasure in this country welcome the right hon member for birmingham hodge hill liam byrne and his report think that this be the first time that have have an interaction with he since my return to the department and since he become the chair of the select committee of course as two former chief secretaries to the treasury we be well used to bit of spar over the year his report be good strong and constructive and he make some strong point about fta be of course choice welcome his statement that cptpp have be well scrutinise in this house do not intend to give an answer to any general question raise because it be not who be be ask however point out to the hon member for tiverton and honiton richard foord that the national farmers union do welcome the uk join cptpp say to the right hon member for birmingham hodge hill that new fta implementation unit in the department for business and trade be look at the important point he raise about how post signature we ensure that the agreement work for british business and british consumer on investor state dispute settlement nothing prevent right to regulate in this country and it can be of benefit to british business overseas guarantee job at home my only question for the right hon gentleman be really just clarification he say that cptpp represent of the indo pacific area which think be true in the sense that china and india be not in cptpp and that therefore it be quite small economic bloc but if can just take issue with he cptpp be currently about of global gdp and the uk joining would make that so he be not wrong in what he say but if he could just acknowledge that the part of global gdp in cptpp be also not just portion of the indo pacific trade be grateful to the minister for that question and for welcome the report we look forward to welcome he before the committee at some point in the near future to talk about some of our forthcoming report on export lead growth the point he make be right and be glad that for once he and agree on the number that have not always be the case the reason we want to flag it be that the government impact assessment state cptpp membership act as gateway to the wide indo pacific region which be expect to account for the majority of global growth between and we appreciate that all government need to hard sell their policy achievement that be the nature of the game we be in but it be important that we do not oversell the treaty the reality be that it account for only quite small fraction of the indo pacific market which be trumpet in the impact assessment and in the integrated review as one of the treaty virtue we must be clear eyed and hard headed about precisely what gain come from this treaty specifically and it would help we all frankly if the government set out their road map for grow the treaty in future thank the chair of the select committee for make his statement and respond to question backbench business civil nuclear road map relevant document oral evidence take before the environmental audit committee on december on small nuclear reactor in the transition from fossil fuel hc write evidence to the environmental audit committee on small nuclear reactor in the transition from fossil fuel report to the house on december hc and correspondence from the chair of the environmental audit committee to the secretary of state for energy security and net zero on small nuclear reactor in the transition from fossil fuel report to the house on february beg to move that this house have consider the civil nuclear roadmap thank the backbench business committee for allow time for debate on this very important subject this be probably the big moment for the nuclear industry in the uk for year the government have set very important and ambitious target of an extra gw of nuclear energy into the grid by it will require huge feat of civil engineering to create the facility require to deliver that we will do that in the context of wish to see less reliance on import oil and gas in our economy with more clean source of energy and electricity and recognise that other change in technology be create enormous demand for new energy the impact of artificial intelligence on energy demand will be very significant indeed researcher in the netherlands estimate that the amount of electricity just to power ai in the world by will require enough electricity to power country the size of the netherlands that be not insignificant amount and an entirely new demand in addition to the high level of water require to power the cool system require for the amount of compute power and energy our demand for the electricity market be change but technology be also change the impact it will have the review that the civil nuclear road map set out have to consider not only those challenge but the requirement set in when the current nuclear site list be agree by parliament that it would need to be review in for the next period remember very well as new member of parliament the review and with the nuclear power station at dungeness in my constituency the idea of the site list then be to try to give certainty to community that nuclear power station could be develop there largely alongside exist facility eight location be agree dungeness in my constituency be not expressly rule out but it be not include at that time have try to be an advocate for look at what be possible for nuclear site such as dungeness and not just look to say well if they can accommodate nuclear reactor the size of hinkley point or sizewell then there be no future for they at all do that not indicate why there ought to be great latitude in particular when consider small modular reactor and preferably those produce in the united kingdom completely agree with the right hon gentleman will come on to that in more detail that be normally an excuse to say be not go to answer his question but wholeheartedly agree with what he say and want to give it some attention as go through my remark the advent of advanced nuclear technology and small modular reactor be the big thing that be different now compare to they give we more flexibility in the technology that can be deploy also agree with the premise of the right hon gentleman point this be exciting not just because it open up new opportunity for nuclear power in the uk but because it create an opportunity for renaissance in the civil nuclear industry in the uk it be particularly exciting to see british firm such as rolls royce lead the development and design of new small modular technology while the government have their competition to identify good bet in term of technology to invest in we need to look not just at the unit price of that technology but at the wide impact and benefit to the uk economy of invest in the new technology in particular the modular reactor that can be factory build and assemble they can be design not just to meet our energy demand they could also be an export industry for the future for the uk that be an incredibly important part of the equation in design the civil nuclear road map and through the creation of great british nuclear the government have try to make it as easy as possible for the industry to work with the government to understand what the government need and objective be and to understand the technology that they may seek to invest in think all of that be welcome certainly the people in the industry have speak to welcome that step which create degree of certainty we be look at far more player to be involve in the uk nuclear market than be the case in the past with far great range of technology and different business invest in they and develop they in the uk europe the united states and far afield this be all to be welcome and encourage appreciate why it be difficult for the government now as it would have be in the past to say these be the technology that we know with certainty we can back because the range be so great but nevertheless we need to give certainty to the market and investor the government competition for smr be also important but there will be developer of technology that do not necessarily require government subsidy and support but simply seek site where they can deploy their technology and know they connect to the grid the hon gentleman talk about the competition would also mention the time it be take be the underlie problem not that while we have manufacturer with proven capacity to produce modular reactor as it have be do for the royal navy for many decade the united states be out there sell its technology with the full backing of the us government and their various department right the way across europe and other part of the world we be just consider it be we not hobble british industry and the possibility of we be involve as he rightly say in this exciting new development be sure the minister will speak for himself on that particular point but that be not characterisation would share what the competition and great british nuclear be do be give very strong signal to business such as rolls royce not only that this be sound technology to invest in but that there be potentially very robust market for it in the uk that be what would like to see and why say early that when these technology be consider we need to think about the broad impact on uk manufacturing and job that support and back these technology would bring not just the manufacture of modular reactor and electricity have meet rolls royce and see its smr plan and design they be incredibly exciting as the right hon gentleman say this be technology that have be develop for the royal navy and its application for civil nuclear be very exciting indeed hope that it be very successful with it would certainly be very happy to see rolls royce smr in my constituency at dungeness do support the introduction of small modular reactor but hope the house would not want rolls royce to be give preferential treatment by the office for nuclear regulation in its generic design assessment because we need to ensure that it be safe do my hon friend agree that while sizewell be now get under way it be important that the contractor do honour what they say they will do such as source the water and ensure that skill and job be happen locally in order to give people confidence we know how long these project have take to get off the ground agree with my right hon friend particularly on her point about the labour market and in the sizewell area that be incredibly important know from dungeness in my constituency that it be the certainty of have long term employment that attract some of the good talent and encourage people include apprentice to join the industry the minister will probably want to comment on the substance of my right hon friend remark in the time available to want focus on the site list consultation element of the civil nuclear road map the government be say that the criterion that be apply to nuclear site in should still apply today and in most case that be true safety access to water where appropriate and grid connection could all be important consideration when it be be decide where the site could be along with habitat implication and in coastal area flood risk all those be constant the one factor that have completely change since be the size of the footprint of the nuclear facility itself in dungeness an important factor have be the existence of special protect area as consequence of the unique shingle peninsula on which it sit which be the second big in the world and habitat that be unique in europe let alone the uk the big shingle peninsula in the world be cape canaveral in the united states the protection be there for area of the shingle bank that have never be disturb however there be plenty of area surround exist nuclear site that be in effect brownfield site where that disturbance have take place as they be not in special protect area believe that future development would be possible the hon gentleman be advance powerful argument if we be to persuade people that smr be suitable for use outside conventional nuclear site sit they in place such as dungeness and trawsfynydd which do not fit under the list convey an important message we have to be able to persuade people that small modular reactor can be use in other area as well as not misuse site that might be well use for large nuclear project completely agree have request to make to the government who will be consider the response to the consultation on the road map be keen to hold this debate now during the period of the consultation so that member can have their own view as well appreciate that it would not be easy or desirable for great british nuclear to make technology by technology recommendation for every nuclear site in the country but there should be recognition of footprint size there be site such as dungeness in my constituency and sizewell in that of my right hon friend the member for suffolk coastal dr coffey where small facility could easily be build they could be build on decommission land where old power station have be subject to advance decommissioning they could be build on land that be use as the building work site for the construction of the exist dungeness station or even on the land that be currently car park for the exist nuclear station we need to give the market some certainty that building of certain size can sit within the footprint of an exist nuclear site on land that do not have the high level of habitat protection but at present that be not envisage what the consultation envisage be that every site on the list must be able to do everything if there be to be no distinguish feature between different source of technology we be not distinguish between single smr unit and something as big as hinkley point there must clearly be some relaxation because otherwise other site that be currently among the eight location on the exist list will not be include on the new list the industry will have an opportunity to come forward with recommendation to the department and make case for individual site but obviously without the certainty of know that it be believe that technology below certain footprint would be suitable there and to take into account all the other important site consideration such as the local workforce grid connection access to water for cool if it be require think it would be much well if follow the consultation on the civil nuclear road map we could provide certainty about the type of technology that be possible on some of the small site so that developer and business come forward with those technology would know they look with confidence at some of those site think that would make huge difference to site such as dungeness which in other respect tick every box in respect of its suitability for new nuclear it be on the grid it have domestic labour market and it have strong support from the local community in almost every case the exist nuclear site be the most supportive of investment in new nuclear because people be already familiar with the industry and know how many job would be create if the minister could say something about this today it would be much appreciated but should certainly like it to feature in the government response to the consultation as say early be not seek site specific information about each technology of which there could be many more in the future but hope it will at least be recognise that the big difference between smr and reactor the size of hinkley point be literally that their size smr will not be suitable everywhere in fact they will be suitable in relatively few place but other technology will be suitable on wide base if the government be to meet their target they will have to do so by deeming site that be not currently be deploy to be suitable for smr we should give the industry as much backing as possible in make that investment commend the hon member for folkestone and hythe damian collins for initiate the debate it may not surprise he that will approach it from different angle provide the opposition as it be in my view this should be call the nuclear road map fantasy even if we put aside my objection and that of my party to new nuclear power all the evidence and all the understanding of the development or non development of nuclear power in the uk over the past decade point to the fact that this will not happen as the hon gentleman rightly point out the plan never come to fruition it be obvious that the nuclear ambition have not be fulfil in the past year every pro nuclear enthusiast seem to ignore the fairly recent market failure whereby hitachi walk away from wylfa and oldbury and toshiba walk away from moorside notwithstanding the intended competition for the construction of all these new nuclear site edf and china general nuclear remain the only show in town and edf be still the only show in town as the only company willing to build large scale nuclear edf have blank cheque when it be at the negotiating table because there be nowhere else for the government to go large scale nuclear ambition also ignore the fact that as concept the epr design have be failure with every single epr project in the world be over budget late and experience technical difficulty finland olkiluoto be year late flamanville in france be year late and at four time its original budget taishan in china be hold up as the delivery exemplar when it be commission but have be plague by safety concern owe to rod damage and have be offline as much as it have be online since it be commission we be tell that the lesson learn from all the problem with all the other epr project would be put into place in hinkley and that it would be much more efficiently deliver so let we look at hinkley point in its estimate cost be billion but edf have recently update that estimate to billion in today price mere billion overspend instead of generate power in it will now be as late as as cost have continue to spiral the government attitude remain that it do not really matter for the taxpayer because all the risk sit with edf however china general nuclear which be partner in the project have already reach its cap on the money and capital it be willing to put in so clearly edf be now have to find lot more borrowing than it anticipate frankly it beggar belief that the minister and the government claim not to be speak to edf about this especially when just last week the chief executive of edf luc rémont state we confident we can find pathway with british authority on hinkley point and sizewell when will the government admit that hinkley point will need some sort of bailout to allow it to get to completion or be the intention to throw more money at sizewell to offset hinkley financial black hole for edf the government also need to come clean on why they put back the contractual payment cut off date for hinkley by six year do they know that there be potentially far bad news for hinkley the lesson learn have not work out for hinkley but now we be tell that it have be good learning project and that sizewell will be different and will be deliver efficiently learn from the lesson of the delivery of hinkley again this be head in the sand stuff the last government estimate for sizewell be billion but we now know that hinkley will cost nearly billion so it be quite clear that sizewell will cost billion lot more capital than the government have intimate they be require to raise it be no wonder that pension fund have be run mile from invest in sizewell it be not straightforward comparison because think sizewell be still in line with its price it be fairly standard to try to stick with an estimate but agree with the hon gentleman as the local mp for sizewell be concerned that there have be significant delay at hinkley appreciate that the snp do not approve of nuclear power at all but would like to understand why he be concerned that the government will have to bail out hinkley when that be clearly not the situation would be interested to explore why he think that be the case quote the chief executive of edf who say he hop to find pathway with the british authority which suggest that edf want to be talk about get more money the reality be that if there be billion overspend edf must recover that money somewhere if it can afford to deliver the project without get bailout and in line with the year contract it have for sell electricity if the company have be able to swallow that level of overspend it show that the site rate originally agree in the billion estimate for construction be way too high because the original billion be suppose to cover contingency as well something do not stack up give that there be such an overspend and such delay the delay mean that it will be even long before edf start get payment for the project so something be not quite right and we need to get well understanding of that disagree that sizewell be still in line with its price at the end of the day although some lesson can be learn and replicate the site for sizewell be small more constrained and geologically different it be surround by marsh and adjacent to an internationally renowned nature reserve it be also in one of the fast erode coastline in europe which be subject to rise sea level and more extreme weather event in other word would argue that sizewell be daft location for new nuclear power station with the groundwork and initial civil engineering that will be require it be not straightforward carbon copy of hinkley we need to know the official estimate for sizewell taxpayers deserve some transparency especially give that the government have already allocate billion of taxpayer money to edf for the development of the project just to get to the stage of final investment decision enough money have already be plough into sizewell yet there be still lot of uncertainty on the wide programme delivery consideration for these large scale nuclear site hinkley will have take year to complete if it be complete by even if we be optimistic about sizewell which will be deliver much more quickly it be still go to take at least year so it could be between and before it be deliver these timescale alone show the folly of rely on nuclear for decarbonisation and of planning for nuclear to deliver of generation output capacity by as set out in the road map it also show the folly of the road map state delivery target of gw to gw every five year it be fantasy target as be gw overall unfortunately the concept of gw or of generation output be the wrong model give that nuclear power be so inflexible such large nuclear output on the grid mean that at time even great constraint payment will be pay for renewable energy company to turn off their turbine large scale nuclear can not deliver the intended five year target so how will those target be meet as the hon member for folkestone and hythe damian collins outline the road map talk about small modular reactor the name sound innocuous but do people really believe that footprint the size of two football pitch be small it clearly be not and there be not yet single license prototype in the uk good luck in the competition for smr consider that none have be license and approve for construction in the uk of the design that the office for nuclear regulation be consider the only one to have reach stage be the rolls royce proposal with the onr stage assessment due to conclude in july stage timescale be still to be confirm so the reality be that smr be just glint in the uk eye at the moment there be no understanding or certainty on timescale even if smr do come to fruition nuscale be supposedly the world leader in smr technology and it have just give up on its propose smr in utah because cost have balloon to billion the cost of electricity generation have rocket too our road map tell we that the uk will pioneer and lead the way on new nuclear and smr but that do not make sense the government estimate that smr will cost billion go which make no sense give the cost of the project in utah the chair of the environmental audit committee the right hon member for ludlow philip dunne be in his place and welcome the question he have put to the government the government need to consider this closely and look forward to their response why do the road map outline two possible funding model contract for difference and regulated asset base at per megawatt hour strike rate over year hinkley point be way more expensive than renewable energy at circa to per megawatt hour over just year concession period when we debate the legislation on the regulated asset base funding model the government tell we that the cfd model do not work for nuclear as it be too expensive and that switch to rab would save billion to billion over the lifetime of nuclear project if that be the case why be two funding model list in the road map be the government now concerned that rab transfer too much risk to the bill payer be they concerned about repeat what happen in south carolina where under regulated asset base model company abandon the construction of nuclear power station and ratepayer be leave pay for power station that be never complete what be to stop that happen at sizewell the road map outline the need for geological disposal facility but there be no plan in place to show how such facility will be identify construct and pay for what be the estimate cost of gdf how big will it need to be will it be one facility or will there be more depend on how many nuclear power station be build worryingly the road map talk about have interim storage in the meantime this show that there be still no solution in place for dispose of radioactive nuclear waste other than bury it for hundred of year our current decommissioning legacy be estimate to be billion so why do we want to create another generation of nuclear waste for future generation to pay for there be always risk that future government will need to pick up the tab for decommissioning no matter what company sign up to at the outset finally we be tell that nuclear be require because of its reliability and because it produce power when the wind do not blow and the sun do not shine over the last year however each nuclear reactor have be offline for roughly quarter of the year so the dependability of nuclear be not given indeed heysham and hartlepool power station be offline and have be since december so two out of three in the exist fleet in england be offline before hinkley come online seven of the original eight nuclear station operate just few year ago will have go offline if we can operate with such depletion of the exist nuclear fleet before hinkley come online that undermine the argument that we need nuclear to supply the baseload the government clearly do not think that the light will go out when the rest of these nuclear station be be decommission before hinkley come online to the road map seem to be all false aspiration and not enough substance and it fly in the face of the reality of what we know about the operation of nuclear in the past few year and how the market really sit at the moment be grateful to the hon member for kilmarnock and loudoun alan brown for refer to the letter that the environmental audit committee have just send under my name to the secretary of state be pleased that my hon friend the member for folkestone and hythe damian collins allow the letter to be tag to this debate when he secure it and congratulate he on do so it be on an important subject and from our committee point of view it be timely because we write to the secretary of state only few week ago before the recess some member of my committee it be very diverse committee with complete range of opinion on this subject have very strong reservation about the role and scope of nuclear energy in the uk but will start by place on record my personal support for nuclear energy and the smr programme which be the subject of our letter and will be the subject of my remark today it be an important part of the path to net zero contribute not just to baseload but to the significant increase in electricity generation that will be require if we manage to decarbonise our economy as be support across the house look forward to listen to the contribution from the opposition spokesman the hon member for southampton test dr whitehead but the labour party energy policy be in complete disarray therefore welcome the stark contrast that the minister have provide particularly in his new role as minister for nuclear by get nuclear on the road to regeneration as core part of our energy mix as we move towards net zero it be precisely because the labour party during its last period in office make no decision and would not even debate the subject that we have such skill shortage in the uk civil nuclear sector that be pick up in an intervention by the right hon member for warley john spellar no new nuclear reactor have come online in the uk since because of that indecision so welcome the civil nuclear road map which set out the government ambition to reach as much as gw of nuclear power by the intent to deploy smr will assist the uk in reach that target as be set out in the british energy security strategy ask the minister to consider the concern that raise in the committee letter of february to the secretary of state among which be the fact that the investment decision seek between and be likely on current plan to realise generating capacity of between gw and gw the minister who be very good at math will recognise that that be quite range gw or half the government gw upper target for nuclear capacity by great british nuclear tell our committee that the government target of produce up to gw of nuclear power be not sufficient to give industry confidence about the scale of investment that would be require and suggest that specific programme should be require to facilitate industry confidence further clarity this be the essence of my letter would be welcome despite the government assertion in response to the committee recent intervention as it stand the road map do not offer as much clarity as industry and investor require give the increase international interest and competition in investment in build nuclear energy capacity we need to recognise that the uk market for create that additional capacity can not be consider in isolation we be in an international race to transition our economy into decarbonised world in which many other country be look to build nuclear capacity those involve in deliver that capacity will have choice where to invest to build and to bid key role for government in achieve their objective of introduce smr nuclear energy be to provide as much clarity as possible in the process for decision making the timescale to which they be work and the manner of the procurement process include funding and contracting model urge my hon friend the minister to make the government expectation on gigawatt roll out as clear as possible so that the contribution smr be expect to make to the electricity generation mix in the uk by be make available to industry that will give it the confidence it need to invest in the programme to the extent the government would like and accord to the timetable they have indicate in the road map assume ministers be as convince as be about the future role of baseload generation in supply electricity to the grid alongside the power to be provide by renewable and be sure the minister will need no further invitation to set that out in his response on current estimate it seem unlikely that smr deployment will be contribute generating capacity to the grid until the date by which the government expect the gb electricity grid to have be decarbonise with both hinkley and sizewell likely to be operational in the early quite how the labour party believe it can decarbonise the grid by full five year ahead of that against all consensus of prevail expert advice be matter for labour but it seem wholly fanciful and frankly misleading to the british public so what will the additional generating capacity to be deliver through an smr fleet provide there be strong suggestion in the road map and its support paper that fleet of smr base on advanced nuclear technology will have application beyond power generation but until those technology be prove to be viable for deployment in smr with the benefit that modular approach to construction be expect to provide which be highlight by my hon friend the member for folkestone and hythe damian collins in introduce the debate they remain some way off be ready for investment not only be nuclear and the smr approach to deployment crucial component of reach net zero but there be significant economic benefit to the uk if we be leader in this technology include large potential export market for smr unit the uk smr programme be in an advanced position among western country it have the potential to facilitate nascent export market and deliver new skilled job across the uk along with my right hon friend the member for west suffolk matt hancock in when be minister for defence equipment science and technology and have responsibility for defence nuclear procurement be proud to launch the coalition government programme for sustain the uk nuclear skill the competitive advantage we have in this field be potentially huge if properly resource and incentivise however all of this require the government to flesh out the road map in way that far demonstrate long term commitment to the uk nuclear future and to learn from the issue in procure gigawatt scale nuclear when develop its strategy to deliver nuclear through smr simon bowen whom commend for his clear leadership of great british nuclear explain to the committee that between one and four smr design be to be select for government contract with at least one smr project to be take to final investment decision by on the issue of the timetable be disappoint that the road map remove reference to clarity of the timeline for the conclusion of the current design competition signal that the government may push back award contract to winner of the smr design competition beyond summer as originally intend hope the minister will use this opportunity to clarify when he expect to announce the outcome and hopefully that will be prior to the summer recess any of we who have hold responsibility for procurement in government will know that time be constant pressure so encourage the minister to do all he can while in post to put in place the right process early so that deadline do not slip our committee have say that in the interest of parliamentary and public confidence in both the expenditure of public money and the timely delivery of expected benefit the smr programme should be fully subject to value for money audit by the national audit office provide that this in itself do not add delay to the delivery recognise the pressure to streamline planning and regulatory process but the committee think it vital that robust governance and safety arrangement be maintain this be not an area where ministers will want to cut comer while be on my foot ask the minister to comment in his closing remark on medium report that great british nuclear be in discussion with edf to purchase part of the exist nuclear site at heysham as likely location for one of the first smr facility my hon friend the member for morecambe and lunesdale david morris neighbour of yours mr deputy speaker in whose constituency heysham sit can not be here for this debate but he have tell that the site in his constituency have grid and rail connection supportive community and clearly highly skilled workforce the large of any generate nuclear site in the uk which could support the operation of any future nuclear development at heysham in order to help accelerate deployment once the successful design have be select which other speaker in this debate have call for can the minister confirm whether gbn could make start on prepare one or more site for the eventual successful bidder once the government have announce which site they have designate for initial deployment finally the fact that every nuclear power plant start life under conservative government demonstrate our willingness to make important decision for the term future of this country welcome the government plan as they represent the big expansion of nuclear power for believe year my hon friend the member for folkestone and hythe say year which will lead to quadrupling of nuclear capacity by the uk can once again become lead nation in provide civil nuclear energy and this government can take credit for take the key decision to bring that about it would be great to expedite those decision as soon as possible we have already have mention of the significance of net zero we know that alongside that the demand for electricity will increase exponentially we know too that energy security not just for the united kingdom but for the supply of electricity that we currently receive from european country or the price that they will be prepare to pay for electricity and energy will affect what we produce here ireland to the west of the united kingdom and very significantly to the west of wales be also go through the same thought process about its need for electricity the all party parliamentary group on nuclear energy pay visit to finland alongside the great significance of employment which be in no way insignificant in any of our constituency least of all in one such as dwyfor meirionnydd which be one of the lowest pay constituency in the uk there be other socioeconomic driver which could be part of this programme and which be implicit in the road map one of those driver which we have not consider in sufficient depth be the cost of electricity in the united kingdom again speak for my constituency when say that we alongside merseyside pay among the high standing charge if not the high standing charge in the uk yet we have tradition of generate electricity can think of hydro production facility in tanygrisiau which be produce and feed into the grid and go over some of the poorest build housing that we know of in my constituency and certainly among the poorest build housing in western europe there be deep anomaly here we know how much energy poverty be hit our community we must be look in future not just at the boon that come with employment but at the boon that come from generate electricity in finland for example large scale power station pay in to real estate taxis they pay so much that everyone else pay less in france people pay less for electricity when they be in the environ of generating station these be thing that we need to consider because as thing stand we be deal with inequality and people suffer from power poverty like the hon member for folkestone and hythe damian collins want to speak about the decommission power station in my constituency but first welcome the announcement on wylfa it be the policy of my party plaid cymru to support development at wylfa and trawsfynydd although not at any more site in wales previously work in further education we see expectation and hope raise and then dash in community which be of course what have happen at wylfa in the past urge the government to ensure that what be propose be robust resilient and sustainable and that the development be bring forward remember programme of apprentice who have to finish their apprenticeship elsewhere because they be no long able to do so at wylfa that be very damaging there be immense potential but this must not be just political boon in the run up to general election these scheme matter immensely to our community and must not be handle lightly trawsfynydd just like dungeness be site that do not find its way on to the list for reason that be perfectly understandable at the time but would strongly argue that it should be under consideration in the here and now why first will namecheck constituent rory trappe who when he work at trawsfynydd he be also the prospect union rep almost single handedly get trawsfynydd mention in the financial times and elsewhere as the first site for which an smr be be consider that raise people hope in my constituency as mention the difference that would make to salary in an area such as meirionnydd in gwynedd be immense it have be part of the ambition north wales growth deal as well public money have be allocate to trawsfynydd but there be now question mark hang over that funding another advantage of the site be that we have grid connectivity know that for some other site that will be question there will be cost public controversy and issue over pylon but at trawsfynydd grid connectivity exist the site be entirely in public ownership there be question about the good use of public money trawsfynydd be not on the list because it be on lake rather than on the sea it be recognise then that the site be not sufficiently supply with water for large scale development in the future that come back to an argument that raise in my intervention if smr be to be show to be suitable on site other than conventional site the government should look at how they can show that on the ground again that be one of trawsfynydd original positive point alongside that the welsh government have invest cwmni egino as development company for the site that appear to have be disregard in the criterion be sure that the criterion for gbn be very worth while but that factor which be unique to wales be not consider strongly urge that it now be consider finally there be mix for the area we have hydro generation scheme at maentwrog so old that it exist even before the national grid we also have company call ynni twrog with local scheme for energy and scheme for community energy it want to engage with the profit generate from maentwrog would welcome the opportunity to discuss that far and everything else that have raise with the minister trawsfynydd cease to generate over year ago the fear be about what be be propose now will be tell that trawsfynydd be not off the list and know that other sort of technology will be mention but they be year away that be year without any generation at publicly own site that be more than professional lifetime this be waste of resource we be talk about something that would make an immense difference to the area and to north west wales as whole would like to know what the minister propose for the site be there possibility of an smr if the minister propose an alternative technology what be it how realistic be that be we talk about medical isotope as well because that have be moot have moot it because there be security question over their supply reiterate that this be waste of public resource just like at dungeness we have so much that we could be make well use of urge the minister to consider how good to do that be little cautious about rise to speak because like other member in the past have great enthusiasm and great understanding of the need but considerable ignorance of the physics involve have leave physics behind or year ago have two personal link to this matter the first be slightly amusing one live in little place call richmond in the north of the south island of new zealand just down the road be place call appleby which be even small in the the school at appleby have four pupil one of they be ernest hemingway sorry it be not ernest hemingway interruption it be our nuclear man his first invention be potato masher for his grandmother which think be quite an interesting link because as we all know he go on to smash the atom as it have be put my enthusiasm come from recognition that we must have nuclear power in this country even if we take into account the point about hydroelectric but without the facility we can not have it my second link to this matter be that firm in my constituency kbr be power in nuclear production it welcome this road map but have concern about it invite the minister to have roundtable discussion he could bring in the key player to sit down with he and talk the whole project through kbr feeling and sense this as well be that we have classic case of uk caution in this area we have positive response to small modular reactor in the case of rolls royce and terrapower but we do not seem to be get stick in with and behind advanced modular reactor as have already be mention will the hon member give way think the right hon member might make this rather difficult for because of my lack of knowledge but will give way promise the hon member that will not as someone who be very pro nuclear believe that one big issue be that we have load of review and identify all the problem and what we will do and then never actually do it if we do get around to build station we build one not number of they just one then number of year after that we might build another one but to completely different design that be how we keep go in this country do he agree mr beresford think the name you be struggle to find be ernest rutherford sorry it be ernest rutherford the government whip the hon member for newcastle under lyme aaron bell be the genius not thank you the whip have save have actually work it out and be go to bring it up the other thing that rather kick my memory be that when go out to the same place last september stay at the rutherford hotel oh dear my english and english literature be well than my physics concede agree with the right hon member for alyn and deeside mark tami that be the point that kbr and other be make this be an opportunity that we have the distinctly british possibility of miss kbr be go in particular for amr it have come back to and complain as it will to the minister just to prepare he for that meeting about our clumsy development consent order which delay everything be bureaucratic and problematic and could be considerably easy as result we be slip behind some of the rest of the world for example the united states advanced reactor and advanced modular reactor technology developer terrapower have finance match programme well under way that will achieve power generation in the us by we have that opportunity and we have the right attitude but we be not do it stop at this point have make my complaint and miss lord rutherford name we owe our nation the facility to produce the extra of power that we will need when the sun do not shine and the wind do not blow the water will keep run but that be very minor part of our power we do not have those facility and if we miss this opportunity we will hand our child low grade state while welcome the road map it be not enough it do not move fast enough and it do not contain the funding we need but it do have the co operation of the industry which will bring its money bag with it as such invite the minister to come along and talk to some of the key people in short roundtable discussion lord rutherford will be there in the wall behind we rise before we go into the wind up remind member that there be second debate which we would like to get on to as quickly as we can to give other member as much opportunity to discuss their issue as possible ask members to leave two minute at the end for philip dunne as well will be mindful of that mr deputy speaker it be fair to say that while there be very different opinion on nuclear energy and indeed on the civil nuclear road map we can all agree on how important energy be to our future the future of all nation across the uk and indeed that it be become an increasingly important resource across the world as member of the snp represent the scottish constituency of livingston be proud that we be an energy rich nation we in scotland be particularly rich in renewable energy and we want to see those resource make the most of do not believe nor do my party that nuclear be the way forward the effect of climate change and resource competition have demonstrate that access to the amount of energy we need be not give and we must act to ensure that we have secure and sustainable energy resource however the goal of energy security can not be achieve by go backwards which many snp members feel be what be happen it be interesting that even member in this debate who support nuclear energy be critical of the road map my hon friend the member for kilmarnock and loudoun alan brown who be not supportive of nuclear energy make very pertinent point he describe that road map as fantasy that be probably the good and fairest description that could be give none the less member particularly those who have constituency interest raise pertinent and serious issue about cost and delivery throughout the debate as we have hear the cost of nuclear energy be staggering the number we have hear in this debate be almost inconceivable billion for hinkley point include billion budget increase this year alone and an eye water approximation of billion for sizewell budget for some context the uk government will spend only billion to increase the availability of hospital bed in nhs england and only billion on england new childcare plan stark contrast to the cost of nuclear energy every single project run by edf the company commission to build hinkley point and sizewell have run over budget and between six and year behind schedule at time when we face cost of energy and cost of living crisis that be not value for money the plan be not efficient effective or practical what be more those large investment come at the expense of green energy development in the uk non nuclear renewable energy source be credible option to solve energy instability scotland have prove that it can fuel its entire country and more just with wind power in fact accord to national grid scotland full energy mix have be keep the light on in england we be do our good turn but the reality be that money invest in nuclear project be take away from investment in green energy particularly in scotland turn to grid connection an issue that number of member have raise recently meet with developer who be try to develop solar project in my constituency have concern about how close it be to house in my constituency these be new development and there be still lot of area that be be look at however that developer say to that if the project have be build in the south of england it would have be half the size it need to be twice the size because of the grid connection charge as we hear from my right hon friend the member for dwyfor meirionnydd liz saville roberts the grid connection charge and the standing charge in her constituency be absolutely outrageous the green industrial revolution be the great economic opportunity of the century and it will deliver more job cheap energy and great economic growth but this focus on blank cheque investment in unproven nuclear power be utterly ludicrous at the end of the day we need energy in order for the united kingdom to function and fuel be become scarce resource action must be take to resolve that this much we can all agree on but the civil nuclear road map do not even solve the problem in fact the plan as we have hear focus largely on the great development of small modular reactor but the propose mw smr appear to be base on the mw design that have not actually be build make the technology in the civil nuclear road map unproven to have such an important road map and spend so much public money on it and to have at the heart of it technology that be unproven just do not make sense as if that be not enough these smr be think to produce up to time more waste than conventional nuclear reactor as my hon friend the member for kilmarnock and loudoun highlight waste be one of our major concern we be see water pollution across the uk with sewage be pump into river and sea particularly on the coast of england and now we want to dump nuclear waste in bunker or accord to this road map not actually to have any proper plan but just to kick the can down the road scotland and the rest of the uk need government who will deliver comprehensive energy strategy that include job and low bill and that grow the economy we deserve plan that can unleash our full green energy potential and scotland future growth and green future will come from investment in renewable energy not nuclear the uk wide focus on nuclear energy run counter to common sense frankly we have see project and know the minister know this and hope feel it keenly that be cancel as when work in the north east of scotland in the energy industry myself and see that repeatedly with carbon capture with the devastation that wreak on the industry sadly we can not trust the uk conservative government with our energy policy at time when other country be ramp up investment in green energy westminster be show itself to be incapable of deliver credible plan it be clear as this debate have show that the uk government civil nuclear road map do not deliver call the shadow minister first congratulate the hon member for folkestone and hythe damian collins on secure this timely debate via the backbench business process that be extraordinarily efficient since the road map be publish only on january to get parliamentary debate in less than month of that publication be good go indeed so congratulation go to he need to say at the outset for the elimination of any doubt that the opposition consider that nuclear will play significant role in our low carbon economy for the future and we therefore support its development over the future period however the very substantial question that have be raise this afternoon be about what that development will consist of how it will be organise and what site may or may not be available for its development as well as number of relate issue it be good that we now have nuclear road map but think it be fair to draw attention as other hon member have do the chair of the environmental audit committee the right hon member for ludlow philip dunne and the hon member for folkestone and hythe to number of the issue in the overall headline in the nuclear road map which be that there should be gw target for nuclear development out to by the way contrary to the suggestion that the previous labour government do nothing on nuclear in there be nuclear national policy statement that set out the site that should be make available for new nuclear and start the process of discuss those site with developer the problem be that since then yes there be revised national policy statement but not single electron of nuclear power have appear between and the present we be talk about target for the future in the context of serious delay as far as nuclear be concerned yes we must talk about that target and what the energy mix will consist of for the future but we must also talk about whether those thing will materialise in the way envisage and about how we can overcome the substantial delay that seem to be bake in to the process of nuclear development it be not clear whether that target will largely be fill by gigawatt sized plant or by small modular reactor and advanced modular reactor it be not clear what consideration should or will be give to the mix of nuclear as it will sit in what will be very different power mix from hitherto what planning will be undertake to ensure that such mix will be optimal give the need to have power system that can act compatibly with other form of power the road map commit to at least one gigawatt power station in addition to those under way at the moment but as we have hear this afternoon substantial delay in exist large nuclear plant be the order of the day hinkley be now year delay sizewell do not yet have financial closure and it do not look as though there will be any power from that until the early the good news be that sizewell be likely to have year extension on its life it be currently due to close in so that will be effectively the equivalent of new large power station generate in the late onwards so far the government have put billion into sizewell and not one stone have yet be lay on another imagine there would be need in principle for similar sum to be lay before future gigawatt nuclear power plant if that be what the government envisage for their gigawatt strategy in the main it be not indicate on the road map whether the government be able or prepared to do that indeed the money that have already be put into sizewell be not plan on the other hand while we be have competition to determine what support if any should be give to the winner of the competition for smr development an agreement in principle have be reach to build four smr on teesside at no cost to the public purse by the american company westinghouse electric company and community nuclear power it at least appear competition or no competition that there may be circumstance in which at no cost to the public purse nuclear power in the shape of smr can come forward that be another reason why the competition need to go ahead as quickly as possible to get what we be do in the uk as up to speed as possible with what people be do elsewhere in the world what the agreement that have be reach in teesside currently lack be clear route forward about site that be proper subject for another delay action which as mention in the road map be the updating of strategic planning statement concern nuclear the last such statement revise be publish and adopt in and it identify as the document have do number of specific site for gigawatt power station however it run only until indeed number of those site be initially earmark for nuclear plant but the consortium advance they withdraw we be now in different age the priority now be surely to identify site or at least to put in place clear condition under which smr in particular might go ahead see from the road map that an intention for the development of an update appear to be that it will establish clear criterion for such site that be of course delay as with so many thing relate to nuclear planning and action it be not with we at the moment but it should be hope the minister will give we firm indication of when it will be publish and adopt by this house an area where we have have delay and prevarication in the past be nuclear fuel be pleased to see in the road map firm commitment to support the development of new form of nuclear fuel and support for the production of exist fuel such as high assay low enrich uranium which at present be available only from russian source secure those fuel development for springfields nuclear fuel and establish the funding that will make it work be an important piece of work under way early in the path of the road map and see the minister have already lay revise designation for springfields in respect of enable new uranium conversion facility to be develop all of that be good piece of work by the minister and he should be applaud for it on the subject of delay one of the most egregious be the absence of any progress on the identification and establishment of nuclear repository in the word of the road map process be well underway to identify suitable site in which to develop gdf geological disposal facility that have suitable geology and the support of local community those word vary little in content from the original white paper in that state that such process be to get under way have be to finland and see its waste repository it be not rocket science it be not that difficult we have put this off for year and year the argument always use against the industry be there be no answer to the waste well there be an answer and it be forward we just need to make that decision my right hon friend have more or less write the rest of my speech for he be right that it be not rocket science it be nuclear science and it be pretty straightforward essentially by the way the white paper under the previous labour government say in that the process should get under way rapidly with community consent and that geological disposal facility should follow shortly after nothing have happen since then but it be vital as we contemplate the kind of programme that we be envisage for nuclear and the decommissioning of all but one of our current nuclear fleet that storage facility get under way we need rather more in the road map than the sparse word right now or we at least need renew specific pathway for disposal facility to be publish would be interested to hear from the minister whether he be positively inclined towards that idea and whether he appreciate the urgency of make progress on secure geological disposal facility it be pleasure to see you in the chair this afternoon madam deputy speaker commend my hon friend the member for folkestone and hythe damian collins on secure this important debate and on the speed at which he be able to secure it give that it be only month and half ago that be stand at this dispatch box and publish the nuclear road map he be absolutely right to seize the opportunity present in the civil nuclear road map and commend he for his consistent effort on this agenda and for champion his constituency be grateful to visit dungeness last year with my hon friend see the strong local support for that site as potential future location for small modular reactor very much enjoy my trip to the local pub and the fish and chip should that be fission we be serve follow our visit to the reactor the uk already deliver high quality apprenticeship in the nuclear sector we recognise the need to increase the number of apprentice to ensure that the nuclear sector can keep up with demand without compromise the quality of training or career opportunity the value of energy generation to community around the country be an essential part of the discussion month on from the publication of the civil nuclear road map be pleased to be discuss it here today the government be focus on create stable secure and clean energy supply for the country the publication of the road map set out plan for the great nuclear revival of this country as my right hon friend the member for ludlow philip dunne who have be consistent champion of this point out nuclear play key role in our drive towards net zero that have be recognise not only by this country but at cop by other country around the world who come together to pledge to increase their nuclear generating capacity by so that we can take concrete action on the big challenge of our time which we all agree be climate change nuclear power generation be low carbon prove technology that will play an important role in make our energy system more resilient and less polluting we have set out this expansion with quantifiable aim we want to achieve up to gw of nuclear power generation by which be four time what we currently produce that ambition will require we to deploy range of technology from large scale gigawatt reactor to small modular reactor and come down the stream advanced modular reactor on the first of those technology be pleased to say that we be make incredibly good progress since the subject be last raise in the house on january the government have make available furth billion for the construction of sizewell that bring the total government investment available for the project to billion beyond sizewell we have commit to pragmatic approach to nuclear deployment as set out in the road map that mean commit to explore far large scale nuclear project beyond sizewell interruption will not give way will address the comment make in the debate far on in my speech be conscious that we have another debate to get to and do not want to take up any more time for that debate we be already eat into it on smr we have set up great british nuclear an arm length body responsible for help to deliver new nuclear project in gbn launch technology selection process for smr it have be reference with the aim of identify the technology well able to reach project final investment decision in the next parliament potentially release billion of pound of private and public investment in october great british nuclear announce the design of six technology vendor it have select to proceed to the next stage of the process assure right hon and hon member that the next stage of the competitive selection process will be launch shortly the ambition be to announce this year which of the six company the government will support importantly whatever the technology the nuclear programme require new site to enable construction within the decade the government plan publish last january set out how we will achieve the expansion in the come year my hon friend the member for folkstone and hythe will know from the road map that in order to reach our destination of up to gw by we have propose new approach to sit nuclear power station which will empower developer to identify sustainable site the current national policy statement for sit nuclear power station deployable before the end of list potential location for nuclear site our new national policy statement for beyond aim to enable developer to identify site that well match their technology to open up more siting opportunity and facilitate long term market development an update robust site assessment criterion will ensure that only those site that be suitable for new nuclear programme progress through the planning system while be afraid that we can not today speculate on the location of these new nuclear site we will pave the way for new nuclear site in the uk to be make possible by this new nuclear sit national policy statement and civil nuclear road map suggest to my hon friend and any other who be rightly look to the job creation and economic benefit of new nuclear site that my department share their eagerness to confirm these project and we will share news of they as our consultation progress know that red tape and over cautious regulation have slow the progress of many construction project in this country however urge that cautious planning and adherence to correct procedure be necessity when after all we be here discuss nuclear power this be slow process because it be diligent one and it should be diligent one will not make any promise today about the location of new nuclear site but my hon friend and other can be certain that community engagement will be central to the development of any new site and my department be work to deliver that my hon friend the member for mole valley sir paul beresford talk about new technology in january launch the alternative route to market for new nuclear project consultation which aim to explore what step can be take to enable different route to market for advanced nuclear technology and the us and potential benefit they can provide to the uk economy when they do not need the support of the british taxpayer the consultation will end on april and we be seek response to support the development of policy that will allow the nuclear industry to thrive expand our nuclear power generation will benefit every community in the country with clean reliable power but it be the community that host these new nuclear site that will see that benefit most directly the skilled workforce that exist around our exist nuclear site will expect be an important consideration for those look to develop new nuclear reactor we expect that the nuclear sector workforce in the uk will need to double in the next few decade in response to the challenge we recognise that we can not close the skill gap without urgent collaborative action we have work with the ministry of defence and will soon launch the nuclear skill taskforce of which be incredibly proud it will set out the action need to ensure that the uk nuclear sector will have sufficient and appropriate nuclear skill to deliver our civil and military nuclear ambition will the minister give way will not because do not want to eat into the time for the next debate the taskforce will set out our aim and ambition and the work involve close co ordination with industry across civil and military to turbocharge the work already happen to develop the skill we need we look forward to see the taskforce final recommendation very soon right hon and hon member raise extensive point about the road map have be advise that we want to give time for the next debate so will not be able to address they all today however promise the hon member for kilmarnock and loudoun alan brown that would come back to his point on hinkley point and sizewell hinkley point be not government project edf energy be responsible for its delivery additional cost will not fall to the taxpayer despite what hon member might read in the press sizewell will be crucial part of the uk agenda for new nuclear power as say we have make available total of billion to support the project development last year the government and sizewell start the process to bring in private equity back by our new regulated asset base model for nuclear in which we have considerable confidence the hon member claim that the rab would not deliver it be establish as an option for fund new project follow recommendation by the national audit office the most appropriate funding model will be determine by negotiation with project developer on project by project basis as say we have full confidence in that will write to the other member who take part in this debate to address their point because important point be raise but do not want to eat any more into the time for the next debate we have publish three key document which reinforce the uk position as leader in the civil nuclear renaissance civil nuclear road map consultation on alternative route to market and consultation on propose policy for sit new nuclear power station the uk need to increase the resilience of its energy supply while reduce its emission for that reason nuclear power be source of real optimism the continued work of my department and great british nuclear will ensure that the uk have world lead nuclear power industry be very glad to work with my hon friend the member for folkestone and hythe as we turn this plan into reality be grateful to the minister for what he have say and as he allude to in his remark for visit both dungeness power station and the pilot inn at dungeness both be welcome visit for the local community thank all the member who speak in this debate in particular my right hon friend the member for ludlow philip dunne the chair of the select committee the issue on which the right hon member for dwyfor meirionnydd liz saville roberts and be in lockstep be probably not numerous but this be one of they as the minister just say at the dispatch box and as be in the road map document we recognise that to achieve the government aim we need more nuclear site than be currently in the planning framework those nuclear site will probably be other nuclear site that already have the technology and the connection but for whatever reason be not suitable in the list but will be in future move forward if the government say we know we need extra site it will be helpful to give some idea of where they might be question put and agree to resolve that this house have consider the civil nuclear roadmap heart and circulatory diseases premature deaths beg to move that this house have consider premature death from heart and circulatory disease start with something never think that would stand here discuss as share in prime minister question few week ago at have heart attack it happen back in august last year but must admit that it take several month for to feel comfortable talk about it more publicly although know that be on the path to full recovery and feel that be now recover as say in prime minister question feel bit thin for it that be the physical response one thing that come through beyond the fantastic support of the nhs to which will refer later friend and family and my team be the support of the british heart foundation its online resource support and guidance be invaluable in help when be on my own to find way through this get on the path to recovery and understand the story of other hope the debate will not just share my story this be not about but raise awareness of the early sign and symptom and some area of prevention as well as raise with the minister on behalf of other who be perhaps not as fortunate as be some of the challenge to early identification of risk will aim to cover as much as can but know that other will want to speak so will not hog the short time we have hope that even one person might come away from watch this debate be sure there be million at home follow this debate this afternoon able to spot sign for themselves or for family member or friend which might save or change their life to start let we talk about the symptom appreciate that symptom differ slightly for everybody and the british heart foundation have excellent example and guidance for what they might be for it start with feel sort of numbness and tingle sensation in my left arm and an increase tightness in my chest which as it grow start to filter to the back of my body it be not immediate one often think of heart attack as cardiac arrest which be where the heart literally stop and one need defibrillator or cpr but heart attack can feel more like slow process that happen quite quickly if that make sense even though many year ago work on campaign to talk about these symptom with the british heart foundation as client of mine and even though know instinctively what be happen to as start to get those symptom even think do want to phone do want to waste their time end up call expect to hear do be silly take pill go to your gp tomorrow and they get you sort out but they do not say that the message have back immediately be that an ambulance be on its way at which point think this might be bit even then be still in little denial about the situation will not tell the full story but be transfer very quickly to watford general hospital where be see and give exemplary care the east of england ambulance service be absolutely incredible with its speed and the compassion and support be give the same be true at watford general hospital love dearly be then transfer to harefield hospital where be again see very quickly during that process realise the enormity of the situation be in and the potential that could lose my life although be then unlikely to because be in the right place at the right time the hon gentleman mention the work of harefield hospital my son have be at harefield for four month after have heart transplant just before christmas it have be very traumatic time would like to place on record the incredible support and care the hospital provide also want to say that we think of heart attack heart failure and similar condition as affect people my age maybe people bit young or bit old but heart failure and heart condition can affect young people as well we must not have lazy diagnosis where people think just because somebody be young they can not possibly have heart issue cancer or other issue as say really want to put on record the great support that harefield hospital provide may send my good wish to the right hon gentleman son from my experience his son be in absolutely the right place and hope he have swift recovery echo the right hon gentleman comment the staff at harefield be exemplary at every stage of the process again put on record for my own benefit rather selfishly my gratitude to the east of england ambulance service watford general hospital and harefield hospital but also the cardiac rehabilitation team the experience of be in hospital and have heart attack be matter of day but that of the rehabilitation exercise programme and diet change all the thing that be so important be matter of month can talk about it not so much as have save my life but it have change my life can not say that be pleased that it happen but be pleased that it happen the way it do if that make sense in make difference recognise that my experience be not unique however lucky be in the experience have have and the subsequent opportunity to use the platform of parliament to raise awareness of these condition and the work of the british heart foundation and the nhs it just feel very apt to have this debate this month because it be world heart month back bench debate be an opportunity to have these conversation and to raise concern cardiovascular disease include condition that affect the heart and circulation include high blood pressure stroke and vascular dementia which will refer to collectively in the debate as cvd over the past six decade huge stride have be make in improve outcome for those affect by cvd with the annual number of death fall by around half since the in part thank to decade of medical and scientific breakthrough that be why research be just so essential today more than million people be live with heart and circulatory disease in the uk and they cause more than quarter of all uk death in alone over people in england die prematurely of cardiovascular condition that is on average people week just to provide sense of scale that would fill the chamber two time over despite the premature death rate for cvd continue to fall by between and sadly it remain one of the uk big killer the british heart foundation be do lot of work to raise awareness of waiting list go up for heart test and treatment we need to ensure that we tackle that head on there be no room for manoeuvre on this let we keep move forward to make difference more analysis be need from lifesave research by the british heart foundation we know that the cause of premature death from cvd be multifaceted and complex the nhs long term care plan intend to look at many of those area but call on the government to be bold and consider co ordinate action to address the issue in three way urge they to prioritise heart care within the nhs to accelerate vital care to ensure well protection from heart disease by address the driver and underlie health condition such as obesity and smoking and finally to create research and development ecosystem for breakthrough treatment and cure welcome the significant work already under way through the government major condition strategy and the inclusion of cardiovascular disease in it the interim report publish last summer by the department of health and social care make clear the scale and urgency of the government priority to address this issue urgency be absolutely key here around of case of cvd be attribute to modifiable risk factor such as high blood pressure obesity poor diet and smoking make cvd largely preventable through number of lifestyle choice politically be not one who think that the state should intervene and stop people from be able to enjoy their life but think education be key education can come through many different mean include engagement with the nhs and gps provide advice it be not about the state stop people make lifestyle choice but it be fair enough to let they know what those lifestyle choice might lead to and what can make big difference to they and their family nearly two third of adult in the uk around be overweight or live with obesity up to million people have either undiagnose or uncontrolle high blood pressure from my own personal experience admit that know be not go to be run in the olympics any time soon can not exactly describe myself as an adonis but while know be slightly overweight think would be okay think that these thing do not happen to somebody at the age of like most of we think these thing happen to somebody else that be the way our mind work this be wake up call for and that be why want to make wake up call to other from this wonderful platform of the house of commons chamber do not assume that it be all okay get check out and make sure that you watch out for the sign therefore welcome the government ambition to halve childhood obesity by and to help adult reach healthy weight through range of preventive measure to empower people to take control of their own health of course everyone have different way of do that will not share my own dietary habit because be sure that some dietician will watch this and tell have get it totally wrong but have lose about stone in the past four or five month do not do it by fast know the prime minister do his fast each week so will not comment on that or by adopt fad diet simply make some small change in my lifestyle and the way live my life like many people we as member of parliament work long hour my father be lorry driver and be proud of the long hour he work and the work that he do to bring up our job here be not particularly physical but it do involve long hour and be quite sedentary at time and the same probably apply to the job of great many people throughout the uk be mindful of that and go for walk and get bit of exercise can make big difference the nhs long term plan set out the government determination to prevent heart attack stroke and dementia case over the course of year welcome the focus on early intervention to help people live long healthy life but we all know that smoking be still the single lead behavioural cause of preventable death in this country very much support the government desire for smoke free generation by and be glad they be press on with tobacco and vape bill to ensure that child who be now or young that is anyone bear on or after april can never legally be sell tobacco product address lifestyle concern and identify underlying condition early could help to prevent ten of thousand of heart attack and stroke and could support the government ambition to increase healthy life expectancy by five year by but think it mean more than that to it mean that child will grow up see their father or their mother it mean that friend and family can see love one reach the age at which they can call that person grandparent or that person can see they graduate this for be not just about government policy it be about the impact on real people who can be help to lead positive life when we talk about heart attack heart disease and the other issue we be discuss today we be of course talk about premature death but for most people who be affect those condition constitute restriction on their life and want to ensure that we improve that situation for everyone in the country be proud to say that the uk continue to lead the way in medical research establish innovative method of early diagnosis and effective treatment as many member will know campaign vigorously with west hertfordshire teaching hospitals nhs trust to secure the necessary funding for the new hospital in watford and it be proud and important moment when we do one reason support that so strongly be the incredible work see be do at watford general hospital especially in relation to the virtual hospital programme it have lead the way in show that there be other way of support people health particularly at home and adopt the idea of use technology and datum to help improve people lifestyle the beauty of the modern age be that many app can give people guidance on their health they have apple watch or fitbit or whatever else be out there do not want to go down the route of one particular brand we be now able to track so much more of our health but think we need more education on what that datum mean we can all see our heart rate but what be the actual impact on people life virtual care be important in this regard but will not go too far down this route madam deputy speaker because think it be for different debate have long argue for what call datum donation at present someone who sadly lose their life may donate an organ but if we could donate our lifestyle datum throughout our life the nhs and other organisation could start ask themselves whether they could for instance cure cancer by use that datum which would be anonymise with all the necessary check and balance to ensure that it be do well be conscious of the time and be sure that be go over my allocate period but want to highlight the fact that despite all the development cvd continue to have an impact on the wide economy cost an estimate billion annually in england alone as say behind every figure be person or family who have be deeply affect by these condition as part of this process be fortunate to work with the house of commons chamber engagement team who reach out to constituent across the country to share their own experience in preparation for this debate believe that the correspondence should be in the library if not will make sure that it be share with colleague and put online one respondent really move they say that their daughter have half work heart she have two open heart surgery and will need another if it have be detect early she would be with we today that be life an ambition and future that be still there because of the support that have be give know that be do bit of plug for the british heart foundation today but one of the other comment which ring true with my experience be that the british heart foundation have brilliant website for fact and the consultant team we be under at our local hospital be fantastic there be many quote from people share very similar story common concern though be about aftercare follow surgery or medical treatment and the effect that people condition have have on they mentally and socially from my own experience have to admit that suddenly start to feel twinge all the time and think be there something wrong with be it happen again my experience be that within two week of have heart attack promise that would go to local event do not want to let people down remember go to it on sear hot day be genuinely frightened about go out in the heat with people and not know whether my body would still work in the way hop it would be glad do it because once have go through the experience of be there and realise that could still be be able to overcome that and continue to work as safely and as good could as recover however not everybody get that opportunity when someone have have physical illness particularly when it affect the heart it be easy for they to suddenly worry that they do not have control over themselves and they do not know what might happen next must admit that there have be many time when something have twinge and have think be this heart attack again thankfully it have not be but aftercare be absolutely essential we can fix the body but help to support the mind through that psychological process be absolutely essential know that colleague in the house will have far more powerful story about their experience than mine and look forward to hear they later this be about multidisciplinary care that do not end when the patient leave the hospital it be about support their full recovery and help they with some lifestyle change have to admit that the cardiac rehabilitation team work with be phenomenal when be extremely concerned they would put my mind at rest which mean that be well physically and mentally therefore ask the minister whether consideration will be give to offer counselling service and mental health support to those affect by heart and circulatory condition as have say heart and circulatory disease cause quarter of all death in england amount to over each year day or one every three minute sadly in the time that have speak today five people will have lose their life therefore call for urgent action to do more to protect our heart by prioritise the right action and supercharge the progress that have be make on address heart and circulatory disease we can improve the nation health grow the economy and give people hope for bright healthy future rise order it will be obvious to the house that we have very little time this afternoon so hope that members will limit their remark to around five minute five minute would the hon gentleman like to find some way to make the house sit long no madam deputy speaker be just rather surprised we often have three hour for backbench business debate but we have end up with an hour appreciate the point that the hon gentleman be make but there be nothing can do about it now do we all sometimes wish that we could turn back the clock do not have that power thank the hon member for watford dean russell for secure this important debate and for share his personal experience of suffer heart attack be delighted to see that he have make such strong recovery that he can be here in the chamber today be sure that many member have be affect by cardiac disease or know people close to they who have be deeply affect by this appalling and shocking killer the library briefing pack for this debate contain startling statistic almost casually it mention that cardiovascular death per population have rise by since after fall steadily for decade order apologise for interrupt the hon gentleman but have take what he have just say to heart have do my good to squeeze out more time and he can have around seven minute thank you madam deputy speaker that be increase ask and ye shall receive the previous steady reduction follow major improvement in public health policy reduction in risk factor such as smoking and the controlling of blood pressure as well as improvement in medical care although be grateful to the hon member for watford for secure this debate and to the other member who will contribute there be an elephant in the room indeed there be so few speaker that there be probably room for herd of elephant why have there be significant uptick in cardiac death in recent year what novel intervention in public health have occur since some might think that covid be the cause not so the same uptick in cardiac death be observable in australia and singapore before those country get covid but after they roll out the experimental messenger ribonucleic acid injection ah the jab can see some member tutte and turn away everyone know that mps with science degree be few and far between and that some members eye glaze over when science be discuss well be one of those mp fortunate enough to have science degree another be margaret thatcher who be rather prouder of be the first prime minister with science degree than of be the first woman prime minister and rightly so some member appear to have prejudge the issue it be often say that it be easy to fool someone than to persuade they that they have be fool for posterity we must remember that it be year after the thalidomide scandal be expose in before the word thalidomide be mention in the chamber refuse to let this new mammoth medical scandal be ignore in the same way we be witness to the great medical scandal in decade perhaps in live memory and possibly ever it be big than thalidomide and big than the tuskegee untreated syphilis scandal in which some black people be deliberately not treat to see what would happen to their body over time it might be big than the vioxx scandal hitherto the grandaddy of medical scandal can see some member look puzzle vioxx be new drug invent by merck as an alternative to aspirin mild painkiller researcher first highlight an issue to merck senior management in two year before the drug be approve one in people who take vioxx suffer heart attack merck profit from vioxx comfortably exceed the criminal fine the compensation and the litigation cost after the drug be pull it be good business decision for merck not one pharma executive go to jail for skew the trial result for deceive the regulator or for recklessly cause the death of ordinary americans for profit it be always for profit life tragically cut short family destroy and child devastate imagine the incentive structure in an industry where profit like that can be make and the corporate greed where there be full immunity from prosecution in pharma company get immunity in the usa for all vaccine the number of vaccine administer to child in america have explode since then do the hon member share my hope that the minister in respond to the debate will address the article in the daily sceptic on february this year by will jones headline covid vaccine link to large increase in heart blood and neurological disorders major study finds hope that the minister will address that and of course this will go on cardiac death be already the big killer in our country but we have mysterious increase be sure that the hon gentleman like other in the chamber have witness the horrify sight of super fit athlete keel over on pitch around the world mountain of peer review evidence be emerge and hypothesis be be propose numerous cardiologist have concern but unfortunately many expert do not feel able to speak out openly about their concern because of the climate of fear and the consequence of whistleblowe or speak out against big pharma which have so often be find to be not operate in the public interest and cause harm be afraid that we will see much the same follow the roll out of the vaccine as we see with vioxx and thalidomide and in so many other case the evidence be mount up so rapidly and the only people who can not appreciate what be go on in this country be those who really do not want to see the public will be extremely harsh on this parliament and our response to the pandemic include the roll out of the vaccine we be go to stop vaccinate after the but we then decide that vaccination would include the we then decide it would be for everyone then this house take the appalling decision unsupported by the joint committee on vaccination and immunisation in september to vaccinate child who be at very little risk if any of covid but who have be harm seriously by the vaccine why ever do we use systemic vaccine for mucosal respiratory virus one expert say last year it be not surprising that none of the predominantly mucosal respiratory virus have ever be effectively control by vaccine this observation raise question of fundamental importance if natural mucosal respiratory virus infection do not elicit complete and long term protective immunity against reinfection how can we expect vaccine to work when natural immunity do not give protection and what be the name of this expert mr anthony fauci the former head of the centres for disease control and prevention in america who push the vaccine wish have more time madam deputy speaker this be huge issue and we need to debate it again it be the big killer of our constituent and our fear be that the rate of increase in cardiac death will not slow in the uk or the rest of the world it be pleasure to follow the hon member for north west leicestershire andrew bridgen as often seem to in these debate which often resemble madame tussauds the same face appear time after time as you will know madam deputy speaker have reputation for brevity in my speech and intend to support that reputation now congratulate my hon friend the member for watford dean russell on secure this important and rather timely debate and echo the hon member for north west leicestershire in say that we enjoy see he look so fit and healthy after the trauma that he have this be really important matter and he be right to raise it today as highlight in last month westminster hall debate on excess death trend recent article in the lancet find that although the cause of ongoing excess death in the uk be likely to be multiple office for national statistics datum show some clear trend in particular the large relative excess death since the pandemic occur in young and middle aged adult with the number of cardiac death happen outside hospital be the most elevated in other word young and previously healthy people be die at home from cardiac relate event and we do not know why these be not just number and statistic these be real people love one often from young age group who be die before their time it be urgent and our duty to get to the bottom of the situation soon rather than later as be sure we be all aware there be many theory circulate about the cause of these excess death one be the possibility of causal link between the population wide use of vaccine and the marked increase in cardiovascular relate critical event include heart attack and stroke among otherwise apparently healthy people we do not know if that be the cause or not because the data be not be release until certain datum set be release it be impossible to rule that theory in or out that be why along with cross party colleague write yesterday to the secretary of state for health and social care professor steven riley the director general for datum at the uk health security agency and dr alison cave the chief safety officer at the medicines and healthcare products regulatory agency we warn that by withhold official datum the department ukhsa and mhra be help fuel concern and hesitancy about public health we have ask that anonymise record level official mortality datum be release alongside vaccination date dos and co morbidity without delay we understand that the mhra have collect and already share this datum with pharmaceutical company to enable those company to produce post authorisation safety study for their product so see no reason why it can not also be share with parliamentarian and the public right away will the minister say whether that datum have be share with pharmaceutical company if so why be not be share with the rest of we as the minister surely realise repetitive generic assurance that the government and the ukhsa take excess death seriously and monitor they constantly and that the mhra have system in place to continually monitor the safety of our report january vol do not serve to reassure anybody at all likewise the news from the office for national statistics this week that it have revise its excess death methodology and that there be suddenly few excess death last year have do little to quell public concern if anything it have do the exact opposite people cynically see it as convenient sleight of hand as we say in our letter if the government and their agency be not willing to share the datum we have request will the minister explain to we why not we be all on the same side and want to look after people we be all concerned to do the good we can for everybody but until we have all the datum we just do not know what we do not know if there be any potential that public health intervention such as vaccine be cause harm and premature death to some we must act on that without delay if the evidence show that that there be no issue then it be in everybody interest for that reassurance to be in the public domain as quickly as possible if that information be in the public domain then the prime minister would have be able to answer the question that he be ask in the gb news interview the night before last my hon friend be right it be in everybody interest that the information be in the public domain so that we can reassure people or at least let they know frankly there be never any harm in give people information and let they make their own mind up about what have happen opinion need to be put to one side and the datum need to be examine in the cold hard light of day otherwise we will do harm to people and we will do even more and irreparable damage to trust in public health policy hope that the minister will provide some reassurance that the datum will be forthcoming as soon as possible and that the government do not give the impression that there be something to hide commend the hon member for watford dean russell for set the scene today we have speak many time on this issue it be real pleasure to see he back to health and strength and work very effectively in this house the rate of premature death from heart and circulatory disease do not make for easy reading the british heart foundation have be clear about how stark the situation be as the dup health spokesperson try to involve myself in all health matter whether they be in ministerial question or in debate in this chamber or in westminster hall because that be part of my duty the number of people die before the age of from heart and circulatory disease have rise to the high level in more than decade waiting list for heart operation and other heart procedure be nearly high than they be year ago those figure be stark and worrying be very pleased to see the minister in her place we all have great respect for she although we do not want to burden she with question we do need to ask ourselves why these figure be so high and what be be do to reduce they worryingly there be more people over the age of wait over year for treatment the rate be time high than before the pandemic begin late figure show that in more than people in england die prematurely of cardiovascular condition include heart attack coronary heart disease and stroke an average of some people each week again worryingly that be the high total since what be be do to address those issue this backwards trend because that be what it be have be broadly mirror in age standardise premature death rate which account for change and difference in population size and demographic before the number and rate of death from these condition under the age of be fall in part thank to decade of medical and scientific breakthrough but after nearly decade of slow progress recent statistic show that the rate of premature death from cardiovascular disease have now increase in england for three year back to back this be the first time that there have be clear reversal in the trend for almost year again the question must be what have bring that about and what have be do to stop it the british heart foundation have say the reason for the rise be multiple and complex while increase pressure on the nhs and the pandemic have likely contribute in recent year the warning sign have be present for over decade if those sign have be present for over decade the question we must all ask be what step have be take to slow the trend that have be there for some time know that there will be many in this chamber with opinion as to the cause do not hold medical degree be very simple person but do have an interest in health and do ask the question the fact be that the sharp rise need to be well manage can quickly give some example of what we be do back home in northern ireland we have develop plan with the irish football association that include more defibrillator and cpr training which be really important many people who be fit and healthy the hon member for watford refer to this have have heart attack on the football pitch those be thing that we need to address may commend the chest heart and stroke charity back home for all that it do this month in northern ireland people will die from heart or circulatory disease around of whom will be young than year of age some people be live with heart or circulatory disease hospital admission will be due to heart attack people will die from coronary heart disease and baby will be diagnose with heart defect this year those be the figure for northern ireland the statistic be shocking especially give the small size of northern ireland there be an estimate people live with heart and circulatory disease in northern ireland an age and grow population and improved survival rate from heart and circulatory event could see these number rise still far it be clear that this really be tick timebomb and therefore we do seek some help from the minister here can see the minister formulate her response both she and be glad to see that the northern ireland assembly be up and run as health be devolved matter may ask she in genuine fashion as always do whether she can indicate what discussion will take place with the department of health in northern ireland we in northern ireland be in the situation in which every region of the uk find itself there be not enough funding not enough staff and not enough support across the united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland we need to address the grow problem with solution which can only come about with reasonably pay staff and well system let we exchange our thought and idea and move forward together towards system where we can help each other an overhaul of the system be need and we look to the minister for plan of action begin here in this place and extend through the nhs and across the united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland you tell to finish within certain time madam deputy speaker have just do it congratulate the hon member for watford dean russell on secure this debate on such an important and prevalent issue he and have share interest in health inequality largely due to our personal experience he and join the house at the same time remember sit in this very chamber for his maiden speech in which he quote sir elton john song still stand be absolutely delighted that we be both still stand hon member hear hear just few short month after my hon friend maiden speech will call he my hon friend be in rehab recover from stroke still stand be one of the song that we ironically listen to while do physio dark sense of humour can be powerful tool in the face of adversity but of course we need to equip people with more than just sense of humour to get through these very difficult condition this issue be one that my party and be deeply concerned about with nearly three in scot die from heart and circulatory disease equate to about people per day or people per month prevent those death and in particular premature death be something that the scottish government be commit to the hon member for watford outline the sign and symptom of many heart and circulatory condition commend he for shin light on they we can not overestimate the impact that debate like this will have support for the mind after health trauma be necessary as he also outline after my stroke do not realise that need help for my mental health until reach crisis point get help be the good thing that could have do for myself that support need to be there for everyone as we have hear there be clear risk factor for develop cardiovascular disease centre around people lifestyle we can call they lifestyle choice but the choice be often heavily influence by inequality and poverty we know that people in poverty have poor health outcome and improve people ability to make healthy choice on diet smoking and alcohol consumption be essential to change that we know that sadly the prevalence rate for circulatory and cardiovascular disease be significantly high in the most deprive area we also know that poverty rate be high for some minority ethnic group and therefore they be often disproportionally vulnerable to health inequality that be why improve health and reduce health inequality across scotland be clear priority for the scottish government especially in the face of uk government austerity measure the british heart foundation say that there have be lack of meaningful action from the british government over the last year to address many of the cause of heart disease and stroke such as stubbornly high obesity rate obesity and unhealthy lifestyle choice be intrinsically link to poverty that be why the snp action to mitigate the effect of this tory government cost of living crisis be so important to today debate recent analysis from the british heart foundation show that the number of people die before the age of in england from heart and circulatory disease have rise to the high level in over decade we know that people in scotland be live with circulatory disease we do not know how much that be affect by or other factor but it be clear that an increasingly unhealthy population play key role in these worrying statistic this be why the snp focus on tackle these inequality and tackle poverty be such an important and proactive step in reduce these premature death the scottish government focus and commitment to tackle poverty and other risk factor relate to cardiovascular disease be despite this tory government austerity measure the british government austerity policy be harm the economy across these isle drive more people into poverty and make our health outcome bad health inequality be rampant the length and breadth of these isle stand here as proof of that have cancer as teenager and have stroke in my an example of the health inequality prevalent in the west of scotland economic austerity be to blame for the slow progress in health outcome over the past decade the british government would do well to cast their eye up to scotland and consider focus on our wellbee economy with people at its heart as we do funding or in this case the lack of it be political choice the uk have considerable wealth so it be shameful that so many people be in poverty and that their health be suffer as result the level of universal credit have be too low for too long the snp and the scottish government continue to call on the uk government to introduce an essential guarantee to ensure that social security benefit adequately cover the cost of essential good and properly support our most vulnerable people the scottish government have go to great length to increase income for scot by promote fair work and improve the value of social security through bold measure such as the scottish child payment and the real living wage know that we be short of time madam deputy speaker so will bring my remark to conclusion urge the government and whomever form the next government to consider take the scottish government approach to tackle health inequality by reduce poverty and guarantee that people have the resource to make healthy lifestyle choice it be abundantly clear that while scotland be tie to this place westminster and the british government hold the purse string and any action that the scottish government take can be outdo by austerity measure in this place only with the full power of independence will we truly be able to tackle health inequality in scotland and reduce the number of premature death from cardiovascular disease call the shadow minister thank the backbench business committee for grant the debate and pay tribute to the hon member for watford dean russell for secure it think we all agree that he make an excellent and heartfelt speech not just about his own experience but about the effect on his family and his team he thank the british heart foundation and agree that the resource of such organisation be well receive at such time which can often be very lonely we wish he and his family the good of health go forward my right hon friend the member for alyn and deeside mark tami who be no long in his place speak about his experience as family member of young person who have suffer heart condition and the snp spokesperson the hon member for east dunbartonshire amy callaghan highlight her own experience vascular disease affect not only we but our family too as have be say every week in an average of people die prematurely of cardiovascular disease include heart attack and stroke every premature death be of course tragedy and our thought be with all affected family nhs england have report that cardiovascular disease be responsible for one in four premature death in the uk as we have hear the rate of premature death have rise for the past three year consecutively that be something that we all wish to understand many of my constituent and people across the country be worried about the state of heart and circulatory disease service despite the good effort of staff there be significant backlog in treatment the number of people on waiting list for cardiology service be rise with huge increase in the past year accord to the institute for public policy research wait time for cardiology treatment have rise even more sharply than for elective waiting list as whole that be deeply concern because long wait mean poor outcome for patient often with devastating result an estimate million in the uk be currently live with heart or circulatory disease it be vital that every one of those people receive effective and timely diagnosis referral and treatment yet under this government the nhs have lurch from crisis to crisis and far too many patient be not receive that timely care labour have an ambitious year plan of reform and modernisation to speed up treatment with million more appointment year we want to return to the constitutional waiting time target within parliament as our mission set out it be vital to restore the nhs as world lead health system something that we have lose under this government the government have promise to eradicate wait of over year for elective care by it would be good if the minister indicate whether they be on track to do just that labour have mission to reduce death from heart attack and stroke by quarter within year so that few life be lose to the big killer under our fit for the future fund we would double the number of scanner speed up heart and circulatory disease diagnosis and ensure that patient receive the timely treatment that be so vital for manage those condition we would also incentivise continuity of care in general practice which would improve care in our community for people live with heart and circulatory disease it would be helpful if the minister explain why in the past year of conservative government we have see such paltry ambition on cardiovascular care and decline in cardiovascular health the minister be probably go to talk about the major condition strategy which be announce year into the conservative party time in power but when can we expect the full strategy to be publish and will it explore the reason for the backward trend in cardiovascular disease that we be currently see agree with other hon member we all need to understand the reason for that one of the most concern aspect of cardiovascular disease in this country be that many of its driver be high in area of great deprivation and as we have hear for black and minority ethnic group that be exacerbate health inequality we have hear from the snp spokesman the hon member for east dunbartonshire and from the hon member for strangford jim shannon about the level in their community in those in the most deprive of the population in england be more than twice as likely to die prematurely from circulatory disease than those in the least deprive of the population something see very much in my own constituency of bristol south that be utterly unacceptable across the united kingdom in the century particularly give that cardiovascular disease be largely preventable tackle the issue that impact cardiovascular health from obesity to high blood pressure or smoking be vital not only to tackle cvd but to improve population health overall that be why we have to tackle social inequality that influence health and focus more on prevention improve capacity in local public health team that do so much vital work to improve the health of their community innovation will also be vital to centre prevention in our health service and would welcome an update from the minister about the nhs digital health check trial in cornwall give that result from that trial will inform the roll out this spring can the minister indicate any challenge apparent in the trial when can we expect the result to be publish as we have hear prevention start long before the age of when that health check take place that be why labour will introduce child health action plan that will put prevention at the top of the agenda ensure that the next generation can live healthy life there be also widespread concern that the restructuring of the office for health improvement and disparities could have detrimental impact on health inequality it would be good to hear reassurance from the minister about how those concern about health inequality will be prioritise in the event of change to that body finally research be crucial to prevent further premature death that be why labour regulatory innovation office would make britain the good place in the world to innovate by speed up decision and provide clear direction base on our modern industrial strategy alongside plan to make it easy for more patient to participate in clinical trial that will deliver well treatment to patient we owe that to all those family who have lose love one to premature death as well as those who we be pleased to see be survive and live well with this disease we must improve outcome look forward to hear the minister comment on the major condition strategy but that strategy must be deliver in tandem with plan to provide the nhs with the staff technology and resource it need to bring down waiting list and improve patient care be pleased that future labour government have plan to do just that first may congratulate my hon friend the member for watford dean russell and say how pleased we all be to see he fight fit and in his place also say to the right hon member for alyn and deeside mark tami that we wish his son absolutely all the good and speedy return to full health and to the hon member for east

disappointing that bank start off by quakers in the have such poor sense of how to serve its community many of those who sign my petition be old resident they tell that they feel leave out and discriminate against because they be be push online when they want to talk to people not machine lot say how anxious they be about become victim of fraud and how to travel to the next bank would take

essential in person banking service and the petitioner remain etc mole valley local plan motion make and question propose that this house do now fletcher thank the minister and her official for come and thank she in advance because be hop for an excellent useful response realise that be pick on specific planning case that be under an inspector review so the minister can only respond in the round and not to the specific case come to london from an area of open green hill bush tree the lot from horizon to horizon and arrive in east london be more than shock then move to mole valley so be particularly delighted that the voter of mole valley have return as their mp several time mole valley be south of london border on the with epsom and ewell with guildford to the west and gatwick to the east and it be halfway to worthe go south what distinguish it from london be the green open space there be the famous box hill and farm common and park and they be all amalgamate together glue together and retain by the green belt land it be lovely place to live the resident live there because it have two small town and many village spread among the green the local planning council be mole valley district council it be liberal no wait minute it be control by the liberals there be nothing liberal about it at all the last ratify local plan for mole valley be date understand that more than of english local authority have adopt and be up to date with their local plan liberal mole valley be among the errant of local authority which leave it vulnerable as it be find now to developer in may the liberals take control of mole valley district council and with that the responsibility for produce the draft local plan it be produce between may and february and pass for consultation by the council executive and the council without vote it contain or more green belt site be tell that have not count they and the inclusion of many if not most of they be vehemently oppose by local resident that be not just those next to the green belt site but those within what new zealanders would call cooee recognise that the proportion of land protect from development in mole valley be considerable and relatively speak the quality of brownfield site free for development be small in comparison but it be not impossible to increase the number of dwelling on those brownfield site know from my own time in inner london that with imagination and the new rule and regulation on building it be possible to increase density and height and adapt those site it have be claim that the percentage of green belt site that the liberal plan will remove from protect status be small however that be bit like my saying to cancer patient that the prospect of long term cure be sound great unless they be in the that be what be happen with green belt site the figure be small in percentage term but if they affect someone who choose to live there in part because of those green belt site it be bad news the plan go to inspection but as last may local election arrive the liberals ask the inspector to stall her inquiry and she do the liberals announce on their election leaflet that they would remove the green belt site from the draft plan they do not last month at full council meeting the council face decision on three choice provide by its planning officer the first be that the plan be withdraw for complete rethink the second be to continue with the inquiry but withdraw the green belt site the third be to continue with the plan inquiry with the or more green belt site include which the liberals say they have redrawn but have not just before the council meet the minister for housing planning and building safety be aware that restart be probably the bad option write to the council to tell it that it have to keep the plan in the system it could not withdraw it the liberal council in classic liberal duplicitous way choose to proceed with the inquiry with the green belt site which it say it have remove but have not still in the plan the need for clear plan be obvious it would protect site that be not appropriate for development but also set out development site that be consider suitable the current situation with the mole valley plan have come back to bite the liberals will give one example but there be other site near dorking call sondes farm be green belt site that be put in the draft local plan by the liberals for its green belt protection to be remove in spite of that the liberal council do an about turn and refuse developer application for housing on the ground that it be green belt site ignore the fact that it be go to withdraw that protection that refusal be in line with what large number of local people want to happen they wish to support sondes farm as green belt site perhaps they be unaware that the liberals have in effect already give it away not surprisingly the developer have face refusal take its application to appeal and win with the inspector point out that the site be down in the plan to be take out of the green belt other in the portfolio will be in the same situation one of they be not very far away from that position now my ask of the minister be that she re emphasise the importance to she to ministers and to the government certainly to and most of my resident of the protection offer by the green belt that the removal of that protection from site can happen only in exceptional circumstance and that those circumstance do not include housing this be long stand situation it apply when be planning minister and think it still apply now it be not specific to mole valley it apply across the country and can not but emphasise how important it be for so many in mole valley and many other area throughout the country that the strength of protection for the green belt be retain congratulate my hon friend the member for mole valley sir paul beresford on secure this debate and on his eloquent speech would like to respond by comment on the late position of the emerge mole valley local plan and by explain why the department have intervene on january the secretary of state exercise his power under section of the planning and compulsory purchase act to direct the council not to take any step to withdraw the plan from examination as my hon friend have allude to my ministerial role in the planning system dictate that can not go into the specific of the local plan which remain at the examination stage however will try to deal with some of the general point and the reason why we have take action my hon friend will know that minister have consistently set out the importance of have an up to date plan in place as he correctly say the mole valley local plan be from remarkably it be over year old it should have be update many year ago as he rightly say that put the plan in the bottom of plan in the country by age that be clearly not acceptable the council submit its emerge local plan for examination in february and the hearing session commence in june that year it be the role of the independently appoint inspector to look at whether the plan be legally compliant before consider whether it be sound for plan to be find legally compliant the local planning authority must demonstrate that all the procedural check and balance have be follow effective co operation early in the plan make process be essential to ensure that the home and infrastructure need be plan for authority be expect to collaborate with stakeholder to identify the relevant strategic matter to be address for plan to be consider sound it should be positively prepare justified effective and consistent with national policy ultimately the inspector may report that the plan be unsound and can not be adopt by the local council as my hon friend will understand that be not for to decide as have say mole valley have an old local plan so have an effective and up to date plan in place be long overdue such plan be essential to identify the very late development need in any give area decide where it should go and deal with planning application the plan be also the main vehicle for set out the vision for mole valley and how to address housing need along with economic social and environmental priority it be for the independent inspector to consider the council plan strategy but know that mole valley emerge strategy have be not to fully meet its own housing need it be clear that mole valley have not be deliver home its delivery be within the bottom nationally as show in the late housing delivery test result the council have indicate as part of its examination documentation that it have shortfall of dwelling over five year period with only year of supply my hon friend will also know that housing affordability be significant issue in mole valley the council be clearly way way behind first on have plan and secondly on delivery of housing the inspector have agree to pause the examination between february and may to take account of the local election result that pause be later extend to allow for publication of the update national planning policy framework that be perfectly reasonable position to take however the transitional arrangement in the update nppf make it clear that the mole valley local plan will be examine use the pre december nppf that is the nppf under which the draft local plan be develop my hon friend will know that our government policy be clear council and their community be well place to take decision on local planning matter without unnecessary interference from central government however when it become clear that council be not act in the good interest of its community it be only right that the government consider whether it be appropriate to act with that in mind the department become aware of an extraordinary council meeting arrange for january which include motion to withdraw the local plan from examination it be not unusual for council under new administration to want to change direction on its local plan but that be normally before plan be formally submit for examination however there be no change of administration at mole valley liberal democrat administration vote to submit the plan to examination and liberal democrat administration subsequently want to consider motion to withdraw the plan that be after the plan have reach an advanced stage in the process the hearing have be complete and the main modification be to be finalise this be highly unusual the council have one of the old adopt local plan in the country withdraw the plan at that stage would have mean start the whole plan preparation process again the secretary of state quite rightly conclude that such an action would not be in the good interest of the people of mole valley and decide to intervene be sure that my hon friend would agree that further delay in plan come forward would not serve his constituent interest completely agree with the minister and with the reason why the minister for housing planning and building safety write to the council the difficulty be that there be two choice leave one be to withdraw from the green belt the other be to remain the council choice be to retain the green belt site the minister say that the council will have to justify its decision as see it the council will have to justify why it have or so site perhaps individually in that plan in the green belt in spite of the fact that the local population be vehemently against that as my hon friend will appreciate can not talk to the specific of the plan that be not my responsibility however will talk generally about the government philosophy on the green belt just to be clear the process be that the local plan go to examination by the planning inspectorate and the planning inspectorate comment on the plan it then go to consultation it be definitely not in the interest of my hon friend constituent for there to be far delay in the plan come forward as that may well mean that home be build on speculative basis with no co ordination and with limited buy in from local people even the council have acknowledge that in the absence of an update plan with no prospect of new plan come forward for year the district would be at risk of development on green belt site get planning permission because of the district poor housing delivery record be pleased to hear that follow the secretary of state most timely direction mole valley district council have indicate its willingness to progress and to then conclude its work at the examination its intention be to inform the inspector that the council wish to continue with the draft local plan subject to the modification identify by the inspector want to step away from the detail of mole valley and the local plan update the house and clarify the government position on green belt let touch on what we be do to not only protect but enhance our green belt be proud to say that our national planning policy deliver on the promise we make in the manifesto the government remain committed to protect and enhance the green belt national planning policy include strong protection to safeguard this important land for future generation and this policy remain firmly in place should emphasise that national policy will continue to expect that green belt boundary be alter only where exceptional circumstance can be fully evidence and justify at examination of the revise plan in order to demonstrate exceptional circumstance local authority have to show that it have examine all other reasonable option for meet its identify development need green belt release be last resort in broad term be it not unacceptable to assume that an exceptional circumstance be the need to increase housing it certainly be when be in the minister shoe be that still the case the government position be clear let restate it to demonstrate exceptional circumstance the local authority have to show that it have examine all other reasonable option for meet its identify development need as say green belt release be definitely the last resort question put and agree to house adjourn
