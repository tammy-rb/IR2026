with law enforcement and industry to well protect the public and we be demand that the tech company go far and fast to protect consumer at risk of fraud on their platform online scam be cause of particular concern in hendon number of my constituent have be target and one lose to an online scam many of the scam originate overseas what discussion have the minister have with the department for science innovation and technology about tackle online scam and work with other country to crack down on scam originate abroad my hon friend raise an important issue not least that the vast majority of scam be perpetrate by criminal gang base overseas we need the support of overseas government and agency and the co operation of tech firm to prevent fraud from take place on their platform my noble friend lord hanson will be meet tech firm next month to confirm what action be be take work across government include with partner in dsit and other we will not hesitate to take further action where necessary it be disappointing to see in the january figure that fraud have rise again after it have be come down but commend the government for proceed with the payment services amendment regulations to slow down payment where there be reasonable suspicion of fraudulent activity what effect do the minister believe that change will make the right hon gentleman make an important point he be right that the late statistic show that there be million incident in the year end september that be one in people become victim which demonstrate the urgent need for action the government be take action the home secretary the chancellor and the secretary of state for science innovation and technology recently write to tech and telecom company urge they to go fast and far on fraud and we expect they to do so indefinite leave to remain what assessment she have make of the potential merit of extend the qualifying period for indefinite leave to remain settlement in the uk be privilege not an automatic entitlement there be already range of period of time that people be require to spend in the uk before they qualify for settlement the number of people grant settlement each year will reflect the number of migrant come to the uk in early year this government be determined to bring control to the immigration system and to bring net migration down and we keep all our policy under review there be clearly cost to do nothing about the current indefinite leave to remain policy and recent centre for policy studies report estimate the net lifetime cost as billion for those expect to be grant ilr over the next five year what be the minister assessment of that cost gently say to the hon member that the number of settlement grant grow by almost third in the final year that his party be in government compare with we will take absolutely no lesson from the tory party and shadow home secretary who completely lose control of our border allow net migration to quadruple to record high of nearly million while the number of dangerous boat crossing soar only refugee whose case prove that they would be at harm if they return home be give indefinite leave to remain in this people last year they will not leave the united kingdom to return to the bomb and the dictator but without route to citizenship they will find it hard to get job to support their family get mortgage or have say in their local community will the minister meet and other mp who be concerned about the new guidance on naturalisation to talk about how we can properly support integration in the uk my hon friend will know that for many generation refugee who have arrive for resettlement in the uk have be able to apply for british citizenship if they meet the condition and that continue to be the case the uk must always do its bit to support those who be flee persecution but we be also clear that we must do all we can to prevent people from make dangerous boat crossing and risk their life in the arm of criminal gang call the shadow minister as we have hear accord to the centre for policy studies over migrant from the past five year could soon claim indefinite leave to remain in nhs care benefit social housing and more that will cost billion nearly six year of defence spending or almost all income tax receipt for year will the minister commit to extend the qualifying period for ilr or will she accept that the consequence of her policy be liability for the public of hundred of billion of pound be still quite flabbergast by the question that the conservatives ask in the house their party see net migration more than quadruple to record level the shadow minister will know that the prime minister have also pledge white paper on reduce net migration that be at the end of last year and work be under way to consider range of proposal include how well to support the integration and employability of refugee antisocial behaviour what recent progress her department have make on tackle antisocial behaviour what recent progress her department have make on tackle antisocial behaviour may support you mr speaker in your word about the people of ukraine on the third anniversary of the invasion include those who be here in the uk through the homes for ukraine scheme too many community be blight by antisocial behaviour which have increase over the past year while neighbourhood policing be heavily cut that be why this government plan for change mean put neighbourhood police back on the beat in our town centre and community and strong power in our crime and police bill to be introduce tomorrow to tackle off road bike repeat offender and shop theft mark porter be community leader who run kidsgrove ladsanddads around young people play football at birchenwood field every weekend yet the football pitch be constantly damage by off road bike the same happen at burslem golf club and across estate such as mill hill in tunstall what step will be take to tackle the impact of off road park on community in stoke on trent north and kidsgrove my hon friend make an important point some off road bike be total nightmare and can drive community up the wall with harassment and intimidation that be why we be strengthen power at the moment the police must provide repeat warning before they can take action to seize such bike we think that they should be able to seize those antisocial bike straightaway antisocial behaviour come in variety of form norfolk police have recently make it priority to address safety concern about bike and scooter in just one day they reportedly seize illegally modify bike in norwich welcome that crackdown but speed bike and scooter be real menace in our city centre will the home secretary expand on the measure that we will take to tackle speeding and illegally modify bike and scooter my hon friend be right to raise this issue which cause havoc and can be really threaten for people in the local community that be why we will strengthen the law by support the police to take strong action on off road bike and by introduce respect order so that we can ban repeat offender from town centre and tackle the antisocial behaviour that have blight community for far too long antisocial behaviour be problem not just in our town centre but in our park that be why my constituent be extremely concerned about plan to axe the specialist royal park police unit and subsume it into community support team give the million shortfall face the met police this mean that bushy park in my constituency will undoubtedly get less police coverage what assurance can the home secretary give my constituent that they will not see few police officer in our community and our park this government be clear we need to get more police back on the beat the number of police community support officer have halve over the past to year and there have be big drop in the number of neighbourhood police officer on the beat that be why next year we be increase neighbourhood policing with an additional million of investment that be part of up to billion of additional funding next year for our police force across the country the home secretary will be aware that council up and down the country have real problem with nuisance tenant create mayhem commit crime and make resident live misery so do she agree that there should be one strike and out policy for these tenant and that if they keep create problem they should be out and the local authority should have no duty to rehouse they we need strong action against antisocial behaviour whether that involve havoc in town centre off road bike or nuisance neighbour make the community live misery that be why the government be increase neighbourhood police and give the police and local community much strong power to crack down on antisocial behaviour so that we can take back our community from the vandal the thief and those who make other live misery like my hon friend the member for norwich north alice macdonald find that constituent consistently mention the antisocial use of scooter and bike and certainly welcome on my constituent behalf the measure in the crime and police bill about seize such vehicle will ministers talk to the department for transport about update legislation particularly in relation to scooter their usage have explode but legislation have not keep pace we be work with the department for transport we need to keep community safe ensure that proper safety standard be meet and tackle antisocial behaviour have also see the work of staffordshire police who be use drone to follow rider of dangerous off road bike and take action do the home secretary agree that it would be easy for the police to tackle antisocial behaviour if they have more support for special constable the number of special constable have fall in recent year particularly since the pandemic will she agree to consider amend the employment rights act to bring special constable within section agree that special constable can play an important role their number have drop by around two third over the past year think that be damaging and we want to increase their number we be work with police force on how good to achieve that so that they can play their part both on the street in neighbourhood team and in support other specialist aspect of the police work greater manchester have one of the high crime rate in the country with many suffering as result of antisocial behaviour but this weekend we see police officer knock on the door of grandmother because she dare to criticise labour councillor for his role in the pensioner hat whatsapp scandal do the home secretary agree that be waste of police time the government have be clear that the focus of policing must be on the neighbourhood crime that blight our community that be why we be increase neighbourhood policing because the conservative party slash the number of neighbourhood police on the beat and we lose thousand of neighbourhood police in our community that be why we be also focus the police on serious violence the legislation to be introduce tomorrow will focus on tackle serious violence and deal with the most serious crime in our community something that the conservative party which preside over increase in shoplifting alone during its last two year in power fail time and again to do domestic abuse gloucester what step

abuse make number of recommendation my committee will be consider that issue but will the minister comment on what the government response will be to those recommendation and say how she will ensure that domestic abuse be tackle across the country include in gloucester be wait for that reference to gloucester as the right hon lady will know the nao report be largely base on the previous government period in office and although it make clear recommendation it would be premature of to comment however the strategy to combat violence against woman and girl that will be publish by this government in early summer will undoubtedly be look to the nao recommendation sexual exploitation and traffic what step her department be take to help reduce demand for sex trafficking and sexual exploitation the trafficking of woman and girl for sexual exploitation be horrific crime and the government work closely with law enforcement to tackle the driver of that offending and target prolific perpetrator that include through operational intensification initiative aim at tackle modern slavery threat the online safety act set out priority offence include sexual exploitation and human

the criminal justice system that we inherit which have lead to some victim of rape and sexual violence wait for year on end note that the shadow justice secretary have only just notice that fail now that he have the word shadow in front of his job title and even though his government preside over that fail for decade part of the strategy to tackle violence against woman and girl which work on in concert with the ministry of justice be about ensure that that issue be sort call the shadow minister have to get through the question fiona from bradford be fail numerous time by social service and local police after suffer horrific sexual abuse at the hand of gang of man while in care home bradford local authority have shamefully seek to block local inquiry into the issue in fiona own word the government can just leave it down to the local council to decide if they go to be investigate they go to have to enforce it will the home secretary reconsider statutory inquiry into groom gang if not how will she guarantee that case like that can never be allow to happen again be work with victim across the country to ensure as have already be announce that cold case like the one refer to by the

adult be not see as require disclosure and barring service check and with vulnerable adult who be be control in their home where there have be no response at all from local police because my small town be simply not see to be priority and resource be direct elsewhere how can offer reassurance to my community that their small town be not be forget the hon lady make an important point specific resource be available to police force to be surge into tackle county line know the police force in dorset in her area have apply for that funding in the past so encourage she to have conversation with the police and crime commissioner and chief constable about what more can be do to get that resource into the town she talk about police funding gloucestershire if she will increase funding for gloucestershire constabulary the final police funding settlement provide funding of up to billion for the police system in england and wales which be an increase of billion when compare to of that gloucestershire will receive up to million an increase of over million include million to kickstart the recruitment of additional neighbourhood police officer and police community support officer in gloucestershire my constituency straddle two large county gloucestershire and wiltshire which both languish near the bottom of the league table of funding for constabulary despite the modest rise in funding those constabulary will have to cut policing number so can the minister assure my constituent that crime will be address on timely basis more money be go into policing particularly around the neighbourhood policing guarantee that this government promise in their manifesto we be provide million to kickstart the recruitment of police officer pcso and special in all our community take the hon lady point about the funding formula and how that affect the two force that straddle her constituency we be go into spending review and know official have meet representative from gloucestershire constabulary to talk about the financial situation we will keep that under review as we work towards the spending review like gloucestershire police essex police be receive additional funding this year in fact we be get increase funding of million despite that the front desk at harlow police station be under threat do the minister agree that give the additional funding police service in harlow in essex should be increase not decrease and that any proposal not to do so be down to historical underfunding by the previous government be very pleased that essex have get that increase in funding gently point out that the decision around how those resource be use be for the police and crime commissioner and the chief constable but overall more than billion be go into policing over and above what the previous government put in in counter terrorism what step her department be take with international partner to counter the threat of terrorism this weekend horrific attack in mulhouse in france have again remind we of the threat from terrorist and from islamist extremism which can strike at any time have speak to the french interior minister this morning to offer our support and any assistance need we will continue to work with our european colleague and the five eyes partnership to tackle these threat both internationally and here in the uk sadly the misappropriation of religious belief to justify act of terror and intimidation have become familiar across the world we have see the mind of too many of our young people corrupt by online pedlar of hate so what action be this government take to tackle radicalisation at time when xenophobia and intolerance be be promote for political purpose my hon friend be right that terrorist do not speak for any faith interfaith relationship be an important part of develop strong community but we be clear that in the government and across society we have to do more to prevent radicalisation and particularly the grow number of young people from be draw into terrorism both islamist extremism and extreme right wing threat that be why tomorrow we will introduce new youth diversion order through our crime and police bill to give the police new power to divert young people away from terrorism although welcome what the home secretary be say about the need to divert and prevent home grow terrorism do she accept that pattern of terrorism be emerge in continental europe of undocumented migrant go into country and commit terrorist act do she agree that it be very difficult for the authority to prevent anything of that sort if undocumented illegal migrant be release into society when they arrive on these shore we be clear that we need to tackle extremist and terror threat wheresoever they be find which include make sure that we have strengthen border security that be why we have put forward new counter terror style power around people smuggle and traffic to strengthen our border security and it be also why we need to tackle particularly the radicalisation we see online that be where we also see young people be draw into extremist and terror threat wheresoever that be find we need strong action in place to keep our country safe call the shadow minister in fight terrorism the security minister have rightly say that islamism be the foremost threat we face its danger lie not just in physical violence but in the intolerance it embody and the intimidation it rely on will the home secretary give clear answer to this question should it be criminal offence to desecrate koran or any holy text yes or no we be clear that the primary domestic terrorist threat come from islamist terrorism which comprise three quarter of the caseload and of those in custody for terrorism connect offence that be follow by extreme right wing terrorism which comprise around quarter of the caseload we already have framework of legislation in place to ensure that we can deal with the dangerous threat to our cohesion and our community that we face retail crime what step she be take to help reduce shop theft what assessment she have make of trend in the level of retail crime in the last year of the previous government shop theft reach record high and violence and abuse towards retail worker increase to an unacceptable level this government will not tolerate these crime as central part of our safe street mission we be committed to introduce new stand alone offence of assault retail worker and end the effective immunity for shop theft of good under because there be no such thing as low level crime be recently contact by constituent who work in small high street supermarket he and his colleague have frequently be violently attack by shoplifter so what else can the minister say about what the government can do to protect shop worker it be appal to hear about case such as the one in my hon friend constituency be very strike like everyone else across the house think by how commonplace violence and abuse against shop worker have sadly become the government have make it absolutely clear that everybody who go to work have the right to feel safe on the job and we will not tolerate the criminality that we have see in recent time that be why follow year of campaign from the union of shop distributive and allied workers and the co op this labour government will finally deliver stand alone criminal offence of assault retail worker shop worker in doncaster have tell time and again that they be feed up with the amount of shoplifting go on and the antisocial behaviour that go with it which include threat and sometimes physical violence this kind of crime need to be crush be pleased to hear that stand alone offence of assault retail worker be to be include in the legislation be introduce this week but will the minister confirm that the police will have the clout to enforce the law and make sure we eliminate this kind of activity my hon friend make an important point our commitment to neighbourhood police and put the police officer police community support officer and special constable back into our neighbourhood into our community high street and town centre will enable the police to take the action we all want to see against the antisocial behaviour that my hon friend talk about one of the good way of tackle retail crime and associate antisocial behaviour among young people be through targeted preventive work with at risk pupil in school an example be the guidance and welfare unit at cavendish school in eastbourne that unit be set up by my former headteacher mr fitzpatrick who be in the public gallery today along with my former head of year mrs fitzpatrick who be also in the gallery will the minister join in congratulate inspirational teacher such as they on their critical safeguarding and prevention work with young people across eastbourne and beyond do not want to get into trouble would like to congratulate mr and mrs fitzpatrick on the work they have do we know how important that early preventive work be that be why this government be also committed to our prevention partnership identify young people who be on the cusp of get involve in criminality and divert they and put the resource in to make sure they make much well choice in their life harrogate have wealth of independent store that attract people to the town from across the region include shoplifter unfortunately have be speak with harrogate business improvement district about what it can do to help tackle shoplift it have an increasingly good relationship with north yorkshire police what step be the minister take to encourage north yorkshire police and other police organisation to work with local community and business organisation to crack down on shoplifting the hon gentleman make an important point visit north yorkshire last week and one of the issue there be how well the police be work with community and the retail sector to start to tackle some of the issue around retail crime over the next three year million will be allocate to support the police to tackle retail crime through the specialist team opal which be the national police intelligence unit that unit be look at the serious organise criminal gang that be now involve in retail theft rural crime what step she be take to reduce rural crime the government be commit to tackle rural crime we recognise the devastating consequence it can have on community and the agricultural sector under our reform rural area will be safeguard through tough measure to clamp down on antisocial behaviour to strengthen neighbourhood policing and to take action to prevent fly tipping antisocial behaviour in tyrley small village in my constituency have have significant impact on the community small rural community like these often feel overlooked and struggle to have their voice hear when it come to police and public safety will the government ensure that rural community such as tyrley receive the name police officer guarantee so that they have dedicated point of contact for police and for support yes and my hon friend raise an important point about those small part of large rural community and how they can feel that our neighbourhood policing guarantee will provide they with reassurance there be the name officer guarantee and it be worth recognise the use of thing such as whatsapp group in big rural area where intelligence can be feed into the police that can also be helpful for those community to feel safe police in rural area be increasingly complex but rural constabulary receive much less funding than inner city one know the minister will jump on this opportunity to complain about the last government but will she at least take moment to commit to publish the methodology behind the funding formula and open conversation about fair funding for rural police force the hon gentleman be right be go to say that the funding formula be introduce by the previous government think in they have two go at try to update it and they do not do anything about it we have be in government for seven month now and this be what we have inherit in lot of area we have inherit thing that we would not necessarily have want to have inherit as have say before to the house we will be look at police reform go forward and part of that conversation will be around financial issue asylum seeker hotels what step she be take to reduce the use of hotel to house asylum seeker what step she be take to reduce the number of people live in asylum hotel we be continue to reduce the use of asylum hotel from the peak which be reach under the previous government when more than hotel be in use across the country at cost of million every day we be determined to end the use of hotel over time as part of our wide objective to cut the cost of asylum accommodation and restore order to our immigration system asylum seeker be force to live in limbo bournemouth hotel cost the taxpayer eye watering sum as we just hear and everyone be stick in situation that nobody want have write to bournemouth christchurch and poole council to express opposition to additional asylum hotel in my constituency will the minister outline how the home office have reallocate resource follow the election to speed up the closure of hotel and the processing of asylum application to turn page on year of conservative failure we be determined to end hotel usage as part of our objective to cut the cost of asylum accommodation key element of that be clear the asylum backlog and increase return so that the system operate swiftly firmly and fairly be afraid that determination will not quite cut it will it pensioner in north dorset who have be deprive of their winter fuel allowance and farmer who have be hit by and be now face massive tax burden will want to know how the minister will reduce the cost of asylum hotel which be as she say eye wateringly high the action and her word be not apparently match we have to deal with the chaotic system that we inherit from the conservatives we be do that in various way one of the big thing that we be try to do be speed up the system and end the backlog so that we can get people out of hotel phone theft what step she be take to tackle phone theft the government be determined to act to ensure that people feel safe on our street on february the home secretary bring together law enforcement agency and representative of the mobile phone industry to discuss what more could be do to break the business model of mobile phone theft and to bring about strong collaboration across those agency to crack down on the criminal network that be operate in this trade in early time mobile phone theft be see as an urban issue but as have be evidence by my postbag over the last couple of week it be increase in our rural town and village what discussion be the minister have with her colleague in the ministry of justice to ensure that repeat perpetrator of this crime face custodial sentence while there be concentration of phone theft in the metropolitan police area in particular it be important to note that they be happen around the country and it be be suggest that the good practice use by those who be start to tackle the problem notably the west midlands police force should be spread to all force the taskforce that mention early in connection with summit will meet again in three month and will certainly speak to my colleague at the ministry of justice about the issue that the hon gentleman have raise hostile state threats what step her department be take to counter hostile state threat the home office work closely with other departments and operational agency to strengthen the uk defence against state threat that include continue to implement measure in the national security act which will make the uk hard target for state that seek to commit hostile act hostile state be use unknowe security official here in the uk to undermine our national security and conceal their activity and the director general of have say that russia and iran be increasingly use this tactic welcome the home office guidance that allow security organisation to carry out effective due diligence but what else be the department do with the security industry to ensure that our country be protect from these hostile state threat thank my hon friend not just for his question but for mention the recent home office guidance which be crucial first step in upskille security official on the risk that they might encounter from state actor we be follow that up with target engagement event across the sector include upcoming industry conference which we will be attend to ensure that the key message be well understand and we can have an ongoing dialogue with the sector about the handling of such threat when consider hostile state threat we can not ignore terrorist group from both the right and the left in this great united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland who work with some of those state what be be do to ensure that paramilitary group across the united kingdom be take on and that the hostile state they represent on the basis of their own motivation can be address directly the hon gentleman have make an important point as he always do can say to he that threat be threat regardless of the direction from which it come we take all those threat extremely seriously and we work around the clock with the police and the operational agency to keep the public safe wherever the threat may originate call the liberal democrat spokesperson strong encryption be vital for everyone security but last week apple pull its advanced data protection service in the uk after the home office have reportedly demand back door access to its uk customer encrypt datum liberal democrats have long argue that investigatory power must be proportionate as any way in for security service can be exploit by criminal gang or indeed hostile state to target innocent people give that right and security go hand in hand what step be the minister take to ensure that our national security and civil liberty be properly protect why do the government believe that apple uk customer do not deserve the same privacy right as every other customer in the rest of the world hope the hon lady will understand that can not comment on operational matter and it would not be appropriate for either to confirm or to deny the existence of any notice under the investigatory powers act this be long stand position hold by successive government for obvious reason of national security what can say be that the suggestion that privacy and security be at odd be not correct we can and must have both the investigatory powers act contain robust safeguard and independent oversight to protect privacy and ensure that datum be obtain only on an exceptional basis and only when it be necessary and proportionate to do so topical questions if she will make statement on her departmental responsibility call the home secretary thank you mr speaker my son do stand chance those be the heartbreaking word of pooja kanda whose teenage son ronan be

party have year to address all the thing he be so concerned about now this government have increase funding for police by up to billion next year include million to start redress the huge cut in neighbourhood police that we have see on our street in thames valley and right across the country because we need to get police back on the street thank the minister for her previous answer and for her commitment to reduce the number of asylum claimant in the uk as she will know the uk be spend of its official development assistance on housing asylum claimant almost double the oecd average our overseas spend be cut by the previous government do she agree that in order to reduce the number of claimant come to the uk the government should increase the spend on build peace and security abroad my hon friend be right to say that asylum cost make up the bulk of home office spend classify as oda spending and that we be committed to reduce they include by end the use of hotel which will mean that we can return that oda resource so that it can be use upstream to prevent migratory flow from happen in the first place call the shadow home secretary border security be fundamental but between the july election and yesterday people illegally and dangerously cross the english channel increase on the same period month early do the home secretary now regret ignore the national crime agency advice that law enforcement alone be not enough and that removal deterrent be need will just point out to the shadow home secretary that when the conservatives be in government we see that many people arrive in the space of just over day because they completely lose control of our border and let criminal gang take hold along the channel some people arrive in small boat while the rwanda policy that he somehow want to reintroduce manage to send just four volunteer we have increase return by over to which be important hope he will explain why he vote against counter terrorism power to go after smuggler gang the home secretary talk about the rwanda scheme of course it never even start as she well know the first flight be due to take off after the election but she cancel it she mention that return have go up what she fail to mention be that the vast majority of those people do not enter the country by small boat the number of small boat return go down after this government come into office and it represent only of people cross the english channel do she really think that let of illegal immigrant stay here be go to deter anybody just say to the shadow home secretary that the rwanda scheme run for two year it be run for two year it never start exactly all they manage to do order please let we show little bit more restraint and when you ask question at least wait for the answer the scheme run for two year and the conservatives spend million of taxpayer money to return just four people in the period during which the shadow home secretary be in the government people arrive on small boat and only tiny percentage of they be ever return even though that number include albanians this government be have to sort out this chaos but his party be again fail to support counter terrorism power against smuggler and traffic gang side with the criminal smuggler gang instead of the people of britain it be illegal to post prostitution advert in phone box yet the very same advert can be freely post online by pimp website such website be make it as easy to order woman to exploit as it be to order takeaway do the minister agree that we must urgently update our anti pimp law to make it criminal offence to enable or to profit from the prostitution of another person online or offline thank my hon friend for raise this important point the government be clear that online platform be significant enabler of sexual exploitation and must be responsible and hold accountable for the content of their site include take proactive step to prevent their site be use by criminal we be implement the online safety act which set out priority offence include sexual exploitation and human trafficking call the liberal democrats spokesperson on recent visit to marple sixth form

company many hard work employee not least those work directly on the production line but must stress that bmw remain committed to its investment in the uk it be by no mean unusual for manufacturer to adjust its product line up or production start date for commercial reason we be proud that bmw consider oxford to be at the heart of mini production as government we be throw our weight behind its

states underpin by lot of military and defence capability and support over many many year and of course very close intelligence relationship we bring all of that to bear in ensure that we get resolution to this terrible conflict but resolution that mean we have an endure peace in which ukraine be at the centre of discussion my hon friend should be absolutely sure that the uk intend to play its part which be why we will meet with donald trump this week the prime minister have also be at the centre of much shuttle diplomacy over this last period call the liberal democrat spokesperson thank the foreign secretary for advance sight of his statement today mark three year since putin launch his barbaric full scale invasion of ukraine many people include putin expect russian tank to capture kyiv in day yet putin fail to consider the resolve of the ukrainian people three year on ukrainians bravely continue the fight against putin imperialism in defence of their sovereignty the uk and this house have stand together with ukraine throughout these darkest hour across the country people open their home to ukrainian guest and demonstrate their opposition to putin war we must continue to support ukrainians live in the uk include by provide urgent clarity on what permanent option to remain the government will introduce for they however the past week have expose the fragility of the west support for ukraine in parrot the kremlin false claim that ukraine start this war and that president zelensky be dictator president trump have show that the us can not be trust to support ukraine defence that be why the uk work with our continental ally must step up to lead in europe that must include the uk commit to spend of gdp on defence as soon as possible and all party work together to build consensus on reach the liberal democrats support the government suggestion that british troop could join reassurance mission in ukraine if just settlement be reach that would depend on parliamentary approval for such military deployment we also support the government announcement today of new sanction target russian kleptocrat urge the foreign secretary to add to that list the pro russian founder of georgian dream bidzina ivanishvili the government should also now move to seize the frozen russian asset total billion across the uk and europe and channel those fund into ukraine defence as start can the foreign secretary update the house on what be delay the release of the billion promise to ukraine from the sale of chelsea football club this week in washington the prime minister and foreign secretary must make clear that the uk will continue to stand side by side with ukraine for as long as it take to preserve ukrainian sovereignty slava ukraini be very grateful to the hon gentleman on his comment we share president trump desire to bring this barbaric war to an end we know that russia could do that by withdraw its troop tomorrow and president trump agree with we that it be important that ukraine be at the table when speak to secretary rubio he be absolutely clear that there can be no peace without ukraine he be also clear that because of the burden of uk and eu sanction there can not easily be resolution to this conflict without europe at the table as well the hon gentleman ask about sanction and designation combine across both party we have now introduce more sanction for this crime and this terrible conflict than for any other in our parliamentary history can not comment on future designation but the hon gentleman will know and will have hear in my comment that our desire be to put ukraine in the strong possible position we know that putin have turn his economy into war economy and there be evasion that we will continue to bear down on the hon gentleman rightly mention abramovich and the money that have be set aside we be redouble our effort to unlock that money which could be use on the frontline to support ukraine over the course of the next few month be sure that our ukrainian ally will listen to the steadfast support in this house and feel heartened and that they will also notice whose voice be absent from the house at this time there be press report that deal be apparently imminent on ukrainian mineral deposit for america as the price of continued support so be there anything more that we and our european partner can do to stop the eventual product those crucial metal end up in the hand of enemy and competitor state have that issue be discuss my hon friend ask good question discuss that issue with president zelensky when be in ukraine few day ago in the context of the year partnership that we have just sign with ukraine that partnership be unique document not only in our history and ukraine history but in the history of the world and believe it set pretty good guide for how to strike relationship across many front of course that relationship will bring big win for british business over the year ahead but it will also bring big win for ukrainian business we will learn from their innovation look forward to the discussion that ukraine be have with the united states it be for ukraine to make its own judgment but think that year partnership could be good guide thank the foreign secretary for the robust and bipartisan approach he be take to this crisis in that spirit may say to he that if the government come forward with plan to reduce the number of adult welfare recipient just to level that would save billion year it would mean that on thursday he and the prime minister could say to president trump that we be increase defence spending to of gdp or even to of gdp which be what the united states itself spend that would secure not only the future of ukraine but the future of nato which be one of the most important challenge face the government recognise that the right hon gentleman have tremendous experience in these matter he have put his view on the record and be sure that the chancellor of the exchequer will be look very closely at they as part of the detailed conversation that go on across government it be clear that the rule base order establish after the second world war be under extreme threat from oppressor and bully who think that they can just take what they want and be not just talk about putin raft of sanction be introduce in why do my right hon friend think that previous sanction fail to curb russia and what more do we need to do to organisation that use different measure to circumvent sanction my hon friend refer to the rule base order that order be set up not just for its own sake but because of the tremendous bloodshed and loss of life include the many man and woman from our own country and from the united states and other ally who lose their life across europe the order have serve we well and we have to ensure that we continue to protect it she rightly refer to the evasion that we have see with the russian shadow fleet and that be part of the discussion have to have with certain state who facilitate it it be why she will also see in the announcement that have make more effort to target the dual use technology that be find its way out of country such as china and be use against ukrainian man and woman we need to recognise that the environment in which we operate have change fundamentally and therefore our response must change fundamentally very much echo the call of my right hon friend the member for witham priti patel to increase defence spending now because we have to send message to our friend and foe alike that we take defence seriously urge the foreign secretary to remember the commitment we make to the ukrainian people when this full scale invasion take place our support to they be not contingent on the support of other it be absolute and we should make good on that commitment because we say thing that encourage the ukrainians to put their son and daughter in harm way they have stand up their end of the bargain and we should stand up our the right hon gentleman be right we have be ukraine foremost friend and we will continue to do that we have key role to play because of our special relationship with the united states we understand here in europe that yes we want this war to end but we want an endure peace we have get long memory in relation to the soviet union and tsarist history and that guide we on how we secure that peace this weekend join rochdale proud long stand ukrainian community to mark the third anniversary of putin illegal war and to remember all those who have lose their life to russian aggression our own father ben lysykanych be today join the prime minister in downing street do my right hon friend agree that president zelensky be democrat not dictator and that the ukrainian people can never again have their fate decide by other country carve up their land as have happen far too often in the past have meet president zelensky six or seven time over this last period and he have always strike as the most courageous and brave of individual lead his people to self determination that be something that we recognise right across the united kingdom and so we stand with he be at the munich security conference and it become clear while talk with our european ally that they no long fully trust the article security guarantee put simply they do not trust the americans conversation naturally turn to what collective defence look like in europe without the americans last night chancellor elect merz say that conversation be happen at the high level on precisely that will the foreign secretary comment on whether the uk be include in those conversation and on their content nato have stand the test of time as the great modern day alliance that we have ever see and have be strengthen far follow the joining of sweden and finland of course there be debate in europe there be debate about burden share there be debate about burden shift and there be some who think that there be debate about burden dump but nato be great alliance and we work across that alliance successive united states presidents from roosevelt to obama and of course president trump have rightly say that europe must do more and that be what we now have to do the question of defence spending and gdp have be raise think it be clear from recent event that we can not wait until to spend and in fact we should be exceed that percentage in the lead up to any negotiation it be essential for we to ensure that ukraine be in the strong possible position include militarily it be also essential for we to speed up our help and support as quickly as possible understand that the ukrainian defence industrial base have the capacity to increase the production of weapon and equipment can we do more to get funding to it to ensure that that happen our current problem be that our own industrial base can not gear up quickly enough my hon friend have ask an excellent question about ukraine industrial base drone technology for instance be improve apace around the world and the country lead that technology be ukraine we have much to learn we have sign the year partnership and capacity and capability be part of that partnership which will please my hon friend but he be right to say that we can not wait we have to act now that be what be be discuss when the defence secretary be in ukraine short time ago and it be what be discuss with ukraine few week ago so yes we will accelerate the way in which our industry work together and will allocate the fund that be necessary the whole house will want to wish the right hon gentleman and the prime minister strong and successful visit later this week he will be able to agree with the president about the importance of all european member of nato step up and play their part in the significant increase in defence expenditure that we all now need to see while of course never forget what general mattis have say about the important part of the mix that development constitute in national defence however hope there will be no compromise in washington on the fact of the matter namely that member of the united nations invade its neighbour in an act that we think have go out with the last century have bomb and destroy its infrastructure and have butcher and murder its citizen the right hon gentleman have remind the house of the seriousness and the responsibility that we have as permanent member of the united nations security council that seriousness be underpin by the un charter which russia breach and in do so it have make serious hole in the way the security council work let we get beyond that but if we be to do so russia should withdraw and should come to the table with the central issue of peace and make amend at its heart keep ourselves safe here mean show putin that we have the resolve and the resource to defeat he as indeed we have in european nato our combined gdp be about trillion and the gdp of the united states be trillion while russia be just trillion we have more resource and convert they into more fighting force tank gun and drone be key but we can go far russian central bank asset hold by ourselves and our ally amount to more than billion include billion in belgium and billion here and putin could use those reserve in the future to rebuild his armed force can the foreign secretary assure that he be do everything he can to convince our ally of the need to seize those asset to keep we safe and to fund ukraine my hon friend ask good question if we be serious about the responsibility of burden share across europe and indeed across nation at this time one of the issue on the table be move from freeze asset to seize those asset it be live discussion there be other way to find the fund and that be topic of discussion in munich and at the but we must now move from discussion to action will resist the temptation to ask the foreign secretary if he share my feeling of disgust at the spectacle of the leader of the free world shower praise and admiration on the killer in the kremlin when he speak to his counterpart will he try to impress on they that the reason why george kennan containment policy to which he rightly refer be so successful in prevent the cold war from turn into the third world war be that contentious territory be not demilitarise and leave undefended it work in the case of west germany and it will have to be the only way that western ukraine can equally be secure for the future the containment strategy to which the right hon gentleman refer run right through the reagan year and beyond in sense it be the conventional way to understand peace through strength and we would do well to keep it at the front of our mind in the day and week ahead do my right hon friend agree that the international community must not allow the sovereign nation of ukraine to be trade like chess piece by powerful nation particularly after its brave defence of freedom and the international rule base system for itself and the wide world if we fail we risk another peace in our time moment that would soon or later endanger other country and even our own my hon friend be right and we know that ukrainians feel let down by the budapest memorandum they feel brutally let down by the minsk agreement and they can not be let down again we also know that because of the unbelievable ukrainian spirit they would fight on with guerrilla warfare if need be these be the most admirable of people fight for their self determination and the united kingdom will continue to stand with they the scottish national party have stand alongside the people of ukraine in solidarity not just for the last three year but for the last year follow putin invasion of crimea will not invite the foreign secretary to agree with on this in the chamber but be sure he think that president trump remark about zelensky be dictator be beyond repulsive surely we all know that no deal can be make with vladimir putin that he will not break do the foreign secretary agree the right hon gentleman have point russia and putin have be clear about the term that they want for peace which have often include the removal of of nato member that be unacceptable we have see finland and sweden join recently the precondition for talk have be that ukraine should effectively give up the territory now occupy by russia it seem to that such demand show utter contempt for ukrainian territorial integrity the russians will not be serious about discussion until they reconsider the criterion that we hear once again from lavrov last week constituent of mine and her son move to this country under the homes for ukraine scheme she have very stable job here and her son be do level at the good math school in london but she be worried that her month visa extension will expire in the middle of her son exam what conversation be the foreign secretary department have with the home office to ensure that young ukrainians who move here through no fault of their own do not have their education disrupt but can build life for themselves be very grateful to my hon friend for put on the record the tremendous support the british people have give to ukrainian refugee it allow to say that there be still war and there be still need for those people to seek sanctuary in our country it be my assessment that putin be not show serious willingness to negotiate and it may be that negotiation go on for some time so want to reassure her constituent that we be of course in close dialogue with my right hon friend the home secretary some of we be old enough to remember hungary in and some of we be old enough to remember czechoslovakia in none of we want to see ukraine sacrifice on the same altar of expediency when the foreign secretary and the prime minister go to washington they will know that they will carry with they the good wish of almost all of this house ukraine be not for sale and it can never be for sale this be not transaction the united kingdom will stand with ukraine for as long as it take be very grateful to the right hon gentleman for remind we of the history he will know that in the century to the east it be only the russo japanese war that stop russia imperial ambition to the south it be the war in crimea and of course to the west it be the containment strategy to which have refer and nato this history be our good adviser as we approach the matter of peace start by commend the people of ukraine for resist the murderous dictator vladimir putin for as long as they have they be hero almost every member of this house know that if we fold in our support of ukraine now and give russia what it want vladimir putin will only come back for more our national security be at stake do the foreign secretary agree that it be in everyone interest britain europe and america to ensure that any potential peace deal include ukraine at the table nothing about ukraine without ukraine be hear loudly of course from president zelensky but all europeans recognise it be pleased that secretary of state rubio in my conversation with he and indeed general kellogg have both underline the importance of ukraine be at the table very warmly welcome the foreign secretary statement although he perhaps can not use the language be about to use hope that when the prime minister and he meet putin appeaser in the white house later this week he will remind he that if we have special relationship and the foreign secretary keep refer to special relationship it have to be base on truth respect for democracy respect for justice and respect for international law in the end the united states be leader of the free world president trump have an election in which million people vote for he and he hold both houses on the hill and as we would expect he be of course buoy up as indeed be my party by such democratic mandate we will have conversation with he over the come day on range of issue friend agree and can sometimes disagree but think it be definitely the case that we support his desire for bring this horrendous war to an end we will now play our part in europe to ensure that we raise defence spending and that europe step up to the necessary burden sharing president trump analysis of the huge problem in the indo pacific be correct and we must recognise that successive us president have be clear about their responsibility in relation to the indo pacific despite the astonishing day we have have and we should be under no illusion that they have be astonishing there have be reassurance to be find in the government steadfast commitment to ukraine and the leadership they have be show the foreign secretary allude early to vladimir putin penchant for lie he lie about the invasion he lie about ukraine territorial integrity he lie about the rule of war and he abduct thousand of ukrainian child do my right hon friend agree that not only should ukraine be at the centre of the negotiation but that we should be clear eyed about the character of the man we be deal with be very grateful to my hon friend for mention the child who have be abduct on the past two occasion have be in ukraine have meet child who be viciously take from their home there be an attempt to effectively brainwash they from their history we be support organisation that seek to get those child back and reunite they with their family also launch child in care initiative be very pleased to be with madam zelensky when be last in ukraine support vulnerable child with their foster family do the foreign secretary agree that the of gdp ship have now sail and that we and our ally have to find the resource to spend within recognisable timeframe when he be in washington this week will he discuss with his interlocuter how the billion of pound he propose to give mauritius for take on the chagos islands could be well serve by be devote to build and re equip our armed force ten year ago there be just four country meet the commitment today that have rise to right across the alliance country be understand that they have to do more we will set out how we will do more very very shortly as the matter today be ukraine the right hon gentleman will forgive but will not discuss issue to do with the british indian ocean territory be sure he will have an occasion to do so at oral question tomorrow just over three year ago fly the penultimate uk mission into kyiv to deliver materiel essential to the defence of ukraine ahead of the illegal full scale russian invasion since then ukraine have be defend european security the un charter and liberal democracy against putin assault on those share interest and in the word of the declaration of independence the unalienable right of life liberty and the pursuit of happiness do the foreign secretary agree that to free ukraine from putin tyranny and imperialist ambition and to ensure the word of the declaration of independence be realise for all uk leadership in the co ordination of european and transatlantic ally be essential yes yes yes say to my hon friend think all of we pay tribute to our armed force and to his work in our armed force it be because of that work over so many year that sacrifice that think the spirit of this country guide we to stand solidly with ukraine on cross party basis he be right to pray in aid those word that underpin our value and indeed global value as underpin in the un charter that be what we be fight for and we will not give up do the secretary of state regret recant the view he originally express in assess trump when the time be right it be certainly not any time now can urge he to consider follow the example of archbishop cranmer by plunge the offend hand first into the flame this be serious debate and serious discussion as have say that is in sense old news there be so much news before we and so much history to be forge which require diplomacy and friendship and we understand who the real threat be those real threat be the autocracy of the world which could do tremendous damage over the come year have always recognise that as have be replicate across the country people in coatbridge and bellshill have open their door to those force from their home by putin illegal attack public authority have also step up north lanarkshire council have provide home and support integration for more than ukrainian family at the high coats tower in my constituency and have be recognise nationally for help to deliver stability and belong as we continue to push for just peace and follow the question from my hon friend the member for hampstead and highgate tulip siddiq will my right hon friend commit to work with the home secretary devolve governments and other key stakeholder to ensure safe harbour for the family so cruelly and viciously target by putin barbarism assure my hon friend that that will be the case continue to work closely with the home secretary there have be tremendous outpouring of support across this country which recognise and have see at work in scotland too welcome the robust statement from the secretary of state today and the way he have stand by ukraine and commit the uk to stand by ukraine hope he will convey the same message to president trump that by give into putin we jeopardise peace not only in ukraine but across the whole of europe first what practical step can he take apart from the assurance he have give the house today to ensure that ukraine interest be reflect in any negotiation secondly give the stretch state of our own armed force what long term security commitment can we give to ukraine we have commit billion in support to ukraine for as long as it last the ukrainians ask for more munition and we support they they ask for particular missile capability and we support they we will continue to support they because this war be be wag on the frontline it be war of attrition notwithstanding any discussion or talk we need to be there with the ukrainians and guarantee to the right hon gentleman that we will continue to do that be present at the munich security conference where it feel like the world change around we and the consequence could not be more serious welcome our government announcement today of fresh sanction on russia give the absence of some on the opposition benches be sure the whole house will agree that it be president putin and not president zelensky who be the dictator do the foreign secretary agree that this be indeed once in generation moment and that the future of our security in the uk be bind up in ukraine security and in the need to do what it take to face down the aggression of putin russia my hon friend be absolutely right because of the history of russia and the former soviet union we understand deeply that our own future be bind up in putin ambition we also understand by the way that there be many valiant people resist putin in russia meet mrs navalny at the munich security conference our fight be not with the russian people it be to support the russian people our fight be with vladimir putin when putin invade he think it would be matter of week three year on ukraine be still stand be proud of how we as house and as nation stand up for ukraine that include many of my constituent for which commend they my right hon friend the shadow foreign secretary ask about sanction but do not hear an answer from the foreign secretary so he perhaps he can shed some light when the prime minister meet president trump will he raise the issue of new sanction which would welcome will we urge the us to follow suit we continue to discuss sanction with all our partner discuss that with partner include secretary of state rubio we have impose sanction on more than individual and entity the most wide range sanction impose on any major economy we believe that maximum pressure be require at this time the united states have indicate that it would be willing to impose further sanction on russia that issue remain under discussion welcome the important statement from the foreign secretary and the comment from the shadow foreign secretary this entire house should be unite in our support for ukraine as other have say it be rather shame that one party have not show up ukrainian who have come to the uk since the war have make such an important contribution to our country meet olha ukrainian teessider over the weekend she share with that many ukrainians face great uncertainty partly because they be unable to access work and study because of the lack of ukrainian gcse will the foreign secretary discuss this issue with the department for education to ensure that ukrainians be able to access study and work will he recognise at the dispatch box the importance of the contribution that ukrainians have make to our country there have be history between we and ukrainians as they be make contribution across europe and in our country long before this war begin my hon friend make very good point about the ukrainian language have admire many ukrainians for the way that they have quickly learn the english language will take his recommendation to the education secretary join other in commend the ukrainian people for their bravery in the face of russian aggression and the government steadfast support for the nation sovereignty the foreign secretary refer in his statement to the need for european nation to contribute more to future security guarantee for the ukrainian people do he envisage more bilateral and multilateral agreement between european ally play part in that endeavour much in the vein of the lancaster house treaty or latterly the trinity house agreement the hon gentleman be right that the uk have seek to forge strong relationship with key partner across europe once the new government be form in germany we look forward to sign an update lancaster house treaty with our german friend he be right that bilaterally that be important believe that nato be the central underpinning of european security but we need to work together across europe to increase our industrial defence capability and we need to find more fund to increase our defence spending right across the european family he will hear more about that in the come week and month the foreign secretary be right that if russia be serious about last peace it must respect ukraine sovereignty but give that it have show absolutely no sign of do that will he reiterate that we will stand shoulder to shoulder with ukraine no matter what will he far reiterate even for the member who have not choose to be here for this statement that this country do not appease fascist but oppose they my hon friend be absolutely right that be why since february the united kingdom total military economic and humanitarian support for ukraine have amount to billion that be our commitment to ukraine so far and that commitment will continue be proud that more than ukrainians have be host in my constituency through the homes for ukraine programme three year on my constituent stand with ukraine they know that ukraine have protect europe frontline for three year they know that ukraine fight be one that affect we all and that if ukraine lose europe lose and they know that ukrainians be fight for the value of our forebear the british value of democracy and freedom will the foreign secretary commit to stand by ukraine steadfast even when other do not in his meeting in washington tomorrow will he ensure that he point out the folly and the danger of the us administration new approach to russia the uk of course support the us lead effort to get last peace in ukraine that deter russia from future aggression and ensure that ukraine be at the table as we negotiate that peace that be the issue that we will be discuss with president trump just as president macron be discuss that issue today be quite sure that our assessment that putin be not ready really to negotiate on proper term stand but admire the effort to bring that about of course the us play central role in achieve that today we pay tribute to the people of ukraine fight not only for their own freedom but for the freedom of all europe the foreign secretary say that we must learn from history over year ago in munich this country and other talk away the future of czechoslovakia without it be there and strip it of its vital resource we all know the tragic consequence today there can be no peace without ukraine and there can be no endure peace without the security that this country and other nato ally can give to it my hon friend put his remark well agree with he can barely believe that have get to say this to the foreign secretary but he will be unaware that in past moment the united states have just vote against the un resolution condemn russian aggression in ukraine understand fully the position that the foreign secretary and the prime minister be in and the approach that they have get to take in washington this week but we know that president trump listen to the people who last speak to he can therefore ask the foreign secretary to outline two important point first european military asset not nato asset be often use to support american operation in the indo pacific and the american military really appreciate how we put our shoulder to the wheel it be not the americans only ever support europe we also help the americans secondly last week and several hon member and noble member be at the nato parliamentary assembly in brussels where it be make clear that what will be present at the hague summit be what be actually need for european defence rather than just gdp target may also ask the foreign secretary to advise the prime minister that it will be important that he take position with the president of the united states that if those demand add up to more than of gdp our country will set itself on path within the time target to achieve those order can remind member that if we be to get everybody in short question and shortish answer please would be helpful the right hon gentleman mention the indo pacific and it be important that we remember aukus and our critical partnership with australia and the united states in relation to that he quite rightly mention defence spending on which much have be say in this chamber and much be sure will be say when we go to the united states thank the foreign secretary for strong statement he say that ukraine security be our security do he agree that this be fight for democracy where we need to tackle misinformation both at home and abroad and where we need to maintain our steadfast commitment to ukraine sovereignty be grateful to my hon friend for mention that because there be hybrid warfare take place as we speak country such as moldova be at the forefront of it with sabotage and constant attack on its infrastructure and its internet service this be hybrid warfare and of course it be take place against our own country so he be absolutely right this be not just hard war and hot war it be hybrid war and we have to be vigilant welcome the foreign secretary statement it be indeed important that we have cross party support across this house stand in solidarity with ukraine and be clear that ukraine must be front and centre of the peace talk that must take place but it be deeply disturbing to hear some of the comment from president trump include the absurd claim that zelensky be dictator and the ridiculous suggestion that ukraine start the war therefore when the foreign secretary and the prime minister go to washington later this week will they make it clear to president trump that ukraine must be at the centre of these peace talk and that the ukrainian people have an absolute right to self determination yes there must be no negotiation about ukraine without ukraine as have say we have see very little sign that putin be abandon his goal of subjugate ukraine russia have continue to escalate this war include through deploy democratic people republic of korea troop and through daily barbaric attack on innocent ukrainian civilian and their infrastructure and energy supply on saturday join ukrainian family and resident in bishop stortford to remember those who have lose their life and suffer throughout this conflict ahead of the third anniversary this be reminder that in my constituency and across the country we stand firmly with the ukrainian people as we mark the third anniversary will the foreign secretary reiterate to the ukrainian family who have find safety in my constituency and indeed to all ukrainian people that this government will continue to advocate for ukraine sovereignty and for it to be give seat at the table right at the heart of any future negotiation know my hon friend constituency well and be very pleased to give his constituent that affirmation no member of this house should be in any doubt as to who the aggressor be in this situation who the dictator be or who start this war no one should give cover to the dictator who start this war the prime minister have say that if there be peace he anticipate post peace situation where there will be british troop on the ground in ukraine with what he term us backstop do the foreign secretary agree that the prospect of us backstop would be greatly enhance if the european nation begin more thoroughly to shoulder the financial burden that have be shirk in recent year yes do there be complacency in the post cold war period across the european family and at this dispatch box we have lament the fact that the united kingdom have fall to of gdp so the hon and learn gentleman be right this be the time to step up and to demonstrate peace with strength and the baltic nation be very clear about the responsibility at this time like the foreign secretary be incredibly proud of the role that the uk have play in support ukraine and especially proud of the role that my constituent have play in welcome ukrainians into their home and into our community but if we be to stop putin britain must get real on defence do the foreign secretary agree that we must now urgently rearm well beyond the exist target so that with our european ally we can protect our precious democracy as say we will set out further defence spending shortly nato country border russia be understandably step up their defence without wait for other to take action will the foreign secretary update the house on the discussion he have have with those country meet the polish foreign minister at the munich security conference and baltic colleague to discuss those issue the hon member be absolutely right that those country have be aware of the threat for some time her question allow to say that when we talk about security guarantee for ukraine it be important to recognise nato eastern flank when it come to the effort to get us security guarantee many country on that flank would have to know that they be support that be why the us backstop be so important last week along with other member of this house meet ukrainian parliamentarian at the organisation for security and co operation in europe in vienna the opposition mps from ukraine make it clear that they do not support donald trump call for an election in ukraine while they be defend against russian aggression in his conversation with the us administration this week will the foreign secretary make it clear that there be only one dictator in this conflict and his name be vladimir putin yes of course on the third anniversary of putin brutal full scale invasion of ukraine welcome the united nations have just pass resolution condemn russian aggression in ukraine however in the last minute this will shock the house it be oppose by russia and the united states it be say in the press that this be appeasement by trump it direct stab in the back will the foreign secretary condemn what have just happen in the united nations where the united states have join russia in not sign up to the resolution condemn russian aggression in ukraine we be proud to have co sponsor the general assembly resolution propose by ukraine in support of just and last peace in ukraine it be in line with the un charter the un vote for it and we will stand forever with ukraine yesterday ukrainians in welwyn hatfield come together in sober recognition of the third anniversary of the russian invasion pay tribute to they for their bravery and resilience and for how they be go about rebuild their life as valuable member of our community tell they that in this house would speak the truth and stand up for they as well could do the foreign secretary agree that we need to say loud and clear from the dispatch box that one person be the aggressor one person be responsible for the death and destruction and we should say it emphatically one person start this war and his name be vladimir putin my hon friend be absolutely right when be in kyiv see that close to president zelensky office be an apartment block that be blow up few week ago couple asleep in their bed be kill that be the awfulness of this war of course my hon friend will recall that when the prime minister visit putin seek to fire missile into ukraine it be grim and unbelievable brutality and of course we must continue to stand up to it in response to the right hon member for aberdeen south stephen flynn the foreign secretary say that russia do not respect the territorial integrity of ukraine on his comment on the ukraine defence contact group the us defence secretary pete hegseth say that the us want to see sovereign and prosperous ukraine but give the news that we have just hear about the un resolution how confident be the foreign secretary that the us will respect the territorial integrity of ukraine be very pleased that the us have attempt to bring this

through the children wellbeing and schools bill thousand of school have apply to take part an indication of overwhelming demand and spur to act from this april free breakfast club will begin to reach more than child and pupil from school in the most deprived part of the country will be able to take part our early adopter school be draw from all kind of place city and village north and south east and west affluent area and more disadvantaged community big school and small school mainstream school and special school for child with special educational need and disability they include school that have have club before and those that have not school in which parent have have to pay for breakfast club in the past and school in which place be limited that variety be key it give we representative sample so we can see what work when where why and how guide by the good evidence that be how we will maximise the impact of the full roll out bring the benefit to child across the entire country we be take new approach the challenge we face demand it breakfast club be one part but we be go far and deliver more change for child we be mission lead government bring meaningful change that be feel in our town our city and our community and be proud to be lead our mission across government to break down the barrier to opportunity in december the prime minister unveil our plan for change and within that plan lie vital milestone record proportion of child start school ready to learn that be crucial to close the opportunity gap all child arrive at school ready to achieve and to thrive get right to the heart of what it mean to have the very good start in life believe that deliver the good start in life be about family parent and child breakfast club be one piece of the puzzle but our action start early in life with great early education and childcare it be something that have spend many year in this house fight for but that our childcare system have deny family there be area underserve with childcare place yet overwhelm with demand additional hour be offer nationally but they be unavailable to family locally the opposition failure to keep their promise be the reason their party suffer such an emphatic defeat at the last election promise make but not act on be not promise at all and pledge without plan to deliver be meaningless that be why this government be commit to deliver the entitlement that parent be promise before the last election as result of this government hard work in make that pledge reality family can now access hour of government fund childcare week from when their child be nine month old from september that will increase to hour week match the offer for three and four year old this government have match the pledge with plan promise now back by funding in the next financial year alone we will invest more than billion in early year entitlement an increase of more than billion on top of that be new million expansion grant to support the sector to provide the extra place and staff need we will use those hour week to combine childcare with great early education and to give child the very good start in life want to double down on support for those child who need it most in the area that need it most that be why introduce the big ever uplift to the early year pupil premium childcare deliver for parent too just like breakfast club the entitlement give parent power choice and freedom over their life enable they to go back to work if that be what they want to do work choice for parent life chance for child these be the step we be take and the promise we be keep to support family be determined to see the change through but it be not shot in the dark the value of give child the good start in life and the power of spread breakfast club across the country be as clear as day and there for all to see if we know where to look on the northern edge of st helens sit carr mill primary school child at carr mill can come in before the school day start and eat breakfast with their friend in the school bistro when they reach year they be invite to become bistro leader those young leader help their peer to get good breakfast but they also learn about responsibility care for their classmate and what it mean to be part of community parent see the change in their child who be more confident and eager to go to school in the morning and the young one look up to the bistro leader it be not just the breakfast it be the club too help child to settle show they that they belong in school get they ready to learn and shape not just the student of today but the citizen of tomorrow it set child up for success in school and in life because that wide goal we be chase of give every child the good start in life mean give they the good start to their school day each and every day week after week year after year that be how we be break the link between background and success and how we be deliver the change that parent vote for that be how we be drive the change that the child of this country deserve commend this statement to the house call the shadow minister thank the secretary of state for advance sight of the statement the previous government substantially expand access to breakfast club in primary and secondary school and crate the holiday activity and food programme the national school breakfast programme have be run since and of school now have breakfast club with one in eight have taxpayer fund breakfast club in march the previous government announce million for the national wraparound childcare funding programme some of which be be use to fund breakfast club that be part of much wide expansion of free childcare that see spending on entitlement to free childcare more than double in real term between and be strike by the comment make by mark russell from the children society during the evidence session for the children wellbeing and schools bill give the resource constraint he say taxpayer money should be focus on roll out free breakfast to great number of deprive secondary school rather than provide universal offer in primary school he say would like to see secondary school child help and if the pot be limited would probably step back from universality and provide for those most in need official report children wellbeing and schools public bill committee january with that in mind want to draw attention to the uncertainty create by the government refusal to commit to fund the exist free breakfast provision in secondary school beyond next year and likewise the holiday activity and food programme number of charity have call for ministers to guarantee that funding beyond next year and join they in ask the secretary of state to give that guarantee get rid of the exist free breakfast would mean cut in provision for deprive child at secondary school so will the secretary of state guarantee to continue they accord to report by the institute for fiscal studies last year base on the experience of the national school breakfast programme the estimate annual cost today would be around per pupil participate for food only provision and double that around for traditional before school breakfast club labour manifesto offer million overall in this could be enough to fund all primary school pupil under food only model or of pupil if the party plump for traditional breakfast club with some childcare element will the secretary of state respond to that point make by the ifs do the government plan food only provision if not how do she plan to close that funding gap paul bertram headteacher at buxworth primary school in derbyshire tell schools week that he have to pull out of the pilot scheme as it leave he with funding shortfall the charity magic breakfast say if it be expect that per cent of people can access traditional breakfast club setting with the appropriate staffing then the government be many many million away from the budget that we would expect that would require will the secretary of state say how many school apply to be part of the pilot but subsequently pull out number of journalist have ask that question how many of the school choose to take part in the pilot already have breakfast club and how many already have free breakfast club look at the first on the list have breakfast club and have free breakfast club but what be the number overall if pupil need to have one to one teaching assistant how will fund for that work minister say that the policy will save parent up to year the secretary of state say that again today but ministers use to use figure of to give to all million pupil in primary school would cost over billion year in contrast the pilot will cost million labour manifesto say the programme will spend million by which would mean spend of per primary school child not will the secretary of state explain the discrepancy between the plan spend and the much large benefit that minister be claim parent on low wage be bear the brunt of the billion increase in national insurance as the office for budget responsibility and the ifs have point out that increase will directly hit wage which even the chancellor have now acknowledge the big loser from that tax increase be those earn less than year people who be among those most affect by the billion tax increase may not feel well off from the million of plan spending so it be vital that we be clear about what minister be really claim and on what basis mention that of school already have breakfast club the new requirement to offer free school breakfast in all primary school will interact with that exist provision in different way many school breakfast club currently run for an hour on pay for basis and hope most will continue to provide at least the period they be provide now however if the breakfast club be provide for say an hour or more the school will have to charge for the first minute of that hour but not for the final minute which be likely to give rise to considerable complexity will ministers agree to report on the length of time that club be run in these school and on any reduction that this change may inadvertently bring about taxpayer fund breakfast for those who really need they be helpful but there be number of question about ministers plan and their claim about the scheme so look forward to the secretary of state answer the shadow minister ask number of question but at no point do he welcome the massive investment and the benefit that this provision will bring to child across our country include in his own constituency not word of support hope when the breakfast club in his constituency open he might take time to visit that school and see the massive benefit be deliver to child and family before respond to the number of detailed question that the hon gentleman ask note once again how disappointing it be that the conservatives vote to block the children wellbeing and schools bill let we remind ourselves what that would have mean it would have completely stop the roll out of free breakfast club we be announce today they will be roll out across england subject to the progress of the bill it would have stop we limit the number of brand uniform item that school can demand which again will save family hundred of pound at time when we know that they be under real pressure most shamefully of all the hon gentleman know full well that it would have stop dead some of the most far reach child protection measure in generation just so that the conservatives could grab cheap headline the hon gentleman talk about the national school breakfast programme and the investment there that programme be an online platform from which school can order food it cover of food only it do not cover wide cost and school be require to contribute the remain so there be significant difference in what we be set out one in seven of the school in the pilot scheme that we be announce today have no before school provision the rest have mix of pay for provision or in many case school breakfast club where cap be in place and the number be limited the breakfast club we be introduce will be free and available to every child and every parent who seek to take they up that be why it be estimate that parent will save year when it come to evidence of the roll out the hon gentleman have say on many occasion that he be interested in evidence base policymaking the evidence be very clear that the impact be great at primary school level and we would think that he would recognise that the purpose behind the early adopter be not simply to demonstrate to parent the difference that labour government be bring and real difference to child life they also allow we to test really effectively what work ahead of full national roll out that be why we want to work with school leader as part of this programme to ensure that all child be able to benefit from universal free breakfast club across our country include child with send the conservatives have no plan for education except preserve the tax break for student in private school whereas we have plan to give every child the good start in life if they be go to spend the next five year defend their record we will get on and deliver the change that this country vote for we make promise to the people of this country and today we be deliver on the promise we make call the chair of the education committee thank the secretary of state for her statement today welcome the news that st luke church of england primary school in my constituency will be one of the early adopter of universal breakfast club under the programme all too often child with special educational need and disability be exclude from extracurricular activity and it be the parent of child with send who often find it the hard to access childcare it be essential that child with send have equal access to breakfast club in both mainstream and specialist school what step be be take to ensure that that be the case that school have the capacity to provide specialist staff where need and that any additional home to school transport cost which be often essential in enable child with send physically to access breakfast club will be meet some school have be select to take part in the early adopter scheme of which be mainstream school and be special school and alternative provision setting that be important because we want to make sure that all child in time be able to benefit from the roll out of breakfast club we will work closely with school and sector expert to develop the programme as we intend to roll it out really want to learn through the early adopter school how we can well create truly universal and inclusive breakfast school provision recognise that deliver breakfast club may be particularly challenge for special and alternative provision school we have invite they to take part in the early adopter scheme so that we can make sure that as we roll out across the country include in mainstream school the need of all child be properly cater for as part of the programme call the liberal democrat spokesperson with three in child grow up in poverty any measure to tackle child hunger be to be welcome to enable they to learn and flourish so congratulate the school select as breakfast club early adopter the learning from those pilot will be absolutely critical as the government seek to scale up the programme number of question that have previously put to ministers still stand and hope that the secretary of state will address some of they many school leader have raise concern about the propose funding rate which be reportedly around per child per day if the pilot clearly show that those rate be insufficient will ministers commit to review and increase they school simply can not afford to make saving elsewhere such as in teach budget will ministers review school food standard to ensure that breakfast be specifically address as the recent house of lords report on childhood obesity recommend what consideration have be give to how the minute of universal free childcare provision will interact with exist breakfast club provision most commute parent need more than minute of childcare in the morning the child poverty action group have highlight that breakfast club will probably secure only around take up the most vulnerable child especially those in temporary accommodation who travel long distance may not make it to school in time for breakfast the children society have argue as have the liberal democrats that where money be scarce we should target resource at those who most need they as such why will the government not prioritise expand eligibility for free school meal hot healthy meal in the middle of the day when child be guarantee to be in school so that all child in poverty whether in primary or secondary be be feed be it not high time that ministers introduce automatic enrolment into free school meal for all child finally on the secretary of state childcare announcement can she confirm how much of that money will go into plug the gap leave by the rise in employer national insurance contribution which will put significant pressure on provider and push up cost for parent be grateful to the hon lady for her question turn first to the question of funding there have sadly be some misunderstanding about the funding rate so will set those out for the benefit of the house in the summer term funding will be pay in two part an up front one off payment of to cover initial set up cost and alongside that lump sum payment of to cover fix staffing cost for the summer term that be in addition to the per pupil funding rate that exist in both mainstream and specialist provision of course rate will be high in special school recognise the additional need and staffing requirement that exist there school will receive support to manage the requirement of the scheme and will be provide with opportunity to learn from one another on food standard we always seek to keep all those area under review we want to make sure that all the food serve in our school be healthy and nutritious so that child be well fed and ready to learn the school food statutory guidance which regulate the food and drink provide in school already apply to breakfast we want to ensure that healthy meal be offer as part of breakfast club and we will continue to keep these area under review the hon lady be right to ask about exist wraparound provision we expect the two offer to be complementary school will be able to provide pay for offer alongside the minute of childcare and food through the universal offer note her concern about child poverty and strongly agree that there be need for further action to tackle the shocking rate of child poverty we see in our country that be why together with the work and pensions secretary we be lead work across government as part of the child poverty taskforce we look forward to set out further finding from that work in due course include to this house we be consider range of measure and way in which we can support child out of poverty the shocking legacy leave behind by the last conservative government the hon lady ask about the additional investment go into the sector the big investment that we be put into the early year pupil premium and the expansion grant will be crucial to provide the support that the sector need to deliver the place and staffing require ahead of september look forward to continue to work with she to make sure we get this right warmly welcome today announcement of the breakfast club pilot area include the two school in my constituency which will make massive difference to the life of many work family however on the subject of breakfast club as an sen parent would like to issue the plea do you forget about too often sen parent and their child find that policy move ahead without they and there be risk that we could be slightly overlook in this area what measure have the secretary of state put in place to make sure that disabled child and those with additional need can fully take part in breakfast club be grateful to my hon friend for raise this important area she be right that breakfast club must be fully inclusive and take account of the need of all child include child with send that be why as part of this process we have announce special and ap school that will be take part in the early adopter scheme they will receive high funding rate of pupil in addition to support for set up cost and termly payment recognise the need to ensure that breakfast club operate in mainstream school can cater to the need of wide range of child that be why we be develop toolkit for provider of wraparound care include breakfast club so that the provision that be put in place be inclusive for all child the secretary of state make compelling argument on the merit of breakfast for many of our young child and the benefit that it have for learn can she say word or two on two point first will she answer the question be raise in the secondary sector about future funding beyond the agree time period secondly what incentive can she put in place to encourage school to procure foodstuff that be produce locally that would give good support to our local food producer and our farmer agree with the hon gentleman about the importance of support local provider where that be possible and the fantastic contribution of british food and wide produce just observe that it be my understanding that his constituency be set to benefit from the early adopter scheme hope that he will be able to see the fantastic benefit that it will bring to child and family in his constituency the national school breakfast programme will continue for the next year but that cover only of food school be require to fund the additional of cost our new breakfast club will be about more than just food they will be about the wide opportunity that child in primary school will have at the start of the school day and the cost will cover staffing delivery and food warmly welcome this statement and the firm action that my right hon friend be take to make sure that we can level the play field and boost attendance and attainment for child in southampton itchen and beyond be particularly delighted that st john primary and nursery school will get this investment from the government as part of the early adopter programme will the secretary of state detail what conversation she be have about how the monitoring will work so that the national roll out can be base on the good evidence ahead of perhaps other invitation may invite she to visit st john to see the breakfast club in action be delighted to hear about the good news for st john be sure that the minister for early education my hon friend the member for portsmouth south stephen morgan and will receive lot of invitation to visit fantastic breakfast club across our country we will do our good to service those invitation but with more than it might be bit of stretch we will try our very good my hon friend the member for southampton itchen darren paffey be right to identify the need to develop learning and understanding about what work across the early adopter that be why the school take part in this pilot cover range of setting and serve community with range of different need both rural and urban and of different kind so that we can ensure fully representative sample ahead of full roll out be grateful to the secretary of state for her statement as child bring up on free milk and free school meal very much welcome and support the government plan to set up universal breakfast club in all primary school however concern be report among headteacher union and charity that the plan will not be properly fund and will lack the flexibility require to be successful this weekend the independent publication schools week highlight how some headteacher in primary school while enthusiastic about the aim refuse to take part in the early adopter pilot scheme as volunteer school because only be be provide by the government per pupil the budget of school in my constituency of dewsbury and batley as well as those across the country be already stretch beyond break point will the secretary of state therefore confirm that adequate funding for healthy food as well as the necessary flexibility will be provide to all primary school for the breakfast club will she guarantee that school will not be leave out of pocket be confident that the funding be make available to school will be sufficient to deliver on this programme the hon gentleman quote the daily per pupil funding rate but alongside that as set out early there will be start up cost as well as lump sum payment to cover the cost of run breakfast club alongside high daily funding rate for special school and high daily funding rate base on the proportion of pupil at the school first my congratulation go to pool hayes primary school in willenhall for be one of the early adopter will the secretary of state outline how the free universal roll out of breakfast club alongside cap the number of brand item of uniform and expand funded childcare will help family in wolverhampton north east with the cost of living be delighted that my hon friend constituency be part of the early adopter programme our breakfast club scheme be all about make sure that child get great start to their school day welcome space that provide they with valuable opportunity to play learn and socialise however as she identify the measure we be set out to the house today on the early adopter scheme as well as the measure in the children wellbeing and schools bill will also make big difference to parent they will put more money back into their pocket by limit the cost of school uniform and provide more support around breakfast club that be the difference labour government make welcome very much the secretary of state commitment to the scheme know it be an england scheme but we have similar scheme in northern ireland every one of we as mps have attend kellogg event in the house and we understand the commitment that kellogg can make have the secretary of state consider whether other company could do similar to what kellogg do in relation to school for instance bakery and those who make jam or marmalade could do something indeed we know that the superstore dump their food out or dispose of it within hour that be good food go to waste there might be well way perhaps she can help we to achieve that agree with the hon gentleman that there be always more that we can do and note that many company already involve themselves in important charitable work in this area he name one company it would be remiss of as north east mp not to give special plug to greggs which do fantastic work in this space too alongside the national roll out of breakfast club that we intend to deliver we continue to believe that there be an important role for organisation such as magic breakfast greggs and kellogg in support school and child welcome the introduction of free breakfast club for all primary school include robin hood primary school in leeds south west and morley such club provide of saving to parent and extra childcare and we know that child should not have to start the day hungry what can the secretary of state tell the primary school in my constituency about the full roll out when can they expect to see breakfast club in their school we intend to deliver the roll out as soon as possible because we know it be urgent and we know the difference it will make to child life free universal breakfast club will also mean that every primary school child no matter their circumstance be well prepared to learn that be why we believe in that important provision be universal and available to all child today be an important step forward and robin hood primary school will be an important part of how we develop and understand how to roll out the programme nationally agree with the secretary of state that every single child deserve the good start in life but if we be honest we know that not every child have that this programme will make such big difference to so many child include child at van gogh primary school henry fawcett primary school and crawford primary school in my constituency the secretary of state be always welcome to come and visit any of those three we know that this programme will make big difference for many parent too one of the other push behind the free breakfast club be that they be really good for child attainment and attendance the early adopter start in april what be the timeline for review they especially in light of some of the funding concern that other member have raise strongly agree with my hon friend about the need to ensure that every child have the good start in life be grateful for her generous invitation and be sure that my hon friend the early education minister and will consider it along with no doubt great many other invitation we intend to test and learn as we go along to ensure that

hon friend be right to mention evidence from the education endowment foundation which demonstrate the impact of breakfast club on attendance attainment and behaviour affect not just the child who benefit but the whole school community story of child arrive for lesson hungry be far too common in my constituency and across the country and the issue be exacerbate by the massive rise in child poverty under the last government because of the action of this labour government however my constituency will see pilot in cornholme junior infant and nursery school scout road academy elland church

and resilience in respect of energy security new clause transfer the management of the crown estate in wales to the welsh government within two year of the commencement of the act the principle behind it be simple the people of wales should control and benefit from their own natural resource for much of welsh history that have not be the case with resource often exploit for the benefit of other from copper in amlwch in ynys môn slate in gwynedd steel in port talbot and newport to the coal across the south east valley the river of wealth that flow from those industry be suck out of our community and those community have since be ravage by poverty wales be bless with natural wealth and brilliant people yet we be also nation afflict with deprivation follow year of extraction shocking new figure show that child poverty in wales be set to reach by the end of the decade that be the legacy of our past in which wealth generate be not use to benefit the welsh economy or community today in that extractive pattern be be repeat with wales green wealth wales have immense renewable energy potential in our windy sea and long coastline we can see that demonstrate in the morlais project on ynys môn but the seabed along with thousand of acre of land be control by the crown estate renewable energy project use these resource be expand rapidly and deliver profit we see that in the value of the crown estate which sky rocket from million five year ago to million in however all profit generate by the crown estate in wales be transfer to the treasury this green wealth just like the wealth from coal and other mineral in the past be be suck out of our nation million of pound generate on the welsh crown estate be take out of wales each year away from our community who have bear the brunt of decade of economic decline in scotland gain control over the scottish crown estate and ensure that all profit be keep in scotland devolution have generate million for the scottish public purse with fund go directly to deprive community such as those in the highland why do the scottish people get the benefit from their own water wind and sea resource but the people of wales can not it be simply not credible for the government to continue to say that devolution be too complicated too costly and too time consume these be all issue that can be address with proper planning and resource scotland crown estate be devolve in it be ludicrous to say that the welsh crown estate can not be devolve in similar way in scotland interim measure be put in place to ensure smooth transition from the point of devolution until the implementation of long term framework for manage asset new clause take similar pragmatic approach by introduce transition period it work in scotland it can work for wales too throughout this whole debate the government have still not address the principle of control so would like the minister to answer directly do his government believe that the people of wales should have democratic control over their own natural resource the people of wales certainly believe so polling show that majority support among the welsh public for the devolution of the crown estate be high than ever it be also support by the welsh labour government majority of council in wales have pass motion in support of devolution wrexham council do so just last week with the support of its labour group more council will follow suit and we may very likely have all council in wales declare support for devolution in the near future there be mandate from right across welsh society for devolution member of parliament would do well to remember that they be here to serve and represent the people and that the people of wales have clearly make their view know on this matter in closing return to the principle that outline at the beginning of my speech do member of this house believe that the people of wales should after century of exploitation finally be give the right to control and benefit from their own natural resource if they believe in that principle urge they to join in the voting lobby we live in uncertain time and as nation we face many challenge ahead for one there be russia invasion of ukraine the impact on our domestic energy price have show the extent of our reliance on the international oil and gas market since gas price for household across the country have spike and the cost of living continue to bite putin boot be on our throat another challenge be the result of rapid deindustrialisation across the uk since the and too much economic focus on london and south east england we have see massive job loss at port talbot we face an uncertain future at grangemouth and we still bear the scar of the loss of the mining industry regional inequality be stark and in my constituency of mid and south pembrokeshire the rate of child poverty be steadily increase and of course there be our climate crisis wildfire in california torrential rain in spain and extreme heatwave and long drought even walk through the village of angle in pembrokeshire with member of the local community council it be all too easy to see the increase in frequency of flooding not to mention its damaging impact on resident and local farmer prior to the general election of july my right hon friend the chancellor set out her economic vision of securonomic we would make sell and buy more in britain and so deliver energy security and create good well pay job while tackle the climate crisis my labour colleague and stand for election on that manifesto and it be time to deliver at time when the challenge be so great and the need for leadership be so acute it be vital that the crown estate have great scope to rise to those challenge and do its part for the revitalisation of our great nation the provision in clause that commissioner at the crown estate must keep under review the impact of their activity on the achievement of sustainable development in the united kingdom be therefore to be welcome that amendment be hard fight for by the noble lords in the other place and commend they for it however it be our duty in this house to provide clarity about the meaning and scope of sustainable development and about the mechanism for enforce that provision maintain transparency and accountability be critical for an organisation as big and influential as the crown estate allow the estate to define sustainable development and report annually be move straight out of the environmental social and governance playbook give the financial firepower that this house be grant the crown estate allow it to effectively self regulate on an issue of national importance be dereliction of our democratic duty under amendment the commissioner must have regard to net zero regional economic growth and energy security it would not impede the independence of the crown estate but would provide unambiguous purpose and direction on an otherwise undefined and unexplained term it should therefore be welcome of course key issue for all of we in the united kingdom and certainly for we in northern ireland be the fishing sector any net zero development such as wind farm wind farm have be propose for my constituency in the past could have direct impact on the fishing sector there do the hon gentleman share my concern that the fishing sector could be impact by measure that take away the opportunity to fish in the sea around this united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland to the detriment of those in the sector and their family the fishing industry have great history in my constituency and it be vital that the crown estate take on board the issue in the fishing industry when it look at leasing and consent thank the hon gentleman for that intervention be grateful also to the minister for his assurance in committee that the public framework document will give context to clause on sustainable development however no text have yet be share with this house nor will any be share until after the bill receive royal assent this reduce scrutiny and will encourage retrospective review rather than proactive approach furthermore rely on public framework document reduce this house ability to ensure that the clause be properly enforce what be the mechanism for enforcement in the event of non compliance what if the crown estate fail to report in good faith what would the penalty be off the back of labour resound victory last july we know there be democratic consensus across the nation on our economic vision which promote energy security regional economic growth and net zero yet the crown estate appear to be rely on the window dressing of esg standard to obfuscate its desire to maximise its of profit at the expense of our nation the hon gentleman be make powerful argument and share his concern for community such as milford haven in which renewable development will be critical in future be sure he will also agree that devolution of the crown estate would be key way to make the good use of supply chain and to ensure that money stay as local as possible particularly in wales thank the right hon lady for her intervention sometimes feel though that the idea of her party be slightly for the bird the idea of devolution where be their plan there be no plan what be the practicality thank my friend and constituency neighbour for give way the plan be quite simple we could look at what be happen at this very moment in scotland the issue though be the practicality be the hon gentleman go to draw an artificial line in the celtic sea what about the issue of consent what would that do for the leasing round when certainty of investment for the private sector be so critical at this stage furthermore other government agency and departments have to take account of this economic vision in its late contract for difference round the department for energy security and net zero set criterion of achieve short supply chain in order to ensure that manufacturing facility installation firm and port be locate in area of deprivation it also adhere to science base target which be goal that business set to reduce their greenhouse gas emission in line with obligation under international treaty so that we can reach net zero by the national wealth fund have an overall goal of increase investment in resilient and sustainable infrastructure to support the uk net zero transition and to contribute to improved local economic opportunity and productivity in partnering with the private sector and local government the national wealth fund have two clear strategic objective to tackle climate change and to support regional and local economic growth great british energy facilitate encourage and participate in the production distribution storage and supply of clean energy the reduction of greenhouse gas emission improvement in energy efficiency and measure for ensure the security of energy supply in provide clarity of purpose this house be not overreach and dictate individual organisational decision instead it be set out broad direction of travel base on the democratic will of the people of this great country in my constituency people be desperately in need of that radical intervention to address the high level of social deprivation and bring back economic prosperity to be clear support the bill however in order for this government to deliver on their election manifesto the crown estate must be give clear purpose and direction that be directly align with the prime minister plan for change call the shadow minister it be pleasure to speak on report madam deputy speaker will focus on amendment and new clause and which table the bill be develop under the previous conservative government to increase the crown estate ability to compete by provide broad power to borrow in order to maintain and enhance the value of the estate and the income derive from it the asset manage by the crown estate which total billion be not the property of the government nor be they part of the sovereign private estate they be hold in right of the crown appropriate scrutiny of the crown estate be therefore essential which be what the amendment and new clause have table seek to ensure over the past decade the crown estate generate billion for the nation finance and it believe that the measure in the bill will enable it to generate an additional million in revenue to the treasury by which be prize worth seek before speak to the measure in my name turn briefly to new clause which propose devolution of the welsh function of the crown estate to the welsh government wonder whether the hon member for ynys môn llinos medi have support from business for this change as split the crown estate at this time would introduce risk for asset and revenue stream in committee we hear about the potential problem and complexity of licensing of the celtic sea to which the hon member for mid and south pembrokeshire henry tufnell just refer be very interested to hear the hon gentleman argument against devolve the administration of the crown estate to wales the previous government his government devolve those same power to scotland can ask he very simply why it work for scotland but be too complicated for wales we be deal with the bill in front of we today to do so at the moment would be too complex for the licensing reason and other reason set out in committee which could undermine the return that would be make for taxpayer whether in wales or other part of the country the hon member for mid and south pembrokeshire speak to amendment version of which be move in committee on his behalf we recognise that the amendment have be revise however as say in committee we be cautious about put more obligation on the crown estate than clause already do there be danger of the overreach that he speak about be sure he will be listen to the minister speech with some interest the kernel of the bill be the expansion of the power of the crown estate to borrow but there be lack of parliamentary oversight on borrowing level amendment which appear in my name would limit borrowing to net debt to asset value ratio of no more than which could be amend by affirmative regulation that would believe be proportionate check on this new borrowing power when push in committee the government again state that limit on borrowing be well set outside legislation in memorandum of understanding but memorandum of understanding be all too easily alter at the stroke of pen point the minister do not address in committee will he give an undertaking at the very least that any change to memorandum of understanding would be report to parliament give that parliament be be ask to remove the restriction on borrow and that the government agree there should be limit struggle to see why the cap should not be set in legislation with the ability to amend it borrow more than carry risk which could ultimately affect the sustainability of the estate that be why the government themselves have accept that there should be limit as this new power affect asset hold on behalf of the nation it should be subject to control this would be perfectly reasonable check and hope member will back it new clause would require the crown estate to seek treasury approval for disposal amount to or more of its total asset and then to lay report before parliament disposal of asset have be an important part of the discussion throughout the proceeding on the bill both here and in the other place indeed clause be introduce after pressure to require treasury consent before dispose of any of the crown estate right or privilege in relation to the territorial seabed that be welcome safeguard but can the minister conceive of any circumstance in which the government would approve of such sale can he give commitment that national security would be at the fore in any consideration of such proposal would ministers come to the house before agree to any such disposal in committee the minister state that the current process dictate that the government will be consult on any potential sale of nationally significant asset how do he define nationally significant he also argue that require treasury consent for large disposal would undermine the flexibility that the crown estate need to operate commercially but the propose new clause simply require treasury consent to be seek and then report to parliament the crown estate will not suddenly decide tomorrow to dispose of an asset it will go through its internal process and business case version of those paper could be provide to ministers and depend on the ministers there could be very rapid approval process that do not compromise flexibility but ensure accountability these asset be hold for the benefit of the nation and we should ensure some form of transparency and scrutiny new clause would require the chancellor to lay before parliament any partnership agreement between the crown estate and gb energy that be fundamental as without be able to see detail of the agreement we do not know what have be agree there be lack of clarity over how this new partnership will work we be still concerned that it have be create for political rather than economic reason the opposition be sceptical about what the government say about gb energy because during the election labour claim that gb energy would cut energy bill by but bill be go up the chairman of gb energy have refuse to say when people can expect off their energy bill we know that gb energy will spend billion of taxpayer money but will not generate any energy be an energy supplier or save family we be concerned that at all stage the government have resist great transparency when push on second reading and in committee the exchequer secretary say that while the partnership agreement itself will not be publish since it will be commercially sensitive the crown estate be commit to publish information relate to the partnership as part of its exist annual report however the provision to include that in an annual report could result in considerable lag after such an agreement become operational and in only limited detail be publish frankly that be not good enough which be why we have table new clause transparency be important because we do not know how much the crown estate may invest in gb energy project we do not know what level of fund from this borrowing power could be use for that purpose when ask the crown estate how it would decide between project that gb energy favour and other that may have high rate of return be tell that there would be business plan for the partnership that show further lack of transparency as assume the minister will not place that before the house also ask about decision making for the partnership and the response be the intention be that both party will seek agreement on investment decision whilst retain their own independence the crown estate will not be compel to agree to anything which it do not wish to agree to in fulfilment of its statutory duty note the use of intention and compel there be linger concern that ministers may pressure gb energy and the crown estate to invest in the energy secretary pet project clearly the chairman of gb energy be very close to the labour party and nominate labour party donor as the chairman of the crown estate add to this concern publish the agreement could help allay concern about the government intention if the minister contend that the agreement which do not yet exist be too commercially sensitive will he consider make redact version available as say in committee will he consider provide the agreement to the public accounts committee on confidential basis as former member of that committee know of precedent for that in january the cabinet office provide risk register of strategic supplier to government very sensitive document to that committee which provide assurance on behalf of the house remain concerned about political pressure be put on the crown estate and urge member to support our new clause which would simply require the chancellor to lay the partnership agreement before parliament the crown estate bill will deliver the modernisation of the crown estate our amendment and new clause would ensure appropriate oversight and transparency as it deliver on its primary duty to maintain and enhance the value of the asset and the return for taxpayer it be pleasure to contribute this evening will speak in favour of the bill and address some of the amendment and new clause although there probably be not time to address they all the bill be an important and necessary step to help the government take speedy action to tackle the climate emergency and to help ensure energy security it modernise the management of the crown estate as we have hear which potentially be sleep giant of green energy provision the estate be responsible for vast amount of coastal land and seabed which have enormous potential to deliver wind power and other renewable tackle the climate emergency be significant challenge but it be achievable however we need to step up to the challenge and the bill be part of wide transformation of government policy to do exactly that as we hear in committee the bill be urgently need because although the crown estate have enormous potential the rule govern its management be unduly restrictive for example the crown estate act which govern the estate management of its resource set out rule that would now be deem inappropriate for hold very large cash balance that make it difficult for the crown estate to work with private investor to develop new wind energy and to transmit urgently need new power to the grid there be clear need for these measure hope that after sufficient debate it be time for the bill to make further progress would like to support the minister by briefly point out the inherent error of some of the new clause and amendment new clause seek treasury approval for the disposal of more than of the crown estate asset clearly that would reduce flexibility for the crown estate in manage its estate and business new clause would require the chancellor to lay any partnership agreement between the crown estate and gb energy before parliament however as we have hear partnership agreement be normally commercially sensitive and there could be risk to further business if that be carry out let turn briefly to the amendment amendment which in my opinion be misconstrue would require the commissioner to assess the adequacy of protection against coastal erosion in area affect by their offshore activity however the uk already have whole series of dedicated statutory body in each of the devolve administration that be task with exactly that activity equally amendment be unnecessary it would ask the crown estate when review the impact of its work to consider the impact on net zero target regional economic development and energy security however it be clear that the whole bill be intend to tackle the challenge of address and eventually reach net zero reference specific target risk far complicate what be already an important bill that have have considerable discussion in committee as my right hon friend the chief secretary say at an early stage this be an important bill to help the uk achieve our climate target and it be significant step forward in help we retain energy security it be time for the whole house to support it call the liberal democrat spokesperson extend my thank to colleague in the other place the public bill office staff and those in this house who serve on the bill committee their effort have be invaluable in scrutinise and refine the bill support the bill however the liberal democrat amendment seek to ensure that it deliver for both people and the planet while the bill present opportunity it aim to enhance energy security create new job and bring we close to achieve our climate target we must not lose sight of the need for financial accountability proportionate borrowing cap the duty to protect nature in the marine environment and the necessity of take community with we and provide they with clear tangible benefit it be important to note that our discussion coincide with the third anniversary of russia invasion of ukraine and its consequence not only for the ukrainians suffer the war but for family here in the uk with volatile skyrocket energy price due to our reliance on fossil fuel from authoritarian regime like putin stark reminder of the need to secure the production of our energy here in the uk the last conservative government set the uk back both in meet our climate target and in seize the opportunity to be global leader in green energy due to indecision and broken pledge we have the chance to be global leader in offshore float wind which be why the bill be so important speak to amendment to clause which hope we will vote on tonight it would ensure that sustainable development be clearly define in the crown estate framework agreement explicitly include reference to climate and nature duty the crown estate play crucial role in manage our land sea and natural resource it be central to offshore wind expansion biodiversity conservation and sustainable land use give its influence merely require its commissioner to keep under review their impact on sustainable development be insufficient without clear definition and accountability of what that entail as the hon member for mid and south pembrokeshire henry tufnell mention that be key to ensure that there be social and economic consideration in all investment and that the cost and benefit in particular to local community and local economy be take into consideration the amendment build on baroness hayman concession in the other house she say what matter be the impact we have and how much we have shift the dial in term of what the crown estate achieve in support of the government climate and nature objective official report house of lords november vol by clearly define sustainable development in the crown estate framework agreement the amendment would establish benchmark for accountability in line with exist legislation in contrast with the amendment table by the hon member for mid and south pembrokeshire this amendment mention nature too and build on the agreement in the other house it seek to enshrine the assurance give to the lords ensure that the framework agreement would indeed include climate and nature duty align the crown estate responsibility with the uk legally bind climate target under the climate change act and nature restoration goal under the environment act it be about more than environmental stewardship it be about future proof the crown estate decision against the economic risk of climate change and nature loss strongly support new clause which would ensure that the bill bring local community along with it that be essential we table the new clause to guarantee that coastal and rural community would see real benefit from crown estate activity it would require proper assessment of community benefit before investment decision be make and mandate that at least of net profit be reinveste in affected area coastal community need to see both job and fair financial return from large scale development around they and off their shore the crown estate generate billion from offshore wind marine industry and land development yet local people often see little direct benefit the new clause would redress that imbalance ensure that such community impact by change actively benefit from it it be about fairness and economic regeneration if the government be serious about level up they should back the new clause which would ensure that the crown estate success be share by all not just privileged few we have other amendment too we be busy in committee new clause focus on marine spatial planning co ordination and would ensure that the crown estate duly collaborate with the marine management organisation which have the mandate to make decision about marine spatial planning and that fishing community be fully consult that align with work go on for year as liberal democrats have call for comprehensive land and sea use framework to resolve conflict determine priority and improve co ordination with grow pressure from offshore wind marine conservation fishing and tourism decision making must be join up marine plan balance economic environmental and social interest the crown estate must work closely with the department for environment food and rural affairs marine spatial prioritisation framework and the mmo expertise as well as other relevant consultee such as heritage the government amendment require ministerial approval for seabed sale be an important and positive step recognise its national importance however that highlight the broad need for transparency and oversight in marine planning the new clause seek to avoid potential conflict of interest in prioritising and decision making arise from the crown estate new borrowing and investment power member may have notice theme run through the liberal democrats amendment that of ensure that local community both benefit from and have real say in decision that will affect they as result of the bill that be why we have also table new clause while the appointment of commissioner for wales england and northern ireland be positive step wales still lack the legal and financial control over the crown estate that scotland enjoy welsh community must also stand to benefit from the change introduce by the bill hope that the government and the opposition will join the liberal democrats in support amendment to ensure that sustainable development within the crown estate framework agreement be clearly define and include climate and nature duty the bill present trident of opportunity it can enhance energy security create job and bring we close to achieve our net zero target but we can not afford to lose sight of the need for financial accountability the duty to protect nature and the need to ensure that all community be include in the crucial journey to net zero the bill be not just about number on spreadsheet ultimately for my constituent it be about job opportunity and well future for place like wolverhampton north east right now the crown estate be hold back by outdated rule that limit its ability to invest it be force to sell asset just to raise capital that be not sustainable and it be stop we from reach our full potential the bill change the game give the crown estate the power to borrow invest and back long term project that deliver real benefit for our community wolverhampton north east be ready to seize those opportunity with our forthcoming green innovation corridor world class manufacturing industry and skilled workforce know for its true graft we be perfectly place to drive the uk green economy the bill mean more funding for renewable energy more investment in advanced manufacturing and more demand for the product we make in wolverhampton and willenhall more investment mean more job more apprenticeship and more chance for young people to get the skill they need to build career in the industry of the future whether in engineering fabrication or high tech manufacturing the bill will help we to build more make more and sell more in wolverhampton and willenhall right in the heart of the black country the unprecedented billion partnership between great british energy and the crown estate will supercharge offshore wind development create huge opportunity for our local business this be not just about turbine on land or at sea we know that wolverhampton and willenhall be not geographically suitable for offshore wind but about the supply chain the manufacturing and the innovation that we can drive in town and city like wolverhampton and willenhall just this morning the cbi have say that britain net zero economy be boom the sector be grow three time fast than the overall uk economy the average salary in the net zero sector be high than the national average and productivity in the sector be nearly high than in the wide economy do my hon friend agree that this be an industrial opportunity for this country that we can not afford to ignore and that this bill will help we to realise this opportunity and make it more achievable absolutely agree this be an example of how this government will respond to the change world that we live in this bill be about back british industry invest in local community and make sure that place such as wolverhampton north east lead the way in the uk future success do my hon friend agree that remove these outdated restriction on the crown estate will allow great return for the public purse and benefit all our constituent across the country include her own in wolverhampton and mine in harlow do agree with my hon friend and base on the make up of our constituency we come from different angle from other member who have raise important point in the debate for we it be about job apprenticeship and our local economy so back this bill and hope that the house will join in do so want to speak to amendment table by my hon friend the member for south cambridgeshire pippa heylings which deal specifically with coastal erosion my constituency play host to whole load of energy infrastructure that be vital to our security and our renewable transition we have the bacton energy hub which be on track to make the exciting transformation from be key asset in national gas to hydrogen production and carbon capture it be one of my constituency large employer but it be also of national significance because of the role it play in our energy ecosystem it be therefore understandable that few year ago million sandscaping scheme be welcome it give protection not only to the energy terminal but to the village of bacton and walcott that surround it one local business owner speak of how such scheme mean he no long feel trepidation when he check the weather forecast just down the coast in the village of happisburgh the norfolk boreas and the norfolk vanguard wind farm make their landfall happisburgh have be at the frontline of the coastal erosion suffer in north norfolk with home already lose to the ever encroach north sea this be village battle the real world impact of climate change and it be do its bit to fight back by host renewable energy infrastructure but it have have no additional protection this double standard seem deeply unfair it be in our interest to protect the renewable energy infrastructure we be build but it be also in our interest to protect the community that live alongside it people in happisburgh have live with the loom threat of coastal erosion and frequently feel left behind or forget about and it seem as though this be just another example of this happening be sure that if there be an erosion risk of this scale in central london or the south east the government would move heaven and earth to take action but in north norfolk right at the eastern edge of our island nation people feel despondent about the situation they be face our amendment seek to right this wrong we believe that when these reform to the crown estate allow for new renewable energy product effort must be make to secure the coastline where they make landfall renewable be our future and we have to make sure that the community that host key infrastructure have future too be aware that the minister do not support this amendment in committee be not expect the recess to have lead he to damascene conversion but hope that he can provide some reassurance today on how the government will look at this double standard for energy product and what step they will be take to provide protection to village such as happisburgh that be do all the right thing but feel they do not get their fair share back would also be happy to welcome he and any of his government colleague to happisburgh to see the situation for themselves honestly believe that bear witness to the way that our coastline be be ravage by climate change meet the people it affect and understand what we be set to lose will spark anyone into support radical action to stop this come to pass would be delighted if the government could back our amendment today but if they be unable to do so hope that the minister team will be able to provide promise of progress for the resident of happisburgh and all the other community who live with the existential threat of coastal erosion be on the bill committee and have follow the bill throughout mainly because represent truro and falmouth which have huge potential to benefit from float offshore wind with falmouth dock and our position in the celtic sea if the build out in the celtic sea be do quickly and do well our young people will benefit from good well pay job in strong local supply chain also want to mention the cbi report publish today which show how the green economy have grow three time fast and have high wage than the national average across the board we in falmouth could really do with some of that so welcome this bill the change to the power of the crown estate will enable it in partnership with gb energy to invest in port such as falmouth without sell its asset as well as map the seabed and front load the leasing round and local supply chain as say in an early debate when college in my constituency be struggle to get funding for level course on float offshore wind engineering for local to year old the crown estate step in with year funding to allow it to go ahead on pilot scale now with these change more positive intervention like this could be make which would be really welcome in place such as truro and falmouth where further education college be struggle to get the go ahead for these kind of course new clause deal with marine spatial planning we need spatial strategy for the ocean that link energy fishing and nature restoration and that have to be do in consultation with all the industry and with environmentalist but this bill be not the place to do that new clause deal with community benefit community will benefit so much from the economic boost that this bill will enable with training and education good job supply chain and investment in our port amendment and cover issue that we discuss in the bill committee would simply ask the minister to give an assurance that the public framework will have regard to environmental regional and economic growth and social value benefit and to confirm that this reform will enable the crown estate to invest in wide range of high impact project across the uk strengthen float offshore wind nature recovery and benefit to those regional economy the partnership between the crown estate and gb energy have real potential to be huge force for good we really feel that down in cornwall it will spearhead the development of offshore renewable energy in speedy but sustainable way invest in energy production initially and lay the groundwork for our energy security of the future as well as build our local community our infrastructure and our supply chain in some of the most leave behind and deprived part of the uk rise to speak in support of new clause and to express my party frustration with the government refusal thus far to devolve the crown estate to wales it be the firm view of the liberal democrats both here in westminster and in the senedd that this decision be wrong for wales and its economy under the current system the profit generate from wales vast natural resource flow directly to the uk treasury offer no benefit to the community where that wealth be create the crown estate in wales be set to generate million annually from offshore wind energy lease in welsh water if this money be keep within wales it could contribute an estimate additional million to the welsh government budget at time when public service in wales be crumble it be nothing short of outrageous that the labour government in westminster seek to deny wales these vital source of income which could help to address the crisis in our public service economy and infrastructure the labour government refusal to devolve these power far entrench the outrageous notion by labour and the conservatives that wales be less nation than scotland while scotland have control its crown estate since wales despite have vast crown estate asset within its border have be leave without those power the benefit of devolution for scotland have be clear with the scottish crown estate generate over million for the public finance since the excuse we have hear from the uk government for fail to put wales on an equal footing simply do not hold up patronise comment from ministers about how devolve the crown estate would not be in wales good interest or would be waste of time be frankly an insult to the people of wales this government claim to support growth but they seem determined to keep wales from reach its full potential instead of empower welsh community to harness the benefit of their own resource profit continue to flow directly to london that be not the vision of growth to benefit local community or level up leave behind community it be continuation of the conservatives fail economic model which prioritise centralisation and investment in the south east of england over everywhere else it would be great mistake if those in power in westminster be to deny wales the opportunity to build well future for our community hope the government will change their mind wish to primarily address new clause table by the hon member for belfast south and mid down claire hanna and for ynys môn llinos medi and to express opposition to it it very much reflect what be in new clause in term of seek devolution of the crown estate but in this case to the northern ireland executive in respect of the asset there oppose that for number of reason it presently be reserved matter and strongly believe that be how it should stay say that not because that be right ideologically but because practically it be beyond belief that the current stormont executive could ever handle the controversy that come with the crown estate this be an executive in stormont that have be in existence for almost month and still can not agree programme for government if we be to hand they something as controversial as control of the crown estate we all know what the outcome would be why be it controversial for one specific and historical reason lough foyle be control and own by the crown estate it be piece of water that separate county londonderry which be in northern ireland from county donegal which be in the republic of ireland but the entirety of lough foyle since last we have king charles rest under british control in charles ii gift lough foyle the surround water the seabed and the water within it to the irish society the irish society be conglomerate of various company from the city of london which do great deal to develop and build the city of londonderry and as part of that presume it be gifted control over lough foyle in the irish society convey lough foyle to the crown estate divided executive in northern ireland would be hopelessly incapable of resolve the issue that flow from the somewhat controversial aspect of the entirety of lough foyle right up to the coastline of county donegal be properly legally and in perpetuity in the control of the crown estate therefore devolve the crown estate to the northern ireland executive would be disastrous for the good management of the lough and for the uncontroversial continuance of its ability to be develop that might be particular situation but it be in addition to my opposition from an ideological point of view and my belief that the crown estate be national asset that should continue to be of reserve category think the proposition in new clause would be the utmost folly trust that the government will resist it and that the house will reject it it be pleasure to contribute to the debate will follow on from what the hon and learn member for north antrim jim allister seek want to make specific request which do when intervene on the hon member for mid and south pembrokeshire henry tufnell my issue with the provision primarily relate to the fishing sector and the impact on fishing fleet around the whole of the united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland but particularly in strangford for portavogie and ardglass and kilkeel in south down appreciate the opportunity to speak on an issue that affect crown estates in the entirety of the united kingdom as the library briefing outline the crown estate focus on activity that align with wide national need include energy security and sustainable economic growth it manage the seabed and much of the coastline across england wales and northern ireland play fundamental role in the sustainable development of this national asset include the uk world lead offshore wind sector be not against wind turbine and the green energy they produce but be concern about the impact on the fishing sector want to state my concern and express my support for the fishing fleet at portavogie ardglass and kilkeel where fishing be an important economic sector provide job and investment that have be happen for hundred of year and want to see that tradition maintain hope that when the minister sum up he will reassure fishing community that any development will not be to the detriment of the fishing sector do the hon member agree that one of the problem in this territory be that we do not yet have the definition of what be mean to be sustainable on read the bill it appear that the whole focus of what sustainable will be be on the green energy side rather than what will sustain the fishing industry that be the thrust of where be come from be not against the idea of green energy but want to ensure the sustainability of the fishing sector over the year it have be sustainable and still provide job in kilkeel and ardglass and want it to continue to do so that would be my concern as well the fisherman in my area be well aware of the limitation bring about by crown holding on the coastline and concern have be express to regard the partnership announce by the government for the crown estate and great british energy the very issue that the hon and learn member for north antrim refer to to bring forward new offshore wind development wholeheartedly welcome renewable energy and attempt to harness the reliable energy of our vast sea and lough but only inasmuch as they do not stop the fishing sector from operate and be successful that must always be the key consideration if we be to lose one of our primary sector in fishing and to gain wind turbine and green energy that would be something that the government would have to consider sensibly similarly the regeneration and development department in my local ards and north down council have highlight the additional red tape that come from lease or alter exist lease to the crown estate that be say the council be also thankful for the open door and accessibility when need however it have be see that there be willingness to consider the national need when request be make for alteration and that be appreciate when we look at the national need we want to ensure that they do not take away from the local need of those in strangford in ards and north down and in the fishing fleet and those who own land and farm around the irish sea and strangford lough during the crown estate generate net revenue profit of billion over the past decade it have return billion of net revenue profit to the treasury we must ensure that the crown estate be be run at ultimate capacity and be bring money into our coffer but also that it have socially conscious operating model and that it be be use to do good for everyone include the fishing sector in my constituency be very much inspire as we probably all be by the prince of wales scheme on homelessness and by the fact that he be use his personal estate the duchy of cornwall to build home to help tackle homelessness the construction of the first home in nansledan newquay be due to be complete in autumn that good work should inspire we all to ensure that crown estate operate by team appoint by the prime minister attempt where it can to make such an impact for the common good my understanding be that the bill would broaden the scope of activity that the crown estate can undertake to support the delivery of its core purpose to include activity across net zero nature recovery economic growth that cover the fishing sector and more so that it can generate return for the public purse the bill will also enable the crown estate to invest in capital intensive project more effectively if that be the case will support the bill as long as we remember our obligation to exist business and partnership include in the fishing and industrial sector welcome the appointment of commissioner who will have an eye over northern ireland will the minister reassure the hon and learn member for north antrim and other affected northern ireland members that elect representative can have direct contact and discussion with the commissioner on any fishing sector issue that come to our attention welcome the progress of the crown estate and recognise the benefit that will come from improvement but none of that can be do on the back of exist relationship the minister be an honourable man we know that he have set out to help we and reassure we on many thing although for the record there have not be too much reassurance lately seek assurance for the fishing sector in strangford and in south down give that the member of parliament for that constituency do not even attend parliament find myself with the duty to work on behalf of the fishing fleet in ardglass and kilclief the fishing fleet be all in the boat together to use pun and all need help if the minister can reassure we he may go some way towards reassure the fishing sector which be not quite sure yet about what be happen call the minister thank all hon member who have contribute to the debate and provide further detail about their amendment or concern start by make it clear that the government have carefully consider all amendment throughout the passage of the bill where we have agree with the intent behind an amendment we have work hard to find an appropriate way forward that be evidence in the change make by this house to ensure appropriate protection for our seabed as result of change make to the bill the crown estate will now be require to seek the approval of the treasury for any permanent disposal of the seabed thank the opposition for constructive debate on that matter alongside that further change make in the other place have help to strengthen the bill include change to require the appointment of commissioner with special responsibility for give advice about england wales and northern ireland reporting requirement in respect of activity with great british energy and requirement relate to sustainable development in that spirit have consider the amendment that be before we thank the hon member for ynys môn llinos medi for table new clause under which within two year of the day on which the act commence the treasury must have complete the transfer of responsibility for management of the crown estate in wales to the welsh government it would allow the treasury by regulation to make provision about the transfer relate to reserved matter as necessary and would require it to ensure that no person in crown employment have their employment adversely affect by the transfer of responsibility also thank the hon member for south cambridgeshire pippa heylings for table new clause to which her colleague the hon member for brecon radnor and cwm tawe david chadwick also speak it would require the treasury to set out scheme for transfer all welsh function of the crown estate commissioner to welsh ministers or person nominate by welsh ministers the welsh function would consist of the property right or interest in land in wales and right in relation to the welsh zone as set out in committee the government believe that there be great benefit for the people of wales and the wide united kingdom in retain the crown estate current form new clause would most likely require the creation of new entity to take on the management of the crown estate in wales an entity that by definition would not benefit from the crown estate current substantial capability capital and system ability it would far fragment the uk energy market by add an additional entity and as consequence it would risk damage international investor confidence in uk renewable it would also risk disrupt the national energy system operator grid connectivity reform which be take whole system approach to the planning of generation and network infrastructure those reform aim to create more efficient system and reduce the time it take for generation project to connect to the grid be grateful to the minister for outline his concern about devolve the crown estate to the welsh government he list number of they be right in say that he believe that the devolution of power from the crown estate to scotland have fragment the market and be in some way to the disbenefit of people in scotland the matter that we be consider today through the two new clause that have mention be the proposal by opposition party for devolution to wales we be not analyse what may have happen in scotland historically we be look at the proposal put to we in those new clause which be address to be clear the cumulative impact of the change that the hon member for ynys môn be suggest in her new clause would likely be to significantly delay the pathway to net zero the minister say that the bill would be beneficial to the people of wales as it stand could he quantify that benefit please if the right hon member wait just moment will come to some of the direct benefit for the people of wales of retain the crown estate in its current form it be important to emphasise that the crown estate marine investment be make on portfolio wide basis across england and wales devolve to wales would disrupt exist investment as they would need to be restructure to accommodate welsh specific entity to devolve the crown estate at this time would risk jeopardise the pipeline of offshore wind development in the celtic sea which be plan for into the the crown estate offshore wind lease round be spread across the english and welsh administrative boundary in the celtic sea it be launch in february last year and be expect to contribute gw of total energy capacity enough to power million home in addition to energy the extensive job and supply chain requirement of round will also likely deliver significant benefit for wales and the wide united kingdom lumen an advisory firm to the crown estate have estimate that manufacturing transport and assemble the wind farm could potentially create around job and billion boost for the uk economy devolution would also delay uk wide grid connectivity reform the crown estate be use its datum and expertise as manager of the seabed to feed into the national energy system operator new strategic spatial energy plan on wales the crown estate be work in partnership with the energy system operator to ensure that its pipeline of welsh project the big of which be the round offshore wind opportunity in the celtic sea can benefit from this co ordinate approach to grid connectivity up front if devolution present such enormous barrier why be the government choose to put the headquarters of great british energy in scotland gb energy be for the benefit of the whole of the uk it be absolutely right to locate its headquarters in aberdeen give the strong connection between aberdeen and use of the asset of the north sea to generate power for the entire united kingdom in fact the hon gentleman example underline my point which be that when different part of the united kingdom work together we can achieve more than we can separately thank he for endorse my point it would not make commercial sense to introduce new entity with control of asset only within wales into complex operating environment in which partnership have already be form furthermore the crown estate asset and interest in wales be fundamentally small than its asset in england and would likely not be commercially viable if their cost be unsupported by the wide crown estate portfolio the crown estate can take long term approach to its investment and spread the cost of investment across its entire portfolio self contain single entity in wales would not have the same ability neither would it benefit from the expertise that the crown estate have develop over decade of deliver offshore wind at scale devolved entity would be start from scratch the minister have just tell the house that wales be too small and poor to benefit from the devolution of the crown estate that be an extraordinary argument and be sure that the welsh government will share my amazement have he discuss that with his partner in welsh labour think the right hon member have misunderstand the point be make if we be to have devolve entity it would be start from scratch midway through multimillion pound commercial tendering process just at time when the crown estate be undertake critical investment in the uk path towards net zero something be sure she be keen to support the commercial viability of all three gw float offshore wind project development area in the celtic sea which straddle the english and welsh administrative boundary benefit from the crown estate significant investment of time expertise and capital which enable their entry into the market uk float offshore wind an emerge offshore technology that the crown estate be support would be particularly vulnerable to market disruption it be important to underline that income generate by the whole crown estate benefit the people of wales as have note the crown estate pay its entire net profit into the uk consolidated fund each year that mean that much of the revenue already support public service in wales either by support uk government spending in reserved area or through the funding provide under the barnett formula and the welsh government block grant funding as mention in committee the barnett formula be not fair formula for wales in the scottish model million be take out of the block grant but those community receive million back think that be fair exchange do the minister not agree the hon member have highlight that the change make in scotland lead to reduction in the block grant to scotland the focus of the new clause be the proposal to devolve crown estate capability to wales as be set out that would not make commercial sense when it come to advance great energy capacity or when it come to increase the crown estate net profit which be of course reinveste in public service right across wales and other part of the uk draw member attention to the fact that in the other place the government support the inclusion of clause which require the appointment of commissioner responsible for give advice about england wales and northern ireland that will ensure that the crown estate board of commissioner continue to work in the good interest of wales seek assurance that the ambitious net zero target will not detrimentally affect the fishing sector remember some year ago there be talk of wind farm just off the coast of kilkeel and the fisherman be concerned that it would be in one of their prime fishing sector where scallop be plentiful if that continue the fishing sector could lose out because the government decide to push for net zero seek reassurance that northern ireland mp would be able to contact the northern ireland commissioner directly but ask specifically for wide assurance about the fishing sector in northern ireland for portavogie ardglass and kilkeel thank the hon gentleman for his intervention about the impact on the fishing sector and can reassure he that the crown estate be commit to the sustainable management of the seabed as with any developer the crown estate proposal go through the standard planning approval process which include the relevant environmental assessment under the crown estate strategy it have an objective to take leading role in stewarde the natural environment and biodiversity key to deliver on that aim be manage the seabed in way that reduce pressure on and accelerate recovery of our marine environment of course the bill will not impact directly on how much commercial fishing take place in area manage by the crown estate point out that the inclusion of clause in the bill in the other place provide for the appointment of commissioner responsible for give advice about england wales and northern ireland the requirement to give advice to the board about wales will be alongside the commissioner exist duty that change will strengthen the crown estate ability to deliver benefit for the whole uk hon member may not agree with the point have make but hope that have set out clearly why the government believe that the exist structure remain the good approach and hope that hon member will feel that they do not need to press their new clause to vote new clause which be table by the hon member for south cambridgeshire would require the crown estate to ensure that any decision about marine spatial priority be co ordinated with the priority of the marine management organisation and to consult any community or industry impact by the plan include fishing community confirm that the crown estate and the marine management organisation already have well establish way of work together to ensure effective collaboration for marine spatial planning and prioritisation the crown estate collaboration with the marine management organisation and other relevant statutory body be govern by the marine and coastal access act the act establish the framework for marine planning and licensing in the uk and it require the crown estate to have regard to marine policy document such as marine plan in its decision making the work of the crown estate be also govern by the habitat regulation which require it to conduct plan level habitat regulation assessment for leasing or licensing activity furthermore in the crown estate and the marine management organisation jointly agree statement of intent which be review periodically to provide focus on priority and opportunity for alignment that statement of intent complement memorandum of understanding agree in february which set out framework to encourage co operation between party in relation to the sustainable development of the seabed and right manage by the crown estate we will not be press this new clause to vote but the new investment and borrowing power change the context for the memorandum of understanding ask for reassurance that we might seek new memorandum of understanding between the marine management organisation and the crown estate thank the hon member for her intervention as say the crown estate and the marine management organisation agree the statement of intent in and it be review periodically to focus on priority and opportunity for alignment that may provide an opportunity for review in due course to ensure that it meet current aim in addition to the crown estate relationship with the marine management organisation there be various regulatory requirement on developer who lease area of the seabed from the crown estate to engage with the marine management organisation themselves those include requirement through marine licensing developer must obtain marine licence from the marine management organisation for activity that could impact on the marine environment that process involve consultation with statutory body and adherence to marine plan policy as part of marine licence application developer must conduct environmental impact assessment for project that could significantly alter the environment that include consultation with the marine management organisation and other relevant authority developer be furthermore encourage to engage with local community statutory body and other stakeholder throughout the planning and development process to address concern and ensure compliance with marine plan welcome the indication from the hon member for south cambridgeshire that she feel able to withdraw the new clause and hope have go some way to address the point that she make new clause which be also table by the hon member would require the commissioner to assess plan for benefit to local community and coastal community in respect of offshore activity before make any investment decision it would also require the commissioner to transfer at least of the crown estate net profit to local community impact by its activity as set out in committee local community benefit economically from onshore and offshore development for example through job creation and increase business for local supplier local community will also benefit in the long term as the country transition away from volatile fossil fuel market towards clean domestically produce power enhance britain energy independence and security as highlight in committee the crown estate have specifically design the leasing process for its offshore wind lease round in the celtic sea to require developer to make commitment to deliver social and environmental value tender bidder must think about how their development can encourage healthy more resilient and more prosperous community create last benefit that extend beyond the lifetime of wind farm lease those commitment will be monitor report on and enforce throughout the lifetime of the relevant round development as have lay out before the crown estate be commit to proactively work with local community and partner to enable employment and skill opportunity as mention in committee it have invest million through the supply chain accelerator to stimulate green job and develop green skill pipeline it be support development in the skill we need for the future through measure that range from gcse in engineering skill for offshore wind seed fund by the crown estate and develop with cornwall college to destination renewable course with pembrokeshire college it be also partner with the employment charity workwhile to create green construction apprenticeship the crown estate already work closely with community charity business and the government to ensure that its skill initiative be sensitive to market demand and emerge technology while respect the concern reflect in new clause the government consider it important that the crown estate retain flexibility in how its skill initiative be fund and deliver that enable it to contribute to skill training in the good possible way while importantly not conflict with its statutory duty to maintain and enhance the value of the estate on that basis hope that the hon member for south cambridgeshire feel able to withdraw the new clause new clause seek to limit the ability of the crown estate to dispose of asset without treasury approval by require it to seek consent for disposal of asset total or more of its total asset in single year it would also require the chancellor to lay report before parliament within day of be notify of disposal above that threshold as the government have set out both in committee and in the other place in our view impose limit on disposal would undermine the flexibility need to enable the crown estate to operate commercially and meet its core duty under the act it be important to emphasise that the bill be not intend materially to alter the independence of the crown estate require the treasury to approve the crown estate ordinary business transaction which may well be catch by the new clause would encroach on the independence of the crown estate that be inconsistent with the government vision for the crown estate the hon member for north west norfolk james wild have concern that the crown estate could choose to sell off critical or significant asset indeed he raise that point in committee reassure the house that strong safeguard be already in place to ensure that the crown estate maintain and enhance the estate the first be legislative safeguard namely the statutory duty on the crown estate to maintain and enhance the value of the estate and the return obtain from it while have due regard to the requirement of good management those be set out in the crown estate act and will remain unchanged by the bill the second be requirement set out in the framework document that govern the relationship between the treasury and the crown estate that document be clear that the crown estate should inform the treasury of any matter concern spending income or finance that be novel contentious or repercussive the government view be that that capture any propose sale of nationally significant asset point the shadow minister raise recognise that he may not agree but hope he understand the government position on the matter and as result feel able to withdraw his new clause the shadow minister also table new clause which would require the chancellor to lay before parliament any partnership agreement between the crown estate and great british energy as make clear in committee partnership agreement be highly commercially sensitive it be therefore right that any agreement be not make public or lay before parliament as to do so would likely prejudice the commercial interest of the crown estate or great british energy hope the hon member feel that he do not need to push the new clause to vote will consider amendment and together to try to make progress as speedily as can madam deputy speaker they would impose legislative limit on the amount of borrowing that could be undertake by the crown estate and both would require the government to introduce affirmative regulation set out borrowing limit of no more than net debt to asset value ratio thank hon member for their contribution on this matter the government recognise that borrowing control be an important consideration for the bill as such the government make available the crown estate business case as well as the underpin memorandum of understanding which set out the guardrail that will protect against uncontrolled or excessive borrowing the key principle be whether specific limit should be set in legislation as have set out previously it remain the government view that limit on borrowing be well set outside of legislation in memorandum of understanding have listen to the point make by the hon member for north west norfolk that limit outside legislation can be easily change but reassure the house that the bill have be carefully draft to include strong control specifically the requirement for treasury consent alongside that the exist requirement for the crown estate to maintain and enhance the value of the estate while have due regard for the requirement of good management be maintain take together those element provide clear guardrail around the ability of the crown estate to borrow amendment table by the hon member for south cambridgeshire would require any framework document publish by the chancellor of the exchequer the crown estate or the commissioner to define sustainable development that definition would be require to include reference to climate and nature duty which would mean duty to achieve any target set out under part of the climate change act or under section to of the environment act as set out in committee the government understand the intention behind amendment but key purpose of the act be to repeal various detailed statutory provision that have build up over the previous year which be hamper the effective management of the estate by focus the commissioner duty on enhance the estate value and the return generate the commissioner have clear objective on which they can be hold to account it be an important principle that give an organisation too many objective will make it far less effective than give it clear and focused priority and as set out in committee the crown estate be commercial business independent from government that operate for profit that mandate be unchanged by the be get vibe from the whip madam deputy speaker so might not respond as fully as have hop to some of the remain amendment however will address amendment which know matter to several labour members who have speak to it amendment table by my hon friend the member for mid and south pembrokeshire henry tufnell would require the commissioner when keep the impact of their activity under review with respect to clause to have regard to the uk net zero target regional economic growth and resilience of energy security thank my hon friend for the discussion that he and have on this topic both before committee and last week version of the amendment be debate in committee particularly thank my hon friend the members for truro and falmouth jayne kirkham for st austell and newquay noah law and for camborne and redruth perran moon for engage with on this matter and set out so clearly what be important to they in the constituency they represent although understand the sentiment behind my hon friend amendment it be perhaps helpful to set out the context behind clause the clause be support by the government in the other place as it seek to clarify and enhance the accountability of the crown estate to deliver on environmental social and economic outcome clause will require the commissioner to keep under review the impact of their activity on the achievement of sustainable development in the united kingdom emphasise that the public framework document which govern the relationship between the crown estate and the treasury will be update in light of that clause and will include definition of sustainable development as have set out several time the crown estate will continue to include information on its activity in its annual report which be lay before parliament the government intention throughout the passage of the bill have be to ensure that it can stand the test of time without need for regular update that in part be why the term sustainable development be adopt hope have address some of the concern raise by hon member although regret be not able to address all the amendment with quite the level of detail have hop as make clear early the government have carefully consider all amendment throughout the passage of the bill and hope that hon member will understand the approach we be take thank my hon friend the members for read central matt rodda for wolverhampton north east mrs brackenridge for harlow chris vince and for rushcliffe james naish for powerfully set out the benefit that the crown estate and measure in the bill will provide to people in their constituency and across the country hope all hon member will understand the approach we be take and support our targeted and measure change to ensure that the crown estate be able to operate independently commercially and in the national interest diolch madam dirprwy lefarydd the government have try to explain how devolution and the creation of welsh crown estate would undermine investor confidence but that have not be the case for the devolve scottish crown estate which have raise million from offshore wind investment since devolved crown estate could lead to great alignment and integration with the economy in wales as have be the case in scotland with well manage transition there be no evidence that disruption would occur devolution would also offer opportunity to strengthen the role of the local supply chain to be use and to actually see the job that the government claim will be create for the people of wales remind hon member that it be project that child poverty number will reach in wales in five year time at the end of this decade but the joseph rowntree foundation say that the forecast in scotland be refer hon member to the word of former secretary of state for wales lord peter hain he recently say that oppose devolution of the crown estate reflect old centralised conservative anti devolution whitehall thinking official report house of lords october vol labour promise we that labour government in wales and labour government in westminster would benefit the people of wales this labour government do not show any ambition for the people of wales and ask every member who want to see

of the environmental audit morden on behalf of the committee of selection bank closure rural areas motion make and question propose that this house do now smith we now have the enjoyable prospect of an adjournment debate last an hour and half which know will fill the minister with joy can see the boyish smile on his face he just can not contain himself do not intend to take an hour and half although number of colleague from across the house have indicate that they wish to intervene be very pleased to have secure this debate it be clear that our banking world be go through period of transition there be change in technology there be the move some would say at too high speed towards soon to be cashless society and there be the cost of run branch which include insurance business rate staff cost and the like know full well that the closure of high street bank hit an area hard whether the area be urban or rural however north dorset be rural constituency and the thrust of my thesis be that the impact be feel disproportionately hard in rural community than in an urban setting why do say that do not believe that north dorset be unique in how it operate interruption heckle from the cheap seat our market town operate on hub and speak model the market town grow and the village be magnetise towards it which be good for business large and small across the sector as we all recognise it be also good for community cohesion at time when we be all rightly concerned about rural exclusion and isolation it bring people together our rural area by accident rather than by design contain disproportionately high number of retired or elderly people will the hon gentleman give way will although the hon gentleman be neither retired nor elderly the hon gentleman be very kind commend he on bring forward this debate he be right to highlight elderly people social isolation be an issue for many people not just those who be elderly or vulnerable and it be worsen by the loss of basic banking the hon gentleman tell before the debate that he have lose bank have lose bank in my constituency in northern ireland which mean that go to the bank become an all day job take bus and make connection do he agree that there be moral obligation on bank to ensure that they look after their customer indeed if the bank do not do it under moral obligation do he think it be time for the minister to make legislation to make it legal obligation agree will certainly come on to what be ask the government to consider but the hon gentleman be right to talk about social isolation we have lose bank in my constituency since in square mile we have five bank remain we have have fall of across the county of dorset which include the major conurbation of bournemouth christchurch and poole we have have decrease of overall with branch close and only remain in the whole of the county eight parliamentary constituency be serve by just bank my constituent deborah jones make good point in response to recent announcement by lloyds that it be close its branch in blandford forum market town in my constituency with large village hinterland with the exception of nationwide it now have no proper traditional high street branch the hon member mention nationwide my understanding be that town in the uk do not have bank and many be leave only with building society it seem that the bank have exit while the building society have stay behind would appreciate his thought on what that say about the lack of community cohesion as result of lose those bank often we be lose post office at the same time the hon lady be right she allow to pause to pay tribute to the post office and to member of the association of convenience stores which have step in to provide some level of service in those area where the bank have go that bring to one of my key ask of the bank and the minister as well yet again rubric seem to be use to argue in favour of closure that be blind to whether it be an urban or rural setting that differential need to be take into account will my hon friend give way will but just want to make the point that be well make by my constituent in her email she be customer of lloyds in blandford and she do online banking but during the storm her digital service be down she need to do some important banking and have no way of do it she ask how her year old mother in law who no long drive and do not use the internet or have mobile phone be to contact her bank at the moment she be take into blandford every wednesday for shopping and can pop into the bank what will she do she be very independent lady and not ready to hand over all her affair to family member just because they have internet access number of organisation have draw attention to that issue such as age uk in but before get to that give way to my right hon friend congratulate my hon friend on secure this important debate in leek in my constituency we be about to lose our last two bank we will be leave with building society with cashpoint and the post office yet link have do review suggest that we do not need banking hub because there be sufficient branch or mile away that do not take account of rurality we be market town with as he rightly describe hub and speak model and it simply be not possible for elderly people to get to those other bank branch that be not easily accessible and be not on bus route do he agree that rurality and topography be incredibly important and should be consider when decide on banking hub my right hon friend be absolutely right when bank close in my constituency on an early occasion remember it tell if customer need to talk to an actual person they could use the branch in poole explain that that be right but it would take two day out of the week because those customer would have to get bus to poole book hotel stay over and get the return bus the follow day it do sound little bit nonsensical be therefore grateful to my right hon friend for underline the point that be seek to make there must be rural proofing of the rubric for these decision in the first instance and well understanding of the geography of our rural area as well as of the lack of public transport or other connectivity between the two place it be easy dare say it if one represent ealing where the minister be from there be plenty of bus and tube and heaven know what else that have no doubt will take the people around ealing north dorset do not have those thing and nor do many of our rural area but just do not think that point be recognise by the bank rise rise let make little progress and will give way first to my hon friend and then to the hon gentleman at the heart of everything this place do we must think about social inclusion and try to deliver service that meet the need of wide range of our population accord to age uk four in adult over the age of do not bank online and three quarter of those who be over have express the very clear desire that they wish to bank in person the people with disability and those on low income disproportionately want physical facility and yet they be be deny they as the royal national institute of blind people point out in my constituency alone there be think constituent who be either blind or partially sight they be unable to conduct banking online why be we exclude they from the personal management of their financial affair congratulate my hon friend on obtain this debate which have attract large number of colleague he have touch nerve may enter plea on behalf of coastal town such as harwich which suffer exactly the same difficulty as somewhere like blandford forum in harwich the tsb have close down and the halifax have close down and that be affect business in the town business need banking hub the government have really get to come up with solution and single hub represent all these financial institution must be able to provide some kind of efficiency very much look forward to hear my hon friend proposal be grateful to my hon friend his constituency and indeed lot of our coastal community will have that profile of constituent that be old and more settled and they will want to see thing deliver in the way that they be use to that do not mean that they shun change completely but they do have legitimate expectation let take the house briefly through the timeline narrative of justification and then will give way to the hon member for middlesbrough south and east cleveland luke myer you and madam deputy speaker as part of that great tory intake of those be the day it be nearly year will remember be tell that there would never be town without bank will my hon friend give way on that point let just finish this point that be the first promise but it seem to disappear quite quickly then the post office come in and then there seem to be an over reliance on build society notice that nationwide think it be nationwide could be wrong be say in its television advertisement that it pledge not to close branch before but it be under exactly the same cost and other pressure as its high street competitor then we be tell that the answer to the maiden prayer be go to be the banking hub but there have be quite lot of disappointment surround that suggest to the minister that that be in part to do with the erroneous conflation of access to cash and access to banking service link have assess perfectly properly that in blandford there be atm at the local tesco at the local morrison and at nationwide but just try ask an atm to amend or set up standing order or direct debit small businessman or businesswoman who want to extend their line of credit or have question mark over something can not ask an atm those question say that there be access to cash as important as that is be far too blunt an instrument when try to assess the impact of these closure north dorset be quite far away from the north east but many of the issue the hon gentleman be talk about be issue that be encounter in my constituency as well the rural side of my constituency in east cleveland contain many village and town with high deprivation and high rurality and be endeavour to get banking hub in one of those town that have lose access to bank over many year do he agree that deprivation need to be include as metric alongside rurality agree absolutely more sensitive and refined definition of the hub and speak model be also need if we look at the resident catchment of market town we can construct compelling argument that proposal for hub do not stack up but we must add in the thousand of people who live in the village that look to it and be magnetise to it and who will spend more money in those business and the business themselves not just individual who use those business will the hon gentleman give way let give way to my hon friend from surrey and then will give way to the hon lady would not like to claim that be the member of parliament for the whole of surrey my hampshire resident would not be pleased about that just last friday the barclays bank in farnham close leave the whole of my constituency of people with just one bank santander and one building society nationwide we be lucky enough to have banking hub in haslemere and we be go to get another one in whitehill and bordon liphook do not have one but give that there be only banking hub across the country and that the government say they be go to put forward do my hon friend agree that the government be go to have to turbocharge those banking hub not just for access to cash but more especially as he mention for proper banking service for resident in rural constituency agree entirely with my hon friend who represent surrey and part of hampshire would be happy for the minister to write to on this point if it be easy but it strike that there be scope for little bit of wiggle room with regard to the financial services and markets act the act do not give the financial conduct authority power to reflect on and assess wide banking service the minister party when in opposition be very keen that it should do so when my party be in government for some unknown reason we resist amendment to that effect and labour then in opposition do not push they to division just think that there be too gap lacuna in all of this in that it be only access to cash that be assess and not access to banking service will my hon friend give way let give way to the hon member for north shropshire helen morgan then will give way to my hon friend the hon gentleman be make an excellent speech outline the issue in north shropshire four of my five market town have lose all their bank and only two of they will get banking hub do he agree that we need to look at much wide area to make those banking hub work because people who work in small hamlet and village without access to public transport simply can not access one that be maybe mile away the hon lady be absolutely right again hope that any of the bank or regulator who may listen in or read the report will understand that this be not an issue that divide by party it affect constituent across the country irrespective of which party represent they in this place the key point be to have proper assessment of rurality and the differential of live in rural area compare with an urban area commend the government for their support for hub but they need to be more physical and robust in drive they forward it be almost as if the bank be mark their own homework as to whether the argument in favour of hub stack up as sarah coles of hargreaves lansdown comment year or so ago the closure of bank branch be vicious circle the more that close the more people move online of course by definition the more people move online the more that almost hollow out the argument to justify create hub understand that initially the bank be slightly reticent just as the mobile phone operator be about share mast that somehow client would be pinch and all the rest of it but the hub be shared facility jointly finance by the bank those bank need to remember that they be still in business principally due to the good will of the british taxpayer and the exchequer during the financial crash of who keep our banking sector afloat they owe little bit of payback as number of my constituent have be keen to point out the hub seem to work and fill that gap but as say mark one own homework and set the rubric to decide whether hub will work be not right the treasury could take more engaged and proactive leadership role on the matter thank my hon friend for secure this important and timely debate certainly spend lot of my recess look at banking hub especially in town call ellon in my constituency which have recently lose its last bank ellon be large town of over people and if the surround village be include it be get up towards people however it do not qualify for banking hub link have not give its permission to have banking hub say that there be not enough business in the town it do not take into account for example the farming business and the rural nature of the area as we have touch on be not take into account in the criterion set out by link be glad that my hon friend mention the importance of rural proof the condition that link look at to deliver banking hub hope that this debate and the minister response will put some pressure on link to look more holistically at the rural environment when it come to consider hub because place like ellon need banking hub be grateful to my hon friend because again she enhance and underline the argument that have be deploy and for which colleague across the house have be kind enough to add their support suppose my annoyance be that the people who write the policy whether they be the regulator or those in the bank boardroom do not know what live in rural area be like if they be in the square mile they be not part of rural community they may have getaway weekend retreat that they dash off to in their personalised number plat land rover or range rover in which they take their food down from waitrose before come back to london on the sunday but that be not live in rural area that be not run business in rural area rise give way to the hon member for north northumberland which really be rural area thank the hon member for secure the debate he mention the square mile there in my constituency of north northumberland the third large in england there be eight branch in square kilometre that have go down by since want to highlight point raise elsewhere in the debate banking hub be important and like other member be push for they in my constituency but again the role of the post office in those banking service be key we have to fight together as community to secure wooler post office must give credit to glendale gateway trust for secure that do the hon member agree that post office be absolutely vital and part of the solution to this problem the hon gentleman be absolutely right in many be begin to get paranoid hear voice he be absolutely right to make the point that he do pay tribute to how the post office have step up very often in provide that sort of transactional bank service it have support the continuance of rural post office which can often be marginal and fragile business themselves again think it an easy crutch to lean on to say well of course the post office do this we can all applaud what post office do but customer can not use they to talk to someone from their bank to discuss their overdraft loan mortgage business credit card maximum or whatever it may happen to be say to the minister that we want our local business and small and medium enterprise to flourish small micro and family own business be very much the hallmark of rural economy and they have the great need on more regular basis for that relationship with their bank then the bank know the nature of the business and its long term viability and they can build that relationship will the hon member give way second time for second time of course be grateful to he for give way second time he be make an important point one of the thing that have always find interesting be that when bank have close in north east fife it offer to deliver not an access to cash service but some kind of pop up banking advice service in the constituency that suggest to that bank know very well that give banking service advice be important instead of do it as sop for number of month before give up they need to do it on more regular and permanent basis the hon lady be again absolutely right surely it make good commercial sense for high street bank as we use to call they increasingly they be not particularly high street bank to be able to tout their ware to exist or potential customer that be how to generate business by have presence hub make very good presence for they all but they seem to move at the speed of the slow and if one be not particularly convince the whole thing sort of seem to fall down know that the government be try to do more on that but think they could do even more to turbocharge it falmouth be to have banking hub we be lose our last bank lloyds be go at the end of the year the interesting thing about that be that the banking hub will be open to five day week and potentially even more whereas the bank be very slowly cut their opening hour after covid and it be hard to find bank outside school hour that of course do not help rural business which could not get there in time the hon lady be right the cynic might suggest that the opening hour be set in order to try to deliberately reduce footfall possibly that might be hugely cynical and if it be madam deputy speaker will plead guilty as charge will my hon friend indulge second time who could refuse my hon friend be so very generous to indulge second time during his excellent speech be strike by the impact on charity as any trustee of charity will know trustee quite regularly have to prove their identity at the bank that the charity choose to bank with when it be simply not possible for trustee to get to branch of the bank to prove their identity the impact on rural charity will be devastating admire my right hon friend perseverance in ever try to change the signatory on charity bank account people have die of boredom and exasperation try to do it year old have to turn up with their great grandparent their first cat and everything else to prove who they be the fact that the bank have know they as private customer for year seem to pass it by hope have make my point to the minister but let rehearse they very briefly in bullet point form one concern the rubric to defend bank closure the assessment of access to cash need rural dimension and there need to be much more granular understanding of the hub and speak geography of rural economy which be very different from an urban one we need to move away pretty quickly from merely assess as satisfactory access to cash as define by access to an atm we need to turbocharge the delivery of hub and bring pressure to bear on the bank and there be variety to do that it can be carrot and stick through tax and other policy to try to nudge they to move at fast pace hope however that the government will take the lead on social inclusion for our rural area reflect the fact that they have far more small independent shop and business and that the population be disproportionately old retire and deal with disability infirmity frailty and so on those thing should be take into account and remain to be convince that they be think an opportunity exist to amend the financial services and markets act to give the fca great power to look at wide banking service not just cash our rural community struggle our economy be fragile and wage be usually low than in urban counterpart another bank closure be not just another bank closure in rural market town although welcome banking hub be increasingly concerned that bank see they as an excuse to accelerate the closure of core service do the hon gentleman agree that pressure need to be apply first and foremost to the bank to keep branch open on the high street and that banking hub should remain as an infill as oppose to be see as the solution that be the danger when we as collective talk so frequently about banking hub the hon gentleman make an interesting point think the trend have be pretty clear and the goalpost have move from late or through to about or think the government could and should have be much tough and more exact but we be where we be take his point and understand it but let we not let the delivery of the good be sacrifice in pursuit of the excellent which seem unattainable think the trend in what the bank be do be pretty well set and it be probably irreversible all sort of thing play into that what think be arrestable be the attitude of we will pull out even if we be the last branch open and somebody else will pick up the the post office or we expect our customer to travel great distance to find bank that be open and can help they that may require number of visit in the case of something like an overdraft that be where the idea of hub come in understand that we be due to have our first hub in dorset at some point this year in sherborne in the constituency of the hon member for west dorset edward morello but north dorset need one as well will certainly be campaign for one in blandford would value the support of the treasury bench to emphasise to the bank that they have duty of care to their customer and they can not just cut they adrift and say make your own way find an alternative beat path to another branch it be terribly inconvenient for you but that be what we be tell you to do because we have no social responsibility at all for the sake of our rural community economy and business for charity and the farming community and for host of other people who want that personal interaction because they do not have access to the internet or do not want to use online banking or an app and so on there should be bank teller as we use to call they from bank in hub at set time to help their customer by so do they will not damage our rural and market town economy as much as many of we fear and as many hon member have attest to in this short debate commend the hon member for north dorset simon hoare for secure this debate he have ensure that the view and concern of his constituent have be hear by ministers this evening and he have set out the particular dynamic of the role of banking hub in rural community the fact that he receive so many intervention from other hon member underscore how important this issue be to constituent across the country and thank he for secure this important debate it might be helpful if outline some of the context around this issue in recent year people across the uk have reap the benefit of the transformation of the uk banking sector particularly the enhance accessibility and convenience afford by remote banking for example in of uk adult regularly use bank branch but by only of uk adult do so and almost nine in bank online or use mobile app notably that include of the however the government recognise that those change have present considerable challenge for other bank branch closure can have particular impact on rural community give the distance to alternative indeed we hear example of that from the hon member for north dorset and other hon member who intervene to highlight specific case and to draw the house attention to the challenge face their constituent assure hon member and the people they represent that this government understand the importance of face to face banking and banking access to local community and high street our objective be to ensure that people and business have access to banking service support local community and local economic growth work on that be well under way and we be work closely with bank to open banking hub by the end of this parliament my right hon friend the chancellor mark the opening of the banking hub in december and more than hub have be announce in total the hon member for north dorset refer to bank close and refer to closing when it come to the criterion for agree where those bank hub will be will the minister reassure that those constituent who have lose the most bank will be those who get more banking hub when the opportunity come through the hon gentleman highlight how this issue affect community right across the uk and in moment will turn to the criterion by which the location of banking hub be decide hon member have raise that important issue and put on record their concern and feeling about it banking hub offer counter service provide by post office staff which allow personal and business customer of more than bank and build society to withdraw and deposit cash deposit cheque pay bill and check their balance they also crucially contain room where customer can see community banker from their bank to carry out wide banking service such as register bereavement or help with change pin as the hon member for north dorset point out bank hub offer more than just access to cash that be an important point regard why such hub can bring so much to an area that have otherwise lose its local bank community banking hub can clearly contribute great deal to local area where exist bank have close and decision over the opening of hub be guide by the financial conduct authority regulation in response to the question from the hon member for strangford jim shannon it may be helpful for to briefly outline how the fca process work when bank announce closure link the operator of the uk large atm network conduct an impartial assessment of community access to cash need link consider criterion such as population size the number of small business and level of vulnerability as well as the distance to the near branch and the cost and time take to get there via public transport should link recommend banking hub cash access uk not for profit entity fund by major uk bank will implement it crucially bank branch can not close until any recommend service be in place additionally individual include member of parliament can directly request an access to cash review via the link website in collaboration with industry the government remain committed to advance the roll out of these hub it be worth point out that customer have alternative option for access everyday banking service notably of personal and of business banking customer can conduct their banking include take out and deposit cash at over post office branch nationwide the post office as several hon member have mention have duty to serve rural community with the department for business and trade require that of the total rural population across the uk be within three mile of post office therefore where community might be too small for banking hub as may be the case for some of the rural community we be focus on this evening individual and business can still access essential service at their local post office have the people who have develop these regulation consider that three mile be very long way for those who do not drive or have access to car or where there be no bus service that be certainly the case for large number of people in north shropshire and be sure the other rural community mention during the debate people have set up their life to be able to access the service that be available but if those service be take away and put somewhere else they be unlikely to be able to get to that location which be really problematic will the minister consider reassess the criterion so that banking hub be place where bank be previously locate so that people can still access they the hon member be correct that people need to be able to get to banking hub and will address that point later in my speech more broadly this government be
