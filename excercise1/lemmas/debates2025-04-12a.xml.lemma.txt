lady have make about staff come in today we be incredibly grateful to they be sure we be go to hear lot today about urgency move at pace and the rest of it but the truth be that the government have make total pig breakfast of this whole arrangement the fact be that anyone who have be pay any attention to this story over the past few month have know that this be come down the track the house be order we have come back on saturday that do not mean it be crackerjack day we be go to listen the house be sit on monday and on tuesday and on those day my hon friend the member for brigg and immingham martin vickers raise these issue the fact be that the government make bad deal for britain when negotiate and as ever they be make bad deal it be huge discourtesy to the house that we see this bill only minute before the start of the sitting far reach power be be give to the government power not see in legislation really in the past year very much hope that the government will apologise for the way that they have do thing for have take their eye off the ball yet again and for have negotiate badly for the british people question put and agree to steel industry special measures bill second read remind members that under the order of the house of today notice of amendment and new clause to be move in committee of the whole house may this be very serious they may be

as manuscript amendment mean that only those table before noon and select by the chairman for debate at committee stage will be distribute and publish beg to move that the bill be now read second time we meet in exceptional circumstance to take exceptional action in what be exceptional time our request to recall parliament be not one we make lightly be genuinely grateful to hon member in all part of the house for their co operation and for be here today as we seek to pass emergency legislation that be unequivocally in our national interest thank in particular the staff in parliament for facilitate today sitting and the prime minister the chancellor and the home secretary for their support indeed we can take this action today only because of the restoration of economic stability and the dedicated resource for steel in the last budget acknowledge my hon friend the member for scunthorpe sir nicholas dakin the hon member for brigg and immingham martin vickers and all my hon friend from teesside for their advocacy and engagement on this matter throughout on behalf of their constituent as hon member will know since take office the government have be negotiate in good faith with british steel owner jingye we have work tirelessly to find way forward make generous offer of support to british steel that include sensible common sense condition to protect the workforce protect taxpayer money and create commercially viable company for the future despite our offer to jingye be substantial it want much more an excessive amount frankly however we remain committed to negotiation but over the past few day it have become clear that the intention of jingye be to refuse to purchase sufficient raw material to keep the blast furnace run in fact its intention be to cancel and refuse to pay for exist order the company would therefore have irrevocably and unilaterally close down primary steelmaking at british steel want to make it absolutely clear that separately from any conversation about possible deal to co invest in new infrastructure the british government offer to purchase the raw material in way that would have ensure no loss whatsoever for jingye in maintain the blast furnace for period of time counter offer be instead make by jingye that we transfer hundred of million of pound to it without any condition to prevent that money and potentially other asset be immediately transfer to china jingye also refuse the condition of keep the blast furnace maintain and in good working order even if have agree to those term could not guarantee that further request for money would not then be make in that situation with the clock be run down do nothing be not an option we could not will not and never will stand idly by while the heat seep from the uk remain blast furnace without any planning due process or respect for the consequence that be why need colleague here today from what the secretary of state have describe it be begin to sound as though jingye be try to manoeuvre the government into recompensed nationalisation will he make it plain that if it try to manoeuvre we into nationalisation we will pay not more than penny for the business to be clear where there be transfer of ownership to the state we would always pay the fair market value for the asset in this case the market value be effectively zero so take the right hon gentleman point entirely would say that the intention of jingye have not be to engineer that situation its intention have be to keep the downstream mill which colleague will know be fundamental to our construction and steel industry and supply they from china rather than from scunthorpe that be the situation be it now the view of the government that primary steel production in the united kingdom be an override national security issue as the right hon gentleman will know we have have this exchange at the dispatch box before believe that the capacity for primary steel production be important the steel strategy look at new way of ensure that and at not just protect the past but at what the future may bring direct reduce iron technology be of significant potential interest to we for the future however this situation involve the last remain blast furnace and the proposition put to we be exceptional and unique and need all colleague to recognise that the legislation ahead of we today be therefore proportionate and necessary step it allow we to take control of british steel blast furnace maintain steel production and by extension protect the company strong workforce the bill do not transfer ownership to the government we will have to deal with that matter at later date take the decision that give the exceptional nature of recall it would be well to limit the power in the bill which be still significant rather than introduce more complex matter of property right and public ownership at this time the secretary of state be take extremely extensive power for the government and they apply to what he describe in the bill as specify asset as far as can see they be not limit to blast furnace or asset require for make virgin steel do he accept that he be leave two hand on the tiller when it come to the operation of all the steelmaking company to which the bill may apply in other word he be say that the government can direct company in relation to specify asset but that company can do other thing of its own initiative do he recognise that he be create considerable legal complexity in the operation of those company go forward why be that the right approach be extremely grateful to the right hon and learn gentleman for his thoughtful question the fundamental purpose of the bill be to allow as secretary of state and this government to take control of this situation the reason why this be the steel industry special measures bill and not bill specific to british steel be as he will know that the latter would be hybrid bill and introduce that would be far more complex procedure with the clock be run down that be not an available option the bill broadly replicate the situation that would apply if the civil contingencies act have be trigger but rather than seek to meet the threshold to trigger that act be seek parliamentary permission the consent of this house and the other place to take control which think be well way forward want to make it clear to the right hon and learn gentleman and to the house that want this to be temporary position do not want these power minute long than be necessary but need the power to rectify and save the situation give that the secretary of state have infer that the owner jingye be not and have not act in good faith surely the right thing to do be to seize this great opportunity now this weekend and nationalise british steel transfer of ownership to the state remain on the table it may well at this stage give the behaviour of the company be the likely option however our aspiration for british steel remain co investment agreement with private sector partner to secure long term transformation the action seek to take today be not magic wand or panacea the state can not fund the long term transformation of british steel nor would it want to but failure to act today would prevent any more desirable outcome from even be consider and that again be why we must act today applaud my right hon friend for his decisive action in this matter have only have chance to read the bill for that be not criticism it be the natural procedure of this house the bill could not be lay until first reading the bill talk about compensation he have make the point that he be not plan to take over and run british steel which be not the desirable option but have he do some sort of impact assessment on the potential range of cost to the taxpayer in these circumstance think my hon friend refer to clause which deal with compensation again let be clear this be clause that we would put in any bill we be not russia and we do not sequester asset the language in the clause the legal definition be something that we would use in most standard procedure go back to the question from the right hon member for goole and pocklington david davis the effective market value of jingye be zero so there be no inconsistency between those two point what be happen today be something that mining community like swadlincote in my constituency of south derbyshire will be feel deeply in their soul it be something that they could have only dream of back in the when they want government who have their back and prioritise the national interest instead they have conservative government who sell they down the river do the secretary of state agree that this be pivotal moment in our history because we have labour government prioritise our people and the national interest this be significant moment how country handle economic transition be not about nostalgia for the past we have to embrace the future but how we help our people our industry and our nation get to that point be key my hon friend and come from similar place and we have not manage these transition particularly well in the past we be meet this weekend to discuss the potential loss of thousand of job which be what be on the line the fact that we do not accept that and that we will do thing differently be welcome change we will scrutinise this bill today but we want to do so in constructive fashion give the huge damage that president trump tariff have do to the british steel industry accelerate this crisis do the secretary of state agree that any member of this house who actively campaign for president trump election and cheer he on have behave shamefully unpatriotically and should apologise to british steelworker be extremely grateful to the right hon member and his party for their presence today he will not draw on the other principal issue that we have be deal with at the department for business and trade over the last few day but to be clear the issue around british steel be about more than the imposition of tariff the tariff be not welcome and do not think there be justification for they to be put in place believe that it be in our interest but also in the us interest to agree position that remove those tariff in the interest of steelworker fully understand the nature of what the right hon gentleman be bring forward also understand some of the requirement for speed in this case and we can argue about whether this should have be do before have quickly look through the bill do not see sunset clause ask about that not because want the government to set particular date but because such clause would bring they back here to debate whether the process should be extend it would therefore put reasonable limit on government activity without debate can he explain why there be no sunset clause in the bill absolutely understand and welcome the right hon gentleman question do not want these power for minute more than be necessary can not say at the minute have draft the bill the timeframe for which they will be require but will endeavour and commit at the dispatch box to keep the house update perhaps will ask the business and trade committee for its involvement in order to make it clear how long we believe it will be to be absolutely specific where we make an order in relation to control of steel undertaking we can revoke the regulation once that control have be establish and be no long require rise know there be huge interest but will make little more progress and that might deal with some of the matter member want to raise this be what it mean to be government unashamedly on the side of work people one that will never hesitate to take action to protect this nation asset and economic security understand that some have ask about precedent or refer to other troubled industrial situation to be clear again this be an exceptional and unique situation the question for all members be whether we as country want to continue to possess steel industry do we want to make the construction steel and rail we need here in the uk or do we want to be dependent on overseas import as government we be not passive in any way about the future of british industry the secretary of state have say this be unique and exceptional and make reference to energy transition and thousand of job in the scottish context many mind right now will be focus on the situation in grangemouth where we know that hundred of job will be lose directly as well as thousand in the supply chain be or perhaps even the local member the hon member for alloa and grangemouth brian leishman to bring forward similar bill to save scotland only oil refinery and give the secretary of state the executive power to do as he please as he be do with british steel would the labour party back it as it be back this bill today be pleased for the chance to address this issue the importance of grangemouth be why this labour government have pledge million to secure its long term future it be an important asset but it be not the only remain refinery it be one of three cracker in the united kingdom that be important specifically it be not comparable situation and the behaviour of the company be not comparable to the case of british steel also say to the right hon member and indeed to all members that this be why we fight and fight again to secure the future of british shipbuilding by save all four of the harland and wolff site in england scotland and northern ireland the right hon member will know that the commercial interest be not in the scottish yard but we hold they together precisely because of our commitment to scotland and the union it be also why within week of take office we secure well deal for the worker at port talbot we have repeatedly act and we will continue to act no matter how hard the circumstance do my right hon friend agree that the failure of the tories and the snp to develop an industrial strategy for scotland mean that they have no plan for grangemouth they know for over decade about the problem at the refinery and do nothing do he agree that as soon as labour come into power we get to work and deliver support for the site the workforce and the local community endorse my hon friend comment entirely do not believe there be history of the snp call for the nationalisation of grangemouth it be as ever on the bandwagon think we all recognise that the snp do not campaign on its record in run scotland it campaign on grievance my hon friend be absolutely right that the contrast be with labour government in this place who be on the side of work people everywhere the secretary of state mention port talbot appreciate the unprecedented circumstance we find ourselves in today when the government have rightly move quickly to safeguard primary steelmaking and the secretary of state will be very mindful of the extraordinarily difficult circumstance that the steel industry in south wales have face recognise the million fund available but can he make sure that south wales and llanwern benefit from their share of the billion clean steel fund can that also be at the forefront of his mind be incredibly pleased to have the chance to answer the point my hon friend raise the port talbot deal be originally negotiate by the previous government do try to reopen it go to see chandra in davos and fly to mumbai to talk to he about it to be frank keep port talbot open on polling day because it would have close due to the industrial action that almost take place the previous government be nowhere to be see even before the result of the election be in we be not able to reopen the deal but we do negotiate well deal as result port talbot be in strong position than british steel because it have long term future in place interruption this be because we improve on the deal that the leader of the opposition botch at the time to be clear the billion green steel fund the chancellor have put in place be in addition to the million already go to port talbot that be an incredibly important point thank the secretary of state for give way and for act in the national interest the complete opposite of the hon member for clacton nigel farage who say he be against intervene to save british steel two year ago do the secretary of state think the hon gentleman say that in the british interest or in the foreign interest the reform party seek to serve believe that that be on the record hope to convince all colleague today to support this action which be in the national interest when the blast furnace in port talbot close down last september this government could have take exactly the same legislative action as they have choose to take today we will endeavour to amend the bill to include wales because there be still the opportunity for this government to make real difference to the community of port talbot and the job that have be lose there do not want to embarrass the right hon lady but the blast furnace have already close at port talbot they be not available to be save that situation have move on let stress again port talbot be in strong position because it have that long term future in place and the potential additional investment through the green steel fund rise think must progress mr speaker can see your indication to do so will my right hon friend give way will take one more intervention thank my right hon friend for give way and for the consider way in which he be look after the national interest the steel union the gmb community and unite would like clarification that any board that be set up will have at its heart the steelworker who have keep the steelwork go through thick and thin we remain in close engagement with all the union which have be monitor the situation closely again reiterate that the bill be not in itself about change of ownership it be about change of control to rectify the situation however will certainly have regard to the comment my hon friend have make and of course the role of the workforce at all stage we will never accept the argument that steelmaking be sunset industry steel be vital to every bit of the modern economy domestic demand for steel be set only to go up not down in the past few week alone we have see heathrow airport announce multibillion pound expansion plan require tonne of new steel and universal studios confirm it will be build europe big theme park and where possible will use uk make steel to do so this government be back the builder not the blocker with the action we take today we have the chance to feed that boom with steel make in britain the legislation we be set out today will help to end the uncertainty that have be hang over british steel scunthorpe site for too long welcome the opposition support today for this recall but this issue should have be resolve year ago believe they may now view it as mistake to have give this essential national asset to this company have to address the statement make by the leader of the opposition yesterday which do as matter of genuine regret she claim that while she do my job she negotiate modernisation plan with british steel to build an electric arc furnace at teesside follow by one at scunthorpe wish to make it unequivocally clear to the house that the new government inherit no such deal we could not renege on that deal because it do not exist on day one be tell that there have be lack of progress on this matter to date rise if such deal be negotiate somehow in secret ask the leader of the opposition to say how much money she agree to give jingye for this deal and what condition be place on it to state the obvious build two electric arc furnace in two different location would be more expensive than build one in one location and give that jingye request to build two furnace in scunthorpe be for billion in taxpayer support what on point of order mr speaker would like advice on how to counter the point the secretary of state be make give that they be factually incorrect and complete misrepresentation of the situation that he inherit it have just be clarify by your good self can not make the secretary of state give way when you want to come to the dispatch box but be sure that if he notice you do so again he may wish to this be an excellent chance to clarify that if the leader of the opposition agree deal with jingye to cause massive job loss in scunthorpe and transfer the job to completely different place and at high cost than the request the company make to we think she should be able to tell we be more than happy to give way labour can not negotiate we be negotiate modernisation deal that would have have limit job loss just as we have in port talbot the labour government inherit function commercial deal in port talbot and the same would have happen with british steel have we not have snap election what the secretary of state be do now be the union push deal they bring that deal to say no he say yes this be genuinely revelatory say again if jingye request be for billion to build at less cost in one place what be the sum of money agree by the leader of the opposition when she be business secretary to build in two place it certainly be not in the account that the chancellor have will give way how much money be agree to jingye to close the job in scunthorpe ask she when you be negotiate you do not labour member be cheer and laugh because they love this they think that the public take on billion of pound in liability be fantastic we have not finish the negotiation so there be no amount but it would have succeed well than the terrible plan that the secretary of state have now our friend in the press will follow that up and find out exactly how much money the leader of the opposition secretly promise to jingye to transfer those job out of scunthorpe think it might be wise on all count for that statement to be withdraw the situation we inherit across the board on assume office be one where most of our foundation industry be in some substantial difficulty since uk crude steel production have almost halve and we know that rebuild our steel industry after year of neglect will be challenge but it be one that this government have grasp my right hon friend and be in this house in when the conservative party sit on its hand and kiss goodbye to the redcar blast furnace and with it the state of the art coke oven that could have resolve this situation today before he sit down will he say something about the jingye activity at lackenby and skinningrove and how they will be impact by today announcement be really grateful that my hon friend have be able to put that point on the record for his community to avoid the kind of situation we have see in lot of industrial community to be frank over the year this be why we take this action today in the national interest to provide that bridge and that possibility to the future specifically in relation to the downstream mill even if we be willing to accept situation in which they be supply from foreign country as in this case the confidence of consumer and business would surely be put at risk and it would bring into question the entirety of british steel workforce and business and huge part of our strategic asset that again be why this decisive action today be necessary the right hon gentleman say that steel production be strategically important and agree he say that we should be avoid have to be reliant on import and agree however his government block production of the raw material metallurgical coalmine in the north west will he now go back to his colleague in government and the company to encourage they to reapply so we can have security not just of steelmaking but of the raw material that be need to make it the hon lady will know that the company bring into question whether that coal be the right grade for blast furnace supply remember several debate in this place about that should also make it clear think hon member understand this that we be talk about two blast furnace that date from the and we must also be look to the future to new technology and new investment crucially have the dedicated resource that this government have put into steel be why we have the chance to look to the future with optimism the uk steel industry be an outlier in the sense that it be much small proportion of our overall economy than in any major comparable economy so of course there be potential and we should look to the future would be more than willing to work with the hon lady as local mp to do so rise will give way one last time thank the secretary of state for give way once he have the power in this bill urge he to use they decisively and swiftly but then as he have say we need to look to the future once we have secure scunthorpe future we need to discuss what happen next which be clean energy and invest in the global clean energy that the uk really could succeed in do he agree that the people of scunthorpe have uphold their end of the bargain for decade and now it be time that we in this house make sure we uphold our end too the hon member put it extremely well if may say so the people who have uphold steel as the backbone of construction in the uk for decade deserve well treatment than they would have have if parliament have not be recall today to take this action and we should all bear that in mind whether it be at port talbot via our upcoming steel strategy via our work to improve public procurement or in the introduction of our industrial strategy to tackle the most thorny issue of industrial competitiveness where other have shy away this government have step up let conclude by say that steel be fundamental to britain industrial strength our security and our identity as primary global power today legislation will help ensure that we can retain that steelmaking capability here in the uk both now and for year to come for british worker security for british industry future and without hesitation in our national interest and for the worker of british steel and their family this action be essential and commend this bill to the house call the shadow secretary of state thank the secretary of state for take the time to brief last night ahead of today sitting and for advance sight of his speech to fail to prepare be to prepare to fail what way to proceed recall parliament for only the sixth occasion since the end of the second world war to debate bill publish only minute ago this would be conduct unbecoming of parish council our country our economy and this parliament all deserve well that be why the amendment in my name would at least put sunset on the bill and hope the government will accept it today be not failure by the steelworker of scunthorpe and elsewhere their family or the community they have toil for generation to ensure that we have the primary steel we need for our structure our safety and our security this be failure on the government watch let we be crystal clear what today mean we be enter tunnel with only one exit this be botched nationalisation plan reveal that the government have no plan in government we act to secure port talbot and we be negotiate plan include british steel preferred option of an electric arc furnace on teesside which would have limit job loss and keep scunthorpe run in transition once again when labour negotiate britain lose the chagos island us tariff the train driver and now this late crisis bad toolmaker blame his tool but this time the government have only themselves to blame do the hon gentleman not accept that in the year between and steel production in this country fall by to do that not underline the lack of strategy under the previous government will talk about the difficulty face steel around the world but let we just be clear what be happen today the british people must not have lose their winter fuel allowance and their disability benefit in order that china can walk away from its liability leave british taxpayer to pick up the bill steel need energy and energy need steel no one deny that steelmaking have be difficult for some time but scunthorpe be the victim of dishonesty that pretend it be well for the environment to ship coke halfway around the planet than from down the road and of an energy policy that have drive cost high than in any compete nation no one be more responsible for this than the energy secretary and the prime minister who appoint he will my hon friend give way interruption order remind member that those who keep intervene will go down the list so that everybody get fair chance assume that apply after the warning mr speaker we have government who believe be ship coke coal just off the lincolnshire coast today from japan when it be perfectly possible to have the world green production of coke coal in cumbria with thousand of job be it not disgrace that this government turn their back on job in cumbria and indeed in the north sea because they put ideology ahead of practicality and even ahead of the environment my right hon friend be absolutely right it be sad to say that scunthorpe be the victim of exactly that policy put ideology before british interest rise will make some progress million of other business be also struggle with their energy bill which be why the chancellor tax choice have be so devastating steel may be the first domino to topple but glass chemical car and concrete be other industry at risk do the prime minister envisage whole series of saturday sitting or will he change course today and cut energy cost now and not in year time when it be too late we be hear about the previous government effort to save british steel and we have hear somewhat confusing account of the deal that the now leader of the opposition negotiate if such deal exist can we see record of it my right hon friend the leader of the opposition have make it extremely clear that the deal be be negotiate and the point about it be negotiate be that it would have be conclude after the election rise will make some progress it do not need to be this way my hon friend the member for brigg and immingham martin vickers have be warn of grow threat since last september the mayor of tees valley have be ask the government to present their plan for steel for month rob waltham the leader of north lincolnshire council have do all he can to support steelmaking in scunthorpe and on april ed conway of sky news show the world that we be just day away from the risk of the furnace shut down but the government do not listen and they do not act it have be almost day since parliament last debate substantive government business rather than this rush one minute to midnight bill we could have use that time for proper debate proper process and proper scrutiny this be indefensible incompetence despite year to prepare it be clear that the government come into office with no plan there be no steel strategy there be no industrial strategy there be no export strategy and now we have this botched nationalisation the secretary of state say that his preference be to find commercial partner but let we be serious do the government think that be likely after attack business with billion job tax and his bill to create the most hostile environment for employer since the on the chancellor watch in case she have not notice all the flow be of investor leave this country be still little confused about the deal negotiate by the last government as the leader of the opposition do not answer could the hon gentleman please clarify the situation for the house be not surprised that the hon lady be little confused as say the government have fail to lay out their plan and to afford this house the opportunity to debate it everything that we have hear this morning say that the government have not really think this through steelmaking be complex intense and highly operational iron ore have to reach thousand of degree to become molten iron it be dangerous process that pose serious risk to health in birmingham labour struggle to collect the bin rise sit down from midnight the chancellor will be stand behind the payroll settle every bill with every supplier even if they be in arrear if these decision no long sit with the plant owner where do the buck stop old admiralty building the treasury no how can other steel provider have any confidence in the impartiality of the government steel strategy if the umpire be now on the pitch what assessment have the government make of the impact of the bill on public finance there be no impact assessment the government have be talk to british steel for nine month they have put at least million of taxpayer money on the table surely by now the business secretary and his official have comprehensive understanding of the cost of the action that he be ask we to vote for what disrespect it show to this house for the government to come along today have recall parliament after nine month of fail to land deal and ask we for blank cheque that be no way to run corner shop let alone the country have anyone in government ask the office for national statistics rise if they sit down they might learn something you will sit down actually it be the hon gentleman choice whether he give way so member should stop hang around will take an intervention if someone want to answer this question have anyone in government ask the ons whether as result of the power that be be take in this bill from today british steel will be classify as publicly own whether it have be formally nationalise or not no answer rise that be bit slow interruption go on then that be relevant question give that the hon gentleman be boris johnson business adviser when the jingye deal be be negotiate what advice do he give boris johnson about whether to accept that deal disappointingly there be no answer to my important question about the ons and whether this asset will sit on the government balance sheet perhaps when the minister wind up he will provide an answer to that important question that affect the nation finance the market know the world know and we know that the chancellor headroom be inadequate from the very moment that she sit down after her last emergency budget only this week the bank of england take the unprecedented step of cancel the plan sale of government bond today botched nationalisation will far unsettle international market when will the chancellor be present she next emergency budget and what be her plan to update the market there we be disrespect of this house the government treat parliament with disdain nine month of dither and delay and botched nationalisation of steelmaking with the british taxpayer on the hook it be crystal clear that when labour negotiate britain lose this be not serious government it be government shape by event not in control of they it be government by sulky teenager not share their plan not answer the question and when it go wrong it be everyone fault but theirs call the chair of the business and trade committee mr speaker wonder whether you will forgive for return the debate to the bill which be about save british steel that be what the debate should be focus on and commend the secretary of state for bring forward the power to achieve that goal he have act with decisiveness speed and certainty and thank he for the bill he have present today he have act in the national interest and he have act to safeguard our economic security be delighted that he have also act in line with the select committee advice which be table with he day ago as we know that do not always happen we urge he to maximise pressure on british steel owner not to do what be easy but to do what be right today he have return to the house with bill ask for the power to do exactly that this legislation matter not simply because it protect job in scunthorpe not simply because it protect job in the steel supply chain across our nation and not simply because it safeguard nearly billion of economic output it matter because it defend our economy our security and therefore our future at the heart of this debate be very simple question can we entrust critical national asset to company we do not trust say no we can not we must not and we dare not we be present with very simple challenge in british steel owner we have company in possession of an asset that we need yet it be partner that we do not trust in world where threat to our economic security multiply each day we can not allow that risk to fester at the heart of our industrial core do the right hon member agree that there be wide issue at stake our energy security and national security we have see what can go wrong with chinese company that we do not trust and we see chinese influence increase in other vital sector particularly our energy industry should that not underline our concern and act as warning that we do not want the chinese to have control of our energy supply we be here in the house to answer very basic question if we can not trust company can we entrust to it capability that we need when that capability be so vital to our strength that be one reason why the select committee have set up new sub committee on economic security arms and export controls we will be report back to the house on the state of economic security in our country before the summer recess and look forward to the hon lady comment on that report the general point want to land be this what we value most can not be entrust to those we distrust most the timing of the bill be critical we live in an age of intensify insecurity president putin violence be unabated china military build up be unabated and now president trump threaten to upend the free trading system in such world to surrender our ability to make primary steel would not be misfortune it would be negligence my right hon friend will know that the select committee have speak to defence company about how necessary it be not to rely on import at time such as this do he agree that national resilience and defence rely on industrial security my hon friend be absolutely right in this debate we need to remember that of our rail infrastructure be make by british steel british steel also supply three quarter of every major construction project in this country thank to the chancellor we be about to invest billion in the rearmament of this country much of what we need to put in place will be make by british steel how can we afford to let british steel go out of business today how can we vote against the bill british steel be not simply pillar of british industry it be cornerstone of our economic security do the right hon gentleman agree with as card carry advocate of industrial strategy that this argument apply to some of our other key high growth sector such as fusion quantum and space we have to accept that the day of easy globalisation be over and be bit more strategic about how we support our emerge industry mr speaker you know that could answer that question all day but you would rule out of order so will confine my remark to the bill however agree with the hon gentleman he be absolutely right and that be why we have to work hard across the house to build consensus about the big call that we need to get right for our future british steel face significant headwind not just from chinese steelmaker flood the market but from the new tariff from the united states and we have to rise to the challenge of decarbonisation yet we in this house must keep our eye on the prize ahead of we the chancellor have just commit billion worth of capital investment we be build affordable home at pace not see in decade and we be invest billion in defence there be market to seize but only if we have the mean to supply it british steel can not profit from britain future if chinese firm be allow to kill it today agree with the right hon member that we need steel industry in britain and that we need to invest in it do he not think that we could be go bit far today and instead of this temporary measure take the whole steel industry into public ownership so it can be what it have always be the bedrock of manufacturing industry in britain and give we security for the future free from market force the right hon gentleman may well be right but this be the second key point that want to land the truth be that jingye be mess it have fail to publish account since two auditor have resign one cite material concern about the company ability to remain go concern inventory can not be verify cash flow statement be miss the company be not act in good faith and that be why the secretary of state be right to take the power that he be ask for today it be clear that the escalate trade war between china and the united states create the imperative to act today it be clear that jingye be about to move primary steelmaking capability from scunthorpe back to china and merely use the downstream mill in scunthorpe that may have be good for china economic security but it be not good for britain national security and that be why we need to give the secretary of state the power that he be ask for the option on the table be very simple the secretary of state could do nothing and watch the furnace close he could hope but hope be not strategy or he could act as he have do today he have act with strength and make decision in the long term interest of our country and the house should give he its full and unabated support call the liberal democrat spokesperson recall parliament today be absolutely the right thing to do but to be frank it be extraordinary that we find ourselves in situation in which our sovereign steel industry be in such peril as result of the conservatives failing and the labour government be now try to give themselves unprecedented power it be astounding that even after british steel be sell for even after it enter insolvency and even after the government insolvency service temporarily run it the conservatives press ahead to erect more trade barrier through their botched brexit deal scrap the industrial strategy council and allow the sale of the steel plant to chinese firm that accord to ministers be now refuse to negotiate in good faith at least to keep the plant go the conservatives be asleep at the wheel they fail to tackle energy cost and business rate and now trump tariff and contagious protectionism be the straw that have break the camel back do the hon lady agree that the conservatives be also in government in when the steelwork at redcar close and thousand of people lose their job as the hon member know the three thing that have just outline british steel be sell for pound british steel enter insolvency and the government insolvency service be leave temporarily run the firm all happen in with putin barbaric war in europe and donald trump disastrous tariff cause economic turmoil around the world we must secure the future of steel production here at home we liberal democrats welcome the sense of seriousness and urgency show by the government in recall parliament we must work together to rescue our steel sector and the ten of thousand of job that directly and indirectly rely on it but under the term of the bill the secretary of state be give himself huge and unconstrained power that could set very dangerous precedent urge he to make commitment in the strong possible term to repeal the power that he be give himself as soon as possible within six month at the late and to come back to this house for another vote to extend those power if they be still require after that as try to articulate in my opening speech on second reading understand the gravity of the situation which give put some context to the demand for further power to be include in the bill the limitation as wide as it be be the right measure and can give the hon member my absolute assurance that shall seek to do exactly as she say be incredibly grateful to the secretary of state for give that assurance which be important in the context of what the power in the bill actually be clause give the secretary of state the power to break into anywhere to seize asset clause give the secretary of state the power to take whatever step he consider appropriate not what court or reasonable person might consider to be appropriate to seize or secure asset clause on offence make it crime for anyone not to follow the instruction of the secretary of state or to refuse to assist the secretary of state in take those step without reasonable excuse however reasonable excuse be not define in the bill no example be give and quite frankly it be hard to work out what defence of reasonable excuse might be accept give that under clause it be whatever the secretary of state himself consider to be okay clause on indemnity appear to give the secretary of state and potentially any other person who be with he police officer civil servant or border force official immunity from prosecution for use any of these wide range power these power be unprecedented and they be unconstrained be grateful to the secretary of state for say that that be precisely why he intend to repeal they as soon as possible more broadly the government must now also bring forward plan to guarantee the future of this vital sector we know the steel industry be surround by crippling uncertainty after decade of underinvestment and shocking indifference to our sovereign economic security the previous conservative government have leave our sovereign national capacity on steel diminish and endanger yet there be no chance that uk demand for steel will disappear how absurd and irresponsible be it that we have sustainable and endure long term market for british steel but that our supply could keel over in matter of day because of the failure of the fail conservative party so look ahead let we remember that save scunthorpe be necessary but not sufficient on its own there have be significant discussion about the future ownership structure of this company give the precarious fiscal position in which the government find themselves it be important that all option on ownership be put on the table so that this house can take an informed decision about what they mean for the public finance hope the government will make commitment that in the come week they will bring forward report that set out option for future ownership of the plant look ahead many big question remain unanswered will the government immediately designate uk make steel nationally strategic asset will they be use direct reduce iron and if so will that form part of the uk plan alongside protect the production of virgin steel at scunthorpe when will the government bring forward comprehensive plan to ensure that more british steel be use in vital infrastructure project from defence to renewable energy will ministers work shoulder to shoulder with our european and commonwealth partner to tear down trade barrier include by negotiate custom union by will they develop initiative to retrain and upskill worker across the country as we transition to green method of steel production how do the government intend to respond to call from uk steel for the government to achieve the low electricity price in europe parity with competitor on network charge and wholesale electricity market reform this case should also raise concern about the role of chinese corporate interest in the uk national critical infrastructure the decision by british steel chinese owner to turn down the government offer of million to support the future of the scunthorpe plant have directly precipitate this crisis we must now be clear eyed about the risk pose by chinese involvement in our country vital infrastructure to that end will the minister tell the house when the government promise uk china audit will be release and how the government plan to strengthen protection for critical infrastructure can he assure the house that the government have assess whether there be any risk that jingye on behalf of the chinese government have deliberately run down the plant to jeopardise the uk capacity to produce steel we be in precarious position and it be not as if there be no warning in the royal united services institute think tank say domestically produce steel be use in defence application and offshore the supply chain may have security implication for example in scenario where multiple ally country rearm simultaneously at time of global supply disruption such as during major geopolitical confrontation the fact that jingye have now close down the supply of raw material be further evidence that the plant should not have be sell to it in the first place quite frankly the fact that some conservative mp be call for nationalisation show how far through the look glass we really be be not the conservatives attitude abundantly clear on national security they cut troop number by on food security they undermine our farmer with unforgiveably bad trade deal and on economic security they leave our country with almost no sovereign steel capacity on security the conservatives leave our island nation severely vulnerable like flotsam in the sea passively bob up and down or be bash around by the tide of international event as for hon member from the private limited company reform ltd they have bit of cheek to claim to support uk steelworker while cheer on their pal president trump whose punish trade war be put those steelworker job at risk perhaps the company director who sit in this house will come clean about whose side they be really on time and again we have see the failure of an ad hoc piecemeal approach to industry across all sector from the failure of our water company to the shocking state of our housing nationally and the dismal situation of our health service for too long there have be no stability for these industry which be constantly fix on short term basis only to the point where they be practically hold together by string and tape and the dedicated worker who remain we liberal democrats stand ready to help constructively to bring about an outcome that deliver real change today some of we have be surprised to hear the opposition talk about failure to prepare the worker of scunthorpe might say that they have year to prepare and fail british steel product be essential to industry to this country security and to the delivery of major infrastructure programme across the country include in london british steel supply transport for london with the power rail use on its transport network which be not manufacture anywhere else in the country for railway include the underground power rail from british steel be essential to the everyday operation of the service which support up to million customer journey each day the closure of british steel would have very serious adverse effect on transport for london service as it would on project up and down the country so above all transport for london believe in the importance of uk base supply chain for steel finally everyone in this house understand that the bill be not about bring steel into public ownership whatever the opposition assert but some of we hope that move on to nationalisation will not be rule out all of we on the government benches believe in what work but privatisation certainly do not always work the water industry come to mind since privatisation not single reservoir have be build instead billion have be pour into the pocket of shareholder now raw sewage float in our waterway and river and it be the consumer who will have to pay exorbitant charge for investment that should have be make all along this house support the government in move to save british steel and the job of thousand and thousand of worker it also support the government in move so quickly and with such certainty to protect the country interest include in relation to security and in work to save the community in scunthorpe because one of the issue with deindustrialisation be the long term effect on many community up and down the country we all support what the government be do have just come off the phone to tom smith the trade union convenor at the blast furnace on behalf of my many constituent who work next door in scunthorpe my primary concern today be with the nearly people who work in this plant let we be clear we have be make the good quality steel in the world for year in lincolnshire and we intend to go on do it we be not go to allow cheap inferior chinese steel to kill off our industry the worker of scunthorpe be breathe sigh of relief we can be party political have to say that think the chairman of the business and trade committee make an excellent speech he be positive and talk in strategic term but do not know what the liberal democrat spokesman the hon member for st albans daisy cooper achieve by constantly attack the conservative party on what be very complex issue of course we can be criticise because we sell this company to jingye yes agree but how many voice on the liberal democrat benches be speak up at the time be they speak up when greg clark our then business secretary pay the wage of the scunthorpe steelworker for many month be they speak up when we save sheffield forgemasters this be highly complex issue and we should be work together so support the bill know that we can be critical of the government perhaps we should have act soon my hon friend the member for brigg and immingham martin vickers have be raise this point be sit beside he at the end of march when he raise it and call for nationalisation of the industry but we have now get to work together to save our steelmaking capacity we know though that this bill be bit of stick plaster it be quite dangerous quite extensive power be be take by the government so there have to be sunset clause we be give unprecedented power to the government we can criticise they for not act soon but this be stick plaster on gap wound let we be honest steelmaking in this country be under extreme stress and why be that why be we load the most expensive energy cost on to our own steel production why be scunthorpe pay almost twice as much in energy cost as those in south korea or in america high energy price make uk steel expensive to produce and uncompetitive versus that produce by our european counterpart in the average price pay by uk steelmaker be kwh compare with the german price of and the french price of we be make our own steel industry uncompetitive we have to stop these green energy cost we have to be realistic the secretary of state for energy security and net zero have now leave but we need to get real we can take steel into public ownership now but if we go on load cost on our industry we will have to come back month after month and year after year we will support the bill although we want sunset clause but we have to get real about china too be it not obvious for week and indeed for month this be so call private company but there be no such thing as private company in china they be all under the cosh of the government under an autocratic regime what do they care about the steelworker in scunthorpe what do they care about our national interest never again colleague must we allow such strategic industry to fall into the hand of the chinese the russians or anybody else will the right hon gentleman clarify whether he be aware that the chinese company that be now in possession of british steel be sell it by conservative government of which he be part of course be because just say that have just admit that it be mistake but ask everybody what they be say at the time of course there be silence it be easy to be wise after the event but be worried about my steelworker be worried about their future rise give way to our former leader want to make sure that my right hon friend put the record straight some of we on the opposition benches warn the then government that it be wrong there we be some of we apparently warn the government do not know how many we now know the true nature of our chinese friend we support the bill let we make our steel industry really competitive again and let we make great britain great again rise order can make an appeal to everybody lot of people want to speak and there be go to be some disappointment think those whose constituent be actually go to be affect should be allow to speak but let we see how we go for time we need to be brief to get more member in let we have good example from melanie onn be delighted to follow the right hon member for gainsborough sir edward leigh give his damascene conversion to socialism today he could be term the new red ed welcome the government decisive action to bring security for worker at scunthorpe they be grasp the nettle after the can have be kick down the road for far too long british steel at scunthorpe be not just of interest to that town its importance emanate across northern lincolnshire to my constituent in great grimsby and cleethorpes whether directly or indirectly the employment and training opportunity that come from that single site be so important to our local economy and the product be of course nationally important when consider the business that operate across the humber and northern lincolnshire think the industry that be relevant to secure the future of steel seem strong from the siemens factory in goole to the boatyard of hull and the turbine off the cleethorpes coast the product that scunthorpe could have role in produce be plain for we all to see the government must turn their attention to the next step because the measure we be take today be not without risk unless we set course for steel in the uk that closely align with our industrial strategy this will be only another stick plaster for site that have already be put through the wringer too many time over the year the power that the government seek today will protect the worker at british steel from any retaliatory measure that jingye may have seek to take that be welcome by those worker who have often feel at the mercy of the company owner and unseen by the government do my hon friend agree that one major way in which we could secure market for british steel be through the british first strategy that the ministry of defence have set out for the building of future warship order mr roca have somebody texte photograph outside this place of what be go on here this morning indicate dissent okay can people please not take or text photograph do not know if that be the case here but your name have just be associate with it agree with my hon friend the member for north durham luke akehurst it be imperative that we tie up all the initiative that this government be bring forward whether in defence or other critical area of industry to make sure we can secure the long term future of steel to ensure the good chance of successfully secure private partner or long term commercial solution the government must take all action available within their power and do all they can to make british steel viable wonder whether now be perhaps the time for the government to look again at the carbon border adjustment mechanism the eu have already bring in the adjustment mechanism to protect against international steel dumping by do all we can whether by keep down energy cost as know the minister have seek to do invest through the national wealth fund or indeed bring in the cbam this be our chance to secure genuine long term solution for the preservation of british steel it be pleasure to follow the hon member for great grimsby and cleethorpes melanie onn my member of parliament on this matter we be in complete harmony before talk about the local situation which be what want to focus on may thank the secretary of state for give call yesterday evening and outline the proposal he would be bring forward this morning do say to he that would not be entirely uncritical so be sure he will not mind few jab here and there the local situation be extremely critical as have be point out the impact not only on the workforce but on the wide economy of northern lincolnshire would be extensive have be resident in the grimsby cleethorpes area all my life and have see the impact when town lose its core industry in the case of grimsby of course that be the deep sea fishing industry when that decline happen it have happen to so many town up and down the country as result of the decline in mining shipbuilding and other heavy industry it take generation or perhaps more for the town to fully recover that be the last thing want to see happen in my neighbouring constituency of scunthorpe or to the hundred of my constituent who work there those member who be here for the easter adjournment debate there be handful might have hear say this only four day ago but the site extend way beyond the bound of scunthorpe into my brigg and immingham constituency the site be the equivalent of wembley football pitch which give an idea of its size and of the amount of work that would be need be the steelwork to close there would be demand for vast government investment over decade in order to remediate the site and to provide new employment say that would not be entirely uncritical of the secretary of state so refer he to my first urgent question on this matter on september last year say on that occasion there have be widespread medium report suggest that coke will stop be import from october which would mean production would stop in scunthorpe by christmas there be rumour concern the fact that employee will be give notice very soon that be obviously create great anxiety among those directly employ by british steel and those in the supply chain which in northern lincolnshire extend to many thousand of people and many business official report september vol thankfully we have have six month reprieve from those threat in october but have to say the government have be little dilatory on this appreciate that negotiation have be take place and ministers can not give away their negotiating position but make this point as long ago as september as well as when you grant an urgent question on march mr speaker only couple of week ago and surely the government be begin to realise at that point that the negotiation with jingye be go nowhere be extremely grateful to the hon gentleman for put that point on the record it be precisely because of those concern that we be able to have ready legal route to intervene to directly offer support to purchase raw material what we could not have anticipate or expect be for company to act in an irrational economic manner when such clear distinctive and generous offer be make thank the right hon gentleman for his intervention would say merely that he have be party to the negotiation and he must surely have realise that the company be not negotiate in good faith and expect his official to prepare legislation if require to deal with the situation that we be now in as other have say this be crucial not just for thousand of my constituent who work at the site but for the defence of the nation assume and hope that defence ministers have be lobby the secretary of state to make their concern clear locally there be continue concern like the father of the house my right hon friend the member for gainsborough sir edward leigh will support the proposal float the nationalisation issue on march and see this as step stone to that situation to those who will perhaps demand nationalisation today would say that this be very complex issue and what matter more than anything else be the future of the workforce and the ability to produce virgin steel nationalisation legislation would not sincerely hope be pass in three hour it would involve great deal of work have get themselves into this situation the government be now take the right action there have be disappointment locally to put it mildly that the prime minister do not follow my question to he only day ago take up the option to meet cross party delegation of mp to discuss the situation but now that we be where we be fully support the government and hope that they accept the sunset clause amendment which would be prudent can assure they of my full support today which they will continue to have when they act in the good interest of my constituent rise order can we try to help each other by not speak for too long hope we do not have ream of paper for the next speech bill esterson will be good example of short speech well thank you mr speaker no pressure interruption will put some of my paper down may start by praise the business secretary and his team for the way in which they have introduce the legislation add to that my praise for trade union local management and members of parliament of both main party not least my hon friend the member for scunthorpe sir nicholas dakin who be minister be not speak in the debate join he on visit to scunthorpe where the very concern about jingye that we have hear today be share with we by local management and trade union alike it be no surprise that those concern have come to pass the last government be warn and they choose not to take the action need minister in the last government tell that steel need by the navy and by those across our economy could not be make at scunthorpe or at other steel plant interestingly the local management and the trade union tell that they could make whatever their customer ask they to make by adjust production again it be pity that the last government do not listen or we might be in rather different place now during the last parliament we be the only country in the where production of primary steel and steel overall be fall if the blast furnace be allow to close we would be the only country in the without any primary steelmaking capacity which underline why today legislation be so important the steel at scunthorpe be of strategic national importance some of our rail track be make at scunthorpe and the steelwork there carry out automotive construction and defence production all of which be critically important to this country in addition to what be make now there be opportunity in energy transition and defence some million tonne of steel will be require over the next year in the offshore wind sector alone so there be great opportunity if we can secure the future of scunthorpe at the liaison committee last tuesday the prime minister mention that the grid connection plan for the scunthorpe site be only due in our electricity price be above the average for international energy agency state the government have to address the challenge of slow grid connection and uncompetitive industrial energy price if they be to enable the modernisation of industry as whole and steel in particular the business and trade committee of which be member have hear evidence about the importance of the steel industry and about the need for primary steelmaking to be retain as key pillar of uk industrial sovereignty we have hear that blast furnace still play critical role in strategic and high grade steel production do my hon friend agree that our economic security be intrinsically link with our onshore industrial capability and that our government focus on both construction and defence in these uncertain time mean that this bill be very welcome news my hon friend make extremely well the point that our economic security and our national security be two side of the same coin be pleased to hear about the work be do by the business and trade committee in his excellent speech the committee chair my right hon friend the member for birmingham hodge hill and solihull north liam byrne mention the sub committee that have be set up want to talk about port talbot because the energy security and net zero committee visit it two week ago there will be delay of several year between the closure last year of the blast furnace there and the opening of the new electric arc furnace which be massive cause for concern in south wales and beyond the excellent financial support provide by this government and tata willingness to engage be good example of industry and government be partner and an indication that the industrial strategy that the government plan to bring forward be already be effective the bill give the government the opportunity to secure steelmaking in this country congratulate the secretary of state and his colleague on their decisive action worker and the nation as whole be grateful for the work of this government who be do absolutely the right thing my hon friend the member for clacton nigel farage and have be call for british steel to be strategic national corporation for some six year we say to the previous administration that the last thing they should do be sell it to the chinese but they ignore our splendid advice the industry require long term investment the problem as we all know be that it have be beset by short termism and short term thinking as well as by the vast electricity cost in this country partly cause by net stupid zero and the carbon tariff there be now great opportunity for the house to unify as the secretary of state confirm we have the opportunity to take british steel into public ownership this weekend we would urge for the sum of we could do great deal for the taxpayer we should invest in refurbishing and reline these blast furnace in the same way that the french be do in dunkirk they be spend quarter of billion euro in dunkirk and we should do the same we should bring in excellent global expertise to help british steel there will be opportunity if we do those thing and have long term procurement contract for raw material include the opportunity to use british coal from cumbria that be an opportunity that the government decline but it would create more job and save on transport cost there be also the opportunity for long term procurement contract for british steel product those be opportunity to make british steel long term viable business for the taxpayer we can bring in long term patient capital if we do those thing we can get everything that we want primary steelmaking be vital strategic asset and scunthorpe can be its epicentre we will support the government bill today but there be an opportunity to go far to be bold and to be courageous the secretary of state should show his cajone and show some mettle this weekend he and the government have the opportunity to remove the uncertainty for family in scunthorpe let we go for it let we nationalise british steel this weekend and make british steel great again today represent not only my constituent in neath and swansea east but those of my hon friend the member for aberafan maesteg stephen kinnock after year of under investment and neglect by the previous government this government commitment to steel be truly welcome however it be vital that the million steel renewal fund already announce by the government be use to support the industry across the uk and wales need to get its fair share some steelworker lose their job in the region but they recognise that the circumstance in port talbot be different from those in scunthorpe in port talbot half the steel production have already be shut down when the labour government come into power despite plaid cymru desperate attempt to electioneer this as an issue it be impossible to reverse the deal that have already be strike between the previous tory government and tata although steelworker understand the urgency of the current situation and support the government action to prevent further closure and job loss they need commitment for wales that will attract investment and create much need employment opportunity like those be offer by the float offshore wind industry it be too late to save the furnace in port talbot and the job be long go but investment in the area will bring new job and most importantly new hope to all our constituent you will not need reminding mr deputy speaker but will remind the house of quite how unusual day this be for variety of reason the last time we meet on saturday be at time of war and the last time we put bill through in one day be at the beginning of the pandemic that be how serious the disastrous circumstance in which we find ourselves be assume that this house will accept the bill so will address my comment directly to the secretary of state at one level this be nationalisation in all but name bill because of the power it give the government indeed it actually give they more power than nationalisation bill would it will allow the government to do thing that they could not do under nationalisation bill frankly would have vote for one be not fan of nationalisation as the secretary of state will know but would have vote for nationalisation will vote for this bill for simple reason it buy we time people have to understand that this be reprieve not rescue do not agree with the hon member for boston and skegness richard tice on his strategic nationalisation argument nationalisation under these circumstance buy the secretary of state time and leverage and he need to be able to use his judgment on how to use that time and leverage we have have just hint of view of how complex game jingye be play in fact if be to recommend any amendment to the bill it would be an amendment to limit to one penny the amount of money that the government could pay to jingye because then no court could challenge that amount and jingye would know full well that it be not in line to make money out of the british taxpayer we have to look at this in strategic and tactical term will the right hon member give way on that point if the hon lady will forgive will not because lot of people want to speak will refer to something she say in minute so if she really need to intervene will let she come in then we be try to manage disaster disaster for scunthorpe which be local to as member of my community work at scunthorpe the knock on economic effect will be feel much more widely than in one town this will affect thousand and thousand of people all round this be also disaster for our last primary steelmaker and steelmaking have suddenly become more important it be always an important part of national strategy but mr trump have make it vital unavoidable piece of national strategy we have to create circumstance that allow the secretary of state and the government to manoeuvre we through that as member have say that mean have an energy policy that make the plant viable not just viable when it be own by the state but commercially viable it mean have an energy policy under which we do not have the high energy cost of our competitor which we do now it also mean that we have to think very hard about carbon supply at the moment the technology do not exist that allow we to make primary steel without carbon supply so we have to think about that primary steel be strategic supply so we can not rely on another country for it want to see this bill use in way that give the secretary of state the time to deliver those thing but it must also give this house the right to see what he be do and how the strategy be turn out nobody have get this right if those on the government benches want to can go back to and park blame but do not want to do that today want to make this viable we have to get our energy environmental and industrial policy all in line to make this work to put this in context last year british steel lose about million that be the september number this year it be about million neither of those be small amount of money the treasury would shut down an operation if we just leave something like that run inside the government for very long we need new strategy that cut our carbon emission without export our industry to the rest of the world be afraid that most of our success in carbon reduction over the last decade or two or three have be by dint of export industry to other country often with much bad record than we in this case it would be china china have of the world market already it have massive excess in steel capacity and its steel capacity be the most carbon inefficient there be so we would actually be worsen the circumstance the business and trade committee have take clear evidence that we need carbon border adjustment mechanism so that carbon rich steel such as that from china be tax much more heavily crucially what be need on the table be the steel safeguard from the trade remedies authority to guard our market from flood tide of chinese steel right now be afraid the right hon member be right the difficulty be that we be in new world the terrible thing be the house will only ever hear say this once that trump have small point in some respect and we have to deal with the world as it be move on to the sunset clause can imagine that the instinct be not to put sunset clause in the bill because we be deal with difficult negotiator and put in sunset clause would be put in backstop when we put backstop on ourselves we give the other side negotiating advantage in his speech the secretary of state mention that the civil contingencies act would be route for those who have not read that legislation we spend year put it in place under the blair government and it have recourse to parliament at every turn minister be properly control it must be transparent and so on suggest to he that at some point he might organise transition to that so that the house have great control the coronavirus act do not have that it miss all those defence and look what happen to the policy as result this be what would like to see recourse to parliament over the action the secretary of state take to manage the survival of scunthorpe and the policy to ensure its viability and in the post putin and trump era the security of supply we want to see all those thing and we can organise legislation to permit they ask the secretary of state to take the house into his confidence and do this properly in group of steelworker emerge from the templeborough steelwork follow night shift at the time temple borough be the large electric arc steelmaking plant in the world those steelworker have just do something rather spectacular they have break shift record they be surprised to find letter from the prime minister jim callaghan congratulate they on their contribution to the national effort after year it be marvellous that we finally have prime minister who be prioritise the steel industry once again know what it be like to emerge bleary eyed from night shift on steelwork as much as we be emotionally attach to our steelwork the past analogy be not entirely helpful here there be too much of narrative in this country that steel be sunset industry when in fact it be not only essential but advanced perhaps this be the time for to direct member to my entry in the register of members financial interests as the former chief executive of the uk national steel innovation centre lot of that innovation be embed in our facility in scunthorpe from advanced high speed rail from the rail mill to rod that be draw down to wire the thickness of human hair produce to pharmaceutical level of precision the beam mill in teesside be one of handful of plant capable of produce large scale beam that have be use to build building from hong kong through to the west coast of the usa the skinningrove work produce the tine for yellow good for caterpillar which move directly into that factory be sure that all member agree on how vital those plant and facility be but they may be unaware that two third of the steel we produce today do not exist year ago such be the level of continuous innovation in the steel industry everything that we have be make either from or with steel our steel industry have decline so significantly over the past year that just last week when go to the constituency adjacent to mine to visit the hartlepool pipe mill which make the pipe for the carbon capture and storage network in which this government have invest billion see that stamp on the plate of steel be the word voestalpine an austrian steel producer that sit in the foothill of the alps be able to produce plate steel more competitively than those in the uk while we have plate mill in scotland that be practically idle the slab for that plate mill would have be produce in the scunthorpe steelwork welcome the legislation today as an opportunity for we to take back control of our steel industry and deal with the chaotic fragmentation of the industry that occur over the past year believe that the uk can be just as competitive as steel company in austria germany france spain or the netherlands which be in fact the big importer of steel to the uk will my hon friend give way be sorry give the shortage of time will not also believe that we can be at least as good as the steel industry in belgium which be now large than the steel industry in the uk clearly there be lack of ambition on the part of the previous government they do not believe that our steel industry could be as competitive as belgium will the hon gentleman give way be sorry but be not go to give way simply because of the lack of time it be important to correct the record on number of early comment the hon member for boston and skegness richard tice and other refer to the coal from the west cumbria mine but must inform the house that the management of british steel have rule that coal out on the ground of quality the sulphur level be too high rise would be quite happy to talk to the hon gentleman about steel desulphurisation in the tea room later if he would care to join also completely refute his comment about bring in global expertise we have the expertise in the uk to run steel company effectively again would be happy to introduce he to people who could do that if he wish to know it be important to remember that the steel market globally be not free market which be why government work together the us government use tariff and block merger between nippon steel and steel the french government traditionally use procurement the german government subside their steel industry with energy price the chinese government give cash it be really important to recognise that steel company do not compete in free market and that if we ask our steel company to do that we be ask they to compete with national government overseas and let those national government set our steel and industrial policy and fundamentally our defence policy think that be unacceptable we need to recognise that the corporate interest of company be not the same as the national interest of the uk the secretary of state have recognise that and show real leadership want to reserve my last remark for the steelworker in scunthorpe work in scunthorpe for time both at the ironwork and at the steelwork to the steelworker in scunthorpe say know exactly the pain that you be go through be sure that they will be relieve by the word of the secretary of state we all think fondly of the four blast furnace in scunthorpe the four queen bessie vicky mary and annie but ultimately think we all recognise that their time have come while they will be nurse into their ultimate retirement we look forward to regenerate the steel industry in scunthorpe and around the uk with the most modern most efficient and most high productive steel plant just as past labour government do when they nationalise the steel industry for the second time in it be so good we nationalise it twice this time we can hopefully work with the industry to create world lead steel industry for the future it be privilege to follow such an impressive speech from the hon member for stockton north chris mcdonald be sure his constituent will be incredibly impressed at his knowledge of this issue want to be kind not just to he but to the secretary of state once again that be become habit that want to break but certainly his sincerity today can not be doubt if there be one person who could be afford the executive power in this bill with an element of trust it be probably he there be some topic that have not be touch on in huge amount of detail today and will touch on they briefly now whether it be tariff competition or energy price we must not forget the fundamental of why the steel industry face such challenging position there be one other hugely important issue that have not be discuss at any length in the chamber today notwithstanding the future contribution that imagine will be make by the hon member for alloa and grangemouth brian leishman it will not pass the lip of any other members which be the situation in grangemouth say the situation in grangemouth with an element of despair because we all know that there be hundred of people who be on the brink of lose their job the similarity be astounding we have petrochina on the one hand and chinese company in scunthorpe on the other we have chinese company in scunthorpe say that there be loss of around and we have chinese company at grangemouth say that there be loss of around we have cracker in grangemouth that have be deem not useful anymore and we have blast furnace in scunthorpe that be categorise in the same manner we all need to be conscious of those comparison say that on the basis that while the secretary of state be right to say that this be important for job in scunthorpe this be right for the community in scunthorpe and this be right for westminster national uk wide interest be it not the case that it be important to the worker in grangemouth be it not the case that it be important to the community in grangemouth and be it not the case that it be in scotland national interest that grangemouth be protect rise rise be afraid that will not give way because we be all constrain by time in the same way that labour members will not take intervention either the secretary of state answer to early be that million have be put forward through the national wealth fund each and every one of we know that that be not in the gift of the prime minister or the secretary of state to dictate it ultimately rely on the private sector come forward with proposal indeed in evidence give to the scottish affairs committee just last week by ey which have do the project willow report it be quite clear in its observation that there will be no progress until at the early that be simply not good enough because while the government mobilise every effort to save british steel they allow grangemouth to fall on the back burner the hon member for central ayrshire alan gemmell refer to industrial strategy he seem to forget in that context that energy be reserved matter for this united kingdom government something the secretary of state be all too familiar with give our previous role in this here house the final thought will leave with labour members be that they should remember the fact that the bill they be support extend solely to england and wales it do not apply to wales the right hon member from plaid cymru correct to clarify the fact that the bill apply only to england the important consideration be why be this not be extend to scotland why be grangemouth not be include why be the smelter up at lochaber not be include and why be the dalzell steelwork not be include the answer to why they be not be include be that westminster be only interested in westminster it be not interested in scotland interruption will not be shout down by labour members because they need to hear the truth scotland interest matter and the people of scotland be watch let bring we back to the bill that we be here to debate we have hear some of the datum statistic and information and about the finance and the associate commercial consideration we have hear about the importance of british steel to our defence industry and our national security about the importance of energy and resilience and about the infrastructure we need to build to give we the growth in this country that we can feed back and inject into the public service that so need it of course the big thing here be the job and today represent the voice of my resident in the isle of axholme and those live in neighbouring town include scunthorpe who be feel it today and who be listen to every single word we say have to say that the risk to they and the impact the personal impact on they be unquantifiable that be what want to talk about yesterday speak to richard fifth generation worker at scunthorpe who have recently finish there he say that this be about the individual about the family about their colleague and friend and about the town this be about their identity and he describe it in this way he say that british steel in scunthorpe be the beat heart of the area and over the last few year that beat heart have start to slow as it have slow every time it skip beat as it have in the last couple of week people hold their breath they be anxious they be scared and they be frightened with every skip of that beat heart people lose hope and we can not let people lose hope he say to we that we need to come together and we need to pick up community defibrillator take it there give it the injection of pace that it need and make sure that we stimulate that heart for all the generation in the future we have the opportunity with this bill today to take control and to start to make that happen we can turn british steel make primary or virgin steel which be vital for all the thing we have talk about into treasure and not just treasure but national treasure which be exactly why we need to move this on today last year the government say they would introduce new steel strategy that would create more well pay job in the place where they be most need follow last year closure of the blast furnace at port talbot many of my constituent have lose their job or see their income fall that include the thousand of worker who be lay off at the plant itself but also those further down the supply chain include haulage driver and payroll clerk provide service to the local business that have be impact by that closure the closure of port talbot blast furnace start an economic contraction in south wales that be still under way many highly skilled worker particularly welder be leave south wales in search of opportunity elsewhere it be rub salt in the wound for the people of port talbot to hear the government now acknowledge the importance of primary steel production as strategic national asset where be this urgency when welsh steel community be cry out for support last year when tata steel announce over job loss at port talbot the large steelwork in the country key strategic asset and the manufacture heart of south wales there be no recall of parliament no saturday sit no emergency legislation and no rapid mobilisation of the government to save the day despite every warning sign be there the union raise the alarm and industry expert warn of the economic shock but the warning be ignore now face with similar risk in england the government suddenly rediscover their ability to act swiftly the simple fact be that the government do not recall parliament for port talbot and they do not recall parliament for wales if today decision be in the national interest why do the government not offer similar protection to port talbot which have more capacity and great output have the government be fence in by close the blast furnace at port talbot too early how much of the steel supply chain will the government now commit to protect employment at port talbot fall from over employee at its height over the past few decade to around before last year closure decision and now there be just steelworker employ there those job be sorely miss welsh steel be all around we and port talbot once produce the steel use in everyday product such as heinz bake bean tin it be absolutely right that we be now acknowledge the importance of domestically produce steel community that once power the uk growth particularly the swansea valley the neath valley port talbot and maesteg now face an economic reckoning with far too little urgency from this government in return this be personal for many of we from south wales my grandfather work at the blast furnace at the port talbot steelwork and it give he the opportunity as it do many other to set up his own business in his case waste management company that be what be really at risk now and that be what be really wither away in south wales it be not just the job on the steelwork floor but the entire network of small business tradespeople and supplier that rely on the steel industry presence in our community we know that for every steelworker make redundant up to three or four local job be at risk of disappear the message from westminster have be clear when crisis hit in wales it be tolerate when it hit elsewhere it become national emergency we can not go on like this steel be strategic it be critical to our national resilience and it matter just as much in south wales as anywhere else this government failure to act swiftly in wales to consult transparently with worker and to invest in serious and just transition have undermine confidence and leave people in port talbot llanwern shotton and many other across wales feel abandon some job be lose at the blast furnace alone and many of those worker say they have simply be leave behind we have hear the prime minister say over the past few day that he want to take control of steel why do he not say that when welsh job be on the line why be port talbot not worth fight for in the same way we need proper uk wide industrial strategy one that recognise the vital role of welsh steel in our national economy and most importantly one that treat worker in every part of the uk with the same respect urgency and seriousness the steelworke community of wales have not forget the silence that meet their cry for help and they will not accept future in which their community be leave behind frankly some of the contribution that we have just hear from the hon member for brecon radnor and cwm tawe david chadwick should have be make when the decision be take place they should not have have to wait until today commend the secretary of state for how he have deal with this issue and for get we together for today debate the idea that somehow we could have debate the negotiation as we be have they be for the bird frankly because all we would have do be tell our negotiate partner what we be go to the negotiating table for negotiation be not do like that and nor should they be and to those who have be moan about we have be recall on saturday say that you can recall on any saturday at any time and twice on sunday if it mean we can save industry and thousand of job will be here every time some of we know what it be like the town of corby be build on steel the people of corby and east northamptonshire know only too well what it be like to have the steelwork close down and devastation befall local community when the corby steelwork close people lose their job and unemployment rise to corby and east northamptonshire be once home to the large steelwork in europe today it employ just shy of people and it still manufacture tonne of steel tubing per year we would not be the place that we be without the steelwork that corby once have and we know the devastation that the job loss would cause for the community of scunthorpe that be why this be the right thing to do we must maintain steelmaking capacity in the uk in these increasingly uncertain time we must maintain national security by have the ability to produce our own virgin steel all option should be open but the blast furnace must not be switch off because once that happen they be go that be the problem in other part of the country and it should have be raise at the time in any modern economy with central mission for growth production of our own steel be crucial that will be at the heart of any future industrial strategy be proud to be here today to support the bill and to secure future for steelmaking in the uk will try to be brief and stay focused on the bill let start by say that we should all focus on the requirement to save the job of those people who have this threat hang over they in fact understand from my hon friend the member for brigg and immingham martin vickers that people have already receive redundancy notice and they will be very worried at the moment our thought should be with they today come in on saturday be right if it save their job be certainly prepared to vote for that the bill do give vast power to the right hon gentleman the business secretary and the government as other have say trust he personally this be not an attack on he but we in this house should never trust government more than we have to have say this on both side of the chamber by the way therefore urge he to have another look at the sunset clause which raise early it be not say we do trust you it be say that sometimes government be take down sidetrack and before we know what have happen the power be begin to be use for the wrong purpose urge he to introduce the sunset clause or even to do so in the other place to give the house real power to come back for everyone sake even those on the government benches think that would be worth do because it would allow we to have strong debate on how the power be be use and would perhaps even enable we to influence what be take place the reason for this debate be clearly the massively change need of this country particularly after the event that we never think would happen russia brutal invasion of ukraine as result weapon and arm be need on an unprecedented scale there be plan to build up the armed force and they need the very high quality virgin steel that be produce in this plant without it we would have to import it frankly china do not produce that quality of steel the other reason be the tariff war now take place which have introduce tariff on the car industry which be one of the big purchaser of steel all those thing make the bill very much necessary we have another problem which hope the government will deal with in the context of the bill when they talk to the department for energy security and net zero thing have change the prime minister himself have say that the world have change we have be operate in what we consider to be global free market have argue for some time that this be not free market far too many country such as china have abuse the rule of the free market subsidise their industry ridiculously and use slave labour to produce their product when that happen the free market be dead we must recognise that we will have to deal with those whom we trust and who do not break the rule that mean whole rethink of the government china policy and of whether we need to rush to china for investment we need to ensure that we deal with our industry at home and that we produce thing again one problem be the energy cost our industry face which be really quite stark our industry be not just in competition with china even the cost in europe be far less now will give short list the cost in the uk be now the high in the world at per megawatt hour germany which have the high cost in the rest of europe be at per megawatt hour while france and the other all have low cost for produce energy that energy be critical for the steel industry and that be one of the big issue that the secretary of state have to deal with china with its subsidy and break free market rule be at per megawatt hour we should not attempt to compete with it we must say that it be not competitive at all interruption exactly right as my right hon friend the member for goole and pocklington david davis say other be complain about china right now country in the far east such as vietnam and south korea be accuse it of dump what we have in china be something that will really hit we hard and make the secretary of state job even worse very simply china be now suffer from the over production of steel its housing industry have go static and that be one of the big user of the steel it produce where will that steel go by the way it be no surprise that chinese company jingye be involve in push to shut down the blast furnace in the uk it know that we will have to buy slab steel from china that be not coincidence it be all part of the plan that company be link directly to the chinese communist party and it be high time that we call that out in his negotiation the secretary of state need to remind jingye that the reality be that it be not private company the previous conservative government should never have award it the contract and warn they about that it be time for we to make sure that we deal with china at face value and do not accept the pretence that this company be private or in any way detach from its government that be critical point there be much to be deal with and urge the government to listen to the house and to check all of this cheap chinese steel be desperate problem for we and we need to work with other country in deal with it we also need to get our cost down on net zero hope that the secretary of state will tell the secretary of state for energy security and net zero that we can not go on like this this be such an important point and will be exceptionally brief but the right hon gentleman know from debate that he and have be in that be obsess with the issue of industrial energy price and by the very substantial rise from to real term increase as think he know the two fundamental issue be first our network charge and how we do those which be different from other country and secondly fundamentally the marginal cost be set by the price of gas the fossil fuel price for the overall system be not completely reject everything that he be say but we must understand that key point it be the gas price be grateful for that because it allow to say something that have not be plan to say we sit on an island of gas so why for goodness sake be we not drill for it we need it and we will need it strategically there be need for strategic industry and agree with the secretary of state on that however the issue do not stop there it stop elsewhere in the production of energy simply leave that point for he and he can argue it with his right hon friend the secretary of state for energy security and net zero want to say one final thing in the course of this chinese company operation have talk to number of people involve in the business and its record on health and safety and on the abuse of the worker in the blast furnace area have be shocking we should look into that much more carefully the company have bring in cheap chinese worker and pay they nothing like what it pay the british worker many of those worker have end up burn and in great difficulty simply say that this be not company we should be do business with right now we will go to the front benchers at pm so if member who be call could be as brief as possible that would be appreciate thank the secretary of state for his speech and his decisive action this will be meaningful day for the people of scunthorpe know how important job in the steel industry be davy roll otherwise know as union electric steel have stand at the heart of gateshead in our town centre for over year it be the only cast steel roll maker leave in the country and it be at risk of closure steel be incredibly important for our future and the government be take decisive action be remind today of place close to my constituency ten year ago the people of redcar be let down pay tribute to member include my hon friend the member for redcar anna turley for their campaigning at the time redcar have the second most efficient blast furnace in europe and yet it be abandon along with job proud town be let down today scunthorpe and redcar have learn the difference labour government make and the difference decisiveness make they save job and change life thank you for that if member can keep contribution to around three minute that will be helpful call liz saville roberts diolch yn fawr iawn dirprwy lefarydd today legislation to safeguard the uk last bastion of primary steelmaking capacity be of course to be support but what my party can not support be this government approach to steel in the uk which deem that steel in scunthorpe be worth saving but steel in wales be not today be bitter day for the people of port talbot where the blast furnace have be extinguish because labour let that happen job loss there will take an estimate million from the local economy in lose wage people in south wales have be loyally vote for labour for decade do this labour government feel proud that those vote have be pay back by tory style deindustrialisation in port talbot plaid cymru have call consistently for nationalisation but the labour first minister of wales reject our call and describe nationalisation as pipe dream labour in wales be quick to mock our proposal which we make time over and over again in cardiff and here in westminster now it be uk labour policy the government must set out how much of the billion steel fund will be allocate to secure scunthorpe and how that compare with the amount give to support lay off worker in wales will the right hon lady give way on that point the right hon gentleman government do not intervene in wales rise will take no intervention his government do not intervene in wales under his government scunthorpe get security port talbot get pittance plaid cymru believe that port talbot should and could have receive equal treatment alongside scunthorpe that be why we have table an amendment to include wales in the term of the bill and to highlight that the measure we be debate today could have be use to save the blast furnace at tata steel in wales we will not let labour hide from the fact that it own the decision not to intervene to save welsh steel when it have the opportunity to do so worker and community must be at the heart of any long term solution for the steel industry so far labour in westminster and labour in cardiff have work in partnership to dispatch thousand of welsh worker to uncertainty and hopelessness people in wales will not forget today it be day of bitter disappointment for port talbot today we be take an extraordinary but necessary step not just to safeguard single industry but to defend the long term interest of our country on that point of interest refer to my entry in the register of members financial interests let we be clear today be about not nostalgia but national resilience and secure britain future retain sovereign primary steelmaking capability be critical to our economy and our national security because steel be the backbone of our infrastructure defence energy and transport system without the capacity to make steel from raw material here in britain we be at the mercy of global market and geopolitical shock and we would be outsource not just production but power although we be resolute in our commitment to green industrial future the transition to clean steel must be manage and just transition not cliff edge that mean keep the furnace operate in scunthorpe as we establish and scale up the electric arc furnace because if we lose our primary steelmaking capability we will not get it back the skill will be lose the supply chain break and we will become entirely dependent on other country many of which do not share our environmental or labour standard or indeed our geopolitical outlook let we not forget the people this be about job good unionised skilled job that sustain community generation of family and the dignity of work the steelworker in scunthorpe be not just make steel they be make britain we owe it to they to ensure that this industry have future pay tribute in particular to the work of community and gmb union which have fight for the future of british steelmaking and british steel worker the labour party be found to give work people voice in parliament and today as government we be honour that legacy by stand up for british industry british worker and britain future be proud to support this legislation and urge all member to do the same steel be strategically vital for the uk and the foundation of our industry we could and should be produce much more of it domestically steel be also integral to the green industrial transformation that be essential for our future wind turbine train rail track and electric vehicle be key element of the sustainable future for our economy the green party believe that public ownership be the good solution in this case because only public ownership would give we the control that we need to ensure proper strategic long term plan for the renewal of the steel industry not just in scunthorpe but nationally none the less we will be support the bill we do however need to think long term we have an opportunity to reprocess far more of our waste steel to feed our industry instead of export it we have an opportunity to use the skill of the community in place such as scunthorpe to drive that green industrial transformation moreover the government have an opportunity need and duty to use not just this bill but the other lever that be available to they to support this crucial strategic industry as the secretary of state have just acknowledge electricity price because they be lock to gas price be keep too high we need to decouple electricity from gas as the hon member for great grimsby and cleethorpes melanie onn mention we should be introduce the carbon border adjustment mechanism at the same time as the eu year early than currently plan to protect our steel industry we should be make use of anti dump mechanism to prevent the dumping of steel that be sell on the global market at below cost price we should be use industrial and innovation policy to support the development of innovation which be refer to by the hon member for stockton north chris mcdonald who clearly know great deal about the industry that will be the future of the steel industry we can not just patch up our old technology we should be look to the future and consider what innovation we need to produce clean green steel as the foundation for that green industrial transformation forty year ago in this place the conservative minister of trade and industry say believe that privatisation will enable british steel and its work force to secure firmly base competitive industry with long term future in the same debate the then labour shadow minister ask whether the minister have not reward british steel with plan which quite unnecessarily place its future in report december vol today think we can conclude that that privatisation do indeed place british steel in jeopardy and that privatisation have leave britain steel industry dangerously expose in the post war period railway steel mine and mill cover the country in thicket of industry but for ideological reason the conservatives tear those network apart with the result that in my north northumberland constituency the electricity grid be own by warren buffett the water system be oversee from hong kong and the bus be ultimately run out of miami we have the chance to correct this with british steelmaking and that be what we be try to do today this matter because national security be about much more than defence it be about trust mutuality and our common endeavour do my hon friend agree that home make steel be the fire in the belly of this country industrial strategy and that without steel be make on our shore to the high quality we be weak today bill labour bill will guarantee the future of steelmaking in our country which be essential my hon friend make good point and agree absolutely want my constituent to trust that the people pump their water provide their power connect they to the wide world and make their steel have their interest at heart want they to get job in business that serve the common good not international stock market or foreign government we need to have strategic industry in house so that we can trust that our economy be work for we as we have hear today jingye appear to have at heart not the interest of the british people but its own profit why should we accept that decision make in boardroom in china with link to the chinese communist party can risk wipe out an industry that be the heart of one of our community and vital to our nation flourish if we be ultimately to nationalise steel that would not necessarily be perfect solution sluggish and over subsidise steel producer would not serve britain interest any more than one own by foreign firm but believe we should keep nationalisation on the table as my hon friend the member for stockton north chris mcdonald say we have the expertise and certainly the passion here in this country to succeed and recent event have prove that the safe way to safeguard strategic part of our national infrastructure be to do it ourselves privatisation have often be very bad for our country that it take government intervention to secure the continuation of our last remain plant produce virgin steel speak volume my hope be that we soon move to the full nationalisation of british steel and align that with our plan massive investment in skill through skills england after decade of fire sale of british industry it be time for we to rebuild our industrial pride our national security and our social covenant to those end urge the house to back britain and back british steel rise order remind member that each contribution should take no more than two to three minute potential tragedy be unfold for many people in the scunthorpe area not just those at the steelwork but people in the wide community who work in the supply chain their customer and worker in the local economy and the family and friend of those work at the steelwork well over family in this country could be affect nearly whole parliamentary constituency trump steel tariff will hurt the uk steel industry trump supporter in this house in the two shade of the blue team be strangely silent on the impact of his unnecessary tariff have anyone hear they condemn trump tariff no the liberal democrats believe the government should stand strong against trump tariff the relationship between the jingye company and the government have clearly break down which be why the secretary of state be take wide range power for himself as it appear that the bill will be pass today have two question for he can he confirm that the pension fund of employee and former employee be not in deficit that all company contribution be up to date and that the asset of the scheme have not be transfer to the hold company or any offshore business and if they have be will he commence measure to get they back can he also confirm that ownership of the asset of the business such as plant land and building have not be transfer to any hold company or offshore business be glad to be call in this debate declare an interest the gmb one of the steelworker union whose parliamentary group chair have donate to my constituency party twenty year ago the mg rover car plant in my constituency collapse with devastating consequence that be feel to this day today all our thought be with the steelworker and their family at scunthorpe and teesside and hope that we can do something to avoid such future for they do not want to speak for too long but would like to make few point first today decisive action be welcome think all our constituent would rather have government who act at great speed than government who act too late secondly echo the point raise early by my hon friend the member for brent east dawn butler about the importance of steelworker participation in the day ahead if the government could also clarify any change in plan for the uk steel council that would be appreciate thirdly what role will jingye now have in the running of british steel on day to day basis it be clear that worker have lose confidence in the management as show by report this morning that management from jingye be refuse entry to the plant and that change in that day to day management be need would like to respond to couple of point make in the debate the last time that this house carry legislation that have the effect of nationalise steel that legislation be page long nationalisation be clearly outside the scope of the urgent emergency legislation that we be debate today we have also hear much about cost include energy cost do not wish to add to the inform comment make early but the oecd have also say that the root cause of the industry current problem be global excess capacity in other word the uk have be leave at the mercy of over production and the dumping of artificially subsidise good the manufacturing trade remedies alliance have long call for our trade defence to be strengthen and hope that those call will be listen to in way that they be not under the last government would like to end on personal note because have think about one person in particular today family member my aunt father who begin his career at the ravenscraig steelwork in motherwell he rise to become branch officer national executive member and later salaried official of the iron and steel trades confederation the forerunner of today community union in the peripatetic life of trade union official he later work in the west midland corby and scunthorpe he be fierce in the defence of his member and the gentle and most modest of man in private understand that he be still remember on the executive of community and if he could be here today to witness this most difficult chapter in the steel industry history be sure that he would offer valuable perspective and wise counsel with your permission mr deputy speaker would like to enter his name in the record of this place dick knox thank all member for their help in be brief for the last few contribution but unfortunately we have time only for final back bench contribution call sir jeremy wright be grateful to you mr deputy speaker can accept that there be broad agreement in this place that we should take action to preserve virgin steelmaking capability in the uk but quite frankly it be not enough for this house just to agree that we should do something it be our responsibility to look at the detail of what the government be propose and to decide whether it be properly target and appropriate for the task there be not go to be committee stage or report stage in this bill that be what the clock tell we this be our only opportunity to look at the detail of the bill and be afraid that precious little of that have be do today let we have look at what power the secretary of state be go to be give by the end of today as thing will probably unfold the secretary of state will have power that apply to all steel manufacturer in england and wales not just to the particular company over which he have specific concern there will no doubt be shiver run down the spine at tata steel as well because the bill apply to that company too the secretary of state can act accord to this bill in order to instruct those company to deal in specific way with what be describe as specify asset as mention to he early that do not limit the measure to blast furnace or to anything else that be specifically require to generate virgin steel the secretary of state can give direction to ask and require company to do pretty much anything that company could otherwise do and if the company refuse to do it the government have power to take control of asset include power to enter premise by force if necessary and criminal penalty that can lead to imprisonment these be very serious power indeed and be afraid that this house be simply not be give the opportunity to scrutinise they as they require they also look suspiciously by the way like nationalisation so perhaps it would be easy to call this thing what it really be let address one or two specific before finish hope that the secretary of state for whom have huge respect will think about think he have and will some of the problem that this legislation will throw up first there be highly likely to be considerable controversy over whether company in question be comply with government instruction company be likely to argue that point as the secretary of state point out in respect of his particular concern we be deal with company that he do not trust and that he believe have act in bad faith thus far have no reason to think nor do the secretary of state that the company might not continue to do so secondly the secretary of state be make himself responsible for claim against the company that arise from specific instruction give to it by the government that be what the indemnity clause mean in those circumstance there will be further dispute about whether the relevant problem have arise because of what the government have tell the company to do or because of something it have control over as say the secretary of state be enable there to be two hand on the tiller and that will store up headache for the government urge he despite the fact that we have not have the chance to explore the matter today to think very carefully about how the government will protect themselves and the taxpayer from the oncoming complexity call dame harriett baldwin for the official opposition add my thank to everyone who have enable we to be here this afternoon but the fact be that this be bungle way to do parliamentary legislation follow bungle set of negotiation and we be likely to end up with bungle nationalisation the labour government have land themselves in steel crisis entirely of their own making they have make poor decision and let the union dictate their action the fact be that the union lead labour government have bungle the whole negotiation insist on scunthorpe only deal that be not viable frankly the government should have see this come in fact instead of address it day ago when british steel announce its plan to close the site and parliament be sit their incompetence have lead to this last minute emergency recall colleague include my hon friend the member for brigg and immingham martin vickers the tees valley mayor ben houchen and councillor rob waltham of north lincolnshire council have be warn about the issue at british steel but no labour ministers think they know well the british public can now see the government scramble for solution to problem they create and could have resolve month ago the government give themselves power in the bill to compensate steel undertaking yet the minister have tell we nothing about the scale of that or the estimate of it the secretary of state tell the house that he have no trust or abide faith in the company but he be give himself power to give whatever sum he deem appropriate to the company do we not need more answer before we pass this legislation wholeheartedly endorse what my right hon friend say all new government members should be aware that the explanatory note to the bill which have only just be circulate to colleague make it very hear cry of shame from behind on the financial implication of the bill the explanatory note say that there have be no impact assessment of the effect on the country finance and nothing have be prepare for this house while we make this decision today the bill be stick plaster for government who in opposition have year to come up with plan but they have dither and delay ultimately nothing will change for uk steel until the government understand the damage that unrealistic and impossible net zero by target have do to british business and industry we have hear range of really excellent contribution from my hon friend from the father of the house we hear an excellent exposition of the importance of this industry to his constituent in lincolnshire and the impact of energy cost on the industry we hear from the great champion of the industry my hon friend the member for brigg and immingham who have regularly bring this issue to the forefront of members consideration we hear from my right hon friend the member for goole and pocklington david davis and from my right hon friend the member for chingford and woodford green sir iain duncan smith who raise incredibly important issue to do with tariff and china we then hear from my right hon and learn friend the member for kenilworth and southam sir jeremy wright who raise some important legal question if may in the time available to would like to raise few far detailed question for the minister to respond to when she get to the dispatch box the secretary of state have say that he do not want these power indefinitely so why will labour members not back our amendment to implement sunset clause for this bill we have hear from range of voice in the debate about the confusion over the territorial extent of this legislation it make it very clear that the territorial extent apply to england and wales only yet clause refer clearly just to england there be another thing would like the minister to make clear at the dispatch box if new provider come into the uk and decide to set up new steel make enterprise in england or wales would that new enterprise be cover by this legislation can the minister also tell the house what the attorney general have advise on compliance with international law include article of protocol to the european convention on human right the world trade organisation subsidy agreement and the trade and co operation agreement particularly with reference to state aid the secretary of state be unable to tell the house this morning how much this intervention will cost we be be ask this afternoon to sign off on bottomless pit of money how often will this house be give an update on how much taxpayer money be be send into this bottomless pit family across the country be already be hit in the pocket every day can the minister give the house ballpark figure from the dispatch box be we talk about million year be we talk about billion be we talk about more than billion it be fact that the government themselves have make the situation bad for the steel industry with their determination to impose high energy price high taxis and high business rate where be the steel strategy that they have have nine month to develop what we can say with certainty about today legislation be that this be no way to govern the country whenever labour negotiate britain lose we can see for ourselves that this be government control by event they be not in control of event yet accord to the secretary of state it be everyone else problem and nothing to do with they this government have treat parliament with disdain we have have nine month of dither and delay for these worker at scunthorpe when labour negotiate britain lose look forward to hear the answer to all those question from the minister thank hon member on both side of the house not just for participate in this debate but for return to this place in these exceptional circumstance there seem to be some debate about it but think this be the sixth time since the second world war that we have meet on saturday and only the second time that the house have be recall on saturday the other be during the falklands war before respond to members comment echo the point make by my right hon friend the secretary of state in his opening remark this government will never hesitate to protect our steel industry and the thousand of steel worker in this country who build it we always say from the outset of our negotiation with jingye that we would keep every option on the table and would act in the national interest to protect job uk forge steel build our railway bridge and building it be integral to our economy future just as much as it have be to our rich industrial past that be why we need to pass this legislation today will try to address as many of the point raise as can member make the argument for british steel my right hon friend the member for birmingham hodge hill and solihull north liam byrne point out that of network rail steel be from british steel my right hon friend the member for hackney north and stoke newington ms abbott point out that tfl would not get anywhere be it not for steel my hon friend the member for stockton north chris mcdonald who have such expertise point out that steel be the future and everything we have be make from or with steel can reassure the house that our plan for steel the billion that we commit to in the manifesto will work to break down the trade barrier that we have on steel consider the all new technology that we can introduce and look across the whole of the uk to ensure that we protect steel everywhere the minister speak about the whole of the united kingdom be very pleased that the government be act literally at pace for once by step in to protect the worker in scunthorpe in precisely the opposite way to when they turn blind eye to the plight of worker at grangemouth which be also critical national infrastructure labour under energy price why be there one rule for industrial production in england and another for industrial production in scotland in the first week after come to power this government negotiate well deal on port talbot and deliver million commitment to secure the future of grangemouth we act last week on the zero emission vehicle mandate to secure our automotive industry we be act today to save the worker of scunthorpe the government believe in direct action in an active state secure the future of our industry across the uk my hon friend the member for great grimsby and cleethorpes melanie onn raise trade protection issue want to reassure she that we will ensure that the right trade protection be in place for our steel industry concern be raise about future decision about move towards nationalisation and whether we would come back to this place can reassure the house that we will come back to this place if be any further matter relate to ownership or otherwise we will keep the house update concern be raise about the reasonable excuse part of the bill and example be request the reasonable excuse clause could include physical inability illness or accident and it be reasonable and measure in this case many hon member talk about china we be focus on this company today we be not focus on the nation of china the bill be about what have happen with british steel and what this government be go to about british steel would not want this house to believe that the policy of this government be anything other than belief in free and fair trade and that include with china turn to the sunset clause amendment that have be table and the suggestion during the debate that those measure should be include in the bill reiterate what the secretary of state explain about the risk of hard backstop reduce our leverage which be why we do not include sunset clause however we have hear the house concern confirm that we will repeal the legislation as quickly as we can and that we will involve the select committee also make this pledge to the house we will update the house regularly and the secretary of state have commit to do so every four working week hope that that will give the house reassurance rise welcome the government action today thank my hon friend the minister for industry for all the hard work that she have put in to get we to this place do she agree with that our future industrial strategy must contain an extended section on government procurement for steel so that british produce steel have fair crack of the whip in the future my hon friend be right that procurement have key role to play in our industrial strategy in steel and beyond we be work with colleague in the cabinet office to ensure that that be the case speak to the hon member for brigg and immingham martin vickers about these issue regularly as do the secretary of state on point of order mr speaker it be report that jingye management have be turn away by worker and the humberside police today so will the minister tell the house whether the government policy be to bar jingye management from go on to the premise as the right hon member know that be great information but not point of order will not comment from the dispatch box on report that have be make during the debate we be actively engage minute by minute on activity in british steel if anything those report underwrite the need for the power in the bill to be introduce on this day hope all hon member will support the introduction of the legislation and vote for it today the hon member for brigg and immingham suggest that we could have move fast reassure the house that we do not recall the house lightly we do it because we have choice today do we want to deny any possibility of the future of the steelwork at scunthorpe and do we want to see the closure of the blast furnace or do we want to secure future for those worker and for primary steelmaking in this country on that point will the minister give way hope my hon friend will forgive but there be no time for to give way reassure the hon member for brigg and immingham that in no way have we move slowly we have be move at pace throughout our time in government there be suggestion that we should move to nationalise british steel today and that this bill be already nationalisation it be not nationalisation and we be not move to nationalise british steel today we be take very significant power that we do not underestimate that buy we time to have the leverage and the time we need to look at what must be do next but we will act in the national interest as the prime minister say yesterday nothing be off the table there be suggestion that we should use the civil contingencies act that be difficult to do because it be very hard to meet the criterion there have to be risk of death so we do not meet that criterion agree with my hon friend the member for sefton central bill esterson that economic security and national security be two side of the same coin the emergency legislation we have bring forward today be essential to protect british steel its workforce and the national interest this government will never hesitate to act in the national interest to keep britain secure at home and strong abroad and this legislation be proof of that today we take back control and urge all member of this house to
