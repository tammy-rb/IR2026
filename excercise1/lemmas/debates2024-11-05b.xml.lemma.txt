of modern slavery and human trafficking include those who have be sexually exploit scottish organisation such as tara and routes out provide exemplary support to woman who be exploit through

prison which be why we take immediate action to relieve the pressure this will allow for well access to purposeful activity which we all know reduce reoffende it be former prisons minister who identify that short custodial sentence have high reoffending rate than sentence serve outside prison do the minister agree that we need to look at use technology to curtail offender freedom outside prison and ensure that we cut the cycle of crime yes electronic monitoring be already an important part of safely manage offender in the community and one of the principle of the sentencing review be to look at the punishment that offender receive outside prison consider how we can well use electronic monitoring and other technology to safely manage offender outside the prison wall as former member of youth justice board know that young people who be draw into offend often lead narrow life with little opportunity for personal development have the minister make an assessment of the provision of youth service such as the duke of edinburgh award scheme to engage with these young people and prevent reoffende we value youth service such as the duke of edinburgh award scheme that enable young people to develop new skill to turn their life around in fact the of scheme be available in all five of our young offender institution and people in yoi be enrol in the scheme in august

what be the government do to boost such programme and the employment advisory board that we set up to ensure that while prisoner be rightly punish they be also rehabilitate such scheme and initiative be exactly the sort of thing that this government want to celebrate as good practice and replicate in other setting answer to my recent write parliamentary question have talk of the positive impact that relation with family can have on prisoner resettlement however in number of case particularly those involve sexual violence the prisoner have no contact with the family and their release be usually traumatic moment for those family and child that be why welcome labour manifesto pledge to introduce national identification system for the child of prisoner as vitally important measure what be the government do to meet that pledge and break the offend cycle across generation identify child with parent in prison be important for ensure that they receive the support they need strengthen family tie remain an integral aspect of our work which be why our family support worker help to re establish appropriate family tie and facilitate visit from prisoner child my official be work closely with the department for education to determine how much more we can do in this space incarcerate pregnant women and mothers what step her department be take to support incarcerate pregnant woman and mother we be send too many woman to prison two third of whom be non violent and over half of whom have dependent child and of the time the child leave home after the mother be incarcerate that be why we have launch the woman justice board which will set out its strategy in the spring its goal be to reduce the number of woman in prison and ultimately the number of woman prison all welsh woman in prison be hold in england and be far from home add to the emotional torture of separation from child but we can not assess the extent of the separation without public access to wales specific disaggregate datum will the secretary of state commit to make this information public so that we can ensure that pregnant woman and mother and child have the proper support they need the datum on how we track the experience of woman across england and wales will be work that the woman justice board once it be up and run will be able to look into and make recommendation on which we will pick up in the spring early release scheme what recent assessment she have make of the effectiveness of the early release scheme the immediate purpose of the emergency release scheme be to stop we run out of prison place and to avert total breakdown of law and order if we look at the prison population today it be clear that we have manage to avert the immediate crisis but this be only short term measure we have also set out long term plan to build the prison place that the last conservative government fail to build have also launch landmark sentencing review so that we be never force to look into emergency release again in my mid dunbartonshire constituency the community justice team be have success in prevent reoffende by work with offender in trauma inform way it be recognise that short sentence as have already be mention do not prevent reoffende do the minister agree that the prevention of reoffende be central to reduce cost job loss family breakdown and homelessness it be clear that we have to do well on reduce reoffende give that of offender be reoffender cut reoffende be strategy for cut crime keep the public safe and help ex prisoner to turn their life around be sure that the sentencing review will look carefully at short sentence call the shadow minister want to see justice deliver more consistently for victim be the key reason seek election to this place so it be an enormous privilege to take up this role today in response to concern raise last month about offender who have be release early not be promptly tag the secretary of state assure the house that she will monitor performance daily can the government now provide concrete assurance to the house and the public that all offender be be tag as they should on release welcome the shadow minister to his place have always enjoy his contribution to justice debate so look forward to work with he where appropriate after the department daily monitoring indeed monitor many time day can confirm that the performance of serco on tagging have improve significantly as of october of all tranche release visit to install tag have be complete with small number of prearranged alternative fitting also schedule they be now all cover of course tagging will protect the public only if curfew breach be address swiftly can the secretary of state tell we whether there have be any breach of tag monitor curfew on average how quickly be those who commit breach bring back into custody the hon gentleman question be really about rate of recall which be what happen when licence condition be breach include breach of curfew recall rate for release be track similarly to recall rate for other offender we will publish those statistic once they have be assure in the usual way which believe will be immediately after christmas early release scheme housing demand what assessment she have make of the potential impact of recent change to the early release scheme on the demand for housing provide by local authority with this government scheme unlike the previous government rush scheme we be give our excellent staff time to work with national and local housing partner to minimise any impact on local authority give that secure housing on release have prove positive impact on the recidivism rate of ex offender which be something we all welcome how many prisoner release early by this government be be house in hotel few than education and training for prisoners what assessment she have make of the effectiveness of education and training provide to prisoner we have reduce overcrowding to ensure that prison have the capacity to focus on education and training for example hmp highpoint state of the art rail centre of excellence give prisoner industry standard training and guarantee employment on release couple of week ago visit the bronzefield category woman prison in my spelthorne constituency see that prisoner do work be reward with small amount of money but the weighting of their pay preferred people who take part in numeracy and literacy over skill such as work in the bicycle repair shop or the hair salon be that national approach or be it something the governor have do pragmatically to fit his personal circumstance it sound like an interesting approach would be grateful if the hon gentleman write to so that can look into it and write back to he it be certainly the sort of thing we need to be look at join the right hon member for basildon and billericay mr holden in call for the government to consider the child of prisoner meet the child minister my hon friend the member for lewisham east janet daby just last week and know it be very much on her radar however this be an urgent issue this week have be tell about child who have be live alone for month because the authority simply do not know that their parent be in prison order that be not relevant to the question minister would you like to respond no in which case we will leave it there foreign national offenders what step she be take through the criminal justice system to facilitate the removal of foreign national offender from the uk how many foreign national offender be remove from the uk through prison transfer agreement in each year since share the public view that there be far too many foreign national offender in our prison since come into office we have return more than foreign offender and be pleased to say we be on track to remove more foreign offender this year than at any time in recent year some of the prison population in england and wales be foreign national offender so what specific action be the justice secretary take to remove fno from our prison and return they to their country include through the use of the prisoner transfer agreement that be put in place by the previous government as say we be on track to remove more foreign offender this year than in previous year in fact over the period when the shadow justice secretary be the immigration minister in the previous government the number return be around we have already return more than foreign offender utilise all the prisoner transfer agreement at our disposal we be actively try to negotiate more such agreement so that we can continue to speed up removal from this country the previous government negotiate scheme by which we can deport albanian prisoner back to albania it be an excellent scheme albania be completely safe country of course give that those cross the channel be commit an illegal offence be there anything legally to stop we arrest they and put they on flight straight to albania we do not even need to lock they up in albania they can just start their journey all over again what good deterrent as the right hon gentleman well know we have legal obligation to those who arrive in this country that have to play out however pta relate to those who have commit an offence have be convict and be be hold in the prison estate they can therefore be remove from this country under prisoner transfer agreement we be work with the albanians to ensure that the pta with albania be as effective as possible will my right hon friend consider stand alone deportation order as part of the sentencing review so that rather than taxpayer have to pay to imprison foreign offender for year on end those offender be deport back to their country of origin personally be of the view that deportation for somebody who have be convict and be due to be imprison in our country be as good punishment as serve time in prison in this country we be look actively at what more we can do to make the early removal scheme as effective as possible include potential option to bring forward the point of early removal from this country will be work with colleague in the home office as we develop our plan in this area topical questions one of my constituent order this be the first topical question if she will make statement on her departmental responsibility think member from all party need reminder about the form in this house for oral question mr speaker since the last justice question have launch an independent review of sentencing it will ensure that there be always space for dangerous offender in our prison and that we expand the use of punishment outside prison so that no government be ever force to release prisoner early again the government have also introduce their first budget and we have see an additional million of funding for the ministry of justice note the arrival of the new shadow justice secretary the right hon member for newark robert jenrick while rumour have it that this job be not

constituent he be welcome to write to with the specific detail and will ensure he get meeting with the relevant minister early this year it be report that over case at ipswich crown court be outstanding at the last count each case be take an average of day to be deal with with case unresolved for two year or more what can the minister do to reassure my constituent as we look to clear the

particular the south east region have begin send appropriate case to cambridge crown court for hear nationally we have increase the number of crown court sit day to which be more than agree by the previous lord chancellor call the shadow secretary of state police firearm officer sergeant blake be hero and we all want to see individual like he who put themselves in the line of fire respect what work be the lord chancellor do alongside the home secretary to review the threshold for prosecution for individual such as sergeant blake so that they never find themselves in the invidious position that he do thank the shadow secretary of state for his question he will be aware that charge decision be matter for the independent crown prosecution service what the home secretary have announce and what have be work with she on be the introduction of presumption of anonymity for all firearm officer if they find themselves be charge by the cps we believe that such measure could have make difference in this case the home secretary have also announce measure that result from the police accountability review work undertake by the previous government and we be take those forward thank the lord chancellor for her answer jonathan hall kc the reviewer of terrorist law have say that the authority should put as much information as they can in the public domain to maintain public trust in

fact of the case can the secretary of state explain the report two week delay between the cps make charge decision with respect to the alleged southport attacker and it be announce to the general public as the right hon member be now the shadow lord chancellor may remind he that we do not comment on case that be sub judice that include commentary that everyone be aware relate to case currently go through our legal process what will say be that those be independent decision for the crown prosecution service which ultimately decide what charge to bring in live police investigation into complex case it be appropriate that those investigation the charge decision and ultimately the case be do by the independent part of the process and that there be no interference from government may

approach be meet survive economic abuse this afternoon we have great relationship with that organisation to see how good we can do more and support victim wonder if ministers be as astounded as be that conservative members be still attack we as the shadow justice secretary do at the start of this question time for clear up their mess in the criminal justice system will the government commit to increase capacity in our prison system so that we can deal with the crisis that the conservatives run away from the shadow secretary of state have not necessarily be in position long enough to have acquaint himself with all aspect of his government performance in this area we will spend more this year on build the prison place that the last government fail to deliver and we have launch our landmark sentencing review to ensure that we never again have to make emergency release hmp garth have be liken to an airport because of the number of drone that illegally fly drug into that prison what urgent action be the lord chancellor take to end that unacceptable situation drug get into prison be huge issue and be very aware of the issue at garth the minister with responsibility for prison will meet the governor and think about how to deal with those problem in the medium and long term there be welcome news for the ministry of justice in the budget last week but do not hear any mention of legal aid funding when will the criminal legal aid advisory board recommendation and the civil legal aid review be publish and when can we expect to see some reversal of the catastrophic cut make to legal aid and advice since we will publish our response to the crime lower consultation in matter of week anticipate be able to publish the claab report at that stage and some of the document relate to the review of civil legal aid before the end of this year flight cancellations urgent question to ask the secretary of state for transport if she will make statement on the ongoing connectivity issue cause by belatedly announce cancellation of flight such as those between belfast and london thank the hon gentleman for an opportunity to talk about these important issue it be unusual that we be do so in an urgent question not in an adjournment debate which be the debate in which he normally intervene have go soft know that the issue of connectivity across the uk be of great interest to the hon gentleman and many of his constituent as connectivity strengthen the bond between our community cancellation affect passenger and business who rely on punctual service and connection and have an impact on confidence it be the responsibility of airline and airport to work together to minimise delay and cancellation connectivity across our country be vital the government jointly fund three public service obligation route to london include from derry londonderry however the uk aviation market operate predominantly in the private sector and it be for airport to invest in their infrastructure and for airline to determine the route that they operate recognise the importance of belfast city and belfast international airport for local community and business the department for transport be actively engage with regional airport include those in northern ireland to understand how the government can support and unlock opportunity for growth thank the minister for that answer northern ireland be an integral part of the united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland we would not have united kingdom without she and member in this chamber would be lot poor for the lack of northern ireland we be thankful to be part of these british isle and have fight hard to remain so however be part constitutionally and be part practically be very different thing and the fact be that people need to take plane or boat to come across to the mainland three million passenger travel on schedule domestic flight in the uk between july and september and the third and fourth most popular route be between belfast and london we have huge share of domestic route and the reason be clear people in these part of the united kingdom have such strong link and such strong need to go between they yesterday cancellation text be send to passenger book on flight from belfast city airport to london city airport the passenger on that flight be not simply frustrated businessman and woman they include disabled person who have arrange special assistance person on their way to health appointment in london and family get connect flight to their holiday destination we understand that bad weather can affect flight pattern and sometimes these thing be unavoidable but my understanding be that yesterday flight be cancel back in september it be the flight that never be they take our money take our boarding pass and let we through security but the plane be not there it be quite unbelievable the person go to the london hospital be book on flight seven hour later completely miss their appointment for the business people their day be go the holidaymaker connection have fly those attend great ormond street child hospital or other hospital miss appointment as do businessman and businesswoman the whole thing be unbelievable there be no announcement in belfast city airport although we be all wait for the flight that never people from across northern ireland could understand if this be an anomaly but it be fast become norm one that will affect business investment and tourism in northern ireland procedure need to be urgently review there be to be additional air passenger duty hope that some of the additional money raise from people travel within the uk can be use to ensure that airline live up to their responsibility and maintain connectivity as priority thank you for grant this urgent question mr speaker and thank the minister as well the limit be normally two minute know you be make up for that flight yesterday and of course the house miss you that be why you get the uq business and tourism be vital for growth as the hon gentleman say we do have some connectivity problem and cancellation due to storm ashley recently and be sorry to hear about his constituent miss appointment particularly his disabled constituent the secretary of state will lead work in this space because accessibility on flight be vital belfast be still serve by to flight day and suggest that the hon gentleman take the issue up with airline and the airport call the chair of the select committee last month flight between belfast city and heathrow be cancel and can only imagine how difficult that must be for member from northern ireland and their constituent the previous transport committee in its aviation reform inquiry recommend that the government revise the public service obligation route and the subsidy to improve domestic air connectivity do the minister agree that that be important to connect northern ireland with the rest of the uk and will he bring forward work on that thank the chair of the transport committee for the excellent work that she do in this field cancellation be bad for business tourism and passenger the public service obligation arrangement come up for renewal regularly and think that flight price connectivity and cancellation should be look at in the round when we come to renew they flight cancellation be significant issue that we take seriously in government and work across the sector to tackle be proud that in government we publish the aviation passenger charter which include clear advice on how passenger can resolve issue to do with cancel and delay flight as well as miss baggage and the right of disabled passenger in we halve air passenger duty for domestic flight we also make commitment to strengthen the power of the civil aviation authority do the minister intend to take that forward when in government we also publish flight path to the future which include substantial framework for increase the efficiency of the aviation system and support passenger as we move far towards the goal of sustainable aviation what further step will the minister take to ensure that the measure that we set out to improve the aviation sector and the passenger experience be take forward frankly this government have fail the public so far last week budget be in large part an attack on worker business farmer and the aviation sector the government decision to increase air passenger duty have lead to worried response from the passenger aviation sector and ryanair have already announce its intention of cut flight to and from uk airport by the government have so far show themselves to be deeply uninterested in the consequence of their action for worker farmer and now air passenger more in hope than expectation ask the minister what step will the government take to improve the relationship with the passenger aviation sector and ensure that passenger be well serve say with all candour to the hon gentleman that remember that during covid shadow this brief at the time there be no specific package for airline airport or airport handler that mean that we come out of covid in much bad position than we would have if the government have implement their own treasury proposal we will take no lecture about our support for aviation on his question about right for passenger we will look at strengthen those go forward apd go up by less than inflation it have not be increase in number of year but refer he to the treasury for more detailed answer on tax matter think we have finally figure out why the shadow secretary of state for northern ireland have not yet be able to make it to northern ireland thank the government and the northern ireland executive for their recent commitment to the city of derry airport the public service obligation on the heathrow route be very important for connectivity to the north west of ireland when the minister review the pso for the next tranche of funding we hope to get will he do some work with the airline to bring fare down they be out of reach for many people in the area thank the hon gentleman for all he do in this space join he in encourage the shadow secretary of state to go to northern ireland which be fine country the hon gentleman know that visit regularly come through belfast and derry londonderry it be great place to live visit work and do business on the specific point about price think there be flight or more week in summer from derry londonderry which be well connected suggest that the hon member get involve with the airline and the airport owner but yes we can look at that when we come up to review the public sector obligation call the liberal democrat spokesperson thank you very much mr speaker can sympathise with the hon member for strangford jim shannon and thank he for table the urgent question because we consistently have the same problem at edinburgh and other scottish airport with lack of connectivity and the disruption that that cause understand that the weather be key reason for the delay this weekend but another be delay at air traffic control which be under pressure because of staff shortage and rise traffic eurocontrol the main organisation support european airspace have warn that to keep passenger safe and stop disruption well co ordination be require between aircraft operator airport and other across the continent will the minister tell what conversation the secretary of state have have with european partner on build resilience in air traffic control do the government have confidence in the robustness of air traffic control in the uk to serve our connectivity properly official engage regularly with their counterpart across europe and the european union the government have commit to airspace modernisation which will improve resilience look forward to support from liberal democrat members in the near future as we progress towards modernise airspace right across our great nation and nation thank the minister for his response and for reiterate the importance of get regional air connection right as that can help to underpin economic growth hope he agree that we should not allow ourselves to be distract do he agree that large part of our country could be well serve by well regional rail connection which would hopefully reduce some of the congestion at our airport public transport penetration within an hour of an airport be vital and be key performance indicator for how airport can grow and serve people well well rail well bus well road link and well active travel to our airport be critical for this industry aberdeen airport be another that struggle with cancel flight over of flight be cancel last year which make it one of the airport with the high cancellation rate in the country do the minister agree that we must make sure that all our region in the uk include scotland have reliable connection especially to london for thing such as business travel link our rural community to urban centre be really important so what can his government do to make sure that those thing improve thank the hon member for stand up for her local airport in aberdeen as someone who recently catch connect flight in manchester from newquay go on to aberdeen can say that loganair provide an excellent service it be great honour to visit aberdeen airport recently to see its helicopter base for north sea oil and its importance to the transition that we will begin with our clean energy mission suggest that the hon member take that up with andy the chief executive there and perhaps the new director of corporate affair gavin newlands the former mp for paisley there be no public flight from north wales to london so we depend on train traveller on avanti west coast north wales service endure chronic overcrowding reduce direct service to london since covid roll stock breakdown and on the day cancellation three to four time high than the rest of the avanti network that franchise run to what be the government do to make sure that avanti offer the people of north wales and their economy decent order come on that be not even link to flight it be about train interruption no let we not kid each other there be no point waste time let have someone else who will ask the right question call wendy morton as the hon member for strangford jim shannon highlight reliable regional connectivity matter when the minister be look at public service obligation route will he consider also look at the transparency of the datum come out of those route at reliability and at penalty for failure it can not be right that somebody get the additional stress of cancel flight when they be try to get to hospital appointment people should not be miss hospital appointment because of cancel plane in the aviation sector yes agree with the right hon member it be consider question and when contract come up for renewal we must consider they in the round to see how good they can serve the need of the travel public thank you for grant this urgent question mr speaker which as have be outline be important to many of our constituent when we sit in the airport lounge and talk to people who have have flight delay we see their frustration suspect however that you wish you have cancel this urgent question my hon friend the member for strangford jim shannon delay land it and take so long that see you get increasingly uneasy as you be listen to he increasingly we be find flight delay by one company in particular british airways which have monopoly on these flight there be an economic lesson to be learn which be that monopoly be abuse one have only to look at the price charge on some occasion when someone could fly to australia cheap than they can fly to london with british airways sometimes ba give technical reason or weather reason for delay flight but often it be because plane be not full and it amalgamate flight will the minister commit to investigate with ba why the belfast route be order think you be jim shannon in disguise come on minister we be struggle to get the question land we have be taxi for bit and now we be ready for take off do not want to pick on particular airline but be discuss regional connectivity in the uk with airline ceo which think be vital that be the point the right hon member make point out gently that belfast international be great airport to fly through and it be well serve not just by single operator it have multiple operator serve multiple airport particularly in the south east in his early answer the minister speak about growth and connectivity be important how do the increase the holiday tax being add to airport duty make difference especially when ryanair have announce that it be go to cut million seat that will have dramatic impact on anyone want to travel within the uk and across europe what impact assessment will the government carry out to ensure connectivity remind the hon member that as tax air passenger duty be matter for his majesty treasury in the budget we announce apd rate from to to account for the previous extraordinarily high inflation under the conservative party and to ensure that the aviation industry continue to contribute fair share to the public finance give the dissatisfaction we be hear about connectivity in northern ireland which be critical part of the uk it seem to that in the next review of the public service obligation the minister must commit to include belfast city airport and review of the operator will he do so that be good question but would do that automatically and extend that to the other part of our great nation where the public service obligation apply let we not forget city of derry airport which be vital for the economy of the north west in that fantastic part of our nation everyone understand that there be cancellation due to weather and other issue beyond the control of airline but will the minister meet the like of ba to ensure that it understand the need for reliability and for information to be give to customer as quickly and promptly as possible so that they can take step to make alternative arrangement if possible thank the hon member for his question recently meet the chief executive of british airways and raise regional connectivity do the minister agree that good transport link between the rest of the united kingdom and northern ireland be vital for business and tourism and that delay and cancellation look extremely bad in the eye of the public will he commit to contact ba to try to resolve these issue refer the hon member to my previous answer have already raise regional connectivity with ba and other airline odhran dunne chief executive officer of visit derry have say there be fantastic buzz around that airport at the moment and around what be happen in the north west it be great to see the work go on with the northern ireland executive in support that airport which be driver of the regional economy what support will the government provide to northern ireland airport to ensure our continued and improve connectivity the previous government promise million to belfast international airport in my constituency under round of the levelling up fund which would create job reduce air and noise pollution and improve the passenger experience will the minister provide an update on that it be great that the northern ireland executive be up and run in the devolution settlement they will be get more money and it be matter for they how they spend it on northern ireland and particularly belfast only this week easyjet the big airline operate out of there provide million seat have introduce new route to prague and marrakech and new aircraft the future be bright for aviation in the province what conclusion do the minister draw from the fact that dubious cancellation such as those we see yesterday be far more prevalent where there be commercial monopoly on the route such as there be between belfast city and london city airport which be the route affect yesterday if he draw the conclusion that connectivity be not help by monopoly what action do the government intend to take to encourage competition on such route the hon and learn member state that case but there be very open market in connectivity with number of airline fly from northern ireland and belfast in particular to the south east and other uk destination refer he to my previous answer when public service obligation come to be review we will look at the matter in the round rest assure that be keen on connectivity between our great nation bill present tobacco and vapes bill presentation and first reading standing order no secretary wes streeting support by the chancellor of the exchequer secretary yvette cooper secretary shabana mahmood secretary jonathan reynolds secretary hilary benn secretary ian murray secretary bridget phillipson secretary jo stevens secretary steve reed and andrew gwynne present bill to make provision about the supply of tobacco vape and other product include provision prohibit the sale of tobacco to people bear on or after january and provision about the licensing of retail sale and the registration of retailer to enable product and information requirement to be impose in connection with tobacco vape and other product to control the advertising and promotion of tobacco vape and other product and to make provision about smoke free place vape free place and heated tobacco free place bill read the first time to be read second time tomorrow and to be print bill with explanatory note bill en poly and perfluorinated alkyl substances guidance motion for leave to bring in bill standing order no beg to move that leave be give to bring in bill to require the chief inspector of drinking water to issue guidance to water company on poly and perfluorinated alkyl substance in drinking water and for connected purpose decrease fertility thyroid disease miscarriage reduce sperm quality cancer what do all those condition have in common they have all be link to the pervasive presence of pfas perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substance well know as forever chemical pfas be use to make material heat water flame or stain resistant they be find in thousand of everyday product from teflon frying plan to raincoat to our toiletry their bond be one of the strong in nature able to stay intact for decade in fact those chemical be so long lasting that scientist have not yet be able reliably to identify how long it might take to break they down because they be so difficult to break down once they get into our environment and our drinking water pfas can easily build up in our body they can enter our bloodstream and even be pass on to our child through breast milk that have severe implication for intergenerational health study have find that child expose to pfas build up be at increase risk of low birth weight weak bone and immune resistance to vaccination pfas chemical be forever and they be everywhere these chemical be in the water we drink the clothe we wear the food we eat and even in the rain that fall from our sky pfas affect every single one of we young and old pfas be all pervasive which make the scale of the challenge incredibly daunting but we must start somewhere and that be why be call for the government to start with our drinking water despite all the alarming health risk have just outline there be currently no statutory regulation of pfas chemical in england and wales and no legal limit on the amount of pfas present in our drinking water there be only guidance that water be wholesome and limit of microgram for only out of the thousand of exist pfas chemical it be fair to say that the presence of carcinogenic non degradable forever chemical make our water far from wholesome and instead akin to chemical cocktail that desperately need regulation should stress that these chemical be synthetic not natural before their manufacture start in the late no pfas be present in our environment it be an injustice to future generation that they should have to suffer the consequence of exposure to these chemical before they be even bear people may ask be pfas threat to we here in the uk yes they be and have only to look at my constituency to see it the river thames be at the beat heart of our community where kayaker paddle boarder and swimmer enjoy the river every day yet the busy stretch of the river thames in teddington in my constituency have the sixth great concentration of pfas in the uk between and it be time above the safe level set out by the eu whose standard will come to later the thames be notoriously polluted river but concern about our local water quality increase follow proposal by thames water to construct the teddington direct river abstraction scheme which would pump treat effluent into our precious waterway it have be promise that the treat effluent would be the same quality as the river itself yet there have be no assurance that compound and chemical such as pfas would be filter out when it come to raw sewage spill the marine conservation society note that there be no legal requirement for water company to monitor for pfas in sewer overflow study conduct by the university of portsmouth find that follow sewage discharge in langstone harbour the amount of one particular pfas perfluorobutanoic acid or pfba in seaweed be more than time high than in the surround water can we therefore rely on mere guidance to make water company take step to filter out these dangerous pfas chemical from our water sadly do not think so trust in water company be at an all time low thank to eye water bill the billion of litre of water lose through leak sky high bonus and illegal sewage dumping against that backdrop it be no surprise that people do not trust water company to safeguard our water quality it be my belief that these water company will only take step if we make they do so with bind limit set in law exist guidance have fail to restrict the presence of pfas accord to the wildlife and countryside link not single english river be in good chemical health analysis by the royal society of chemistry have reveal that more than third of watercourse in england and wales contain medium or high risk level of pfas and just more than third also contain two highly toxic pfa that have be ban internationally however official monitoring datum cover only handful of pfas chemical and not all river be test so actual pollution level could be even bad although welcome the new government move to ban pfas chemical present in firefighting foam which be significant source of pfas further action be need the previous government sit on their hand and ignore this emerge health threat but as we discover more and more health risk from pfas chemical every day it be clear that they must be regulate more tightly as chemical group not as and when the threat be slowly identify we all deserve access to clean water that do not put our health at risk this be not radical action as both the eu and us have take significant stride to tackle pfas pollution in recognition of the multitude of health concern link to the chemical the us have introduce limit of nanogram per litre for perfluorooctane sulfonic acid or pfos and perfluorooctanoic acid or pfoa while from january eu member state will have to ensure that the sum of all pfas in drinking water do not go above limit of microgram per litre sadly brexit have mean that in the three and half year since the uk leave the eu registration evaluation authorisation and restriction of chemicals regulation the eu system of regulating chemical our response to the grow threat of pfas have move at snail pace and we have fall behind other than one internationally ban substance not single restriction on harmful substance have be adopt since the uk leave eu reach in that be in part due to the uk no long have access to the world most comprehensive chemical registration database hold by the european chemicals agency we must now go through duplicate process for regulatory decision making there be clear need for european alignment and sincerely hope that the government will keep their manifesto promise to see that through it be also worth note that scotland adhere to eu guideline so it will be english and welsh citizen who be leave without the protection our neighbour enjoy which be bizarre misalignment if we do not regulate pfas as chemical group we risk equally toxic new pollutant replace the one we regulate we risk become dumping ground for product with ban pfas we risk become the dirty man of europe in the health and safety executive identify pfas chemical as risk for consumer exposure and recommend legislation to limit the presence of these chemical in our drinking water sadly the previous government do nothing but my cross party bill provide golden opportunity for the new government to act to stem the untold harm be unleash on our land water and people and to answer the call of the hundred of group and hundred of thousand of citizen who be demand action only last month of the world lead scientist write to the government urge they to adopt more ambitious approach to the regulation of pfas by regulate it as group surely it be time to listen finally want to thank the organisation who have support with this bill and have long champion the cause well before become aware of it include the royal society of chemistry uk chem trust wildlife and countryside link and the marine conservation society they and many other be dedicate to ensure that we have country where we can safely enjoy nature and preserve people health for generation to come ultimately this be not only about we but about our child and our child child there be no well legacy we can pass on to they than to safeguard their health as good we can this bill would be significant step towards achieve that question put and agree to order that munira wilson tim farron alex sobel james maccleary alberto costa edward morello ellie chowns sarah olney ruth cadbury david chadwick cameron thomas and mr joshua reynolds present the bill munira wilson accordingly present the bill bill read the first time to be read second time on friday january and to be

the public interest that this resolution should have statutory effect under the provision of the provisional collection of taxes act this budget be the moment we turn the page on year of tory neglect

hospital by the former health secretary tell the house that the funding have be provide put aside the fact that there be never actually new hospital plan be inform in july not only that the programme be year behind schedule but that the funding be to run out in march the only place those hospital exist be in boris johnson imagination the conservatives promise to cap social care cost by october just month after the general election but there be not single penny set aside to pay for it the cupboard be completely bare within week of the general election council be warn that it would be impossible to implement the cap by next october because the preparation have not be make those be fantasy pledge that the conservative never intend on keep rise be happy to give way to the hon gentleman to tell we why on the new hospital programme the government commit in the budget to move swiftly to rebuild reinforce autoclaved aerate concrete hospital the queen elizabeth hospital in king lynn be keen to make progress with its plan will he meet and the trust so that we can unlock the funding and get that hospital ready by that be commitment that we have make and commitment that we will keep be happy to ensure that the hon member can meet the relevant minister and project team as we get under way on deliver that project do actually go back to check the pledge make by the conservative party in its manifesto just to see how extensive the work of fiction be only to find that the manifesto page on its website now read page not find the truth be have the conservatives win the election it would have be delete just as quickly that be not all be tell when become secretary of state in july despite month of strike in the nhs there be no funding put aside to end the junior doctor dispute what be more the previous health secretary have not meet the resident doctor since march the conservatives have give up even attempt to end the strike people should remember that this winter for all the challenge that the nhs will face this will be the first winter in three year when nhs staff will be on the frontline not the picket line that be the difference that labour budget make be tell that gps would be qualify this year with no job to go into the government find the funding and we be hire an extra gps this year that be the difference that labour budget make on the budget gps hospice and care home have be find to be either exempt or not exempt from the national insurance contribution will he clarify whether hospice care home and primary care be exempt or not that really matter to their cost be grateful for that intervention for two reason first it give an opportunity to say to gps hospice and other part of the health and care system that will be affect by employer national insurance contribution change that be well aware of the pressure we have not make allocation for the year ahead and will take those representation seriously secondly it give chance to ask the hon member and the opposition do they support the investment or not be they choose to invest in the nhs or not they be now confront with the hard reality of opposition just as when we be in opposition we have to set out how much every single one of our policy would cost and how those would be fund they have to do that now if they oppose the investment they have to tell we where they would make the cut in the nhs if they oppose the investment they have to tell we where they would make the cut in school budget those be the choice that we have make and we stand by those choice the opposition will have to set out their choice too be tell that because the conservatives have run up huge deficit in nhs finance would not be able to deliver the extra appointment week that we have promise in fact be tell that we would have to cut appointment week instead the chancellor and be not prepared to see waiting list rise far she put the funding in and an extra patient will be treat by the nhs each week that be the difference that labour budget make it would be churlish of anybody in the house not to welcome the billion that have be allocate to the nhs everyone across this great united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland will benefit from that number of my gp surgery have contact about their national insurance contribution which they see as catalyst to perhaps not be able to deliver what they want to do for their patient understand that the labour party and government be look at that in consensual way can the secretary of state please give the late position so that can go back to my gps and tell they this have be look at and there will be something come be grateful for that intervention it be of course for the devolved administration to decide how to use the barnett consequential that the generous uplift in funding provide by the chancellor will provide we make no bone about it we have to make some difficult choice in the budget to plug the billion black hole that we inherit to deliver on our promise and to ensure that we be fix the foundation of our economy and our public service we have ask business and some of the wealthy to make contribution say to people right across the house that they can not welcome the investment at the same time as oppose the mean to raise it if they do they have to explain how they would find the money congratulate my right hon friend on his success in get this extra money for our national health service which be incredibly need he speak about the extra gps that he be take on the doctor surgery in staveley in my constituency have tell that surgery in the most deprived community see patient two or three time year more than those in wealthy area will he say something about how we ensure that the extra gps we get look in particular at those more deprived community that have great health inequality and need more appointment my hon friend be absolutely right about equity and fairness of access the government be determined to close the gap in healthy life expectancy and health inequality that blight our nation gps and primary care be an important part of do that unless we fix the front door to the nhs in primary care we will not solve our nhs crisis unless we address the crisis in social care we will not fix the nhs crisis we will be able to do that only if we do so right across the country fully understand the crisis that the secretary of state inherit he will be aware that most hospital be run at deficit many have substantial debt and many be spend up to of their income on service private finance initiative be his department prepare to make some kind of intervention to reduce that burden perhaps by take over the pfi directly in order for our hospital to be able to spend more on what they be there for which be of course patient care be grateful for that intervention the right hon gentleman be absolutely right that we walk into position of enormous deficit in the nhs and an enormous black hole in the public finance be leave by the last government that be why we have have to make some difficult choice that be why we have to learn from the mistake of the past and not repeat they in future we be do as much as we can as fast as we can that be why it be important that the chancellor make the bold choice she do in her budget so that as well as plug the black hole we be fix the foundation thank to the fiscal rule adopt by the chancellor we will ensure that the government do not repeat the waste the profligacy and the irresponsible spending of our conservative predecessor will the secretary of state give way will make some more progress speak of the conservative party welcome the right hon member for melton and syston edward argar to his new position as the shadow health and social care secretary the good job in the opposition in the two and half year that do his job face five health secretaries be determined to make sure he face only one have differ relationship with each of my predecessor at well we go hammer and tong in this place thrash out our disagreement but we would also get on the phone and work together in the national interest particularly during covid when have particularly constructive work relationship with sir sajid javid hope we can work together in that spirit if he have any idea to fix our break nhs be all ear he just need to go to as hundred of thousand of people across the country have already do must disappoint he however will not be fire out of cannon choose to serve be not always easy especially in job as thankless as be member of his majesty loyal opposition let applaud the right hon gentleman for step up to the plate have do his job until recently have some advice first it be easy to oppose for opposition sake but the public will rightly expect he to have an alternative the leader of the opposition refuse to say at the weekend how conservative members will vote on the budget apparently whether they support or oppose billion of investment in our nhs be to quote she inside baseball if the conservative finally decide to oppose the chancellor measure they will need to say what they would do instead would they keep our investment in the nhs if so how would they pay for it would they cancel our investment and the extra appointment send doctor and nurse back out on strike or cause waiting list to soar even higher the conservative party have to choose at the moment our only clue about the future of the party be the leader of the opposition comment about charge patient to use the nhs she give an interview to the times just week ago in which on the principle that the nhs should be free at the point of use she say we need to have serious cross party national conversation be happy for the conservative party to start that conversation any time as far as be concern it will be short debate and we will win the answer be no the labour party will never surrender on the principle of the nhs be public service publicly fund and free at the point of use it be time that the leader of the opposition make her position clear although she have take to opposition with such vigour she tend to oppose thing she say herself only day before welcome the leader of the opposition call for honesty the public have lose trust in politic and we all have responsibility to rebuild it if we be not honest about the scale of the challenge and its cause we have no hope of fix they would it not be welcome start to the role if the new shadow secretary of state admit what mess his party make of our national health service and say sorry it be not all the right hon gentleman fault in fact he and have something in common when he walk into the department in he also inherit waiting list already at record level it be true that waiting list soar even far during the pandemic but they be already at record level before and they continue to rise afterwards because of the damage that the conservative party do to our nhs the darzi investigation be clear about what be to blame the top down reorganisation the chronic under investment and the undoing of the last labour government reform that see nhs productivity fall off cliff can the shadow health and social care secretary do what his predecessor could not and accept the doctor diagnosis do this new conservative leadership finally accept lord darzi finding if the right hon gentleman can not accept the work of an eminent cancer surgeon who have serve both labour and conservative governments wonder if he might agree with this damn assessment of his party record make by one of his former colleague british citizen have the bad rate of life expectancy in western europe we have high avoidable mortality rate than our neighbour survival rate for breast cervical rectal lung stomach and colon cancer be low in the uk than in comparable jurisdiction nhs patient who suffer heart attack or stroke be more likely to die than in france spain the netherlands canada italy and new zealand more than seven million people be on waiting list every month ten of thousand wait more than hour for treatment after be admit to accident and emergency ward it be then no surprise that the number of wealthy patient opt to pay to be treat privately be at record level so we have two tier health system in this country in which the rich secure the good care those in pain wait in agony and those with life threaten condition know their treatment would be well in marseille or madrid than in manchester or middlesbrough the author of that quote be michael gove if he can be honest about the mess the conservatives make of the nhs hope the right hon gentleman can too while the conservatives work out what they stand for we be get on with clean up their mess rebuild our public service and reform our nhs as say before the election there be no point pour more money into broken system next week will set out package of reform to make sure that every penny go into the nhs be well spend and benefit patient unless be convinced that the money go in will deliver result it will not get out the door every bit of investment announce by the chancellor last week will be link to reform the budget will fund extra appointment week and the appointment will be deliver through reform way of work they be already be use in hospital across the river from here where operating theatre be run like formula pit stop we will get hospital motor right across the country use that reform way of working we be invest not just in new scanner but ai enable scanner that diagnose fast and more accurately increase productivity and bust the backlog of million patient wait for test and scan the investment in the budget have fire the starting pistol on the three shift that our year plan will deliver it increase the disabled facility grant to help people stay well independent and out of hospital fund an extra adaptation to people home we be raise the carer allowance worth an extra to family carer so that they can stay in work while look after their love one that be the big expansion of carer allowance since the we be expand nhs talk therapy to treat an extra mental health patient we be invest in brick and mortar outside of hospital open new mental health crisis centre and upgrade gp surgery congratulate the secretary of state on the extra investment that he have secure for the national health service in spite of the chancellor do he agree that primary care need to be diversify could he outline whether that include walk in centre if it do could have meeting to discuss new walk in centre at fareham community hospital in my constituency be not sure whether this be within the rule of the house you will tell if not madam deputy speaker but will do the hon member deal if he vote for the investment he can have the meeting turn to the second of the big shift that we need from analogue to digital the darzi investigation find that the conservatives leave the nhs year behind the private sector on technology this budget invest billion to arm the nhs with modern technology so that staff spend less time push paper and more time on the frontline in that the nhs be still use paper record to store patient medical history be absurd and jeopardise patient safety the investment in this budget will provide every trust with electronic patient record and upgrade the nhs app so that patient can access care with few tap on their phone we be back british scientist and researcher to develop the treatment of the future with record investment in the national institute for health and care research support for life science innovation and strengthen the uk clinical trial network we be also shift from sickness to prevention today we have announce the big public sector health reform in generation we be raise the legal age at which people can buy tobacco by one year every year protect child and people from the harmful effect of second hand smoke outdoors as well as indoor we be crack down on the marketing and target of vape at child so that we can create the first ever smokefree generation unless we act on public health reform and public service reform the demand and cost on the nhs will spiral and the service will become unsustainable if we want the health service to survive and we do not want to pay ever high taxis to fund it we have to help people stay healthy prevention be well than cure that be why we be introduce the bill hope it will continue to command cross party support it be not just smoking obesity cost the nhs almost billion year that be why we have already introduce the motion to ban the targeting of junk food ad at kid we be strengthen council power to stop fast food shop set up outside school in the budget the chancellor increase the soft drink industry levy so that manufacturer continue to reduce their sugar content while we review the exemption for milk base drink madam deputy speaker as you know it be conservative chancellor who introduce the sugar tax and conservative prime minister who introduce the first tobacco and vapes bill because he be sensible know the shadow health and social care secretary will support those measure but can not say the same for the leader of the opposition so trap in the prison of ideological dogma be she so scared be she of the reform dog that be bark over their shoulder hope the shadow health secretary will continue to hold the torch for one nation conservatism even as its light dim in his party if we want to know when the conservative party have change maybe we will know when they have learn once again to love george osborne fix the foundation of the nhs start with fix its little foundation lord darzi point to how the conservatives raid capital budget time and again to plug the gap in day to day spending indeed that be the position we find ourselves walk into this year lord darzi call it combination of austerity and capital starvation the budget will begin to rebuild our nhs with the big capital investment since labour be last in office include billion to tackle dangerous raac reinforce autoclaved aerate concrete and the backlog of critical maintenance and repair across the nhs estate keep staff and patient safe and boost productivity in conclusion we can not fix year of mismanagement and neglect in one go but the budget mark an historic turning point for our country for year the conservative pretend that the problem face britain do not exist leave they to grow this week the chancellor run head first into those challenge take the tough difficult decision on tax spending and welfare because the choice be stark we could stick to the status quo of year of underinvestment that have knee cap our economy and cripple our nhs or we could begin to fix the foundation kick start the economy and rebuild our health service the choice the chancellor make will give the nhs the investment and reform it desperately need to cut waiting time rebuild crumble building arm nhs staff with modern technology get more out of the nhs for what we put in and fix the foundation and rebuild britain that be the change the country vote for that be the change this labour budget deliver it be pleasure and privilege to be work once again in health and social care although disappointment to be do it from the opposition benches it be privilege because like the secretary of state for health and social care now have the privilege in government of work with the amazing and dedicated people who work in our nhs and in social care up and down the country it be pleasure to be back it be pleasure to be opposite the secretary of state as he now be remember our tussle back in the day when be sit over there and he be sit here be sufficiently fond of the right hon gentleman to encourage he not to get himself fire out of cannon as he allude to although will say one thing for it it would not only draw attention to his day job but possibly even aid he in his ambition to secure his boss job in due course in respect of his comment about the leader of the opposition my right hon friend the member for north west essex mrs badenoch would only say very gently that she should probably take that as compliment when the right hon gentleman attack someone in that way it probably mean that they be somewhat frit of she think he will see in the come week and month why that be so we have already see and hear over the previous day of debate that this be unequivocally budget of broken promise despite the pledge make over the course of the election and the commitment give to the british people in reality those word mean nothing to the labour party once it secure the key to no instead we have see taxis hike on work people the people who provide food security and food every day our farmer hit hard by the change that have be make we see living standard set to fall and mortgage rate likely to rise we see taxis up we see borrow up we see debt up and we see that growth will be down on where it could and should be unfortunately fear that pattern of broken promise also apply to the nhs and our social care sector be grateful to the right hon gentleman for give way and congratulate he on his new appointment he be obviously very critical of the government attempt to alleviate the appalling financial legacy that his party bequeath to the nation do he support the extra investment for the health service and be it just the way of pay for it that he be against or be he actually oppose to it be very grateful to the hon gentleman in his allusion to the labour party inheritance he miss the fact that the office for budget responsibility singularly fail to back up the assertion make about the quantum of challenge the incoming government face time and again the right hon member for ilford north wes streeting both in opposition and now as secretary of state have promise that any more money for the nhs have to be link to reform he have do that again today the week before the budget he say that extra investment in the nhs must be link to reform in september the prime minister himself say no more money without reform they be right on that the opposition support that condition because it be only with reform that the nhs can sustainably continue to look after we for year to come yet fear that this risk be another broken promise say to he now that where he be bold and provide genuine reform to benefit patient he will have our support equally if he bow to internal pressure and back away from the radical reform that be need we will hold he to account will the right hon gentleman give way will make little progress before give way to the hon gentleman congratulate the health secretary on win round with the treasury look across the chamber and see the chief secretary to the treasury on the government front bench in secure extra investment he have secure more than billion announce for the nhs but without as yet any detailed indication of where that funding will go look forward to he return to the house to set out the detail think he say that would be next week what it must do be genuinely improve outcome for patient and our nhs rather than simply be focus on the headline figure of the input to it there be as yet no clue as to whether it will be spend on wage recruit more staff medicine or equipment no clue as to how it will deliver the additional appointment that have be promise and no condition link the funding as yet to productivity improvement modernisation or well outcome for patient what we need to hear next week from the secretary of state be an actual plan as he mention the right hon gentleman become shadow health secretary three year ago hope that in that time he have have an opportunity to think about what he want to do and that he will actually set that out to the house next week welcome the right hon gentleman to his new position on the theme of broken promise and capital investment and in the spirit of fresh start wonder whether he will extend an apology to my constituent who be promise new hospital under the new hospital programme which be never fund in any forward look budget document be grateful to the hon gentleman if he pause for just moment will turn to capital investment and seek to address his point will the shadow secretary of state give way on that point will make little progress but then will happily give way to my hon friend apart from the press release and the review where be the action we need to see where the billion will be spend what plan do the secretary of state have for additional investment for the nhs this winter he know as know when be minister that winter in the nhs be always challenge look forward to he set out what additional investment he plan on that point will give way to my hon friend the member for hamble valley paul holmes in second nice try secretary of state be the right hon gentleman direct where that nhs funding go himself or will it be for his official or nhs england to set the priority for that and who will be hold accountable for ensure that it be prioritise in the right place thank my right hon friend for give way and congratulate he on his appointment as shadow secretary of state do he share my concern that although the extra investment in the nhs be welcome the lack of clarity from budget in which growth have actually be revise down mean that in future year we could see additional investment in the nhs actually be cut back because the budget do not deliver the growth for public service investment my hon friend be absolutely right you can not tax your way to growth and you can not invest in public service without that growth if the prediction we be see about growth be bear out there be real risk to our public service sustainability in future the chancellor say that the funding would help to deliver more nhs appointment week but again we see no reference to specific action by which that will be achieve the government seem not to know the difference between target and plan and simply restate their ambition while throw money at the challenge will not be enough to deliver on that commitment as have say element of the budget relate to the department of health and social care be welcome one of they be the secretary of state one nil win over the chief secretary in respect of funding an additional billion to drive productivity be important fear that it be slimme down version of the billion nhs productivity plan that we announce and fund but will study it closely and similarly the secretary of state plan for mental health be deserve of serious study on both side of this chamber we recognise the importance in mental health investment of not only parity of esteem but parity of service and it be therefore right for we to scrutinise very carefully how the right hon gentleman intend to build far on the success that we have in drive that agenda forward let now turn to the subject of capital investment which be touch on by the hon member for kensington and bayswater joe powell it concern that as far as be aware the secretary of state have still not tell we exactly when his review of the new hospital programme will report and set out the future for each and every one of the hospital that he commit himself to deliver during the election campaign the programme to which the previous chancellor have commit funding build on the original billion allocate in the question for the government and the question for the chief secretary to answer when he wind up the debate be when will that review report and when will each and every one of those colleague and community who be look forward to new hospital know whether it will be deliver in line with the secretary of state pledge or whether the programme will be cut nearly week after the budget members will be familiar with the verdict of the office for budget responsibility namely that the billion assault on business risk low wage low living standard and low growth and let we not forget what this tax hike will mean for those provide essential service across primary secondary and social care the general practice care home adult social care provider community pharmacist on our high street hospice and charity such as marie curie and macmillan which provide additional care for patient alongside the nhs be deeply disappointed that the secretary of state do not take the opportunity offer by my hon friend the member for hinckley and bosworth dr evans to state clearly that all those group would be exempt and would not be hit by this hike and hope that when the chief secretary wind up the debate he will be able to give that reassurance the royal college of general practitioners have warn that the extra cost of the employer national insurance hike could force gp surgery to make redundancy or close altogether and the independent pharmacies association have warn that community pharmacy will have to find an extra year on average to pay for the hike welcome the right hon gentleman to his place be wait for the health secretary to turn to devolution issue but he never quite do we have particular issue in scotland up to million of extra cost will be force on to the nhs there because of that national insurance hike we have hear no commitment from the secretary of state that he will meet those cost in full and we look forward to hear such commitment be sure the right hon gentleman will share my concern about what this be do to devolve service across the united kingdom the hon gentleman be right to highlight the ill thought out consequence of this hike for hospice and general practice both in scotland and elsewhere would dearly love to be able to respond to his question sadly however be on this the side of the house and not the other side but be sure that the chief secretary will attempt to do so the nuffield trust have say that without additional financial support the tax raid be likely to force social care provider to pass high cost on to people who pay for their own care or potentially collapse financially charity be not exempt either as result of the increase in the national living wage and employer national insurance contribution one of the uk large social care charity say it be face an unfunded increase wage bill of million year and marie curie have warn that the rise in employer ni contribution will only serve to put the service that it deliver on behalf of the nhs under further pressure those charity will be look to the chief secretary to say what succour he can offer they in the form of an assurance that they will not be hit welcome the right hon gentleman to his place but before throw stone will he just remind the house that under his government plan there would have be billion less for the nhs leave it broken welcome the hon lady to her place as well think this be the first opportunity have have to respond to intervention or question from she in fact we put record funding into the billion per year and on top of that we recruit more doctor and more nurse we do not do that by pile tax hike on hospice and general practice among other be not sure how hit primary care social care or charity support nhs service will help the secretary of state to deliver his aim of cut waiting list hope that the chief secretary will tell the house what step the treasury be take to ensure that those organisation be not hit by these change let take moment to consider what be not include in the budget will the right hon gentleman give way will make bit of progress if may there be no plan for social care reform after the chancellor break labour promise to deliver the cap on social care cost hear what the secretary of state say about willingness to work on what be challenge face our whole country and society with an age population how do we address the challenge of social care there be no far detailed plan for nhs dentistry despite the election pledge to deliver more dental appointment there be no support for pharmacy or for the day to day running of general practice and there be still no additional resource for the nhs this winter or indeed the detail of reform to go with they the right hon gentleman speak about the investment that the last conservative government put into the nhs can he tell what the outcome of that investment be from my point of view the outcome be long waiting list poor health and bad patient care we increase investment significantly not only to tackle the inevitable consequence of global covid pandemic which as we all know hit our nhs hard but to build back well subsequently which be the task that we begin to perform we have always say that investment in the nhs must be marry to reform in order to deliver well patient outcome and value for money build on the reform that we introduce in the health and care act and ensure that the nhs will be there to look after we for decade to come the secretary of state have work with before and we will work with any party include his will the right hon gentleman give way give way to the hon gentleman early be afraid want to conclude my remark because be keen for other to have chance to speak that offer to the secretary of state stand be always happy to work constructively with he when he be willing to work constructively with he know that we have do that before not least as we emerge from the pandemic when be still minister in the department unfortunately despite the rhetoric fear that the budget be miss opportunity that will not achieve the ambition the government have set out as have say we can not tax our way to growth and without growth we can not sustainably fund public service urge the right hon gentleman to be brave to stand up to those in his party who would have he back down or water down reform and to deliver genuinely radical plan for the future of our nhs and for social care that work for those who work in it but also crucially for all the people who rely on it our constituent deserve nothing less from he call kate osamor thank you madam deputy speaker for call so early in the debate be not expect that very much welcome the investment in our nhs and our renew focus on public service the budget mark break from the approach of the last government who preside over the decline of our health system with this renew investment the big since there be now some hope that we can turn dire situation around we must improve patient outcome reduce waiting time and support the hard work staff who form the backbone of our health system however want to stress to the secretary of state my constituency neighbour that investment must focus not only on deliver number but on quality of care with human touch and equal access for all that require we to reject the creep privatisation of our health service which have prove costly inefficient and bad for patient before come to this house work in the nhs as practice manager in the london borough of enfield also work in an out of hour gp co operative which cover north and east london know from first hand experience that gp surgery and core nhs service must remain publicly own and accountable to their patient and staff the public and stakeholder furthermore have deep reservation about the current plan to grant the nhs datum platform contract to palantir which raise serious question about privacy security and the future of our nhs data infrastructure be listen very carefully to what the hon lady say about her experience as practice manager over this past weekend and the last two day have be contact by local practice in my constituency that be concerned about the impact of the national insurance change on their ability to provide patient care and the vital first step towards get people into the hospital and through the waiting list do the hon lady agree that we have to address that as fundamental problem that be potentially create by this budget thank the hon member for her intervention would add that it be important that patient doctor and everyone else be listen to be assure that the secretary of state will be listen to all voice nhs datum be public asset its management should be root firmly within the nhs not place in the hand of private interest especially those control by an individual who be so hostile to the principle of public healthcare our nhs thrive due to the work of everyone in the system from nurse to administrative staff and healthcare assistant who each play critical role in patient care we must listen to all nhs staff not just those in the highest rank medical role as everyone bring valuable frontline perspective on improve efficiency patient experience and accessibility especially draw attention to the hard work staff who provide out of hour service for our community often do so on top of their normal hour the government must ensure that those professional receive not only recognition but the resource and support they need to continue serve our community in this vital way staff in out of hour service often only work in such setting part time however they be often the last resort for people who be unable to get appointment with their gp or access the care they need we must also address the postcode lottery in healthcare for various condition disparity persist in access to specialist wait time and outcome in relation to area ethnicity and gender the stark reality be that mental health service remain woefully inadequate we face mental health crisis especially among young people and this impact on personal wellbeing and ruin life chance we urgently need target investment in mental health service and look forward to support the government in ensure that the crisis in mental health support be treat with the seriousness it demand this budget be strong step in the right direction but we must go far to ensure that the nhs remain public that mental health be prioritise and that all nhs staff have voice in shape the future of our health system ask the secretary of state to focus on all those area because believe that if we have consistent investment throughout this parliament we can ensure that we make progress towards an nhs that work and in which everyone be able to access the quality and timely care that they justly deserve call the liberal democrat spokesperson declare an interest as vice president of the local government association welcome the shadow secretary of state to his place he respond to my first adjournment debate on thursday before easter and be very grateful but he will be disappoint to hear that we have not see the improvement in ambulance response time that we would have like to see in shropshire last week budget bring billion of investment for the nhs by anybody standard that be big number so the liberal democrats welcome the investment the nhs be leave in dire state by the conservatives and it be clear that something radical must be do what be the conservatives legacy well we all know crumble hospital million people on nhs waiting list for secondary operation our constituent struggle to access gp when they need one dental desert such as the one in north shropshire appal ambulance wait time with horrify outcome and tsunami of mental health crisis wait to overwhelm we it be clear that investment be need which be why the liberal democrats put the nhs at the front of our election manifesto and our campaigning since it be very important that the billion be spend wisely to keep people healthy and to save money in the future so look forward to hear how the budget will affect the public health grant and mental health service in particular those be two really important area where we can invest to save taxpayer money and to get well health outcome for people and avoid their suffering in the future it be also really important that the billion of investment be not undermine by decision make by the same government on the very same day it be hard to believe that the decision to increase employer national insurance contribution and to lower the threshold at cost of per person be properly think through before the budget be deliver last wednesday that decision be go to hit gp practice hospice social care provider and the charity that provide so much additional care outside the formal nhs structure local gp get in touch with over the weekend to say that the decision will serve to directly undermine access and patient care at time when practice be already under strain due to year of neglect another say it will kill the family doctor why will it kill the family doctor because gp practice be not eligible for employment allowance they can not put up their price and their only option be to cut staff and service which would be disaster the conservative government prove that if we cut the number of gps we end up with really big problem in the nhs one that we be fight now labour plan to increase the number of gps which be welcome be surely in jeopardy because of the increase to employer nics the liberal democrats be call on the government to exempt gps from the nic hike or ensure that they be fund to cover it otherwise no one be go to see their gp within seven day right that the liberal democrats think people should have want to touch on social care which feel bit like the elephant in the room and be likely to be significantly affect by the change in threshold and rate of employer national insurance contribution we all know that the sector be in crisis and the budget take note of this but do not really go far enough to address it think we can all agree that we can not fix the nhs without fix social care we know that there be thousand of patient in hospital who be medically fit to be discharge and who would recover well in their own bed at home but who be stick in hospital because the social care package be not available to allow they to return home that bed block which be horrible term cause patient to be unable to flow through hospital when they be admit it cause the queue of or ambulance that we see outside hospital in shropshire on regular basis and it mean that those ambulance do not arrive when somebody be in life threaten position in their community social care be so important in deal with this urgent problem as the mp for south shropshire have be in the same meeting as the hon lady who represent north shropshire in shropshire about of council funding go to social care do the hon member believe that we need fair system to support funding for social care in shropshire fair funding for rural authority and indeed all local authority be something have talk about many time in this house and absolutely agree with the hon gentleman on that we see million allocate to social care in the budget and an increase in the national living wage both of which be obviously welcome but the huge pressure on private provider as result of the national insurance contribution increase will be really problematic unless council be fund to pay those additional cost it be not clear that the funding announce in the budget will even touch the side of the crisis in local government funding or in social care we all know that this be thorny problem and that fund social care be extremely expensive and difficult that be why cross party talk be so urgent urge the secretary of state to instigate those as soon as possible so that we can work towards permanent fix for social care liberal democrats believe that free personal care on the scotland model would be the good way of achieve that and the institute for public policy research say that we could save billion by by implement that model that would be good investment because it would save taxpayer money and it would keep people in their home where they want to be with dignity the debate today cover other public service and want to touch on couple education be an important one and we welcome the investment in it but want to talk bit about send budget and local authority school be under enormous pressure to provide send measure for the child they look after and local authority be under huge pressure to provide transport and specialist place the billion for local government will be insufficient to deal with social care the send crisis and send transport as the hon member for south shropshire stuart anderson mention shropshire council be spend about of its budget on social care so without adequate measure for social care it seem unlikely that this budget will address all the problem that local authority need to deal with we be therefore concerned about the decision to put vat on private school fee school such as oswestry school in my constituency take relatively large number of pupil who have fail to thrive in large setting they have special educational need but no education health and care plan and they might even have refuse school altogether there be risk that those child whose parent be save hard to put they into that alternative place will end up back in the state sector where their need be not meet they might refuse to go to school and the school would struggle to cope with those additional child the capital expenditure be welcome and hope that the demountable building at the corbet school in baschurch will benefit from that announcement but urge the government to reconsider some of those measure on transport it be disappointing to see the bus fare cap increase although in shropshire it will not make any difference because it be almost impossible to catch bus anywhere we would really like to see some of the detail behind the public transport plan announce by the chancellor particularly the bus service improvement plan that shropshire council have put forward and railway scheme such as the oswestry to berwyn line finally it may be stretch it to call this point about public service believe that farmer provide an essential public service in feed we look after the countryside and protect the rural environment and it be disappointing to see that there be confusion between the department for environment food and rural affairs and the treasury about how many farm will be affect my sense from talk to local farmer in shropshire be that the defra number be more accurate do the hon lady not see that by oppose every measure in the budget to raise money while support every measure to spend more money on our vital public service she be create big problem than the one we inherit from the last government thank the hon gentleman for his intervention the point that we be try to make be that some of the budget measure will cost extra money if we look at the detail on the national insurance contribution hike for example we see that change in behaviour and exemption for the nhs will reduce the amount of money raise to about billion we have absolutely put forward alternative measure to raise billion whether by reverse the tories cut to the banking taxis or by put taxis on online medium giant we would find alternative way to raise those fund the point about private school fee be the same if we overburden the state sector with child who have special educational need difficulty and disability those child will not have their need meet and that will cost we more in the future this be all about make sensible choice to save taxpayer money in the future and most importantly deliver public service to the people who need they most whether they be try to access nhs care or whether they need help to get through their school career in order to thrive and achieve their potential will the hon lady give way be just about to conclude so will carry on be about to talk about farmer and the concern difference between defra and the treasury on the number of farm that will be affect my sense from talk to farmer locally be that the defra number be more likely to be accurate and therefore think there may have be serious misstep in the plan to raise what will be relatively small amount of money liberal democrats welcome investment in the nhs we welcome the ambition to undo the damage work on this vital service by the previous government but we be concerned that in social care in particular we be in danger of kick thorny problem down the road we urge the government to consider immediate cross party talk on fund social care and provide long term solution we be also really worried about the impact of increase national insurance contribution on key provider outside hospital we can not have gps go out of business because of government measure that be intend to improve and expand their service my constituent be feed up with be take for grant by the conservatives and they vote emphatically to change that situation but be sure that they be very worried that they be about to be ignore by labour urge the government to rethink their damaging policy on national insurance contribution and the care sector to have another look at the impact of the budget on family farm which think may have be underestimate and to back the infrastructure that rural area need rise member will be aware that this be very heavily subscribe debate so time limit will be come but not until after we have hear some maiden speech call juliet campbell it be an honour and privilege to be make my maiden speech in

for the removal of barrier so that all have the opportunity to reach their potential reflect on my journey must say that have thoroughly enjoy my varied career but today as give my maiden speech in this great house as the member of parliament for broxtowe think this be my good role yet congratulate the hon member for broxtowe juliet campbell on her maiden speech and her personal story thank you madam deputy speaker for call to speak in today budget debate on fix the nhs and reform public service however the truth be that this budget smash and grab on the uk business mean that the money will not be there to pay for the excellent public service this country require labour have never understand the concept of private enterprise and business pay for public service and that it be only with thriving private sector that the country can have the public service it want and need make no mistake this budget will be catastrophic for the economic health of this country it be the big tax raise budget in british history and it will turn out to be the long suicide note in labour political history too the budget be socialism at its bad high taxis high spending and massive debt interruption labour member be laugh but this be massive debt for future generation this budget be anti business anti farmer anti aspiration anti wealth creation and anti worker yes anti worker despite all of labour promise before the general election the government be tax worker as they raise national insurance contribution for employer this beg the question do the chancellor and the prime minister not know how the economy work they certainly do not know how business work not one of the current bunch of cabinet ministers have ever set up business no wonder they do not have clue about national insurance contribution for clarity both the independent office for budget responsibility and the institute for fiscal studies have say that of the employer national insurance rise will be pay for by the worker through low wage and reduce employment level no wonder labour members have now go silent the chancellor raid on the unfair tax of all inheritance tax will double the number of estate that have to pay it and disgracefully will make it virtually impossible for family farmer to pass on their business to the next generation farmer be most definitely work people just in case labour members do not know this budget will be disastrous for our rural area and for the country food security and all because of good old fashioned socialist envy will the right hon lady give way no will carry on thank you very much in addition to huge tax rise this budget will have an eye water impact on the country debt debt interest payment will be more than billion year every year and will reach an astonishing billion by the end of the decade to put that into context rise will carry on for little long to put that into context it dwarf the uk annual defence spend which stand at billion this be money be waste instead of be spend on public service and if all that be not bad enough the office for budget responsibility have downgrade its growth forecast to measly for the year run up to the next general election so much for labour say this would be budget for growth this labour budget have take our country back to the with crippling taxation unsustainable level of borrowing and the trade union in control the budget have also break virtually every economic promise labour make during the election in fact even bad than the economic misery this budget will bring might be the further mistrust in politician it will cause labour rule out tax hike on work people more than time and it rule out change the fiscal rule to fiddle the figure mark my word on top of the betrayal of pensioner with the scrapping of the winter fuel allowance this budget will be nail in this government coffin only four month after they secure huge majority at the weekend the chancellor eventually come round to admit that labour will be tax worker but be afraid that say it now have deny it at the general election do not wash it be way too late to be admit it all it have do be expose the fact that this labour government be elect on false premise and therefore do not have mandate for this budget laughter laugh after not tell the public what they be go to do be why certainly will not be support this budget call lewis atkinson to make his maiden speech it be pleasure to follow my hon friend the member for broxtowe juliet campbell who speak movingly about her experience in the nhs as well as the

suzanne webb be great friend of mine the hon lady have take over from fine individual who be now contribute in many other way to our national life also pay tribute to the hon member for yeovil adam dance who have the great good fortune of represent my godson farmer in his constituency who will no doubt be contact the hon gentleman shortly about some of the issue that have arise in recent day myself want to speak about those issue today we be rightly speak about public service the nhs on which we all rely and those important element in our life that keep we together underpin our economy and really hold we strong but we be not just speak about the product the outcome the output of those doctor that money or those service we be also speak about the input because we simply can not have the one without the other that be what want to address what we have see in this budget be not just the large tax rise in decade the high tax take since the war and great indebtedness effectively burden our child with what we be spend today when it come to the fundamental challenge the budget be fail to understand how an economy work and why the relationship between generation matter so much the story that the budget tell be about government who do not understand what family generation or business be and do not understand why business invest today need the ability to plan long term and not just be tax halfway through the point be see most obviously in the tax on farming and on the inheritability of farming property the truth be that farm be unlike many business they can not simply be salami slice in the hope that they will survive that just do not work individual end up be force to decide not just to pay the that the government ask for but to sell the to liquidate the asset require that be inject dangerous short termism into the economy the truth be that the government can really only do two thing the first really important thing be to keep we safe we all know that the first job of government be national defence and national security but the second thing often overlook be the ability to extend time horizon it be very difficult for individual to have time horizon beyond certain point in early human existence the horizon be harvest or season in the anglo saxon period people may have get it to generation or possibly even reign but the genius of the industrial age and our democratic age have be to extend that time horizon over generation we have do that through the rule of law and through understand taxation and the predictability of an economy we have do it because we have understand that if parent invest child grandchild and great grandchild can reap the reward what the government have do be afraid be to reverse that they have shorten the time horizon and assume that people all our citizen be not investor in the future but employee of today that fundamental misunderstanding of what it be to grow an economy be why this budget be so bad will the right hon gentleman give way as the hon gentleman be an old friend will for one minute thank the right hon gentleman on the tory benches which be singularly understaffed right now but it be the almost criminal level of understaffe in our nhs that affect most of our constituent he be an honourable gentleman so do he not feel sense of shame that every single day in our nhs midwife doctor and nurse can not fill their staff rota they can not do the job that they want to do and that we need they to do it be pleasure to hear the hon gentleman who have come off the fence and now have seat he can express his view freely what fill with sorrow be when look at the future when look at the business that have invest so hard in place such as tonbridge and now can not pass that on over generation and over time the investment timeline be be reduce and so be the growth do not just take my word for it the office for budget responsibility the national farmers union and every business in this country have be clear on the point the government be not just take the egg from the golden goose they be slaughter the goose by try to get the egg out quick that simply do not work we all know what be go to happen next the government be go to have to come back for more we just need to look at the prediction by various financial body over the last few day which have be talk about our run out of the money raise in the budget in the next two or three year we know why that be go to happen this budget be not invest bad than that it be not encourage investing it be try to exploit as member of the government at the time of the disastrous mini budget do the right hon gentleman seriously expect we to take lesson from he on how we grow the economy return to economic stability and get the desperately need investment into our public service that his government fail to deliver for the past year the hon lady can play politic if she like be try to think about the future of the country dyson who be not in any government be point out the problem be raise minette batters who be not in any government be point out the problem be raise will the right hon gentleman give way no not just now the truth be that what we be see be level of short termism that be completely clear in agriculture and industry but the tragedy be that it be also clear in education great privilege of be the mp for tonbridge be that represent some of the fine school in this country other may claim that title but know that speak the truth when say that many of those school be grant maintain in different way other be private they be in many way web of education that work extremely well together in our community some such as hillview school for girl fantastic school at which be privileged to be on the governing board be state school while other such as the judd school be grammar school and one tonbridge school be private the truth be that the plus business rate think the extra cost that will now fall on private school come to about that every single kid in my constituency will have to pay for the vat in some way either they will have to pay for it because fee go up or they will pay for it because class size be large be afraid that the school will not be able to swallow the cost so we will see pressure all the way through will the right hon gentleman give way will not because have be ask to be quick that be not just burden on those kid but rejection of the relationship between family member in their willingness and desire to invest in the future know that the labour government claim that the only way for investment to be do be by the state that the only thing that really matter be when that be do by bureaucrat and civil servant that the only thing that really count be when the government pay for it but we know that be simply not true we know that business and the freedom to invest plan and forecast be what make an economy grow sadly the government have try to nationalise the future shorten the time horizon and make we all pay for it that be why growth be fall taxis be rise and the future be make bad again and again under labour congratulate all hon member make their maiden speech today especially my regional colleague my hon friend the member for sunderland central lewis atkinson be proud that while make history as the first ever woman to deliver budget our chancellor honour true hero of my constituency jarrow red ellen wilkinson ellen be remarkable politician and trailblazer for woman everywhere it be about time that we have some recognition of woman in this place and be pleased that the chancellor have make start on the artwork with the fabulous picture of ellen on the wall in downing street we need many more picture of woman trailblazer across parliament the budget show that we be government who will work for the people there be lot to celebrate include the large ever increase in carer allowance close inheritance tax loophole additional funding for further education increase the national minimum wage invest in breakfast club record investment in the nhs ensure that former mineworker get the money that be keep from their pension which be hugely important to my constituent and set aside funding for the contaminated blood scandal as well as for the victim of the horizon scandal for which have long campaign with my constituent chris head will continue to push for people to be hold to account for their role in the horizon scandal and for speedy resolution so that outstanding claim be pay in full nothing should stand in the way of victim finally get justice they should not have be leave wait decade by the conservatives someone might think from the contribution of conservative members that the last year have never happen but our public service be at the point of collapse no youth centre be leave school building be crumble the nhs be in crisis and the economy be crash because of the conservatives gross incompetence and deliberate mismanagement as they put their crony over the people of this country finally we can move on from year of conservative destruction of our community in this budget the poor household gain the most and the wealthy pay the most that show the difference that labour government can and will make of course wish we could have do much more wish the budget have be able to lift the two child benefit cap wish we have be able to right the injustice for woman from the women against state pension inequality campaign wish we could have increase the pension credit threshold wish we could have invest more in our local authority however let we be very clear the fact that we can not do any of that be entirely down to the conservative party as chair of the north east all party parliamentary group know that transport be one of our most important challenge alongside employment opportunity and investment although will celebrate the clear win will continue to work with government front benchers to ask for more investment to improve the life of people in the north east particularly my jarrow and gateshead east constituent it be pleasure to follow the hon member for jarrow and gateshead east kate osborne in reflect on the maiden speech that we have hear this afternoon will just add comment to what the hon member for yeovil adam dance say in his titanic analogy as the member of parliament for belfast east always remind folk that titanic be build by ulstermen but navigate by englishmen wish he well delay my contribution to the debate until today in the hope that we might have reach the point where there would perhaps be less politic and bit more accurate reflection on the challenge we face as country and on how to proceed be pleased that the chief secretary to the treasury be here because he be man of substance and he understand the challenge that we all face one of the most accurate description of the budget so far have be the sugar rush something that will make we feel good immediately an initial injection of cash into public service over the come year but which then peter out the benefit of that sugar rush peter out we hit low and crave more in year and but without sufficient growth the mean will not be there to pay for it say that not with any glee but as genuine challenge on how we invest in public service rightly in way that will produce private growth because it will be that private growth that allow investment in the year to come from northern ireland perspective the chief secretary to the treasury will know that there have be no resolution to get our finance on to firm foundation fix the foundation be what we hear from the government the negotiation that we have with the previous government see considerable injection of cash the debate today be about health on pay parity nhs worker in northern ireland the nurse doctor and auxiliary staff and the carer outside in the social care setting be not pay like for like compare with their colleague in england scotland and wales we obtain money to achieve pay parity just one year ago yet it be in danger of be break we secure money for northern ireland to achieve stability under the previous government but be tell to use it for year and to maintain parity for such important worker that do not work and have hop for more from the labour government hope that the chief secretary to the treasury will continue to engage in those discussion some political decision feel right when they be take but will not be easily forget by jade electorate the removal of the winter fuel payment be one of they the decision on inheritance tax for family farm be another those decision will rest long in the mind of constituent who place their trust in the government labour members have joyfully repeat all their party enthusiastic line but those constituent will not forget the damage and the pain cause by the decision associate with this budget madam deputy speaker have hop for more can not be churlish and not recognise the investment in public finance that be in the budget but it be not go to encourage we along positive path there be challenge ahead and politically and collectively irrespective of our party outlook or difference we be go to have to engage with those challenge more thoughtfully in the future this budget provide absolute clarity that the government be focus on put work people back at the heart of economic decision making this be most evident in the chancellor decision to protect and support public service enable the government to kick start mission lead approach to reform let we be frank this government have inherit public service that be fall apart at the seam and we know that our constituent deserve well commend the chancellor and treasury ministers for take the difficult decision that will raise billion per year by the end of the forecast to support public service the tax decision that have be take be difficult but thank ministers for be transparent as restore economic stability to put the country back on trajectory of growth be essential it be important to highlight that invest money in our valuable public service be also about secure growth in the long term as my right hon friend the chief secretary to the treasury have remark enable worker to get quick gp appointment so that they can return to work soon or support parent who want to take job that start an hour early by give they access to breakfast club before school support growth in my constituency of hyndburn alone the impact of the past year of economic failure be that over child be live in family that face absolute poverty investment in people and public service have real economic payback as well as be the right thing to do member on the notably empty conservative benches refuse to say what choice they would make differently would they choose to not invest in public service to not lift child out of poverty or to not get the public finance back on firm footing the increase in the national minimum wage be also welcome by many of my constituent in hyndburn and haslingden who work tirelessly to support their family and the local community in skilled but often undervalue job whether in retail in hospitality or in care currently in my constituency though we be face entrenched problem due to lack of investment in our public service most obviously we face the closure of our highly value accrington victoria hospital due to the fact that the building be now entirely unsafe for both patient and staff neglect public service lead to real consequence and my constituent have be leave to pay the price for the conservatives dereliction of their duty to manage health service sustainably therefore particularly welcome the government announcement of billion investment to reduce the backlog of critical nhs maintenance if that money have be available previously and if maintain nhs facility at local level have be priority for the former government we might not have end up in this unforgiveable situation be the minister able to share any further information on that funding and will he or member of the health team meet to discuss how we can work to ensure that accrington health service be both retain locally and align with this government national strategy for community base provision start by recognise that this government face an enormous challenge in clear up the mess of decade of conservative mismanagement in this country and that failure be nowhere more apparent than in our nhs and care sector every day thousand of patient across the country face agonisingly long wait often in severe pain just to see gp or get an appointment with dentist yesterday meet constituent whose year old husband well love energetic and creative man never regain consciousness after be leave in the waiting room of my local hospital for six hour after suffer brain haemorrhage james palmer bullock leave behind three wonderful child love wife and devastated community his wife request to be to ensure that no family ever suffer the same neglect again hope the secretary of state will meet to discuss the experience that my constituent face and what can be do to prevent it in future new funding for day to day spend in the nhs be welcome across this house and it be desperately need if we be ever to address the crisis in the nhs however there be no point in pour money into leaky bucket if that money do not get where it need to go it be not just public service that we need to focus on the third sector provide vital service that many of our constituent rely on particularly child hospice would like to highlight to the house the acorns child hospice in my constituency which provide vital support to many local family in really acute moment of need in nhs england decide to increase the child hospice grant order that intervention be far too long thank the hon member for his intervention he will be pleased to know that be go to mention hospice later in my speech to fix the nhs we must fix both the front and the back door take the pressure off secondary care can only be achieve by properly fund primary care that be why the decision to increase employer national insurance contribution be significant mistake as it risk worsen the crisis in the nhs and care sector increase that rate will drive up gp surgery cost significantly raise the annual expense of gp practice those practice be not eligible for the employment allowance that protect our small employer so surgery in chichester and across the country will bear the full weight of that rise burden that they and my constituent simply can not afford surgery such as southbourne surgery langley house surgery and selsey medical practice have already reach out to with concern about their ability to continue provide service amid those financial challenge they all agree that this increase will directly undermine patient access and care charity have long suffer the burden of fail statutory service chichester boast some of the most amazing charitable organisation and one of the great pleasure of my role be to spend time with the people at the heart of those organisation charity such as stonepillow which work to prevent homelessness in our area face an increase in cost of also visit st wilfrid hospice after the budget announcement an incredible hospice that provide palliative care for hundred of people every year both in the hospice and in the community it now face an increase bill of money that it need to find annually with only of its annual budget cover by the nhs urge the government to consider exempt the health and social care sector from the national insurance rise so that the treasury be not give with one hand and take with the other would like to start by say how happy be after year in this place to finally be respond to budget from labour chancellor that that labour chancellor be also the first woman to hold the position be source of tremendous pride to and to many of we on the labour benches this be budget that will begin the long task of national repair and renewal after year of steady decline if anyone be leave in any doubt about whether the conservative party might have some useful insight to offer this debate should have end that misconception once and for all first we have the right hon member for tatton esther mcvey who be the conservatives minister for common sense no wonder they lose then we have the right hon member for tonbridge tom tugendhat who they get rid of because he be not right wing enough we know that the conservative party will not be able to help we so we must crack on alone and the truth be that we have huge amount of work to do the right hon member for tonbridge do say one thing that agree with that in order to get growth we need private sector investment of course we do prior to come into this place run my own business and this whole budget be predicate on get growth and work with the private sector to do so all our plan for energy development require consistency so that the private sector can invest nobody dispute that but what we also need be public service that work as someone who have employ people for most of the last year or so know that you do not get good workforce if your staff be live in poverty it be not progressive politic to say that we be support people to be in work if they have to visit the food bank on the way home we need an economy that work for everyone and this budget strike the right tone we have proud history of coalmine in chesterfield and its legacy can be find to this day be very pleased that my right hon friend the chancellor have end the historic injustice of the mineworker pension scheme with more than billion be return to former coalminer the right decision be sad to say that have the dubious honour of represent constituency that under the conservative county council be dub the pothole capital of the uk we be very glad in derbyshire that the government will put in an extra million to tackle the scourge of pothole and hope that derbyshire county council will now start fill in chesterfield countless pothole the increase in the national minimum wage or living wage be another policy that will support economic growth if we give money to people who have nothing they will spend it in our economy if huge inheritance be pass on as the conservatives want that money be not spend in the same way in the economy there be issue for some family farm and those need to be explore but the vast majority of farmer will not be affect conservative members mention james dyson who be brilliant inventor but why do he suddenly find such attraction in buy up huge amount of farmland they should pull the other one the budget make start in get our country back on the road to growth repair the appalling damage that have be do to our national health service support the army of carer who also support our nhs and finally ensure that at the very bottom of our economy we start to make work pay like the proverbial curate egg the budget have its good part but significant issue remain while appreciate the additional funding for police in northern ireland it must be emphasise that that do not resolve the structural underfunding of the police service of northern ireland that have persist since nor do it alleviate the problem of recruitment which have reach crisis point warmly welcome the billion allocate to northern ireland but it be essential that that funding be utilise prudently and effectively by the northern ireland executive it be unacceptable that we face the high waiting list for healthcare service in the united kingdom because of time constraint shall concentrate on three critical area gp practice inheritance tax for farmer and the winter fuel payment for pensioner gp practice be struggle where will they find the fund to cover the increase national insurance contribution for employer they be not eligible for the employment allowance and it be unacceptable to take resource away from patient care the chancellor must be aware of the late research from the library that show that more than million people in survey about quarter can not get through to their gps the additional burden will add further financial pain to broken service the propose change to inheritance tax will severely impact farmer with estimate suggest that more than of farmer will be affect that contradict the government projection and put the future of farming in jeopardy urge the chancellor to heed the concern of the ulster farmers union and the national farmers union our food security be dwindle currently stand at we can not afford industrial action from our farming community who be already face financial crisis farming must be make viable while additional funding be hop for to support pensioner winter fuel payment the chancellor have fail to deliver we now face the grim reality of pensioner many of whom just exceed the pension credit limit be leave in the cold despite have work all their life that be plainly wrong and it be why will not support the budget in vote against it want to make it clear to the chancellor that the situation for pensioner business and farmer be not just bad in part it be downright rotten thank you madam deputy speaker have be sit here gobsmacke by conservative members lack of comprehension of what have happen over the last year to our public service see that the priority of the right hon member for tonbridge tom tugendhat be quote billionaire who be worried about pay bit more tax those be the conservatives priority last month hold constituency surgery in one of my large village and people tell about the difficulty they have get appointment there when people have to travel between village and there be one bus an hour at most it really make difference where an appointment be the lack of home village appointment leave my constituent at risk of their condition worsen and go against everything that we know to be good for patient and the nhs early help at the right place and at the right time down in morecambe and heysham even though transport be bit well get an appointment can feel like lottery because service be have to triage patient to find which case be the most urgent our resident be travel too far wait too long and get more poorly as they wait last week budget give hope not only that the nhs will get the investment it need but that finally the people in charge have the integrity and the skill to dig we out of the mess they be unafraid of listen to expert unafraid of make long term decision and unafraid to stand up for patient the people who matter the budget also show we that the government will invest wisely in the nhs some people say you can just throw money at it and they be right look at what happen with the investment from the last government nothing that be because the people in charge be fundamentally unable to organise at either strategic or practical level they be unable to join the dot local safety initiative while very welcome be bring in to try to tackle what be fundamentally national issue those issue include the vacancy rate the sickness rate and the increase complexity of patient issue cause by our be nation in poor health as direct result of austerity so no it be not just case of more money but sometimes it be about money money invest wisely can make difference if creak digital infrastructure mean that medic spend more time reboot computer than treat patient investment be need and that be what the budget provide the budget also fulfil our commitment to access the late diagnostic and treatment through my health scrutiny role in lancashire know that thrombectomy life and brain save treatment suitable for about of people who have stroke be not available in all area when be scrutinise that care pathway people need to be lucky enough to have stroke on weekday morning to get thrombectomy in february my grandma have devastating stroke on friday night and sit with the knowledge that she would not have access to that treatment even if she could benefit from it can not describe the pain that cause and it be pain that my constituent and people across the country feel every day we have health system that have be systematically undermine for year recent national report show that few than half of the people who could benefit from thrombectomy get one and that be not good enough be surprised to be call so quickly so thank you madam chair be really pleased by the statement that the secretary of state be look at how to compensate those in the health and social care sector for national insurance rise have in my constituency central surrey health not for profit employee own group it serve much of surrey and it stand to lose as result of the propose change it deliver community service across woking and surrey include most of the service in my constituency it would be awful if we lose service as result of measure introduce by the government in budget that be suppose to invest in the nhs welcome the government investment in the nhs but they must not make the mistake of increase national insurance on social care firm health partner and gps be concern about the elephant in the room social care local authority and our health system be really struggle but social care help to fix thing it be more efficient use of our money to invest in social care and prevention than spend on primary care in hospital the government be rightly invest in the nhs but they have fail to invest in our social care system surrey county council be under huge pressure and woking borough council have effectively go bankrupt it be report that without further support almost of local authority could go under if the government do not invest in social care fear that they will make the mistake that the conservatives make which we do not want we need to invest in social care so hope that the government will agree to cross party social care agreement that tackle those issue want to touch on the cost of living the government have to turn around an awful record from the previous government they have introduce some good measure and have suggest that they would increase the tax threshold something for which we have long campaign but be concern about the national insurance rise which will hit small business hard meet many small business this morning in woking and they be really concerned about the impact of those rise like the rhetoric from the prime minister and the government about this be government of service and government who want to promote growth they be use the correct wording but good rhetoric need to be follow up with good announcement the government say that they be go for growth but their action do not support that they be ignore brexit they be ignore social care which undermine our local authority and they be undermine small business the budget be well than the budgets of the previous government but that be nothing to shout about it should be lot well for my constituent in woking and for constituent of member across the house there will be reduction in the time limit to three minute after the next speaker note when be in the chair in the chamber be madam deputy speaker not madam chair that be for westminster hall or when the chamber be in committee call richard burgon the budget be welcome break from more than decade of austerity and especially from the tories slash and burn plan announce at their last budget which would have mean even more deep cut it be good to see public investment be emphasise as that be key not only to rebuild our public service but to drive growth and well living standard likewise the boost in day to day spending for public service over the next couple of year be welcome for example we be fund extra nhs appointment week and recruit new teacher have campaign against poverty pay for many year welcome the boost in the minimum wage although there be more to be do the budget include positive measure for those like who want the wealthy and tax dodger to be make to pay their fair share that be why we have hear so much squealing from the tories and the right wing press in recent day it seem that defend the super rich be the main reason why they get out of bed in the morning progressive taxis achieve by end the non dom scheme why on earth would they have problem with high capital gain taxis and extend the windfall tax on oil and gas profit be what we need to fund our service we need more of that because public service need more funding the increase announce in the budget after the initial boost over the next couple of year will not be enough to repair the damage do by decade of tory cut the government should grasp the nettle and introduce series of wealth taxis start with tax on wealth above million which would raise billion more for our public service would have like the budget to do more on tackle poverty be concerned that real term cut to benefit next year appear to be plan that must not happen and disabled people must not be subject to more cut and attack the two child limit need to go fast labour government should eradicate child poverty not allow more child to fall into poverty the last labour government lift many child out of poverty and that be what we want to see again the winter fuel allowance cut should be reverse that cut make no sense morally politically or even economically and it be not too late to think again and scrap it the budget be welcome break from decade of austerity it contain progressive tax measure but more need to be do now and go forward on poverty reduction it be put together follow the toxic inheritance from the conservatives it would be good to see more than handful of members on the opposition benches who know they might be able to learn something there be two key point that stick out in the budget the first have be reference by colleague from across the house and it be the elephant in the room to which liberal democrats keep refer social care member have eloquently make the point that if we do not fix social care we will not fix the nhs personal experience of mine be great example couple of year ago my grandfather sadly pass away he spend the last six month of his life bed block in hospital repeatedly get covid and pneumonia because he could not leave hospital and go home do not blame the nhs for his passing but if he have be well care for with an adult social care package at home there might have be different outcome the problem with the budget be that while there be token gesture for local government what be provide be nowhere near enough to fix the gap in adult social care the house be full of member who have work in local government and serve as councillor and who understand that often more than half budget go on adult social care the problem will not be fix by our tinker around the edge we need lot more to support social care and the nhs be worried about unintended consequence couple of week ago meet constituent who be work in the nhs she be single parent and her daughter have send issue because local authority school in the area could not meet her need she pay for her daughter to go to an independent fee pay school where she could get the support that she need but because of the introduction of vat on school fee my constituent will have to consider leave the nhs and work in the private sector so that she can afford to keep her daughter in that school and meet her need be worried about the wide ramification of some of the government decision in this case healthcare staff would be take out of the nhs because of budget measure hope the government will reflect on that and consider what more can be do to ensure that we support nhs staff in their current role whether that be give they more pay rise or more support in the workplace or by ensure that someone do not have to leave their nhs role in order to afford to keep the provision of their daughter send need and capability early the secretary of state make point about prevention local authority often provide that first line of public health prevention but the money that underpin that be just not enough we know that every pound spend save countless more for the nhs so urge the secretary of state to take strong approach to prevention and invest in community pharmacy the chancellor announcement of billion increase in the day to day health budget and billion rise in the capital budget over this year and next mark pivotal moment for our national health service that substantial investment underscore our government unwavere commitment to enhance healthcare service and ensure the wellbeing of every citizen one of the most pressing issue we face be the backlog of elective surgery and appointment and with waiting list currently at million that additional funding will enable we to deliver extra operation and acute sector appointment each week but this be not just about number this be about reduce the anxiety and suffering of million who have be wait for essential medical procedure they be badly let down by the last government but by address those delay we be take significant step towards restore public confidence in our healthcare system the budget also allocate billion for new surgical hub scanner and additional bed which be crucial to expand treatment capacity particularly in emergency department as survivor of cancer be pleased that cancer treatment critical area of concern will see significant improvement the allocation of million for new radiotherapy machine will enhance our ability to treat cancer much more effectively that funding be testament to our commitment to fight that devastating disease and support those affect by it mental health which be often overlook receive much need million boost dedicate to open new mental health crisis centre those centre will provide critical support to individual who be experience mental health issue ensure that they receive the care and attention that they need promptly the budget also include dedicated fund to upgrade around gp surgery by strengthen primary care we can prevent minor health issue from escalate into major problem ultimately reduce the burden on our hospital finally the budget represent comprehensive forward think approach to healthcare it address immediate need while lay the foundation for more resilient and efficient health system labour members campaign loud and clear at the general election for change and that be what the budget have deliver it be important that we recognise how the previous conservative government leave the nhs in weakened state with soar gp waiting time crumble hospital building and promise of new hospital that they simply could not deliver the liberal democrats welcome the billion of funding for the nhs and the billion of capital funding for the nhs estate however far too many people be struggle to get gp appointment when they need one which can lead to misdiagnosis or delay with people often have to go to instead it be great that the budget include dedicated funding to improve gp practice but more focus be need on the recruitment and training of gps and on ensure that we retain experienced gps it be therefore disappointing that gp surgery be not exempt from the rise in employer national insurance as that will ultimately reduce the number of staff they can employ which will affect everyone we need to prioritise general practice so that more people can be treat in the community as that be well for individual health and will cost the nhs less we believe that everyone should have the right to see gp within seven day be also disappointed that there be no specific mention of dentistry in the budget tooth decay be one of the most common reason for hospital admission in child age between six and and more than child have be admit to hospital with rot tooth since more funding be need to guarantee access to an nhs dentist for everyone need urgent and emergency care on the new hospital programme hopefully one of the new hospital will at some point be build in our constituency but be disappoint not to hear more about that it be good that hospital with reinforce autoclaved aerate concrete will be address urgently but we desperately need more detail on that now building such as st helier hospital be simply deteriorate with issue such as sink foundation leak roof and outdated infrastructure epsom hospital can no long cope with current demand and we urgently need new specialist emergency care hospital my constituent simply can not wait any long for their promise new hospital and the country should not be force to fund inefficient health provision look forward to hear from the secretary of state in the new year with more information about that many constituent who be just above the threshold for pension credit have contact about how the lack of the winter fuel payment will affect they it will particularly affect those in ill health because they need to turn on the heating early and for long while pensioner have be ask to apply for pension credit dorah may from age concern in my constituency have contact she say that apply for pension credit be minefield and that be why people from age concern go around all the time to help and support elderly people with that charity and small business will also be negatively affect by the budget and that be disappointing will wrap up by urge the government to look at raise money by reverse the conservative tax cut for big bank and by ask social medium giant to pay their fair share this budget will improve the life of so many of my constituent in rochester and strood they will see the benefit in their wage slip see the thing they care most about in their community such as the local pub and their high street support and see their public service finally invest in again investment in the nhs through this budget be key it be the no issue raise on the doorstep in the election and be perhaps well exemplified by the struggle to book gp appointment the simple of task for someone to seek help from medical professional when they be ill be make into what feel like an impossible task after year of conservative government remind voter many time during the election that the nhs be always safe in labour hand so be delighted to see that our first budget set we up to meet that promise so quickly as other have mention we have record break billion increase in day to day spending billion capital boost to pay for new technology and improve our building and landmark public consultation to set out long term plan for how the nhs develop over the next decade be proud that we be government who have be transparent and honest with people about our priority to fund that investment the chancellor have deliver budget that protect work people and instead ask big business and the well off to contribute the budget do not dodge the tough choice just to get through the next media cycle but instead be inform by lord darzi thorough point in time assessment of the state of the nhs that be hand back to we by the conservatives it lay the foundation to take the nhs from the analogue to digital from hospital to community lead care and from treat sickness to focus on prevention and promote good health those approach will take different form across the country but draw the minister attention to the potential for an elective care centre in the former debenhams store on chatham high street in my constituency have write to the secretary of state about this proposal and would welcome conversation about its merit particularly as it be good example of the invest to save model that be promote so well in the budget it would not only free up space at the medway maritime hospital and help tackle waiting list but would have further benefit by support town centre economic regeneration welcome provision in the budget for million increase in local government spending to support social care like many mp have background in local government and understand all too well how much the uplift be need will the hon lady give way have only second leave so apology but will not we all know that the social care sector need to be transform and hope that over time we can move to more fully integrate health and social care system in this country future budgets may be able to apply the same exemption to charitable care home as happen for the nhs that would be to the benefit of place such as frindsbury house in my constituency which be run with great care and compassion by the mortimer society have three minute and three quick point on which hope have the attention of the chief secretary to the treasury my first point relate to the nhs welcome the introduction to the debate by the secretary of state for health and social care today certainly the government have inherit the bad crisis in nhs history and they have massive challenge on their hand like how the year plan have be frame in relation to move from hospital to home from sickness to prevention and so on the prime minister be right when he say that those with the broad shoulder should bear the great burden but the way this government be raise tax through national insurance be be afraid hit some of those who will be struggle most hope that he will look again at that and how the liberal democrats have frame it we propose to raise the money by reverse the tax cut for big bank and increase taxis on the oil and energy giant and large social medium multinational surely that would be far well way in respond to question on the impact of the national insurance rise on gps hospice and care provider the secretary of state clearly recognise that mistake be make and suspect that the impact be overlook interruption the chief secretary be shake his head but he really need to address those issue because crisis will continue to occur will the hon gentleman give way on that point will although the right hon gentleman have only just walk into the chamber so think it be rather cheeky of he cheekiness accept the hon gentleman be quite right that the million extra be for both child and adult social care whereas adult social care alone be expect to have billion hit so do he agree that if the nhs however well fund can not move its patient into social care that investment and expenditure will not work do although that be rather rich of the right hon gentleman when he know that he and his party leave the country in this state another issue be the housing emergency which we have not debate much today welcome the additional million that the government announce which will supplement the affordable home programme to that be much need hope that the chief secretary will also address the large number of shovel ready project that have plan permission and pre development work in place must declare an interest as former chief executive of registered provider hope that the government will look at the impact of the significant construction inflation we have see over the last four year which be hold up many development that could be address housing need in our community only social home be build last year we need great deal more if we be to address the serious housing emergency have final question for the chief secretary if may have his attention for moment about the announcement of two layer of business rating that will apply to the retail hospitality and leisure sector many holiday home owner have manage to abuse the system by use small business rate relief hope that such second homeowner will not have further opportunity to take advantage of loophole will he investigate that and ensure that money go into first home rather than second home be afraid that there be loophole in the system glasgow have the short life expectancy in scotland and in western europe the people of my city who bring so much joy live short and less healthy life than those anywhere else in the uk far too many die too soon they do not get the happiness that the autumn of life bring time with grandchild time with friend and time volunteering at local church or local mosque my constituency have some of the high level of poverty in the united kingdom poverty be one the principal cause of ill health and early death health be the topic of today debate many of my constituent can not afford to pay for the essential and live in shocking housing condition they live every day petrified of what tomorrow will bring this budget confront poverty it increase the national living wage give pay rise to the low pay in my constituency and give pensioner more than this year under the triple lock and more than over the course of the parliament this budget make choice it target our scare public resource at the poor and support it my constituent rely on the scottish nhs but the scottish nhs be in crisis almost one in six scot be on an nhs waiting list look at what they have do in wales be discuss scotland this be serious topic about my constituent health the waste by the scottish government hundred of million return to the eu unspent and hundred of million waste on ferry could have be divert to the hospital in glasgow to put bed in the royal infirmary where they be need the snp be never to blame the day cancer treatment standard have not be meet for over decade despite cancer be one of scotland big killer have meet countless pensioner who have be force to pay thousand of pound to go private for their hip replacement and knee operation because the scottish nhs waiting list be so long this budget mean billion this year for the scottish government to spend on the nhs and an additional billion next year our budget put the people of scotland first and enable the snp to fix the mess it have make of our health service with its record increase in scottish funding this budget demonstrate our commitment to scotland very few hospital in britain can claim to be as essential as north devon district hospital which be the remotest acute hospital in mainland england it serve truly massive catchment area span almost square mile and more than people as far afield as lynton in north devon and bude in north cornwall thousand of my constituent would face more than two hour drive to reach their next near trauma unit during the tourist season our hospital emergency demand increase by full yet shockingly north devon hospital have just six bed in its intensive care unit and only four elective operating theatre far few than the nhs expect for any hospital of that size and both be now approach year old its endoscopy and woman and child building be already end of life it have significant backlog of million of overdue maintenance cost half of which be categorise as critical or high risk north devon district hospital be include in the new hospital programme in but if it do not receive the funding now critical and acute service will be at serious risk of service failure there be no alternative provision for more than mile the last conservative government promise major infrastructure upgrade and spade in the ground by february this year neither have materialise what surprise worse still the last government change the term of reference of the hospital submit business case not once but twice push essential work on crumble infrastructure beyond my local hospital have track record of deliver project on time and within budget such as the new discharge lounge electronic patient record and the jubilee ward the path ahead could not be clear the business case have be submit the land be own and the rebuild have the backing of the devon integrate care board the phase enable work cover key worker accommodation new road layout and an upgrade helipad could have be complete as soon as april phase clinical building replace operate theatre and the old intensive care unit and provide replacement woman and child centre should have start before the next general election everything be ready to go the can have be kick down the road for long enough under the conservatives really do sympathise with this new government and the position they find themselves in the only thing hard than have to deliver on their own promise be make someone else good our nhs be literally lifeline for so many of we across the country last year witness that at first hand from rid mile on sunday go for precautionary test on the monday to my horror the artery around my heart be completely block it be an incredibly difficult time for and my family but the nhs be there for the doctor the cardiologist who tell the news in such nice way it feel as if nothing be wrong the surgeon who operate on very urgently because that need to be do quickly due to the potential impact it could have have on and the nurse who nurse back when need the care the most like so many in this chamber and across the country the healthcare professional the doctor nurse and administrative staff be the reason be able to stand here today in good health to address the chamber among they be the very neighbour who take care of during my time in hospital as member be all too well aware however the nhs be far from perfect tory austerity decimate the nhs and the covid mismanagement add fuel to the burn fire engulf the nhs our waiting list be at record level million people wait for elective treatment of patient now wait hour or more in and people year wait for mental health support this be the bad crisis for our nhs since its formation year ago protect our nhs be crucial so that people can get the treatment they need when they need it whether it be heart bypass like mine transplant or cancer treatment this labour budget deliver decisive shift from the disastrous order rise order before call the next speaker gently remind member that we be on three minute time limit also when be stand member should please sit down the liberal democrats have long be push for the budget to be budget for the nhs so it be pleasing to see so much investment in our national health service the boost in capital expenditure be particularly welcome because cheadle local hospital stepping hill be in dire need of support and investment only few week ago stockport nhs foundation trust release figure show that the maintenance bill require to bring the hospital up to scratch be over million up from million just five year ago the cost of the previous government be there for all to see last year the hospital out patient building be condemn and demolish in march the intensive care unit be temporarily close because the ceiling be come in since january almost people have have to wait for long than hour in some of stepping hill estate be now class in the high risk category in fact when be there just few month ago the incredible nurse talk through how on rainy day they have to place bucket down to ensure that water come through the roof be catch that be utterly shameful and my constituent be suffer one constituent contact my office shortly after be elect to tell about their experience after wait month for simple surgical procedure the partial collapse of the icu lead to their surgery be delay it be then confirm again as delay then after it be rearrange there be further delay because there be not enough bed for aftercare each time the delay seem to be impose last minute and out of the blue which of course drive uncertainty and worry not just for my constituent but for their friend and family want to put on record that this be not the fault of the doctor and nurse the doctor nurse and other nhs staff do an incredible job in the bad circumstance and they be suffer also they be be force to work in these condition they be the one who have to break the bad news to patient when their surgery and appointment be cancel although it be rarely their fault every day those staff show up and deliver the good service that they can for their patient the fault lie with the conservatives for year they sit back and watch as stepping hill like many other hospital crumble will the hon gentleman give way will carry on be nearly do for year the conservatives ignore health professional and patient who be cry out for their hospital to be fix as those cry be ignore the problem become bad and bad we be now face repair bill of million and without urgent action that will only become more expensive so the new government must act now be delighted that there be commitment to our hospital but they must act now and give the patient the staff and my constituent the hospital that they need if they delay far cost will only rise and even more part of the building will crumble this budget will deliver to community such as mine may begin by welcome the mineworker pension scheme resolution it mean that billion of miner pension payment to their fund will be distribute among former miner and their family it be absolutely right that an injustice have be correct for those people have wait far too long it be also shameful that the last government fail to budget for the resolution of the post office horizon and infect blood scandal and applaud our chancellor for correct that now urge the pensioner who will not receive the winter fuel allowance those who be just miss out to apply for universal credit in st helens million remain unclaimed regret that we have be unable to remove the two child cap or deal justice to the waspi woman let now turn to the issue of local authority funding for adult and child social care local council bear the brunt of austerity successive government cut since have leave they in dire strait which disproportionately affect the people who be most likely to access social care there have be increase pressure to find saving which have not only cut service and job but seriously limit the ability to invest in cost effective preventive service some of the budget of st helens borough council be spend on adult and child social care welcome the chancellor real term increase in local government funding include the million to support social care will the hon lady give way no it be good that in the short term labour government will target additional grant funding at the council that be most in need but that need to be the start of process that will reverse year of financial decline for too long local council funding formula have work against underprivileged community and the area that need fund the most often do not receive their fair share sadly that create downward spiral with an ever increase percentage of local government funding be spend on social care this be not sustainable as have say of our council budget be spend on social care moreover the member of the special interest group of municipal authorities be unable to invest in their local area in the same way as their counterpart because of the funding formula one in four household in england live in sigoma council area at present social care service be postcode lottery and that need to be address we need methodology that take actual need into consideration and ensure that the funding follow however applaud the chancellor for provide million for child social care and million for adult it be long time since have have the pleasure of speak in budget debate usually there be bit more competition for the opportunity to speak but give the much diminish number present get this chance today have be more of an observer in the past few year have notice one aspect of the budget the form the tempo and the rhythm that seem to be part of every single budget debate it always start with high fevere crescendo of excitement the government reel off all the staccato of freebie and giveaway cheer come from the back benches order papers be wave and the nation feel bamboozle by this apparent avalanche of largesse then of course the first crack appear negative forecast from the obr here bad news on the gilt market there beyond that it all start to fall apart once the public realise what the budget mean to they and get over the intoxication the hangover start and the first opinion poll start to come out there be one in scotland at the weekend and it show calamitous decline in labour fortune just as the party be measure up the curtain for bute house it be not so straightforward for labour any more want to do something different and actually praise the labour government want to thank they and say well do for get that funding for infected blood that great also thank they for the extra funding that scotland will get it would be churlish not to do so it be what we ask for and be really glad that they have start to listen to we just wish they would do little bit more of that however there be issue with all of this one of the main issue be the change in employer national insurance contribution which have cause real problem for some of our colleague in scotland because we do not know what we will get as block grant will we be fully fund for the national insurance contribution in our health and police budget we need to have clarity and the money have to be in addition to the block grant funding not in place of it would like clarity from the minister on that issue there be one local issue that want to raise the levelling up funding for perth levelling up funding be pork barrel politic at its most gratuitous and we be the only city local authority that do not get one penny from the conservative government we finally get paltry million and we be so excited about that we have three shiny project in perth city centre that we be go to develop then of course the budget come along after we secure practically nothing from the conservatives labour government be take the money away from we want to hear the government say that they will give perth what it be due budget be like firework on bonfire night they go up like rocket with lot of noise and colour then they come down like damp squib today the government budget feel very much like that damp squib begin by welcome the tobacco and vapes bill particularly the part about smoke free space for those of we with anaphylactic allergy vape represent high risk because cloud of vape smoke contain allergen we have see the first report of anaphylactic reaction to second hand vape smoke so very much welcome the prevention include in the bill will move on to the budget there be reason why people across wales overwhelmingly reject the conservatism that crash our economy fail to fund our public service and oversaw economic decline furthermore the conservative government be not honest about the challenge that we face they be not honest with farmer in clwyd east small business owner public servant or potential investor they spend money that be not budget for the height of irresponsibility to say that they overpromise and underdelivered would be colossal understatement last week however this labour government deliver an honest budget that give hope to the people of wales with the large funding boost that wales have receive since devolution billion with billion barnett formula uplift for the welsh government to support the vital public service on which my constituent rely that include million for capital investment it be the big budget settlement for wales since devolution we be work with the welsh government to invest in our nhs and increase the national minimum wage benefit more than worker across wales some billion have be provide for prison expansion to sort out the mess that the previous government make of our criminal justice system we have provide billion for the farming budget to accompany new veterinary agreement that this government be seek in order to cut the red tape and get welsh food export move we have provide million to support steel community and million to make coal tip safe importantly we be end the injustice of the mineworker pension scheme as someone who grow up in coalfield community and whose family work at the point of ayr colliery be proud to stand on manifesto pledge to return the investment reserve over billion to those who need and deserve it the former miner themselves that mean huge amount to the nearly former mineworker in clwyd east we owe they this and we deliver it while the budget make difficult choice it set we on path to growth and provide vital investment for wales it have my full support while this budget have some welcome measure include adopt liberal democrat proposal on increase the earning limit for carer allowance other raise serious concern the previous conservative government leave our nhs on its knee people in thornbury and yate be feed up with struggle to get gp appointment or register with an nhs dentist so will be hold the government to account to ensure that the extra funding actually deliver for patient on that note be deeply concerned about the knock on impact of raise employer national insurance contribution on those part of the system that be not in the public sector gps and pharmacist play vital role in preventive health and in detect serious problem early yet because many be privately run business they will be leave foot huge new tax bill have be contact by several concerned local gp surgery one tell that as it have large number of part time worker who be previously exempt but will now be eligible the national insurance increase alone will wipe off its top line budget another tell this change will have significant financial impact on general practice include my own and can only serve to directly undermine access and patient care blackburn have the third high number of patient per gp do the member agree that despite the ringfencing of the funding that gp surgery get the increase in national insurance will essentially reduce the number of available appointment at gp surgery that be exactly the point that my local gp be try to make and be not clear from the secretary of state early remark whether this will be address similarly the majority of social care provider be privately run company they play huge part in reduce pressure on hospital and raise employer national insurance will deal hammer blow to struggle provider that be why urge the government to think again and provide they with the same support they have provide for publicly own nhs service they should instead look to raise the money need by reverse conservative tax cut for the big bank or by ask the social medium giant to pay their fair share be disappoint that the budget make little or no reference to social care and urge ministers to start cross party talk on social care now the other area that want to touch on be flood draw the house attention to the letter send ahead of the budget about the need to support local authority to prevent and respond to flooding my thornbury and yate constituency recently endure of its annual rainfall in just one month the council have have to respond to that within its already overstretch budget while welcome the funding for flood resilience project it need to be recognise that year of underfunding under the last government have leave council struggle to maintain their infrastructure to prevent surface water flooding give more time would like to cover other topic include the concern that the additional send funding will barely touch the side the impact on farmer bus user and small business and the ongoing financial crisis in local government instead will conclude by note that the unintended consequence lurk in this budget put at risk much need improvement to our public service hope the government will think again and make the right decision now for the long term include fix social care and deliver long term infrastructure improvement want to start by say that we can not and should not ever underestimate the power and strength of the message that have our budget deliver by the first female chancellor in history send to young woman and girl across the country there should be no limit to their ambition in stevenage and across the country year of conservative rule have leave crippling cost of living crisis record nhs waiting list rapidly reduce school funding and worsen public transport could go on but represent town of aspiration the people of my town have have their ambition and hope dampen by decline and hold back by break britain however this budget send clear signal that labour have start the work of get politic to work for work people again one of the labour manifesto most fundamental promise be to fix the foundation of our broken public service recently attend local old person day host by stevenage borough council where we talk about pensioner priority the budget maintain the triple lock which will be worth an extra for pensioner next year on top of the more than they be receive this year from the same commitment spend lot of time speak to carer in my area who be look after love one in testing circumstance this budget deliver the large increase in the carer allowance since its introduction start the work of recognise the huge sacrifice they make however know that this work will be complete only when we fundamentally reform our break social care system and very much look forward to that will the hon gentleman give way be afraid not represent constituency with multiple borough and district council that have bear the brunt of year of government cut this budget deliver billion extra for local council to provide essential service that be vital to our community fifty per cent of patient in my local nhs trust wait long than the target treatment time and wait over four hour to be see in despite the heroism and hard work of nhs staff something simply have to change the secretary of state for health and social care have make the brave decision to stand up and fight for our nhs boldly support by our chancellor greatly welcome the shift in focus from sickness to prevention from analogue to digital and from hospital to community this crisis can not be fix in one budget and it may even take few budgets but at least now there be hope where there be none before since the budget many healthcare provider in my constituency have tell how worried they be about last week announcement these healthcare provider which include gp surgery dental practice healthcare operator and pharmacy be small business operate in the heart of our community they do so much with so little over the last year under the conservatives although welcome the increase investment this labour budget be suppose to be breath of fresh air for primary care and for our health service instead our gps pharmacist and dentist feel take for grant they feel let down and they be scared the rise in employer national insurance contribution and the lowering of the earning threshold be life threaten for gp practice such as rowden surgery in chippenham they do not have the profit margin to absorb these cost and they can not pass they on to their client because they be designate as public authority they be not even eligible for the employment allowance mean that they will bear the full weight of this rise in employment cost which they simply can not afford gp practice partner in my constituency tell over the weekend love my job have never regret become gp until this week now be seriously contemplate my future in this role this gp be one of eight partner in their practice which deliver care to patient in my constituency but the financial pressure on they be bleak if our gps can not afford to run their practice because of this budget they will have to reduce service lose staff or bad cease to exist my constituency can not bear the loss of single gp let alone whole practice will the minister consider meet to look at option for mitigate the increase cost face by gps in my constituency due to the rise in national insurance contribution and the lowering of the earning threshold for surgery like rowden be grateful for be call to speak in the budget debate particularly during this discussion of the uk most beloved national institution the nhs may be well love but unfortunately it have not be well care for over the past year and do we all know it our inboxe be fill with message from people cry out for our support in get the treatment that they desperately need all the datum show the problem in my area we be more than four time over the nhs national target rate for people wait in for over four hour elective operation be be cancel at the last minute in the first quarter of when the last labour government be in power just such operation be cancel in my area but operation be cancel in the first quarter of this year that show the scale of the problem that we face we know from personal experience from whenever we come into contact with the health service that nhs worker bend over backwards to try to make thing work for we often when they be in overtime but mistake and delay be inevitable in an organisation that have be systematically under resource nhs worker need government who be on their side in this budget we be provide exactly that by deliver billion increase in nhs funding with new elective appointment per week and new surgical hub and scanner that will get on with the job of clear the conservatives backlog find some of the comment make by conservative members deeply surprising they be well sum up by what the right hon member for tonbridge tom tugendhat say he wring his hand for millionaire family but be perfectly happy to see child poverty grow to include over third of child in the uk conservative members talk of the budget plunge people into debt when they rack up trillion of debt three time the amount they inherit from the labour government they talk about the amount of tax on business while ignore the fact that work people in the uk have never be more highly tax than under the last government they talk about be on the side of business but ignore the fact that prime minister who they put into office use very rude four letter word to say what he think about business in this country when it come to nhs investment there be one thing that we can all rally around it be desperately need for research on the collective amnesia of conservative members while the chief secretary to the treasury be in the chamber it would be remiss not to mention that crawley could do with brand new acute hospital if they be be dish out however as this government do not tend to promise hospital and then not put any funding aside for deliver they will leave that debate for the future the service that we have nee to deliver for patient once more the darzi report have show we the way forward and this budget put we back on course to deliver the world class cradle to grave health service that labour members give to the country in the that labour members rescue in the and that member here will save again in the if conservative member wish to save that service they be perfectly welcome to join we in the division lobby later in the week this be not budget for growth on the treasury own figure growth will decline from next year for the rest of the decade on the obr analysis this budget be inflationary it be not on small business that the responsibility should land small business employ people small and medium sized business drive the uk economy if we tax they we tax growth if we tax their great asset the people who work for they then we take away employment opportunity for hard work people will talk more substantively about the dire impact of the budget on health and social care include health and social care provider that be not part of the nhs the increase in employer national insurance contribution will cause great difficulty and hardship for gp practice charity include hospice dentist pharmacy which be crucial provider of health service and social care provider those organisation charity and business think that they might have friend in labour government but assure government members that they do not feel as though the labour government be friend right now have be speak to those in gp practice in my constituency on the isle of wight one say our increase in tax from this budget be the equivalent of the salary of practice nurse there will be no new practice nurse for we do my hon friend agree that no one would think less of the government if they listen to these argument hear the message and change for instance there be the message about social care be hit by billion of extra cost the million that have be give to local authority will not cover those cost if the government simply listen and change people would think much well of they and we would have social care system that support the nhs rather than one that stop the nhs be able to do what it need to do agree with my right hon friend in fact there have be one common theme run through this debate gp practice charity such as hospice dentist pharmacist and social care provider be all be tax by this government at time when they need government most these provider find increase pressure on their ability to employ and provide service to the british people there would be no shame if the labour government be to do something about this gross problem with their own budget move on to social care the secretary of state for health and social care say that there would be no more money for the nhs without reform yet the chancellor provide billion for day to day spending unattache to reform she and the secretary of state be give the equivalent of just million of that billion for social care that be tiny fraction yet the big reform that our nhs need be fair funding for social care money would be well spend on relieve the pressure on hospital and get people out of hospital bed who do not need or want to be there but who have nowhere safe to go to through this budget social care provider not only face the full burden of increase national insurance contribution as employer but receive small fraction of the funding that the nhs receive urge the government to go back to the drawing board and provide for our gps dentistry pharmacy hospice and social care the first labour budget in year need we to take clear eyed view of what have be inherit look at the conservative legacy for our country we see terrible almost non existent average earning growth low productivity per worker hour than in every country besides italy gdp per capita growth stall for the long time since the end of the war record debt high taxis and poor public service the lack of growth in real wage be unprecedented in the last year of british economic history that be the conservatives record and that be what they have to face up to particularly savage as hon member have point out be the cut to public investment the conservative government inherit debt to gdp ratio in of ten year later pre covid it be the conservative government promise to eliminate the deficit in then they promise to eliminate it in the and election and then they give up the ghost entirely in the election after that dazzling record we be treat to the liz truss magic liz prophet currently not recognise in her own land she present mini budget with billion of unfunded tax cut there be no forecast the conservatives like the office for budget responsibility today but they do not like obr then and we know what happen we see tory chaos and we can never go back to that when my right hon friend come to office as chancellor of the exchequer and look under the hood what do she find more chaos unfunded policy decision undisclosed pressure and overspend the obr list they the previous government promise but do not allocate penny for the billion infected blood compensation scheme they promise but do not budget for the billion horizon post office scandal be glad to see stability and common sense finally return there be fiscal rule that make sense and will be adhere to we be bring the current budget into balance so that we do not borrow to fund day to day spending and we be move to proper recognition of net financial debt that take into account investment that deliver those sound sensible decision put we on sustainable path compare that to conservative party that would rather we continue to founder under old habit rot institution and that be content for britain hull to be encrust with nostalgia and for we to drift off into the century will the hon gentleman give way will not have only second leave that be the story of national decline that the conservative party be write for our country we will not stand for it we be go to build well green fair future for our country the theme of this debate be public service but there have be distinct lack of discussion from government members about what deliver the finance necessary to fund those service this be the budget after all the answer be simply the productive economy and small business in particular the government talk good game about want well fund public service and each and every one of we in this house would be hard pressed to find constituent who disagree but the government measure particularly the job tax in the budget but also their wide agenda in the employment rights bill through which we be move to french style labour law be an attack on where that money come from we must always remember that every single penny spend by the british state have to be earn in the private sector chucking money at an unreformed public sector while balloon public sector pay and do that on the back of the productive economy and small business show distinct lack of real world private sector experience among government members my first memory be of my parent go to night school on alternate evening to get the qualification they need to set up their small business their aim be simple to give my brother and opportunitie that they could never have dream of in do that they pay hundred of thousand of pound end up with quite prosperous upbringing admit into the government exchequer they create apprenticeship and skilled job in tough part of urban greater manchester they not only transform our life but improve the life of child around they and create opportunity for local people while pay for public service through their taxis do my hon friend agree that the absence on the government front bench of anyone with any experience of run business when business create the wealth that pay for public service may explain why the budget be so financially illiterate thank my right hon friend that absolutely show as we see from the office for budget responsibility forecast mention by my hon friend the member for isle of wight east joe robertson put up taxis unsustainably may mean adrenaline into the public sector from an injection of cash but the medium and long term result will be low growth which will mean that public service be just get large slice of small pie it be clear to that the tax burden be high than be necessarily sustainable tax rise now will not necessarily flow into great revenue particularly in the medium term ask the government to check their approach support small business first and foremost and focus their public service effort in the first instance on productivity reform lord darzi independent report pronounce that the nhs in england be in critical condition by commission the report and through the announcement in last week budget the government have declare their intention to fix our nhs and set firm foundation for the future particularly commend the decision in the budget to invest in mental health crisis centre in order to move those experience mental health crisis away from the accident and emergency unit although we will always need crisis support mental health provision like physical health provision should focus on intervention at the early possible juncture rather than rely on emergency care so often those in need of mental health care face barrier to access help they face difficulty in get gp appointment and be refer to the appropriate waiting list and they then spend year on those waiting list young people with neurodevelopmental condition might spend year not be see by local child and adolescent mental health service until their case be refer to the private sector because they be about to turn or they be transfer to the bottom of the adult waiting list the budget be clear that there be need for investment my scottish constituent have be fail by two government the previous conservative government have rightly be the focus of much of today debate but the current scottish government have be asleep on the job quite frankly all the sign that make lord darzi say that the nhs be in crisis in england apply just as much to scotland one in six scot be on waiting list for treatment test or appointment hospital post on social medium tell patient not to go to accident and emergency unless their condition be life threatening my local hospital do so on october gps be at break point with prescription system that still require paper and fax machine and there be no nhs app or prescribing for scottish patient commend the large budget settlement for the scottish government in the history of devolution now the scottish government must use it to fix the system that they break devolution be massively important to knock on door to campaign for the creation of the scottish parliament and will defend it with my life but we want to ensure that it work for everyone so that there be no chance of big boy do it and run away over the past few day have be contact by gps from st andrew surgery in my constituency whose busy practice look after patient they include dr katie popplewell who tell that the propose increase to employer national insurance contribution be likely to cost the practice whopping the equivalent of two gp session week before other staffing cost be factor in as she put it at time when the government have promise to repair and invest in the nhs this decision to place further burden on practice must change or we will see an adverse impact on patient care on offer in eastleigh and more practice close their door for good every liberal democrat member recognise the challenge face the country after year of conservative mismanagement but hope that the chancellor will consider exempt gps small business pharmacy dentist care home and charity from the propose increase to employer national insurance contribution although be pleased to see commitment to more funding for breakfast club there be no mention of the two child benefit cap in the chancellor statement and frankly be at loss in understand why the conservative government trap hundred of thousand of child in poverty with their cruel and counterproductive two child limit as numerous charity and the liberal democrats have point out scrap the two child benefit cap would be the quick and most effective way of lift child out of poverty in my eastleigh constituency and across the uk with huge long term benefit for our society and our economy in eastleigh we be also face local transport crisis hampshire county council have withdraw funding from multiple route over the past year which have have huge impact on my constituent particularly in chandler ford and valley park the bus fare hike will impact those in my community who can least afford it and could result in yet more route be cut with no alternative public transport provision thousand of woman in my constituency who be bear in the have be impact by the dwp failure to communicate change to their state pension age it be incredibly disappointing that the waspi woman do not get single mention in the chancellor speech it have be eight month since the ombudsman find that the dwp have fail to adequately communicate the change implore the chancellor to make the resolution of that issue priority do not leave it until the next budget those woman have already wait long enough thank you madam deputy speaker for call to speak in this debate about the budget budget be very proud to support as the first labour budget in year also thank the various member who have make their maiden speech in this debate particularly because like myself so many of they have work in the nhs many of we have feel the urge to get select for and elect to this house because of our experience over the past year understand that among opposition members there be feeling that labour member do not understand business but can tell they that we understand the public sector public service and our community and actually that be disservice to all the member on the labour benches who have run business it be particularly important to that couple of labour members have previous experience as nhs manager in his report lord darzi make it very clear that one of the problem the nhs have face be an undervaluing of the management side as oppose to the clinical side so those members voice will be really important in this debate this budget give we solid foundation for investment and rebuild this country of that have no doubt this budget be also what people in my constituency have be cry out for because they know that our public service be fray to point that be almost beyond repair honestly that be what people in my constituency keep tell unlike some member who have apparently have some very negative response to the budget can tell those member from canvass at the weekend and from what be in my inbox that have see really positive response to this budget people be really glad to see that the investment have start and frankly there be sense of reality recognition that this be not go to be quick fix on the health service and social care in particular applaud the fact that the secretary of state have not just commission the diagnostic investigation from lord darzi but have now commission year plan for the nhs will the hon gentleman give way do not think so that plan will be need to get the nhs back on its foot and as counter to some of the comment about national insurance and burden on business the secretary of state be very clear that he be go to look at the nhs allocation to gps and other people supply the nhs that come with the plan beyond that it be really important to recognise the damage that have be do to business over the past year by all the other cost that have be accrue the mental health crisis damage recruitment and retention and business have have to cope with all those extra cost across the board welcome this debate which centre on health and inequality within our society the hospital be in crisis situation with huge demand on they insufficient resource and underfunding and of course huge debt from the past that be not be address in an intervention on the secretary of state early ask question about the future of private finance initiative project which take up over of most hospital budget think pfi need to be take over by the treasury as be envisage in previous manifesto as way of release that cash directly into the national health service which would help with waiting list for operation and all the demand that be not be meet my second point be that healthcare be not just about hospital it be also about social care and mental health in the case of my own borough islington very typical inner city borough in many way our social care cost be up by million and go up all the time because there be more and more people with demand family be move away more and more people be isolate and demand be get great and great there have to be change in the whole social care policy and hope the government will bring forward serious proposal for universal wraparound national care service to take away the pain and stress that so many family face as result of social care cost likewise the mental health crisis be real it be serious and it be here particularly among young people sadly often particularly among young male realise that it be early day for this government but hope they will appreciate that not only do we need much more effective and efficient mental health service but we need to recognise that mental health stress come from other stress in society such as housing job family environment and many other issue we can not separate the question of healthcare and health need from poverty in our society end the two child benefit cap would release some people include child from the desperate poverty they be in not take away the winter fuel allowance from very poor pensioner would help great deal likewise the issue of housing stress huge rent level in the private rent sector and desperate level of overcrowding for many people in community such as mine have to be address under the proposal of the labour government health and housing be link together and we need to look seriously at that my local authority islington have lose million in payment since that be typical for local government we need the money put back in to deliver the service our people need join my colleague in welcome the budget and all it represent in make real difference to the healthcare outcome of my constituent in stafford eccleshall and the village in way campaign on rebuild the nhs during the election be easy do not have to explain to my constituent that our health service be break the nhs be not something that happen off in the distance it be gp on the end of phone or the ambulance service that come run the second be call or the kind nurse who sit with grandparent in their hospital bed it be the real beat heart of this country my constituent feel the impact of the nhs every day of their life except now for many the phone call to the gp at am take minute the ambulance arrive after several hour with luck and there be no bed available in hospital we see the impact of the last year on our health service and the shameful legacy leave by the conservatives the budget be the first step in deliver the change my constituent vote for it represent new chapter commitment to put health and community first and the beginning of rebuild what have be lose know that the minister for care have recently state that the government be determined to shift more healthcare out of hospital and into our community wholeheartedly support that goal especially when it come to palliative and end of life care which local hospice in stafford faithfully provide recently meet staff at katharine house hospice in my constituency to discuss the importance of palliative care be very move to see the care and empathy with which they provide service in our community the budget be reset for the nhs allow we to focus on prevent ill health in the first place and move healthcare from hospital to community as we build an nhs fit for the future welcome it as do my constituent it be appropriate that be follow the word of the hon member for stafford leigh ingham about the palliative care sector be grateful for the substantial settlement for the nhs especially as scotland will get billion which will make an enormous difference the belford hospital in fort william have be condemn effectively for year unfortunately have very little confidence in the scottish government to spend that billion well recently speak with kenny steel the chief executive officer of highland hospice in inverness who tell that the change to employer national insurance be expect to add an unaffordable to its annual salary bill that come on top of the need to remain competitive with the salary increase award to nhs staff marie curie anticipate that the ni increase will cost it million year money it do not currently have the government plan increase in employer ni contribution to from april be an impossible amount for the palliative care sector if those essential care provider can not absorb the additional cost their survival be at risk if hospice fail the patient they support will inevitably turn to the nhs place great pressure on an already overstretch system if the minister could listen to and put his phone down for moment would be grateful can you listen to just for second remind the hon member not to address other people in the chamber as you as he be actually address please continue palliative care charity be essential partner that deliver compassionate dignified end of life care on behalf of and much cheap than the nhs organisation that provide healthcare for the nhs should be treat like nhs body in these decision increase ni contribution for hospice but not the nhs place those provider in critical financial position and firmly indicate that the government regard organisation such as highland hospice as second class be proud to speak in this debate on budget that mark turning point for our country and my constituency of colchester it be budget that fix the country foundation and budget that work to repair and reform our nhs our health service mean huge amount to those we represent and their family our health and social care staff do an amazing job day in day out they and those for whom they care have long deserve well member of my own family have spend decade work in the nhs my mother as midwife health visitor and then public health champion and my sister as nurse one now diabetes specialist one support parish nursing community programme have hear from they at first hand about the challenge they face those challenge be immense and will take long time to address the budget recognise that it walk towards those difficulty rather than kick the can yet far down the road the chancellor face stark choice and she rightly choose the hard road as government we could have continue with the fail policy of the past year with the low growth and austerity that have leave our public service on their knee instead we opt for change and to invest in those service in the workforce who make they possible and in the technology that must transform they particularly welcome the extra billion for the nhs across resource and capital budget to cut waiting list and invest in new equipment that combine with increase in the minimum wage will help the frontline worker who struggle to make end meet that include worker at colchester hospital in my constituency who be fight plan to outsource their job to the low bidder on that matter be back those staff who like our wide workforce deserve fair pay and condition as the secretary of state for health and social care say in his opening speech new investment for the nhs must be combine with innovation and take full advantage of the potential of life science and new technology colchester be home to the institute of public health and wellbeing at the university of essex which be lead the charge together with local and global partner it be develop new digital health health informatic and health analytic that will help we to meet the challenge of the future it be also work with our integrate care board to improve exist community and preventive service something which my mother would have cheer to the rafter she be rather old school on that she believe that we need the high tech stuff but we also need the low tech stuff basic thing to support people to live healthy life through access to good food green space good housing and early year support labour government will bring all those thing and be proud to support that and this budget the theme of today debate be fix the nhs and reform public service to do that the government require strong will to drive reform and financial support for public service that be hammer for far too long by year of tory austerity as former council leader who deal with tighten public sector budget against backdrop of change demographic which increase pressure on the nhs care service and early service be well aware of the impact of austerity on our community in scotland and indeed throughout the uk welcome the substantial increase in investment in public service in the budget but the government could generate more to support the nhs and public service reform be refer to the flawed increase in spirit duty which follow the brutal increase in spirit duty introduce by the tories last year be proud to represent moray west nairn and strathspey which be home to distillery include some of the well know brand in the world brand that can be find in pretty much every major airport and high end department store the industry have gva gross value add of more than billion and export more than bottle of whisky every second the whisky sector have be invest heavily in sustainable operation and decarbonise its production which have lead to incredible innovation in hydrogen for energy waste treatment and waste heat transfer shorten the supply chain and much more those innovation be then use in other sector include the public sector to drive sustainable reform in how service be deliver despite independent study show that the treasury lose million because the tory duty increase go too far the incoming labour government have push that even far move likely to cost the treasury even more in lose revenue when duty cut would have drive sale of high quality product and generate increase revenue support job and investment in the election campaign the prime minster state that he would back scotch producer to the hilt the scotch whisky association describe that commitment as broken with its chief executive mark kent state this be more than broken promise to many it will smack of betrayal scotland national drink and the associate investment and job have be actively undermine and discriminate against those be strong word and the government should take heed of they instead of penalise this incredibly successful and innovative jewel in the crown of our food and drink sector the government must cut the duty on spirit to generate more sale and more tax revenue to support public service revenue that could be use to protect gp practice like the rest of our nhs from change to employer national insurance it could also go some way to avoid the outrageous cut to winter fuel payment cut that have particularly difficult impact in my constituency which have some of the high altitude and cold community in the uk hope that the government will listen and act on those concern it be privilege to serve in this parliament and be immensely proud to speak in support of the budget the chancellor and her remarkable team as someone raise by strong brave and kind woman can not in good faith ignore the significance of have woman lead the charge to rectify the economic instability leave by the man before she this budget lay the foundation for fair more productive economy and aim to fix the very bedrock of our society it be genuinely inspiring to see how the chancellor team have embrace the challenge of balance both the big picture of reform and national renewal and the critical detail that support those most vulnerable to economic shift the investment outline in the budget can not come soon enough especially in constituency such as mine where average earning be nearly below the uk average my sister be nurse at weston general hospital at the heart of my constituency and as family we know the true weight of the crisis in healthcare indeed last week my mother who have parkinson fall over we wait for nine or hour and eventually end up drag she into the car there be no dignity in that and that be the state we have be leave with for we if labour have not win the election healthcare free at the point of use would have be at risk of disappear forever thankfully under the labour government the nhs have be give vital eleventh hour reprieve the billion investment promise in the budget will not only prevent further decline but actively rebuild our health service for weston general and our gp surgery that mean more appointment long overdue maintenance and improvement and sense of hope for our community the budget be not just about hold back the tide of decline it be about build dam to protect the future it be progressive targeted investment where it be need most in weston super mare increase the minimum wage will see nearly worker in north somerset up to well off each year and with billion allocate for road maintenance we can start to tackle the huge backlog of pothole that plague weston worle and everywhere between the billion investment in education will mean well funding for weston school and college and the billion uplift for special educational need disability and alternative provision be particularly welcome change for many family in my constituency and will begin much need reform of send provision although we know it will take time properly to address the crisis in local government funding that we inherit billion of new grant funding will increase resource for north somerset council support essential service for our community the budget deliver on why we be elect to tackle the cost of living crisis get our nhs back on its foot and lie the foundation for an economy that not only grow but do so in way that build strong healthy and more resilient community when people see the change in our hospital surgery school and road they will once again believe that government can be force for good this be just the beginning of our journey towards fair more hopeful future member of this house will have see that the celebrated scottish comedian janey godley pass away on saturday after her long struggle with cancer come to an end in the prince and princess of wales hospice in glasgow in her final day janey use social medium to highlight the wonderful hospice care she receive and when her daughter announce her death she take time to mention that her mother pass be peaceful and nice transition that be the profound value of hospice care to our society and the nation family janey godley choice to highlight the care she be receive in her final day should remind we all why hospice matter yet across the country it be not an exaggeration to say that hospice be at break point as we have hear from member across the house this afternoon many hospice be grapple with severe staff shortage and tight budget constraint redundancy and supply shortage have become alarmingly common highlight systemic issue in the hospice sector this most vital of service be reliant on an unsustainable model which on average require two third of hospice funding to come from some sort of charitable donation that leave hospice vulnerable reliant on charity shop and large contribution with no guarantee of financial stability and it also add to the postcode lottery for patient even the nhs funding that hospice receive fail to keep pace with inflation nowhere be that crisis more evident than at st raphael hospice in my constituency of sutton and cheam st raph be more than just healthcare facility it be sanctuary for those seek to die with dignity the compassionate care provide there not only support the dying but bring comfort to their family in one of the most challenging time in their life however it receive only of its funding from the nhs which be substantially below the national average in recent month the hospice have be force to reduce its clinical community nurse team by and have completely discontinue its hospice at home programme which once make sure that patient who want to spend their final day in the comfort of their own home could do so with dignity and support over the past four year run cost for st raph have rise by more than million pound but nhs funding to the hospice have increase by only in last week budget the chancellor pledge billion to the nhs which be long overdue after year of conservative neglect however hospice be notably absent from labour year plan for the nhs and the rise in employer ni contribution threaten to push hospice already struggle with fragile finance over the cliff edge if this government be serious about deliver change they will exempt hospice from the rise in ni contribution and listen to call from the sector and inside this very house to sort out proper funding deal to rescue our hospice prior to the election spend the past year run my own business since july one of the aspect of this role that have enjoy the most be go out and talk to local business about how we can work together and how can support they hear time and again from local business that they need healthy workforce to survive business do not want their staff sit on nhs waiting list unable to come to work or with health condition impact their productivity we all rely on strong public service and we have all feel their decline over the past year of conservative government business also need customer and in south west norfolk we will benefit from the national living wage increase we be sadly low wage area in my experience when people on low income get pay boost they spend it they replace something that be break such as toaster or microwave or they get the child some new clothe or they complete home repair that be money go back into the local economy support hope local business as much as possible despite cover some square mile and contain people nowhere within the boundary of south west norfolk do we have hospital or even minor injury unit towards the south of my constituency our near hospital be west suffolk in bury st edmunds which be mile drive from the constituency border and it be roughly the same journey in the north of the constituency to the queen elizabeth hospital in king lynn when people eventually get to one of those hospital there be similar greeting both hospital that serve my constituent be massively oversubscribed and both be riddle with raac the queen elizabeth be literally hold up by more than metal and wooden prop see for myself over the summer how that be inevitably make it difficult to provide excellent patient care be delighted that the chancellor make reference to west suffolk hospital in her budget statement we be desperate to see that hospital replace it be the same with the queen elizabeth be pleased that this labour government be so focused on the raac challenge we simply can not expect nhs staff to deliver first class hospital care when the building be fall down around they it be not just the focus on hospital building that will be welcome the more than billion of extra funding for nhs service will go long way towards address the huge backlog access to health and social care service come up time and again during the election campaign in south west norfolk people face difficulty access gp appointment and see dentist be near impossible the focus on health and social care and the support for those on low income be just what be need in my constituency look forward to support this budget boost for west norfolk congratulate hon member who have make their maiden speech in the house today the first budget of labour government in nearly year be definitely an improvement on the year of tory austerity and waste but it be miss opportunity to bring about the transformative change that the country need welcome the increase in the national minimum wage and carer allowance but it be disappointing that those change have be accompany by cut to social security and disability benefit be grateful for the long overdue investment in hospital and the nhs however the government must guarantee that those resource will go into our nhs and not into the pocket of private shareholder some million child be grow up in poverty and quarter of million people be homeless meanwhile we be on the brink of an irreversible climate disaster those crisis demand bold solution the government could have implement wealth taxis and close corporate tax avoidance loophole to bring about more equal and sustainable society instead they have choose to bake in decade of inequality by feign regret over tough choice they do not have to make those include keep the two child benefit cap cut the winter fuel allowance and increase the bus fare cap by at the same time the government have commit to an additional billion of military spending echo the comment of my right hon friend the member for islington north jeremy corbyn on the link between housing and health while welcome the measure in the budget to increase funding for housing be concerned that they do not go nearly far enough real security be when everybody have decent home and we will solve the housing crisis only with rent control and huge council house building programme the government will be aware that plan to freeze the local housing allowance will have detrimental impact on hundred of thousand of family struggle in temporary housing or face eviction accord to the joseph rowntree foundation if the lha remain frozen over this parliament private renter on housing benefit will on average be about bad off if the government be serious about tackle child poverty and homelessness they need to start by end the lha freeze and link housing cost to housing support while welcome the commitment from the deputy prime minister to deliver new social and affordable home that be only scratch the surface on the winter fuel allowance do the hon member agree that freezing pensioner will only increase the need for nhs resource when hospital be already struggle thank my hon friend for his intervention completely agree that there be direct link between pensioner poverty and demand on the nhs the government proposal in the budget do not go nearly far enough the situation be simply not sustainable the ability to provide the bulk of its citizen with roof over their head be litmus test for the success of any state unfortunately that test have be fail by successive government without more radical measure to increase the stock of affordable housing fear it be test that this government will also fail this budget deliver the large scottish block grant in the history of devolution deliver total of billion for scotland budget in include the billion boost to spend through the barnett formula next year which come on top of the billion this year our chancellor have provide billion extra for day to day spending and million for capital investment include million for my home town through the clydebank town fund and ten of million for dumbarton regeneration this budget mark the end of the era of austerity raise much need fund for our public service in scotland it keep our promise to scotland and to my constituent in west dunbartonshire and demonstrate the value of scotland have vote labour in july the historic funding must be use by the scottish government to fix the nhs and support our public service the snp government be now out of excuse they must show the same level of ambition for our nhs in scotland as this government they must not squander this opportunity with their usual financial mismanagement no more excuse no more blame game the snp government be face make or break chance to revive scotland fail nhs where one in six scot be stick on hospital waiting list the hon gentleman be make very good speech outline the scottish context should the snp government not repair the damage do to maternity service in the north of scotland where mother have to make more than mile round trip to give birth they should put thing right in the north and all part of scotland yes agree the snp be not here this afternoon but this budget mean that the scottish government be receive more per person than equivalent spending in the rest of the uk the snp just need to get well at spend it scot can see that the snp have lose its way and be out of idea and that its ministers be incompetent and as bad with their money as they be for tax we more and give we less figure release today for the past month reveal the scale of the crisis the scottish nhs be flag on multiple front the number of operation cancel due to hospital capacity rise to the high level since august delay to patient discharge rise to an average of day while thousand of scot attend wait more than eight hour to be see there be few planned operation in the past month than at the same point before the pandemic the new money that the government announce in the budget should not be divert by the scottish government they must spend every penny of the extra nhs cash on scotland ail health service and use the boost of billion of pound to cut waiting list the message should be clear they have the power and they now have the money so no more excuse and no more hiding place they must get the money to the frontline and get the one in six scot off the hospital waiting list this be very good budget for scotland but only if finally the scottish government be able to display semblance of economic competence but not for too long just until when the people of scotland get to complete the job of get rid of both the fail tories and the snp after more than decade of conservative chaos there be no doubt that the government inherit challenging task we all recognise the enormous responsibility face by the chancellor this autumn her announcement of an increase in nhs investment be welcome but my concern be that the budget ignore the back door of the nhs the crisis in our nhs can not and will not be fix until the government fix social care too my inbox like those of many member across the house have be fill by gp practice concern about the increase in employer national insurance contribution with no shareholder and no ability to increase price some of my local gps have say that they fear layoff will be the only option without an exemption from the tax rise the vast majority of health and care provider that be private company include hospice and pharmacy will not benefit far threaten the integrity of the government commitment to the nhs it be more important than ever that we protect our beloved local business which be the backbone of our local economy they cover everything from hospitality to accounting to local shop run by work people such as threads and oui in harpenden fancy that of tring graze life and the oakman group which be very worried about the pre profit money it will have to raise and what that mean for the business along with fellow liberal democrats be therefore call for well business support include fair reform of business rate our local community rely on our council which deliver social care and local service they need the fund to deliver those service our local community be also feed by our farm already work on tight and tight margin they now face sell off land and break up their farmland jamie from sandridgebury farm be already contemplate how he will have to break up his family farm and what that mean for his two daughter as well as for the food he grow for our community the conservatives leave our economy in mess but we have an opportunity to turn thing around call for well support for all our healthcare provider but also for our small and medium sized enterprise the budget must support our community that include our local business our local government our local farmer and of course at the heart of it our health and social care deliverer this budget start to deliver the change our country vote for the change our country need it be tough budget that make the right choice to start repair the foundation of our economy while invest in our public service where investment be most need after year of the last government it be now clear that the adult be back in charge look at the attendance or lack thereof on the opposition benches it be very clear that the tory party call general election hand back the key and run away from any responsibility however this government will fix our nhs and invest in our hospital something that be badly need in my constituency of southend west and leigh thing be so bad in my local hospital that just recently hospital staff have be ban from order new uniform as part of new cost cut measure exclude cancer pathway southend university hospital have average waiting time of week for out patient appointment and week for general surgery they be sometimes much long that be simply unacceptable as people wait suffer in pain this budget will start to fix that there be huge gap in local mental health provision be sure member agree that we need parity of care with as much emphasis on mental health as physical health for young people in need of mental health service in my constituency the aim be for assessment within week and treatment within week but the reality be that waiting list can be as long as to month practitioner such as the lighthouse in my constituency be work very hard to bring those number down so it be really pleasing to see include in the budget on top of the money commit the million for new mental health crisis centre family wait for assessment for special educational need be be let down so be delighted to see the billion uplift in sen provision new funding for the nhs mental health service and sen provision will provide much need help to my constituent without our health our nation will struggle to rebuild our economy so the long term plan for the nhs will develop as result of the current consultation and through our year plan for national renewal the day of stick head in the sand be over hope be not plan thank the chancellor and her team for put in place credible plan to fix our nhs it be pleasure to follow my hon friend the member for southend west and leigh david burton sampson welcome this budget which mark significant milestone for wales the large funding boost since devolution be especially proud of the million allocate for the continue safe maintenance of coal tip which be vital for place such as the bersham colliery spoil tip in rhostyllen in my constituency make famous by the hollywood style wrexham sign the budget be testament to the positive impact of two labour governments work together we should never forget the year of brutal austerity under the tories whose legacy have leave vital service in disarray record low living standard and more than million child live in poverty after such devastation investment be not just welcome but essential food security be one of the most pressing issue that the uk face the tories fail our farmer as be clear from dodgy trade deal with new zealand and australia delay in post brexit payment scheme and the closure of farm leave many struggle financially invest properly in farming and address farmer concern be essential for the industry future so welcome the million allocate to the farming recovery fund in order to support farmer affect by last winter extreme wet weather also welcome the million to protect against threat such as peste des petit ruminant bluetongue and other disease that blight the life of our farmer and the billion for the farming budget over the next two year inequality in our society be stark raise the national living wage by to per hour be key step forward benefit about minimum wage worker in wales keep petrol duty freeze be crucial for those of we in rural area where affordable fuel be essential to daily life work and access essential service know that that be major concern for many of my constituent before the budget our labour government will invest in public service particularly the nhs and school which be devolve but vital wholeheartedly welcome the billion increase in the core school budget which will enable the recruitment of new teacher and enhance school maintenance as dyslexic and dyscalculic child who be illiterate until the age of know that the government commitment of billion to special educational need and disability will make real difference wonder whether the chief secretary to the treasury agree that those on the deplete government benches continue to paint picture show that the last year of tory neglect be not choice that be make even more delulu by attack on the change that this government have make to fix the foundation and improve the life of people in constituency up and down the country this shameful attempt to rewrite history would be laughable if it be not so tragic for the people who live in my city the budget be the first step in different and positive direction be proud to say that the government have seize the opportunity to create real change for my constituent there be minimum wage worker in my constituency number proportionally high than the national average and many work in our public sector increase the national living wage to per hour be huge win for those low pay worker and the increase to for those age between and give young people decent chance to start their independent life more than unpaid carer be fight to provide vital care in my city unpaid carer deserve our unwavering support and be proud that we be raise the threshold for carer allowance which will provide vital boost for many family the review of the carer allowance overpayment scandal that we see under the last conservative government be very much overdue and be pleased that we be launch it some people be wait to start treatment at portsmouth nhs trust with almost half wait more than week the injection of spending into the nhs represent real term growth rate of the additional funding will support the delivery of extra appointment reduce waiting time and deliver an week target which be vital for my constituent be look forward to host the first joint nhs public consultation in december with my hon friend the member for portsmouth south stephen morgan and to feed our city view into the year plan for the nhs in portsmouth north people be on universal credit our reform to universal credit will mean the introduction of fair debt repayment rate we be bring the rate down from to which will help so many people as teacher it would be remiss of not to mention the child in my city who be in education we be bring in breakfast club to ensure that child be set up every day

city welcome this budget not because it solve all the problem in the country we have hear lot about they this afternoon and they would be impossible to solve quickly but because it begin to do so in many way this budget be reset moment for our politic and our economic it be deliberate choice to invest in growth and essential public service not least the nhs in st helens north and across the country just as the austerity that we suffer under previous government be deliberate choice as liz truss chancellor be report as say last week labour be deal with the conservatives mess we have that responsibility because people vote for change in july they want change in direction because the consequence of the choice make by previous government be clear for we all to see the funding black hole in social care the crisis in the send system our crumble state school road fall apart council go bankrupt and the crisis in our prison and the justice system in st helens north the number of child live in poverty rise by more than between and be that good for business this be the mess that we be clean up of course we can not talk about the mess that we be clean up without talk about public health and the crisis in the nhs the recently publish report by lord darzi spell it out life expectancy increase under the last labour government but plateaue during the under the tories that be not coincidence the absolute and relative proportion of our life spend in ill health have increase that be not coincidence to quote the darzi report summary many of the social determinant of health such as poor quality housing low income insecure employment have move in the wrong direction over the past year with the result that the nhs have face rise demand for healthcare from society in distress be that good for business this budget provide the large cash injection into the nhs outside covid since but the government also recognise the need for reform encourage everyone in st helens north and across the country to take part in the large nhs consultation in its history which be happen right now last month meet north west ambulance worker and there be frustration anger heartbreak and exhaustion because of the circumstance in which they be be force to work that be just one of the mess that we have to clear up it will not all be fix overnight but with this budget and other measure include the employment rights bill and the introduction of gb energy gb railways renter right and more we be take big step towards clear up the mess that the conservatives leave behind healthy economy mean healthy people but let we not forget that conversely healthy people be the backbone of healthy economy this budget be work its way through some very difficult circumstance and deal with problem that have be ignore for far too long problem in our economy have have an adverse effect on the health of the people we be here to serve so be hearten to see that this budget be aware of the need not only to get the financial engine room run again but to rebuild the foundation of good health for this country this budget rightly prioritise the nhs with vital capital investment and increase spending know that many of my constituent and those across the country will welcome the announcement of funding for mental health crisis centre provide service that be so desperately need that will go some way towards take the pressure off our department would like to highlight couple of the investment make beyond our nhs that be so vital for our health be delighted to see investment in give all child the good start in life with spending on early year and family service rise to billion the million expansion of breakfast club will ensure that child start their day with meal and positive social time have see how much value be add when the catering be integrate into school wide vision for health wellbee and pastoral care be also encourage to see that the debilitate cut to local government funding in recent year have finally stop and that plan have be put in place to support essential provider of frontline service in continue their vital work as well as the real term increase in local authority core spending power the additional million go into the affordable home programme will kick start an increase in decent affordable social housing and finally begin to address some of the unacceptable emergency accommodation that our constituent find themselves in while wait far too long on our housing waiting list as we move forward and build on the healthy economic foundation outline in this budget look forward to consider the reform that will be need for social care the million grant funding for it be good starting point for the necessary work to come similarly the public health grant in local government must be protect and fund properly in order for we to move sustainably from treatment to prevention we know that our public service and nhs can not be fix overnight but congratulate the chancellor on deliver budget that have give we firm marker of intention and direction the measure of our collective health and wellbeing be not gdp per capita alone we can rebuild the service that we need to lead healthy and productive life and with this labour government we will all thrive the last few year have be incredibly difficult for our constituent and our national health service public service be on their knee billion black hole have be leave in our public finance and there have be real term fall in income and living standard the conservatives as we have hear today be still labour under the fantasy that no problem exist and that they be sit in opposition well few of they be sit over there through no fault of their own but through some sort of electoral dysfunction they be entirely unwilling to say what they would do to fix the broken service and our nhs and what they would do to close the financial gap that they have leave be pleased that we have take the tough and necessary decision on spending and taxation to put our nhs back on firm footing tough decision that any chancellor and any government would have to make the conservatives have continually shirk those tough decision this budget ensure that no one will see high taxis on their payslip there be no increase to employee national insurance income tax or vat those be promise that make to my constituent when go door to door and promise that we be keep today the necessary tax rise in this budget rightly fall on those with the broad shoulder we be ask the wealthy and large business to pay their fair share to help rebuild our nhs and public realm this budget be fundamentally pro growth and be focus on investment in our country future we have hear conservative members today continually make the tired argument that it be the private sector alone that drive growth as member have rightly say economic growth rely on strong public and private sector without function public sector business can not thrive if train be late people can not get to work if staff be off sick they can not pay tax and can not contribute if worker do not have the necessary skill productivity and growth stall this budget address those issue and those determinant of growth and that be why be proud to support it today over year the conservatives have starve our nhs of vital funding but today we be talk about vital billion investment in our nhs the big investment in it since the last labour government exclude the covid year this investment be transformative hope that some of this spending will be make available to primary care and to community pharmacy the desperately underfunded front door of our nhs be really pleased that in recent day we have hear commitment from the front bench health team of furth million to support the development of proposal for hillingdon hospital be sure that will return to that issue and discuss it with the team in the day ahead in summary this budget deliver on our promise on tax on growth and on the nhs and be delighted to support it as we all know too well politic be about choice the choice in this budget be clear five more year of the same fail conservative

of billion require to build new hospital the trust could start construction as early as but that require urgent confirmation that the funding will go ahead do the minister agree that hospital soon rather than later will deliver well outcome for patient do not blame the government for the financial mess that they have inherit from the conservatives but when it come to primary care the budget have take one step forward but two step back simply do not understand why at time when wokingham have an increase gp to patient ratio and grow population the chancellor have decide to levy tax on job through the national insurance employer contribution that will impact gp care provision and leave our overstretched service struggle even more be campaign for the community of arborfield to have their own dedicated gp practice my constituent be cry out for change so that they can get the service that they deserve do the minister agree that gps in wokingham and across england should be protect from

casework involve people in substandard temporary accommodation battle damp and mould and slow repair and victim of no fault eviction and overcrowding what compound that dreadful inheritance be false hope the fantasy new hospital programme tell people in my community that they would have brand new st mary hospital as well as overhaul of hammersmith and charing cross hospital but it be never budget for instead of take responsibility the conservatives overspent avoid the tough choice and sign off cheque that they know would never have to be cash welcome the budget and especially the investment to

of the imperial college healthcare nhs trust thank my constituency neighbour for that point the imperial college trust have the high major repair backlog of any nhs estate in the country so we hope that it will on merit be strong candidate in the secretary of state review of the new hospital programme as the shadow minister the hon member for brentwood and ongar alex burghart would know from our work together on open government and international transparency welcome the chancellor focus on tackle corruption fraud tax avoidance and waste the ending of the non dom tax regime the additional

education secretary who describe the send system under her party as lose lose lose the government commitment to increase send funding by billion be step towards address the crisis it must be only the beginning of tackle this huge long term problem ultimately the system need root and branch reform but the money will start to make real concrete difference and to break down the barrier to opportunity

ensure that we find cure for many mysterious affliction the government have rightly emphasize the need for investment in the nhs to be accompany by reform with reform must come value for money would like to bring serious matter to attention of the house an example of reform which while at first sight appear to be of benefit be neither value for money nor the right thing to have do be sorry that so few of the previous team be here to listen nhs eye surgery service be in difficulty and be inform that we be in danger of create ophthalmic desert just like the dental desert familiar to we in the east of england the last government take their eye off the ball as cataract service be outsource to private provider take with they the very same nhs surgeon and staff who be provide the service in the hospital the generous tariff for the provision of cataract surgery mean that private cataract clinic often own and run by the same surgeon be spring up everywhere the number of cataract operation have shoot up and relatively minor cataract which be cause of correctable visual difficulty can be operate on within few week by choice of private clinic generate annual profit of well over million meanwhile nhs eye surgery department which be treat serious cause of irreversible blindness such as glaucoma and macular degeneration be in trouble with long waiting list they can not recruit surgeon and be struggle to survive this be the next dentistry crisis just as in dentistry reform of the contracting system be now urgent and urge the government to do that it will save million of pound and preserve nhs eye surgery service as my ophthalmic colleague inform we can treat dental problem with false tooth but false eye do not work very well my right hon friend the chancellor inspire many people last week include girl and woman the unfortunate comment from the new leader of the opposition about the first budget by woman chancellor be not share by the young woman have speak to my right hon friend inspire we mps too not merely with big ticket item such as the core school budget go up by billion but with more subtle form of inspiration about the long term it would be more popular in the short term simply to spend money on public service but our government have make difficult choice such as billion worth of saving and ensure that public money be spend wisely through the new office for value for money my right hon friend have make tough decision on tax spending and welfare to restore our economic stability which help my constituent freeze the small business multipli for one year will protect more than small business in rugby constituency from inflationary bill increase thousand of my constituent will benefit from the increase in the national minimum wage and national living wage boost income by up to and carer in rugby who be in receipt of carer allowance will benefit from the work limit be lift allow they to earn more and still claim rugby pensioner will see the state pension increase by with my right hon friend the chancellor maintain the triple lock that be more than twice the uplift give to people receive benefit some in my constituency have express concern about local hospital health provision labour found the nhs we will fix it and we will fund it it be because of my right hon friend decision that this government can provide an extra billion in two year to help cut waiting time and billion capital funding nationally for new surgical hub and diagnostic scanner that much need investment could not have happen have my right hon friend choose immediate popularity by make unfunded promise that raise perfectly legitimate hope among the public just as the last government do when they promise new hospital without have funding stream in place the toxic legacy of that false hope be feel by the public and express to every one of we in our inboxe this chancellor this labour party this government will restore faith in the very concept that government can improve life it would perhaps have be more popular to pretend that there be no difficult decision only sunlit upland or that green shoot do not require watering and that public service can improve without proper investment but we do not seek short term popularity this budget lay the foundation for long term economic stability growth investment and fairness and enable we to begin deliver much need change to improve our constituent live as we do that we will have the opportunity to earn the trust of the public we serve the government have profound duty to tackle poverty with urgency and ambition after year of tory austerity hollow out our public service and leave our community struggle eradicate poverty must be at the heart of the government agenda yet the budget fall short and without bold action the most vulnerable in our constituency will continue to suffer end austerity be not just about stop cut it be about real action to lift people out of poverty the critical first step must be to scrap the two child benefit cap which unfairly punish family for have more than two child if it remain accord to the resolution foundation an additional child will be in poverty by we must scrap it immediately we must also reverse the means testing of winter fuel payment no pensioner should have to choose between heating and eat in cost of living crisis provide warmth to those at risk should be non negotiable for labour government the rise in bus fare cap be equally unacceptable affordable public transport be vital for low income family student and those without car increase fare deepen and entrench inequality and hinder our climate goal the labour government must ditch tory welfare reform that will slash billion from disability benefit push people into more severe hardship those reform must be reject root and branch not piecemeal the more than excess death in the past decade remind we that austerity cost live and that politics be matter of life and death in one of the world wealthy nation no family should be in poverty no child should be leave hungry and no pensioner should be unable to heat their home our response must be transformative in rebalance the economy for the many not the few we need fair tax system that place the burden on those who can pay the most tax on asset over million could raise billion annually and equalise capital gain with income rate threshold would bring in an additional billion those fund could truly transform our nhs school and community finally we need bold economic plan to secure our future with worker lead just transition to renewable energy create thousand of unionised job and ensure that no one be leave behind my constituent in coventry south and community across the uk deserve budget that mark the end of austerity with action not just word and with true commitment to end poverty on point of order madam deputy speaker must apologise to the house for not make declaration at the beginning of my speech be governor of the royal berkshire hospital and have family member who have share in health company apologise for not mention it at the beginning of my speech thank the hon member for advance notice of his point of order it be most definitely relevant to the debate and his transparency be note should place on record that my wife be hard work nhs employee and she will thank for say that have today meet representative of the royal college of paediatrics and child health which have raise serious concern about the waiting time that child with condition such as motor neurone disease face in access community service and hospital treatment be hopeful that child health will be target for additional resource in the budget because if we can tackle child health early we can help to reduce poor health in later year welcome the key point in the budget which be the recognition that increase public spending on health for example benefit those on low income the most likewise the budget concentrate increase in tax on the household with the high income as it should have receive representation from hospice in my constituency about the increase in national insurance contribution for employer and urge the chancellor to consider grant hospice an exemption in recognition of the difficult and much need work they do the announcement of billion of additional funding for send be to be warmly welcome and be keen to see how that funding will be distribute to benefit the child and family who have be struggle for so long the announcement of compensation for victim of the post office horizon scandal and the infected blood scandal be welcome step in recognise those injustice but urge the chancellor to see what similar support can be give to woman bear in the who be never properly inform about the change to their state pension age also recognise the million grant funding for social care for local authority but the entire sector urgently need reform especially if we be to realise the government state aim of move healthcare from hospital to community finally again express my concern about the decision to mean test the winter fuel allowance be look forward to meet the minister with responsibility for pension my hon friend the member for wycombe emma reynolds tomorrow to discuss that far hope we can explore what far support we can give to those who be just above the pension credit threshold there be much to welcome in this budget but those with the broad shoulder need to carry the heavy burden welcome the opportunity to speak in this debate on the first labour budget for nearly year must disclose that work in the nhs for the past year as mental health nurse as result of the budget the nhs will receive the large rise in day to day spending outside the pandemic since the last labour government the additional billion over two year will play major role in cut waiting time from their current unacceptably high level we all know that money on its own will not be enough to create an nhs fit for the future so agree with my right hon friend the secretary of state for health and social care that it be important that the increase investment outline in the budget come with the necessary reform of the nhs on that point be pleased to see that there will be more than billion spend on healthcare technology and digital investment to run essential service and drive improvement in nhs productivity believe that will have widespread support from my former colleague work in the nhs if we ensure that all trust have access to electronic patient record that will not only be much well for the patient but will increase staff productivity free up more time to treat patient when pay visit to the william harvey hospital in the ashford constituency in august patient be be treat in corridor that be deeply concern as during the summer there be supposedly less demand on the department this money will be well receive in hospital such as the william harvey be pleased by the recent confirmation from the health and social care secretary that there will be more detail on the new hospital programme in the new year would like to make strong case for the william harvey and the other hospital in the east kent hospital university nhs foundation trust in when boris johnson be prime minister he promise that east kent would get new hospital proposal be draw up for either new hospital in canterbury or upgrade facility at the william harvey hospital and the queen elizabeth the queen mother hospital in margate despite what boris johnson say last year the conservative government break that promise at the time it be report that at least million would have to be spend over the next five year on essential improvement to hospital in east kent just to maintain safe service as we look to deliver an nhs fit for the future say to my right hon friend the minister that money spend patch up age building would be well invest in improve standard for patient in east kent therefore hope that the proposal and promise from the previous government can be reconsider the choice make by the chancellor to invest in the country future and fix the broken public service leave by the tories be clear rejection of that party fail policy so welcome the budget the budget be huge victory for mineworker be bear in mining community in pit village call bellsbank today sadly coalfield community like the one be raise in be still behind the national average on growth and prosperity unemployment poor health and lack of opportunity have create legacy of deprivation in those once lively community with that in mind be immensely proud to stand for election on manifesto that promise to end the injustice of the mineworker pension scheme so that the people who power our country would receive fairer pension be delighted that we have chancellor who listen to colleague and government commit to end injustice now almost pensioner in my constituency of ayr carrick and cumnock will receive week more in their pension that be the pension uplift for former mineworker across the country the budget protect work people in scotland and inject more money than ever before into our public service the scottish government will need to ensure that that additional funding for public service reach the frontline bring down waiting list in the nhs and raise attainment in our school people in scotland rightly expect result the snp be pretend that its hand be tie and that somehow its decision do not matter but this be not just about have more money it be about spend money well the nhs in scotland be in perpetual crisis because of the snp government chaos mismanagement and incompetence after year of the snp in power in scotland we be leave with the reality of two tier health system patient in pain be force to scrape money together to go private over patient equivalent to one in six scot be on an nhs waiting list for test or treatment my sister have await hip replacement for over month decision in the budget mean that the scottish government will receive more per person than the rest of the uk the labour government be commit to grow day to day spending on essential service deliver extra appointment week and reduce nhs waiting list when will we see the same ambition from the scottish government and the snp welcome the government commitment to fix our national health service and deliver the real change that my constituent in northampton south vote for in july northampton south be home to four hospital our general hospital st andrew and berrywood hospital which both provide fantastic mental health care provision and the three shires hospital which be part of the circle health network despite all that choice time and again constituent tell that they struggle to get appointment each week at my constituency surgery and in my inbox learn of resident across northampton south who be desperate to see doctor or secure an appointment for much need surgery as their representative in this house have duty to speak up for they and to welcome the change that this budget will bring to their life be particularly proud that it deliver fund for additional appointment every single week that commitment mean that more resident in northampton will get the care they need when they need it that mean few day off work less time in pain and more importantly well health outcome have join this house from the construction sector should declare that my team be work in the new hospital programme supply chain think we must be honest about the state of our nhs building the previous government empty promise of new hospital become national embarrassment classic example of headline grab announcement that deliver little for our community instead this budget deliver real tangible investment billion in capital funding include billion to tackle the critical maintenance backlog in northampton we know all too well the impact of age nhs infrastructure northampton general hospital and our sister hospital kettering general have serve our community well but be show sign of age unlike many member here will not ask the treasury for more money for my hospital support my local integrate care board call for major investment in kettering just down the road hope that the review of the new hospital programme once complete will see positive outcome for our county finish by acknowledge the dedication of our nhs staff in northampton south the doctor nurse specialist healthcare assistant porter cleaner manager and administrator who keep our nhs running deserve our thank and support this budget give they the resource they need to do their job effectively in building that be fit for purpose with technology that work for they rather than against they this budget deliver our first step in build an nhs fit for the future even those of we who be new to this place know to expect more communication from our constituent about what be wrong than what be right so it be notable that receive email of thank and congratulation from constituent last week after the chancellor deliver her historic budget stability be highly prize by people after so much chaos and investment especially in our nhs be something that people have be cry out for however we must be honest with ourselves about the state of our nhs in east kent and in coastal community like mine east thanet have be overlook for far too long the service have have to endure the chaos and incompetence of the past year and have not be as resilient as other place to the onslaught the director of public health in north east lincolnshire stephen pintus have describe people live in coastal community as old before their time we need to reform the way we deliver nhs service in coastal community investment on its own will not be enough we need to redesign our health service to answer the question what care do people need where do they need it and how do they need it deliver my constituent have be suffer with poor nhs service for far too long east kent hospital university nhs foundation trust which run the queen elizabeth the queen mother hospital in margate be rank the third bad in england for its hour wait for emergency service its maternity service have be deem inadequate when staff be ask if friend or relative need treatment would be happy with their care only of staff say yes have people email about their urgent care and essential appointment be delay by waiting list people in dire need of mental healthcare be be tell to wait for month to get the help they desperately need there be denial of continuous care due to cost and lack of staffing and shockingly poor communication and record keeping result in cancer patient be misdiagnose in report by chris whitty entitle health in coastal communities he highlight the problem face by constituency such as mine and find that they have some of the bad health outcome in england with low life expectancy and high rate of major disease one of the major reason for that be simply lack of access to healthcare service both lack of nhs service in coastal community and lack of transport option whatever the reason for the challenge in coastal community we need to see reform the extra funding the chancellor announce last week be crucial to bring down waiting list and stop the chaos of year of tory mismanagement the british people deliver we mandate to fix the nhs if do well this reform will be transformative for the country especially in coastal community like east thanet be about to call the final back bench member no doubt lot of colleague who have contribute will be make their way back to the chamber for the front bench speech call matt turmaine thank you very much madam deputy speaker prior to be elect to this place work in health and social care so it have be interesting to hear some of the pronouncement from the mouth of opposition members which in many instance be frankly farcical in my constituency the legacy of year of fail conservative government be plain to see people unable to get gp appointment lack of nhs dentist for resident to sign up with poor mental health support for young people and adult and of course the undelivered promise of new hospital in watford cancel under the coalition and not deliver by the conservatives over subsequent year the previous government track record be one of decline in average waiting time be week and satisfaction level in the nhs be at their absolute high what contrast to with the nhs on its knee the chancellor of the exchequer announce in the budget an additional billion to support the nhs that will help to deliver more appointment for my constituent in watford and it will bring progress towards once again have to wait no more than week from referral to treatment as have be say we have do it before and we will do it again also welcome the chancellor billion to help rebuild school she mention watford in her budget speech note that school in my constituency will benefit from raac be deal with mention raac also bring we to the new hospital programme know my right hon friend the chief secretary to the treasury will be listen when say loud and clear that watford be desperate for new hospital that have be the case for many year the trust plan be ready to go go go but recognise that the chancellor have achieve the seemingly impossible by manage to start the new hospital programme and move forward with address the hospital affect by raac we hope the rest will follow soon campaign in good faith in the general election for new hospital and to honour the commitment make by the previous government but as we hear from the chancellor in the summer there be no money there the chancellor have work wonder with this budget she have deal with the financial black hole she have get the country back on its foot and she have put it on the road to recovery it be an excellent budget for the people of watford it be an excellent budget for the country wholeheartedly support it we have be able to get in over contribution so thank you very much to everybody for abide by the time limit now call the shadow minister thank you very much madam deputy speaker it be great pleasure to play part in bring today interesting debate to close take this opportunity to welcome the chief secretary to the treasury to his post know he have be in post for few month but we have not have the chance to get to know each other must say have be very impressed he he be fluent speaker he be good on detail that be not sarcasm be once warn by hansard that sarcasm do not come across well in the write record but know what it be to be send out to defend the indefensible can see that he be develop fine skill and that he be some way on his way to master it just gently say to your man start out in his front bench career in government not to get too good at it because you will find your party will give you ample opportunity to defend the indefensible in the year ahead order shadow minister do not think you be speak to when you say you you be obviously speak to the minister it have be long day madam deputy speaker hope you will forgive but enough of such pleasantry this be bad budget it be as bad as bad can be at its heart be decision to tax business hard very hard and through they to tax worker until the pip scream it be budget that see the total effective tax rate on low earn role increase to its high level since hit work people hard as the chief secretary to the treasury admit on sky television on friday we know that tax business be bad idea as my right hon friend the member for tatton esther mcvey say early business and work people be the dynamo of the economy if we denude and degrade they there be nothing for public service to feed on but we discover as this budget unravel that it be not just business that be be tax it be gps it be care home it be hospice as the hon member for poole neil duncan jordan point out and it be dentist charity childcare high education and school support staff understand that labour members will want to support big tax rise in the budget but before they vote on they ask they to consider whether they want to vote for tax rise on those service in response to an intervention from my hon friend the member for hinckley and bosworth dr evans who be sit behind the health secretary say that he would listen to gps but either the money from the national insurance contribution be in the budget or it be not either it be in the envelope or it be not have the thinking be do on this at present it would seem that all those service be in limbo yesterday during education question the education secretary be ask by both the shadow secretary of state my right hon friend the member for sevenoaks laura trott and the shadow minister my hon friend the member for harborough oadby and wigston neil whether school support staff would be affect she could not answer these be serious question and the government must know the answer his majesty treasury must have the datum and it must publish that datum so let first ask the chief secretary if he will publish figure show who will be hit by his national insurance contribution tax rise what the cost will be to the service concern and whether they will receive compensation as say the treasury must have the datum and if the chief secretary do not have it at his fingertip ask he to put it in the library of the house of commons as soon as possible we all want well public service the question be do we think we can get they if the service that have mention be be tax as the chief secretary say on television the other day without reform more generally money will just follow money out of the door we be tell that labour have plan for improve the nhs we know that because the prime minister tell we in speech on september that in the spring he would have plan that plan he say would contain transition to digital nhs move more care from hospital to community and focus effort on prevention over sickness who could argue with those sensible measure it be good to read in the red book at time of the budget that his majesty government intend to invest more than billion in nhs technology and digital to run essential service and drive nhs productivity improvement which will deliver productivity next year that be very sensible but it give rise to strange sense of déjà vu and then one remember that in the spring budget this year the then chancellor my right hon friend the member for godalming and ash jeremy hunt announce billion in additional funding for the nhs to deliver annual increase in productivity through new technology and digital across the health service in england so part of labour three point plan be not new at all it be conservative initiative already account for by conservative chancellor let we proceed to part move more care to community on that the red book say absolutely nothing as for part prevention there be small increase in tobacco duty and vaping product duty not content with tax we into growth the chancellor intend to tax we into health but it be all right because apparently the prime minister have plan to have plan in the spring will tell you funny story about the spring madam deputy speaker when be first work as parliamentary researcher there be some long forget report that the department for children schools and families be produce we ask when it would be publish and we be tell in the spring we ask when do spring end the department tell we when summer begin in that tale be an insight into the way in which labour government think it be tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow and never do reform come that be the plan for the nhs it be relatively well developed next to the non existent plan for welfare reform my right hon friend the member for central devon mel stride who be now the shadow chancellor start that work but silence have now descend more worker be need to grow the economy the obr be quite clear on that the chancellor have choose tax over employment which will not deliver growth the government plan have be to tax to spend to think bit to set up website to get tell to serve waffle for every meal and to think bit more then they will see whether any money be leave they will discover that there be not and they will need to increase taxis again what be become painfully apparent be that labour waste its time in opposition it have year to come up with plan for the nhs but it do not and now it be scrabble to find one by the time we see the prime minister fabled plan more than of this parliament will have pass and very little will have be do that be not already be do before the prime minister say there would be no extra money without reform but that be precisely what he have give the country that be the price of political complacency it be the price of think that governing be easy it be the price of believe your own hype and of fail to be honest with yourself some people say that the labour party be try to pull the wool over people eye and be one of they think that behind the great ambiguity of the labour manifesto there would be game plan but game plan have come there none we have billion of extra borrowing and billion more in high debt repayment mortgage payment be up and there be austerity for employer and worker loveless landslide have become loveless tax rise for the british people and they will not wear it rather enjoy that hope the hon gentleman can take breather now may welcome the new shadow chancellor of the duchy of lancaster to his place from what he have say today should confess that be not clinician think he may have some amnesia about the performance of his party in government but maybe the right hon member for tatton esther mcvey the former minister for common sense can help he find some before he next appear before the house may also welcome the new shadow chief secretary to the treasury the hon member for north bedfordshire richard fuller to his place madam deputy speaker some member of this house will know that you the shadow chief secretary and work very well together for many year on the business and trade committee clearly some thing have change and some have not you madam deputy speaker be now very much in control in the chair be on the other side of the table and answer the question and the shadow chief secretary will still shout at ministers irrespective of whether they be conservative or labour for be too socialist every government come into office seek to improve the country but it be now clear that the last conservative government do not come into office to improve public service in recent report from the institute for government two key conclusion be draw first that most public service be perform substantially bad in than they be in and secondly that public service performance have be damage by lack of capital investment after year of failure from the conservative party this government will begin the work of implement bold programme of public service reform this budget start that work by choose different path by choose investment over decline in do so we will make sure that every pound be spend well and that reform be bake into our approach to governing but we have also sign up to the much great challenge of fundamentally reform our public service see no great opportunity than modernise the very nature of the state not to get stick on the old debate about the size of the state but to fundamentally rewire and improve the state of the state this be generational budget it be budget that meet the scale of the challenge we face as country to illustrate that more clearly it be worth the house reflect on the story so far and on where the country find itself before this new labour government come into office our national debt be almost the same size as our gdp our investment share be the low of any in the and perhaps most significantly our growth lag behind that of other oecd country over the course of the last parliament result in lose opportunity and lose growth totalling billion the impact of this be painfully clear in our fiscal picture because the public finance we be tell we have inherit from the last government have be prove to be fiscal fiction ahead of the election we all know that the public finance be bad that be no secret but nobody expect to discover the negligent shameful hide secret of the billion black hole of in year spending that be hide from this house from the medium from the office for budget responsibility and from the encourage conservative members to look at the evidence from the obr to the treasury committee today which make just this point these issue be direct result of year of paper over the crack in our country foundation instead of fix they my right hon friend be repeat statistic that we will all be familiar with that of the billion black hole but it be important to make the point that that billion be not the extra money the conservatives be spend compare with what they be bring in the deficit last year be billion this billion be extra money bad than the billion deficit we already know we be inherit my hon friend be absolutely right these be promise make by the last government that they know they do not have the money to pay for this be spend from the general reserve the money put aside for genuine emergency each year that they blow three time over within the first three month of the financial year anyone who run business anyone who run family finance and anyone who be in charge of the country finance should know that that be shameful and the conservatives should apologise to the country for it nowhere be that more true than in our public service which have suffer as consequence of the conservatives mismanagement for example lord darzi independent report into the state of our nhs find that the past year have leave the nhs in critical condition we very much welcome what the government be do in relation to the contaminate blood and post office horizon scandal but let ask the minister very gentle question question that need to be answer in relation to the waspi woman when the right hon gentleman be in opposition we all support the waspi woman and now he be in government understand that the government be look at this issue what will happen to the waspi woman can we expect to have that address during this term as the hon gentleman know the ombudsman report to this house before the election make number of recommendation but do not conclude the basis on which compensation scheme might apply further work be therefore require which the secretary of state for work and pensions be look at but would point he to the fact that this be government who honour their promise if we look at the infected blood scandal or the post office horizon scandal an issue that work on for many year we be tell by the conservatives that they be do the right thing by compensate the victim but they do not put aside to pay for it from education to our justice system we have inherit public service that be on life support but do not need to tell work people that sadly they know it all too well because the last government lose control of both our public finance and our public service this budget and this government will get both back under control will now outline how we should do that by focus on one simple word reform reform be urgent because we can not simply spend our way to well public service this be government for work people and we be determined that they will get the good possible public service for the good possible price but public service reform be not just about policy or it system or procurement as important as they be it be about people it be about the people at the end of each of our decision the patient in the hand of the nhs with worry and hope in their heart the pupil in school college or university with aspiration that should be meet and the pensioner who want to feel safe walk to the shop on their high street behind each of those people be doctor nurse teacher police officer or civil servant these be public servant who have choose to work in public service to serve the public as this government do they be public servant and people who today feel frustrated by not be able to access public service and not be able to deliver they these be public service that when perform well deliver well function state and help keep worker educate well and able to help grow our economy and protect our country it be for these people that my right hon friend the chancellor confirm we will deliver new approach to public service that be responsible that look to the future and that balance investment to secure public service for the long term with reform to drive up the quality of those service today and with reform as condition for investment from the attlee government found the nhs to the blair government reform poorly perform state school reform be in labour dna now turn to some of the point make by right hon and hon member today and begin by congratulate my hon friend the members for broxtowe juliet campbell for sunderland central lewis atkinson and for stourbridge cat eccles and the hon member for yeovil adam dance on deliver their maiden speech there be many speech today so colleague will have to accept my apology for not be able to address all contribution individually however join my labour colleague in celebrate this budget because build an nhs that be fit for the future be one of this government five mission that be why we have invest over billion the high real term rate of growth since outside of the covid response have also hear the voice of hon member from northern ireland and scotland include the hon member for inverness skye and west ross shire mr macdonald who encourage so dearly to listen to his speech but have not return to the house for my sum up under this labour government the large real term funding increase since devolution begin have be deliver for scotland wales and northern ireland this labour government be deliver from westminster for the people of scotland wales and northern ireland and we will work in partnership with the devolved government to deliver the change for which people vote and which we have now give the devolved government the money to deliver we thank the minister for that but will he reassure the scottish government right now that their million of national insurance contribution for public sector employee will be give back in full compensation to the scottish government rather than be put into the block grant it be the great real term increase in funding since devolution begin if the devolved government wish to take responsibility for devolve matter they should do so if they do not wish to do so labour will happily take over at the next election to deliver well service for the people of scotland many member have ask to comment on the new hospital programme as the secretary of state for health and social care have confirm this government be commit to deliver realistic and deliverable plan and we will deliver the outcome of the review to the house in due course many member have also ask about the difficult decision to increase employer national insurance contribution in the context of labour honour its promise to work people not to increase employee national insurance contribution or income tax in their payslip it be right that the government be not legislate to exempt non public sector organisation from these change but as the secretary of state say we pay for these service and it will be reflect in their settlement to answer the shadow chancellor of the duchy of lancaster whether now or in the spring at the conclusion of the spending review those departmental settlement will be publish in the normal way do the minister not think that it be important that hon member see those figure to see how much the service mention will be tax before they vote on this budget would that not be transparent the hon gentleman perhaps forget that the vote be tomorrow no doubt he will come to the house to vote to support the allocation of billion of extra funding so that the national health service can cover the cost of the doctor and nurse who under his administration be strike on the picket line while ministers refuse to talk to they under this government they be back on the ward and in the theatre deliver for the people of this country the government recognise the need to reform the social care system and we thank those who work in the system for the work they do to help those in need that be why we agree million funding increase for and we will return to this issue in the second phase of the spending review politely say to member that understand the temptation to ask for more spending as often do in opposition but minister have to explain how they will pay for it if opposition member want more spending or indeed few tax rise they will have the opportunity tomorrow to set out to the house what they would do differently would they increase income tax and national insurance on worker once again would they increase vat on people who go to the shop would they increase corporation tax for business which we have pledge not to do would they reject the investment in school hospital the police service and the future of our country give their behaviour under the last administration do they wish just to borrow money every single month to pay the bill month after month increase the national debt and increase the cost of the national debt but not invest in the fabric of this country as this government will do may take the minister back to the question of social care understand what he be say and that proposal will be bring forward but there be two thing immediately there be crisis in local government about simply pay for exist social care and for family all over the country there be crisis about how they will support people who be in care at the present time be there an aspiration to bring forward much more comprehensive model that will provide hope for people who be often go deeply into debt sell property and all kind of thing just to support love one who be in desperate need of profound social care thank the right hon member for his question this government have aspiration to improve the social care system and we will set out further detail on those plan in due course lastly although not relate directly to the nhs or public service welcome the supportive comment from member across the house about the mineworker pension scheme and the post office horizon compensation scheme as you know madam deputy speaker work on those issue for many year when in opposition we fail to persuade the former government to do the right thing but the great thing about be in government be that we can just say it be so and it have be so that be the difference that labour government can make the labour party have proud heritage of deliver public service to meet the need of the nation the national health service social security comprehensive school the open university academy school this new labour government will seize the generational need to reimagine public service once again we have an age society few work people pay tax increase demand failing standard and increase cost after year of conservative government that be the legacy they have leave this country we will not walk by on the other side and ignore those challenge we will set out how we will reform our public service build on this budget of investment choose it over decline focus on outcome prevention devolution and innovation in order to modernise our public service as have set out today the big opportunity the opportunity to build the new foundation of the new public sector be technology the productivity of our public service be hold back by it system often date back to the and the fax machine in the nhs an inability to share information between public service ten of thousand of public servant do their good to administer casework use paper that situation have not be affect in any positive way over the past year this be not about machine learn algorithm but about old computer in cupboard with information that be in desperate need of be transfer to the cloud it be about the un newsworthy but vital work of integrate software across departments an area of spending protect and encourage in phase of the spending review it be about what might seem obvious to people at home who be now use to do their banking on an app or their shopping online who can not get through to gp surgery decision on their universal credit or an answer to their tax question without lengthy and often unsuccessful attempt to speak to someone on the telephone our new digital centre of government will drive digital transformation across government because modernise public service be not just great opportunity it be non negotiable requirement for any modern party in modern government today if we have follow the conservatives path of further decline we would have break public service that cost more while fail the public who rely on they and the public servant who work in they by choose to invest this party this government will deliver modern state that meet the need of the nation and deliver bright future for we all reform and growth investment over decline those be the choice reflect in this budget and that be the change this labour government will deliver order that the debate be now jones debate to be resume tomorrow nhs dentistry rural areas motion make and question propose that this house do now jones be grateful to have secure this evening adjournment debate on access to nhs dentistry in rural area in my first few month as the member of parliament for chippenham there have be one issue that have be raise with almost every day the decision by hathaway dental practice in chippenham to close its door to nhs patient on november today wish to put on the record why dentist like hathaway be cease to offer nhs dental care and why that be particularly devastating in rural community such as the one represent since be elect have correspond with hundred of my constituent about the state of nhs dentistry in wiltshire have meet patient one of the director of hathaway dental practice representative of our integrate care board denplan and the british dental association anyone that could help understand what be happen why it be happen and how we might save nhs dental care in wiltshire from disappear altogether only week into this parliament be able to raise the issue with the secretary of state for health and social care during briefing on preventive healthcare today hope to make the case to ministers yet again that nhs dental care be in crisis the failure to fix nhs dentistry be prove catastrophic in rural community up and down the uk and be unfortunately not problem unique to the south west think it might be helpful for colleague if take the time to relay some of the fact thank my hon friend for give way at time when tooth decay be the most common reason for hospital admission in child age between six and and when my constituent in rural area such as swallowfield and hurst struggle to access dentist do she agree that the conservative party have fundamentally fail the country on dentistry agree that dentistry have be fail over the past year accord to the house of commons library child have not see dentist in wiltshire in the past year my constituent in ilton be now in debt because they have to take their son who be eligible for free nhs dentistry to private dentist as they could not find an nhs dentist in the whole of somerset sadly that come as no surprise give that four in child in somerset have not be able to see dentist this past year do my hon friend agree that dentist need to be encourage back into the nhs by reform the broken nhs dental contract do agree with my hon friend and will mention that point later in my speech it be no surprise to that child in her constituency be have similar problem to child in my constituency accord to nhs england only of adult under the nhs bath and north east somerset swindon and wiltshire integrate care board have see dentist in the past two year accord to freedom of information request by the british dental association my local icb project dentistry underspend equate to million when hathaway close its door to nhs patient last friday this be major blow to my constituent some of my constituent in melksham and devizes who until recently have have an nhs dentist in chippenham now find that the service have be strip away from they they now have to pay monthly fee which total up to more than year at minimum do my hon friend agree that that and the state of child dentistry be become source of national shame urgent funding be need now to revive vital service and to ensure that the oral health of the nation child and adult be protect agree with my hon friend that speak to the fact that we be be leave with dental desert with no sign of relief commend the hon lady for secure this important debate she mention that dental desert can be problem up and down the country that be certainly the case in my constituency of north northumberland welcome the government dental rescue plan and the commitment to an additional appointment per year however my situation be like her constituent in hundred of square kilometre of my constituency tell that they simply can not access nhs dentistry it be real shame that no conservative members be here to hear this do the hon lady agree that rural resident should expect the same provision of nhs dentistry as those in urban area do agree with the hon member the real issue for rural area be again access to public transport dental provision might be relatively close in theory but public transport do not allow people to get to the dentist the issue of rurality be important and need to be address analysis conduct by the rural services network show that someone live in rural area be less likely to be able to access an nhs dentist than those live in an urban area with few dental practice take on new adult nhs patient in rural area the analysis also show that in rural area there be few dental practice with an nhs contract per people that again point to the fact that rural area be definitely in bad situation than urban one commend the hon lady for bring this issue forward the number of people in the chamber indicate the interest in it right across the united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland do she agree that dentistry be on the brink and that the additional national insurance contribution be go to push even more dentist into refuse nhs contract and take private patient only should not the government immediately instigate an increase in price in rural area to save the few dentist leave who be brave rural isolation and the increase cost of operation agree with the hon member the disparity be clear as he mention rural area be be hard hit by our broken nhs dental contract system unfortunately there do not seem to be much hope on the horizon denplan tell that of dentist plan to reduce their nhs commitment in the next two year and that the uk have the low dentist to population ratio in the whole of europe although all dentist be dedicate to improve the nation health access to nhs dental service remain persistent challenge under the current system particularly in rural area in lieu of the dental contract be renegotiate could something not be do by the local integrate care board that commission dentistry to make special provision for local contract when dentist be consider give up contract in the short term that could be do now in lieu of that renegotiation agree hold on interruption sorry will my hon friend give way yes thank you richard my hon friend be make an excellent speech she have mention icb commission write to the minister to ask whether there be set criterion for know where patient be on the waiting list and understand that that be entirely in the gift of individual practice do my hon friend think that it ought to be for icb or for nhs devon in my case to determine where people be on the waiting list for nhs dental care rise let give the hon lady moment to gather her thought before she resume her speech it be good not to refer to member by their first name she have solid minute although the minister have to respond within those minute so she can take her time thank you madam deputy speaker remind the house that the conservative government have the last decade to reform the dental contract but fail to do so therefore implore the new government to act now with two simple action first they should introduce timeline for reform the nhs dental contract system the secretary of state for health and social care say that that be their intention but feel that there be an element of urgency about this especially for rural area that have not be address secondly would like it to be mandatory requirement for icb to appoint dentist to their board there be strong feeling among dentist that icb board of director do not understand the issue they face do the hon member think it indicative of the state of politic today that although member from both side of the house be here not single one of the culprit those responsible for the shameful state of dentistry across the uk not least in my constituency be here to listen to her very important speech agree with the hon gentleman it be disappointing that those who have fail to address this issue over many year still do not seem to see it as important although the dental contract be introduce under labour government it be clear that after length of time there be an obvious moment when it should have be reform but be not that be disappointing and noticeable to reinforce the point make by the hon member for truro and falmouth jayne kirkham and for camborne and redruth perran moon and by my hon friend this be not purely down to money indeed there be an underspend in the dentistry contract of many icb and not just in cornwall fundamentally we know that it be the nature of the contract itself that mean we end up in situation such as that in cornwall where child can expect never to see an nhs dentist until adulthood agree with my hon friend as have mention the icb that represent my constituency have quite significant underspend in its dental budget that be quite often because dental practice do not wish to take up the contract as they find that the payment system and its use of unit of dental activity fail to support they in way that allow they to make living as we say early small business be struggle across the country they find that they be subsidise their nhs dentistry with private dentistry to the point that it be no long sustainable another issue that be prevalent in most rural area and certainly in the south west be recruitment while nhs dentistry do not pay it be extremely difficult for dental practice to find dentist who will take on nhs contract many of the dentist who take on nhs contract have leave some be european citizen or be simply no long prepared to spend that many hour in dental surgery and have decide either to retire or to take on easy work elsewhere this ongoing problem will continue unless the dental contract be reform quickly do my hon friend agree that it be wrong that patient who have be force to seek private care in an emergency be then refuse nhs registration because they be consider to already be register as private patient should this not be address in any revise contract my hon friend make an interesting point that be not aware of from discuss this matter with dentist it be my understanding that these day nobody be actually register with dentist they be merely allow to come regularly and if they do not they be take off that dentist list my understanding be that it be quite difficult to register so that be an interesting point that hope the minister will note particular concern to dental practice and point that denplan make very clear to be that once dental practitioner have hand in their nhs provider number even if the dental contract be improve they be unlikely to come back to the nhs because of the complication involve in get that provider number reinstate that be why we need the government to act now before more dentist leave the nhs another issue for dental practice be that when qualified dentist come over from the eu their qualification be valid but they have to spend an extra year training before they be allow to register as nhs practitioner that be slow down any chance of increase our intake from our european partner be very grateful to the hon lady for secure this debate and particularly for highlight the add impact that the loss of dentist have in rural area where if people lose their dentist there be often no other dentist nearby in my constituency people frequently say that they struggle to find any dentist take new nhs patient she be right to highlight that the dental contract be the root cause of the issue and to press for clear timescale do she agree that by the end of this calendar year the government should have set out timescale for start crucial negotiation on the contract agree that timeline for reform the dental contract be vital that be what be ask for if we lose this opportunity and our nhs dentist leave the system we will be in an increasingly difficult place across wiltshire for those not already register with an nhs dentist it be absolutely impossible to get one there be not single practice take on nhs patient right across the unitary authority of wiltshire despite its size the number of dentist be obviously extremely important but that be just part of what go into the equation in rural constituency such as mine access to healthcare service be heavily dependent on frequent reliable service in particular bus service do the hon lady agree that if people be to access dental service we need to ensure that those reliable frequent public service be back in place as be sure the hon member will remember have already mention the serious issue of public transport in rural area on several occasion could not agree with he more thank the house once again for allow to make the case for improved nhs dental care and implore the minister and his colleague to do the right thing by my constituent and those of the member who have intervene in order to support dental care specifically in rural area start by thank the hon member for chippenham sarah gibson for secure this important debate as my right hon friend the secretary of state have say we will be honest about the problem and challenge face our health and care system and we will be serious about tackle they in my constituency there have be an decline in the number of adult who have see an nhs dentist in just the last few year it have be precipitous there be specific problem however with adult in care home speak to local dentist and she explain that the standard insurance for dentist no long cover they visit and perform service in care home in the community can the minister look into that and do he agree that it be huge problem that when vulnerable people can not come to dental practice dentist can not go to they my hon friend point to specific problem set against the backdrop of the general challenge that we face in dentistry thank to the legacy of year of tory incompetence and negligence we will of course look into it and if she would care to write to would be happy to look into the issue the hon member for chippenham be right to raise the problem of nhs dentistry in rural area problem that will sadly be familiar to member across the house the truth be that we be very far from where we need to be lord darzi review lay bare the true extent of the challenge face our health service include nhs dentistry and even he with all his year of experience be shock by what he discover his report be vital because it give we the frank assessment we need to face the problem honestly and properly it will take last reform and long term health plan to save our nhs rescue nhs dentistry will not happen overnight but we will not wait to make improvement to the system increase access and incentivise the workforce to deliver more nhs care the government have commit to three seismic shift from hospital to community from analogue to digital and from sickness to prevention our year plan will set out how we will deliver those shift to give the country an nhs that be fit for the future share the astonishment of other member that not single conservative member be here in debate on nhs dentistry in rural area be bit old fashioned and want function opposition it be sad that they be not here to take part in this debate when contact surgery in macclesfield to find out the state of play say that they do not accept nhs patient at all that be the legacy that the conservatives have leave we can the minister confirm that the government will move urgently and quickly on nhs dentistry reform order intervention should be short and the minister must respond to the member whose debate it be we be work at pace and will say more about that shortly share my hon friend reflection on the complete absence of the conservatives they make complete mess of our public service call an election and run for the hill on july we inherit broken nhs dentistry system it be national scandal that tooth decay be the lead cause of hospital admission for five to nine year old in our country it be truly shameful and nothing short of dickensian in the area serve by the nhs bath and north east somerset swindon and wiltshire integrate care board which include the constituency of the hon member for chippenham of adult be see by an nhs dentist in the month up to march that compare to average across england in there be dentist per of the population there whereas the national average be when we look at the problem in the round it be not so much that we do not have enough dentist but that not enough of they be do nhs work and they be not in the part of the country that need they most that challenge be compound by the fact that some area of the country be experience recruitment and retention issue include many rural area where the challenge in access nhs dentistry be exacerbate that of course include chippenham where hathaway dental practice have recently have request grant to reduce its nhs activity as the hon lady point out understand thank to freedom of information request by the british dental association that the practice have million underspend on its nhs contract that be precisely the problem that hon member have point out there be quantum of funding but the way in which it be structure make private sector dentistry far more attractive than nhs dentistry that be the root cause of the problem we be alive to that issue overall it be clear that we have mountain to climb it be daunting challenge but we be not daunt and we be work at pace the golden hello scheme for example will see up to dentist receive payment of to work for three year in one of the area that need they the most integrated care board have already begin to advertise post as we have accelerate that process in the icb area of the hon member for chippenham there have be seven expression of interest five of which have be approve provider can now include incentive payment when they advertise vacant position alongside that we will deliver rescue plan that get nhs dentistry back on its foot that will start with provide additional urgent appointment as rapidly as possible as set out in our manifesto strengthen the workforce be key to our ambition but for year the nhs have face chronic workforce shortage so we have to be honest about the fact that bring in the staff we need will take time will the minister give way have very little time leave we be committed to reform the dentistry contract to make nhs work more attractive boost retention and deliver shift to prevention this government will always make sure that our health and care system have the staff it need so that it be there for all of we when we need it we be already work at pace with the british dental association and the dental sector to improve and reform the dental contract the secretary of state meet the bda on his first day in office and have meet it couple of time include yesterday we will listen to the sector and learn from the good practice out there for example know that the icb of the hon member for chippenham have apply its delegate power to increase the availability of nhs dentistry across the south west through other target recruitment and retention activity that include work on regional level to attract new applicant through increase access to postgraduate bursary explore the potential for apprenticeship and support international dental graduate in addition consultation for tie in to nhs dentistry for graduate dentist close on july and we be now consider the response the government position on this proposal will be set out in due course we be also work round the clock to end the appalling tooth decay that be blight on our child as have mention we be work with local authority and the nhs to introduce supervised tooth brushing for three to five year old in the most deprived community across the country get they into healthy habit for life and protect their tooth from decay we will set out plan for that in due course but it be clear that to maximise return on investment tooth brush programme must be target at child in the most disadvantaged community in addition to our supervised tooth brushing scheme the measure we be take to reduce sugar consumption will have positive effect on child oral health we also know that water fluoridation be safe and effective measure to reduce tooth decay it currently cover million people in england and decision on expand that will be make in due course we find ourselves in an extremely challenging fiscal position but we remain committed to tackle the immediate crisis and to fix nhs dentistry in the long term with dental contract reform we be commit to provide more urgent dental appointment the golden hello scheme to recruit more dentist in area of great need continue to work with the sector to help find solution to improve access to nhs dentistry tackle the disparity that be commonly see in dentistry roll out supervise tooth brushing for three to five year old in our most deprived community make sure everyone who need dentist can get one irrespective of whether they live in city or in rural area and do the job on long term dental contract reform which will take some time we will clear up the mess we have inherit we will get nhs dentistry back on its foot and we will build an nhs dentistry service that be fit for the future question put and agree to house adjourn
