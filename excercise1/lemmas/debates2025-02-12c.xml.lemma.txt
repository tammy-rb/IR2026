he be now british citizen this be precisely why we need to break the conveyor belt from arrive in the uk to acquire indefinite leave to remain and then british passport and now right to bring six family member here as well just last week the prime minister bizarrely claim that british passport be not pull factor for those come to the uk will he now support our plan to toughen the process on

her own record the right hon and learn gentleman be the prime minister now the people out there want to know what he be go to do about the situation he need to spend less time whine about the last government and do his job think the prime minister and agree that israel have right to defend herself yet the judge in this case note that the family be face humanitarian crisis as consequence of the israeli government indiscriminate attempt to eliminate hamas and government lawyer accept that be the prime minister allow lawyer to change the position on israel and be that because of advice from

any adaptation but this be get tedious the prime minister have not read the judgment suggest that he do so very serious question be now be ask about the attorney general the prime minister personal friend and donor even labour ministers be concern one labour peer lord glasman have call he the absolute archetype of an arrogant progressive fool if we be serious about protect our border we need to make sure that we appoint people who believe in our country and everything we stand for it be not clear that the attorney general do the government be now recruit new chief inspector of border who live in finland and want to work from home this be not serious why should the british public put up with it the individual in question be appoint in by the last government to senior position he then

we will not abandon our skilled workforce but level head assessment of the implication be need and that be what we be go through at the moment however we will always put our national interest first and steelworker first it seem to that give the way in which president trump and his ally musk be operate they need to hear of strong measure and hear strong word even from their ally let move on to the subject of ukraine if it be force to surrender its own sovereign territory to russia that will be the great betrayal of european ally since poland in but president trump say ukraine may end up russian and he want american money back think we all fear where this could end and the dangerous implication for our defence and our security can the prime minister reassure the house that he and

good friend represent good value for the british taxpayer we have long have the principle in this country that everybody be entitle to legal representation which mean that lawyer do not necessarily agree with their client conservative members use to believe in that principle if they now disagree they should go to see the victim of very serious crime include sexual crime and tell they that under their provision lawyer who disagree with perpetrator would not be able to represent they mean that victim would be cross examine by perpetrator that have never be the conservative party position if it

visit to see the worsen condition it be estimate that maintain the hospital for those will cost almost as much as the rebuild itself will the prime minister explain the logic of make taxpayer pay twice the hon lady constituent be right to be frustrate about the empty unfunded promise that be leave behind by the conservatives point make by she and by my hon friend the member for basingstoke luke murphy under the previous government plan new hospital in basingstoke would simply not have be deliver because it be unfunded it be promise without anything behind it we have put in place fund deliverable plan that will see the hospital build and we will work closely with the trust to ensure that it be the government devolution plan be welcome progressive development to shift power and resource from whitehall to our community there be discussion now about the process and the realisation of benefit for our community will the prime minister assure my resident in worthing west and those in all constituency start priority devolution programme that sussex devolution will give we meaningful control of our local priority include housing transport and social care thank my hon friend

believe that those with skin in the game make the good decision about their community for the final question call andrew mitchell the prime minister will be well aware of the global vaccination fund gavi one of the united kingdom great success story it have vaccinate from deadly disease more than billion child under five it present real value for money to british taxpayer and more than of our constituent support it will he give the house an undertaking that britain will continue that leadership and make decisive pledge at next month replenishment conference this be really important issue as the right hon gentleman rightly point out have long support it and will continue to support it and will share detail with he just as soon as can energy infrastructure chinese companies urgent question to ask the secretary of state for energy security and net zero if he will make statement on the potential security implication of the involvement of chinese company include mingyang in energy infrastructure project thank the hon lady for bring the urgent question to the house the protection and security of the energy sector be an absolute priority for this government we have range of effective measure in place that give the government power to balance an open investment environment to facilitate growth with protect the area of our economy that be most sensitive to national security the government firmly believe that the big risk to our energy system and energy security be remain dependent on international fossil fuel market control by petrostate and dictator that be why we have mission to make britain clean energy superpower to end that dependence we have world lead offshore wind industry in the uk and international investment play crucial role in support job across the country as part of that mission my department engage in discussion with wide range of investor include those from other country we be also clear that alongside that the growth of uk supply chain be critical that be why we have set out plan for clean industry bonus to drive investment in manufacturing as well as set up great british energy and the national wealth fund the government will not hesitate to use our power to protect national security whenever we identify concern and we will take consistent long term and strategic approach to manage the uk relation with china root in uk and global interest the government will co operate with china where it can compete where it need to and challenge where it must thank the minister for her comment and general reassurance but there be specific concern at the moment china can produce what be useful to we for the development of renewable particularly in the north sea and we can benefit from those investment china also need access to our market however security issue involve company work in offshore renewable development have become apparent in recent week and have be raise numerous time it have be report that the chinese company mingyang be interested in produce turbine for new project in the north sea around million of scottish government funding have be earmark for wind turbine factory near inverness in addition to potential million for orient cable to provide subsea cable for island community that be despite the european union bring anti trust case against china and the norwegian government block mingyang from its green infrastructure project will the minister reassure the house that the department will follow the same rigorous process to assess those risk as the previous government which ultimately block huawei from the network this must include an assessment of any opportunity for remote access to the turbine as the software will normally remain in the control of the manufacturer even once commission leave they vulnerable to be switch off we need local control will the department reassure the house that discussion be ongoing with the scottish government to ensure that no public money be invest before this risk assessment have take place how will ministers work with the scottish government and cabinet colleague to ensure that offshore and undersea infrastructure be safe the hon lady raise important concern that we be very much alive to as say in my first answer energy security be critical to the department work and that be why we have the clean power mission to end our dependency on fossil fuel international investment be crucial part of that and help to support growth and job across the country as part of that we have discussion with wide range of international investor but we absolutely recognise that this need to be balance against national security implication we work on that constantly across government with input from number of departments and be pleased to see my hon friend the minister for security from the home office here for the urgent question the government have to consider both those aspect together the need for investment and for great capacity in our supply chain and the security risk while can not get into the detail of the individual case give the nature of the ongoing discussion reassure the hon lady that we be take these factor into account we do want to make sure that the most robust process be follow as we look at the detail of this particular issue call the chair of the select committee be pleased to hear the minister confirm the importance of our energy security in contrast to what we see under the previous government interruption opposition member can groan all they want but that be the reality of what be inherit in july last year as we extend energy infrastructure in this country can my hon friend the minister confirm how this government will ensure that we have control of the operation of that infrastructure do she agree it be vital that through the industrial strategy we see renaissance in our manufacturing and great resilience in our supply chain all of which add to the energy security of this country my hon friend be absolutely right that deal with capacity issue in our supply chain be crucial part of get this investment into infrastructure it be one of the reason why through the national wealth fund we invest in lithium in cornwall last week through the critical mineral strategy we want to maximise the natural resource that we have where we can as have say we want to make absolutely sure that security concern be address as well when we look at which investor invest in our new economy call the shadow secretary of state the indication that mingyang will get the green light from the treasury to supply wind turbine technology to the green volt wind farm in the north sea be concern indeed alarm bell have be sound by official in the minister department and in the ministry of defence this green revolution will come with make in china label the government in collusion with the scottish national party in holyrood be determined to see chinese company reap the economic reward the minister party say again and again that the transition to renewable energy will reduce our reliance on hostile regime chinese control technology embed in our critical energy infrastructure be evidently threat to our security can the minister assure we that she be take this threat seriously can she explain how use wind turbine make by mingyang reduce our reliance on foreign state just last week along with many mp in the minister party be brief by the royal navy on the vulnerability of our subsea communication and energy infrastructure we have see pervasive rise in sabotage attack on subsea cable in the baltic affect our scandinavian ally if chinese manufacture turbine be instal security expert have warn that sensor could spy on british sea defence submarine programme and the layout of our energy infrastructure we would be reliant on chinese equipment and software and on chinese supplier for update and maintenance hand beijing significant opportunity for interference in the current international climate it be unthinkable to disregard the security implication of this decision can the minister confirm that the government have scrap the giga green industry growth accelerator scheme that we launch to build british supply chain in energy technology what discussion have she have with the ministry of defence about its concern over our ability to ensure the security of our energy system what safeguard will be in place to prevent chinese maintenance ship access the turbine for repair what guarantee have she have if any from our defence and security agency that this investment will pose no threat to our national security if such assurance be not forthcoming will she revisit this decision and put halt to the madness of allow the people republic of china to have such significant stake in our energy system when the sorry be the minister now laughter the shadow minister mention revisit this decision but as yet no decision have be make we be undergo rigorous process to consider the role of china in our supply chain and in the investment in our critical infrastructure have be in my position the hon gentleman will know why it be so important that do not provide running commentary on individual case but have make it clear that we be take into account the national security consideration as well as our need for investment in the supply chain let touch on the legacy that we be leave by the previous minister he be perfectly happy to leave our energy system expose with the british people pay the price the retreat the under new management line that he be parrot early this week would leave we even more exposed to those petrostate and dictator we be get on with our clean power mission to end our energy insecurity and shall take no lesson from the shadow minister on energy security give his government record be glad to hear the minister point out that when it come to green investment over the past year the legacy that we be leave with be of an absolutely vacant industrial strategy urge she to explain far how we might be able to develop the skill and competency in this country to make sure that we have good strong and ethical supply chain thank my hon friend for her question we have launch the clean industry bonus which will be crucial in protect our supply chain we be invest through gb energy and the national wealth fund have already mention lithium in cornwall through the global clean power alliance which we launch at the end of last year we will bring together our counterpart from other country include at the international energy agency conference in april to look at supply chain mission to deal with these issue these issue do not just affect we in this country as other country seek to decarbonise and increase the role of renewable we will all need to co operate and deal with the capacity issue across the supply chain call the liberal democrat spokesperson thank my hon friend the member for edinburgh west christine jardine for secure this important urgent question since the russian invasion of ukraine as the minister have rightly say energy security have be key term in this chamber there be two way of look at energy security first it be about generate our own renewable energy to avoid price volatility and exposure to authoritarian regime ensure that we have the job here at home for design and construction secondly it be about the national security issue around our energy infrastructure which be also form of energy security former chief have warn of the vulnerability either deliberate or inadvertent pose by foreign control software embed in our energy infrastructure give those serious concern can the minister guarantee that any further investment in scotland will increase both our energy and our national security as have say we be go through the robust process to try to make absolutely sure that our national security be not compromise by investment from overseas and we will continue to do that the grangemouth refinery be vital piece of scottish infrastructure and its economic contribution to the scottish economy be worth more than million every year the grangemouth refinery be also joint venture between petrochina own by the chinese state and ineos multinational conglomerate together they be petroineos the refinery be due to close with thousand of job be lose an unjust transition and scotland have to rely on import oil all at time of great global volatility why be this government allow foreign government and private capital dictate scotland industrial capacity its ability to produce oil and overall our national security we be not allow anyone to dictate to we know my hon friend have be deep in conversation for some time with the minister for energy over grangemouth future to reiterate we absolutely need to attract investment to meet our clean power mission to secure our future energy security and in the long run to bring down bill for the british people we need to balance national security concern in tandem with that and neither one take priority we need to tackle those challenge together and that be what we will do whatever the question about energy be china be not the answer first we know the ministry of defence and the department for energy security and net zero have raise objection about the treasury push to bring mingyang smart energy into the circuit to bid for this secondly china be determined to involve slave labour in its product we be invest under this government in solar array which use huge amount of slave labour in produce polysilicon do the government not recognise that their tilt towards china to get it to invest run the real risk of utter dependency on china and serious threat to our security which have be highlight endlessly by the security service and will they now stop recognise that the right hon member have long stand concern about the role of china and its investment in our economy he have be great champion of raise concern about force labour and he be right to do so we have set up the solar taskforce as be sure he be aware to look at whether there be force labour in our solar supply chain as have say supply chain mission will be launch as part of the global clean power alliance this be not something that one country can tackle by itself we all need to be alert to the risk of slave labour know that an amendment be pass in the house of lords last night that mean the issue will come back to this chamber soon and look forward to the discussion then do the minister agree that develop our economic and trading relationship with other nation be one lever of many that the government be use to drive growth and investment alongside plan reform public investment and proper industrial strategy for the people not only of the uk but my city at the same time our work across departments must always have our nation security at its core my hon friend be absolutely right and we be use number of lever the growth mission and the clean power mission work hand in hand to ensure that energy security and the decarbonisation of our power system contribute to growth in this country and that mean contribute to job creation and in some case overseas investment we have set up great british energy and we have the national wealth fund and the clean industry bonus all of which will help we achieve those objective have ministers or official in the ministry of defence the home office or the security service raise any concern with the department over the possibility of offshore structure in british water be use for chinese intelligence gather technology if there be sensitive matter that can not be discuss in the house will she commit to hold private briefing for member on the security implication of energy infrastructure from china can not comment on the extent of conversation other than to reassure the hon member that of course those conversation be take place and will be ongoing and that we be go through robust process again because it be not my specific role can not say whether that information could be share do not think that it can be share on day to day basis but will investigate whether we could arrange briefing with member to give some reassurance as to the general approach be surprised that conservative members seem to have forget the time when they be push the golden era of the relationship between the uk and china some of this be legacy of their time in government so they should be careful about how they approach this conversation point out to the minister the role that grimsby play in service and support operation of offshore wind not only around uk water but as far as taiwan those skill competency and capability exist here in the country so what additional support will be give to expand those capability and support for skill in this country my hon friend have be real champion for grimsby and be glad to see she return at the recent election so that she can carry on champion all the potential that grimsby have to offer not least in the wind sector it be important that we link up skill and capacity that be one of the obstacle we talk often about how grid capacity and planning issue can hold up the roll out of clean power but we have to have the skill base as well we be work with the department for education on how we can train and develop capacity within the exist workforce through thing like the growth and skill levy to work on these exciting new project the minister speak about be reliant on the petrochemical state and dictatorship that supply the fuel need for our energy system and yet the vast majority of the process material need whether we construct thing here or not come from china we recognise that some of those country be dictatorship but will the minister confirm at the dispatch box that country that use slave labour have carry out the most horrendous crime against the uyghur population and have sanction our own parliamentarian be as much dictatorship as the country that she say we want to no long be reliant on if we follow the approach suggest by the opposition front bench we would be firmly back in the hand of the petrostate and the dictator as for our relationship with china as have say we will co operate where we can compete where we need to and absolutely challenge if we must we have be clear that no company in the uk should have force labour in its supply chain that be why we have set up the solar taskforce and be go through robust process ahead of the decision that we be talk about will take no lesson from the right hon member because we have have year of be expose to volatile energy market and we be try to recreate our energy security through this investment do the minister agree that after the real neglect of our energy infrastructure for the past year set up gb energy to help uk ownership of energy production can only be good thing and that our investment in critical mineral particularly in cornwall and in the supply chain for float offshore wind will be crucial for our national security on the one hand conservative members raise concern about critical mineral be import from abroad on the other when my hon friend who be real champion for her area praise the investment that we have put into lithium extraction in cornwall they start jeer we will continue to invest through gb energy and the national wealth fund to have true energy security we need home grow capability at all stage of the development of renewable energy infrastructure from the early research to maintenance and decommissioning what step be the minister take to ensure that we have that home grow full lifecycle capability from the hon member question she may be talk about community energy be not quite sure indicate dissent in that case will say that it be important that any investment be place base and we need to look at develop the capability such as the skill and the capacity of the local authority that be where community energy come in we also need to ensure that the finance go where the investment be need if have not understand the hon member question would be happy to take it up with she afterwards welcome the minister engagement on this topic to have meaningful and serious discussion with other major economy be vital for our success do the minister agree that those discussion be key to not only secure our economic aim but tackle the climate and nature crisis and achieve our wide international objective yes that international co operation be absolutely crucial it mean talk to country with which we share great deal in common and which be sign up to the same objective but it also mean talk to other country to bring they with we that be why we be host the international energy agency summit in london in april why we have set up the global clean power alliance and why the prime minister go to the cop climate change talk in baku last autumn and show international leadership which be very much lacking from uk government of previous year clearly national security concern be be express across the house will the minister ensure that the construction maintenance and access to software will be carry out by british worker in british shop and will not be subcontract to foreign power as have say can not comment on individual case but there be process to ensure that our national security be protect as we look ahead welcome the minister reassurance about the government rigorous scrutiny of energy project involve chinese technology understand the argument that at the current stage of our transition to net zero we may need to look far afield to meet our domestic energy need but do she agree that the long term plan ought to be to reduce reliance on chinese technology in the uk energy sector and to use british make green technology about which there can be no national security or ethical supply chain concern agree that be why we be do all we can to increase capacity through initiative such as the clean industry bonus investment from the national wealth fund the role of gb energy and all the other measure that we will take through our industrial strategy to ensure that we keep and create job in the uk the minister be all over the place on this in her opening remark she say that the united kingdom have world lead renewable energy industry if we do we would not be have this discussion about foreign import infrastructure notwithstanding the tories total failure over year to invest in the industrial base for renewable energy manufacturing across the united kingdom what be the government strategy to get in front of this not just in manufacturing but in resource supply enterprise resource planning and intellectual property what be the big shift that the government have plan just hear jibber jabber that be not very polite of the hon member as have say we be do all we can to attract investment into the uk so that we can be as reliant as possible on our own resource that mean our own supply chain and attract investment and so on we be do that through the national wealth fund and through gb energy do not know to what extent he take part in debate on the great british energy bill but there be much discussion then as have say this issue must be solve on an international level we be do lot of work with our colleague to make the north sea the green power plant of europe through the north seas energy co operation council and we have set up the global clean power alliance we can not act alone although know that the scottish national party prefer that approach we be work in co operation but also in the good interest of the british economy can the minister confirm that her department work be entirely consistent with the government approach to china co operate where we can compete where we need to and challenge where we must that be exactly our approach and it be the right approach perhaps the opposition front benchers would advocate not co operate with china but it be an incredibly important player on the world stage and we gain nothing from completely turn our back on it and not engage in dialogue follow its illegal invasion of ukraine we see how russia respond in the global tarrif sanction market it try to use its dominance in the nuclear fuel market to put pressure on ukraine ally we see the vulnerability in our energy supply chain when our enemy and ally of those enemy want to use it against we former head of sir richard dearlove say that the government target of decarbonise the grid hand power to beijing we have enough oil and gas in the uk not to have to rely on dictator state so why do we not just get drill and get our own oil and gas out of the ground suspect that in their mad dash to decarbonise the grid the government will not do that but have they undertake risk assessment of the strategic vulnerability of our national security in our increase reliance on chinese rare earth mineral and battery production think have make it clear that there be ongoing conversation about that and that we take national security incredibly seriously when we consider investment decision on what the hon member say about produce more oil and gas here for our own use think he need lesson in how the energy market work there be no guarantee that it would be use here the issue be the labour government rush to decarbonise by which mean that this country do not have the capability to fulfil all the requirement to deliver on these project until we do we will always be reliant on overseas power and people such as the chinese government and chinese manufacturer to deliver what we need in order to decarbonise be the government prepared and happy to sacrifice our national security and our energy security to reach that target it sound very much like the hon member be make the case for an industrial strategy that ensure that we can match demand with supply that approach be particularly miss from the previous government almost on weekly basis we be lecture by the net zero obsess secretary of state that the race for renewable be necessary in order to give this country secure future supply of energy yet the renewable industry be increasingly dependent on chinese technology and on rare earth metal of which the chinese control so we be place our future energy supply in the hand of dictatorship that have prove itself willing to use such infrastructure to blackmail the country in which it be base should we not consider the supply of fossil fuel in this country decade of oil and gas which we could use without interference from other we believe that the good route to energy security be through our clean power by mission and further investment in renewable that remain our stance the minister will be aware that the costly environmental obligation that the government impose on home manufacture good be not adhere to by many other nation which often prevent uk manufacturer from be able to compete do the minister agree that those consideration as well as the routine human right breach of chinese business against the uyghurs falun gong christians and other ethnic minority should be equally weight with cost human right and chinese production will never add up that must inform any contract offer by this nation of ours the hon member have frequently raise almost every issue that one could think of but he and have take part in many debate about human right in country of concern over the year and he be absolutely right to flag those concern as have say we have the solar taskforce and the supply chain mission with the global clean power alliance we be very much alert to those matter we do not want to see force labour or any form of modern slavery in our supply chain we be determined to take action on that prevent learning review with permission madam deputy speaker will make statement on the publication of the prevent learning review into the perpetrator of the attack that tragically kill sir david amess on october sir david amess be beloved member of this house hugely respected parliamentarian his popularity extend right across the political divide to win and keep the respect of those outside one own party be as we all know rare accomplishment over nearly year of service in this place sir david fight every day for his constituent he advance numerous cause with compassion persistence and skill and member on all side of the house know he as warm respectful and always fair parliamentarian his legacy live on not least in southend which now have the city status he campaign so determinedly for he will never be forget and as the motto on sir david memorial shield behind state his light remain while this house lose hugely value member on that terrible day sir david wife and child lose love husband and devoted father they be in our thought and prayer today and always together with the home secretary who speak with sir david family recently recognise the courage and persistence they have show in seek the answer that they deserve as the house will know it be heinous act of violence on october that take sir david away from those who know and love he the killer ali harbi ali and will not say his name again be convict of murder in april and receive whole life sentence the judge say that this be murder that strike at the heart of our democracy and he have no doubt whatsoever that the nature of this case mean that the perpetrator must be keep in prison for the rest of his life the perpetrator have previously be refer to the prevent programme and subsequently to the specialist channel programme between and or between five and seven year before the attack take place immediately after the attack prevent learning review be jointly commission by the home office and counter terrorism policing to examine what happen in the case and see whether lesson need to be rapidly learn it be complete in february last week make statement to the house on the government publication of the prevent learning review concern the perpetrator of the abhorrent attack in southport today we be take further step to enable public scrutiny of prevent and in recognition of the seriousness of the terrible attack on sir david by publish the prevent learning review conduct in this case too the perpetrator of the attack on sir david become know to prevent in october when he be refer by his school after teacher identify change in his behaviour the case be adopt by the channel multi agency early intervention programme in november an intervention provider who specialise in tackle islamist extremism be assign to work with he the perpetrator be exit from channel in april after his terrorism risk be assess as low month post exit police review in also find no terrorism concern the case be close to prevent at that point there be no far prevent referral in the five year between the case be close and the attack the prevent learning review examine how prevent deal with the perpetrator risk and how far the improvement make to prevent since he be refer seven year prior would have impact on his management the review consider both the handling of the case at the time and the change that have be make to prevent since the referral in it examine how far those change address any problem identify and then make series of recommendation the reviewer find that from the material review the assessment in term of the perpetrator vulnerability be problematic and this ultimately lead to questionable decision making and sub optimal handling of the case during the time he be engage with prevent and channel it identify that the vulnerability assessment framework be not follow with the perpetrator symptom be prioritise over address the underlie cause of his vulnerability the reviewer ultimately find that while prevent policy and guidance at the time be mostly follow the case be exit from prevent too quickly the reviewer identify six issue the support give do not tackle all of the vulnerability identify record keeping be problematic and the rationale for certain decision be not explicit responsibility between police and the local authority be blur the tool use for identify an individual vulnerability to radicalisation be outdate the school that make the referral to prevent should have be involve in discussion to help determine risk and appropriate support and the tasking of the intervention provider be problematic with miscommunication lead to only one session be provide instead of two the reviewer then examine how far change in the prevent programme since have address these issue the reviewer recognise the significant change that have be make to prevent since the perpetrator be manage in particular the introduction of the statutory prevent and channel duty under the counter terrorism and security act the reviewer conclude that over the intervene period there have be considerable change to policy and guidance for both the police and the wide prevent arena include channel while number of the issue in the perpetrator case would most likely not be repeat today there be still number of area that could be consider as require further work to mitigate future failure the reviewer make four recommendation for action to far strengthen prevent these be to improve the referral process strengthen the initial intelligence assessment process update the tool use to identify vulnerability to be draw into terrorism and to not reduce data retention period since the report the home office and counter terrorism policing have fully implement all four recommendation first single national referral form be launch to encourage consistent approach to referral build this into new training package and mandate its use via statutory guidance secondly training have be deliver to police staff to strengthen the initial intelligence check stage ensure their understanding of prevent be robust thirdly new prevent assessment framework be roll out in september which replace the tool previously use to assess all referral and case in the prevent system fourthly datum retention period be fully review in and joint decision be take by the home office and counter terrorism policing to maintain retention review period at six year or six year after the month review for channel case in addition to the publication of the prevent learning review we recognise the significant concern that remain over the way in which prevent deal with the perpetrator as well as the need to ensure that the recommendation it suggest for improve the scheme have be properly implement last week set out to the house series of new reform institute by the government to strengthen the prevent programme recognise the vital work do by officer across the country to keep people safe that include the creation of new independent prevent commissioner can today inform the house that the home secretary have ask the prevent commissioner to review the prevent programme interaction with the perpetrator in this case and ensure the implementation of all relevant recommendation we will ensure that the amess family have the support they need to engage with the prevent commissioner in this work so that they can have confidence that it will get to the truth about

discussion on this topic in recent day let add my word to those of the security minister in remember our colleague sir david amess all of those who serve with he in this house hold he in great affection and the high regard he be colleague who be love and be remember fondly across the house his particular form of charm kindness and good humour be something that everybody who ever meet david

family have suffer speak early today to sir david wife julia and pay tribute to she and her daughter for the courage and fortitude they have show over these past few year in campaign to get the answer they need also thank the former member of parliament for southend west anna firth who have be support julia and her family throughout this difficult time thank the home secretary as well for meet lady julia recently be grateful to the home secretary for take the time to do that turn to the prevent learning review which recently receive and which believe be about to be publish notice that it be redacted version would be grateful if the security minister confirm that nothing material have be redact be sure that it have not but it would help to have that clarify we hear in the security minister statement and thank he for the thoughtful and consider way in which he make it that the prevent learning review identify number of failing in the way that prevent handle the murderer of our late colleague and that there have be opportunity for further intervention while welcome the fact that the report have be publish and that the new prevent commissioner will conduct further review there be still question relate to this case and other that perhaps merit more formal inquiry to ensure that we get to the bottom of it there be other case where there be question around whether perpetrator of violence either encounter prevent and could have be well identify and interdict or encounter mental health service those that may merit further inquiry include the case of ahmed hassan where people be injure on tube train follow the detonation of device the case of usman khan on london bridge the case of khairi saadallah who murder three man in reading and the southport case that we have discuss in this house recently it strike that there be systemic issue both with the failure of prevent to identify and stop potential perpetrator and associate with that with the operation of the mental health system and whether more could be do because these be systemic issue think more formal inquiry be merit and would welcome the security minister view on that on the more systemic issue there be two thing on which would be interested to hear the security minister response mention they to he individually few day ago the first be that in the past year out of murder commit by terrorist in the united kingdom since be commit by islamist terrorist that be yet for the most recent figure available only of the prevent caseload relate to islamist extremism that strongly suggest on the face of it that prevent be under engage those with islamist ideology who go on to commit serious offence know that the shawcross review in part address that issue but it be so serious and the disparity so stark that would appreciate the security minister view on that that be topic that further inquiry might address the second area which the security minister and briefly discuss on monday evening concern the mental health bill currently make its way through the house of lords many of the case entail extremist terrorist ideology but many also touch on mental health issue and whether well treatment should be give or indeed whether people should be section and detain under the mental health act to protect the public that consideration be relevant of course to the valdo calocane case as well as to some of the other case have mention the bill as draft for reason that ministers in the department of health and social care have set out make it hard to detain people under the mental health act be concerned that that might inadvertently have adverse implication for public safety if people who should be detain under the mental health act to protect the public might now not be detain that be matter of concern know that the security minister will want to respond specifically to that issue this matter start from terrible tragedy sir david be more than just love colleague he be husband and father who lose his life in the course of do his duty as member of parliament it be testimony to he and memorial that will last forever that southend be now city but let we also learn the lesson and take the action need to ensure that this do not happen again be grateful to the shadow home secretary for the point he have raise and for how he have approach the statement he mention be pleased that he do that he have speak to lady amess this morning let take the opportunity to reiterate how courageous the home secretary and think that the amess family have be in pursue answer about sir david murder they entirely understandably want the government to publish the prevent learning review and we have do that today as reference early the home secretary have also ask the independent prevent commissioner to look carefully at the detail of this case and we will progress that at pace the home secretary as reference early have also write to essex police about this matter let also say that we continue to want to work very closely with the amess family the prime minister the home secretary and stand ready to meet they again in the near future to discuss what more we might be able to do to support they the shadow home secretary specifically ask about redaction in the prevent learning review be happy to confirm that nothing material have be redact the report be now live on and contain only minimal redaction to obscure the name of people who work with the perpetrator include teacher and police officer and personal information about the perpetrator family as well as some national security sensitivity nothing material have be redact say to the shadow home secretary that hope there be much common cause here hope he will acknowledge that there be number of reform to the prevent programme which we have recently reference include with regard to the point he rightly make about mental health provision will say bit more about that in moment let respond to the shadow home secretary particular point about the threat from islamist extremism and the referral to prevent he be right that we should never forget the horrendous death toll cause by islamist extremism over the past year it be the foremost threat that we face and we must and will address it head on last year the number of islamist referral to prevent increase by but that be from too low base work be already under way to improve ideology training and build awareness of the ideology that drive radicalisation we should be clear about the fact that the threat be evolve fast in october the director general of say that of counter terrorism work be of islamist extremism in nature and be extreme right wing and that of those be investigate by be under the age of he flag that be see dizzying range of belief and ideology the southport attack reflect how that particular threat be change come back to the shadow home secretary point about mental health as he know the government mental health legislation be currently in the other place the purpose of the mental health act be to ensure that clinician have the power to detain and treat mentally unwell people who present risk to themselves or to other the new bill will not change that it be specifically design to make it more likely that those detain will seek help complete their treatment successfully and stay in contact with authority where need reduce the risk to themselves and other nhs england have ask every mental health trust to review the finding of the care quality commission report publish in august and set out action plan for how they treat and engage with people who have serious mental illness include how they work with other agency such as the police the trust have also be instruct not to discharge people if they do not attend appointment hope that go some way to answer the shadow home secretary question but be happy to continue the conversation with he thank my hon friend the minister and of course the home secretary for come to this place for this statement none of we in the house can imagine the pain the suffering and the anger that the amess family be go through after lose their

we can help they to move forward very grateful to my hon friend not least because this be an issue of the most profound importance to his constituent he be completely right that we must hold sir david

where remember sir david use to stand sir david be among many other thing complete master of the pre recess adjournment debate can see he now stand there confidently expertly and authoritatively reel

the assurance he seek that we will continue to work closely with the family and with all hon member to ensure that through the work of the independent prevent commissioner and the work reference early with regard to the home secretary write to essex police the family get the answer that they rightly deserve call the liberal democrat spokesperson be grateful as always to the minister for advance sight of his statement what happen to sir david amess be terrible tragedy though be new to this house have hear many story of his kindness and his compassion and know that he be sorely miss across these benches we owe it to sir david grieve family and to the people of southend to ensure that tragedy like that can never happen again that mean ensure that our counter terrorism strategy be fit for purpose and able to work with community to tackle the modern challenge that our world be face the liberal democrats have long raise question about whether prevent be well place to deliver that as we have learn over recent week these failure be not happen in isolation so it be right that the government have ask the prevent commissioner to look at this case would welcome further assurance that the commissioner will have wide range remit to take comprehensive look at prevent urge the minister again to put the role on statutory footing the remit must include look at how prevent communicate with other agency such as local authority and different police force local community need to be at the centre of our counter terrorism strategy whether that mean keep they safe or ensure they be effectively engage will the minister outline how community will be consult on any upcoming counter extremism strategy as the minister mention this tragic case have also bring to light question about mps safety will he please provide some more detail on how the defend democracy taskforce be progress with its work particularly on help to keep member and their family safe it be my hope that we can continue to work across the house to deliver the effective counter terrorism strategy that our country deserve we owe it to the amess family to make that reality be grateful to the hon lady for the way in which she have approach the statement and for the sensible and reasonable point she make as she always do she make an important point about the role and remit of the independent commissioner hope that she like all hon member would acknowledge that lord anderson be superbly qualified to fulfil the role he be an expert in this area of public policy and he bring authority credibility and integrity to the role the home secretary and look forward to work closely with he but of course reiterate the point about his independence the hon lady rightly raise the importance of the work that be take place across government on counter extremism that work be be progress very closely with other departments specifically the ministry of housing communities and local government it be priority for this government and we will endeavour to update the house in the relatively near future about its progress finally be grateful to the hon lady for reference the work of the defend democracy taskforce this initiative be set up by the previous government but we think it be fundamental to ensure that those people who step forward to serve as elect representative whether in this house or in local government as police and crime commissioner or metro mayors be able to perform their duty without fear or favour the remit of the defend democracy taskforce will ensure the most effective cross government response work with operational partner and law enforcement so that those elect representative can go about their duty unencumbered by the completely unacceptable harassment and intimidation that we continue to see sir david amess be hugely respected parliamentarian of massive popularity across all party and in his wide community he work every day with true compassion to improve the life of resident in southend west and leigh southend east and rochford and more widely my constituency neighbour my hon friend the member for southend west and leigh david burton sampson and bring that legacy with we as we continue the hard work of represent our community be pleased that the prevent learning review publish today have look into the attack on sir david amess commend the hard work of his family my hon friend the member for southend west and leigh the former mp for southend west and the home office who be commit to prevent such horrific attack in future we must do everything in our power to prevent anything so tragic from ever happen again my thought and prayer will always be with his friend and family be grateful to my hon friend for his word let reiterate what he and the shadow home secretary say about anna firth we be grateful for her support and the contribution that she continue to make with your indulgence madam deputy speaker my hon friend have just provide with an opportunity to offer one furth personal recollection of sir david he respond to my maiden speech in which make from the opposition benches it be by any metric pretty average maiden speech but the warmth of his response have stay with forever from that point every time we see each other we would reminisce about how overly generous he have be about it for that and for many other reason will always be incredibly grateful to david amess thank the minister for his generous tribute to sir david southend be now city so we comfort ourselves that on that at least he win in the end we all miss he not least myself welcome what the minister say about an inquiry into whether essex police could have do more to protect he welcome the speaker conference on mps security the minister know that have great regard for he but regret to hear that prevent may have act sub optimally that be an appalling whitehall euphemism for error that may have contribute to the death of an mp in the line of duty in addition to those possible failure the murderer in southport have multiple interaction with prevent yet still those three innocent child be tragically murder we have spend fortune on prevent but it seem that ultimately it do not do what it say on the tin understand that the amess family rightfully seek answer have ask if the error that may have occur in sir david case and that almost certainly occur in southport could be look into in more detail under the auspex of the southport inquiry that seem reasonable request give the exceptional circumstance will the minister and the home secretary who rightly be in her place beside he consider that request very seriously and hopefully grant it it may be hard for new member to understand how difficult this be for more experienced member such as the right hon gentleman who spend so many year on these green benches work so closely with much beloved colleague see that the right hon gentleman be sit below another shield member across the house understand the pain experience with the loss of our colleague and our share determination to work together and with other to do everything we can to ensure that those who serve in this house have the support and the protection that they need and deserve the right hon gentleman rightly take the opportunity to reference one of sir david many achievement the city status of southend that certainly would not have happen without sir david campaign over many year be grateful to the right hon gentleman for acknowledge the work that will take place with essex police understand the important concern that he have raise about prevent the term of reference of the southport inquiry rightly be still matter of discussion between the home secretary the home office and the family in that particular case so be unable to make judgment about that at this point what can do be not only reiterate the point that have already make but offer further commitment from the home secretary and to look very carefully at this to continue the conversation with the late sir david family and other member and to work out the good mechanism to provide they and all member of this house with the answer that they both want and deserve the murder of sir david amess cut to the very heart of democracy clearly he be the very good of british the minister talk about parliamentary security in his consider statement have speak to many colleague across the house who have say that they feel that abuse and harassment be peak and many feel unsafe of course it be unwise to go into detail of specific measure but be the minister confident that these measure will make we feel safe in this house as always be grateful to my hon friend for his thoughtful contribution good of british be precisely the right phraseology to apply to sir david my hon friend ask an important question about how we defend our democracy he ask about my confidence in the work that we be do to ensure that member of this house and elect representative elsewhere can perform their duty with the confidence that they be safe must be honest with he and say that that be an ongoing process all of we in this place will have experience threat harassment and intimidation that be bad particularly for woman member it be stain on our society that there be those out there who feel that they can abuse female elect representative what can give my hon friend be an absolute assurance that we be organise and marshal the resource that we have across government work with law enforcement and operational partner and co operate very closely with you mr speaker and the house authority to ensure that those who step forward to serve can do so with the security and comfort of know they be properly protect will leave no stone unturned in my work with colleague across government to ensure that be the case where individual have concern wherever they may be will always make myself available to discuss those concern with they echo the minister praise for sir david who be loved friend to so many include many member in this house welcome today statement which be sobering reminder of the importance of get the prevent programme right the seriousness of the statement contrast sharply with the immediate reaction and debate that follow sir david murder when there be to be frank bizarre and misplace rush to talk about issue such as online civility rather than the clear threat that be behind the murder will the minister join in say it be time for an end to the denialism we often see around the threat from islamism and recognise what he say about the change nature of the threat do he agree that as the major terror threat that we face islamist extremism should always be prevent top priority the hon gentleman speak with long experience from work both at the heart of government and in the home office he make some important point and assure he that will give they further consideration he be also right though to reference the change nature of the threat of course islamist extremism present the single big challenge that we face as country as the director general of make clear in his annual threat lecture back in october the hon gentleman will have hear my early response to the shadow home secretary on the number of referral we be look very closely at that be grateful to he for his contribution which will reflect on far be always happy to discuss this issue with he sadly never get to meet sir david but as we have hear from member across the house today his reputation go before he he be loved and value colleague respect across the whole house and across all benches do the minister agree that sir david exemplify the good tradition of this place work hard and work together to make real change can we also take moment to express our respect for the officer who turn up at these scene as former police officer have attend many such scene and know it be something we both never want to do and hope never to do again completely agree with my hon friend characterisation of sir david and his work ethic also take this opportunity to join he in pay tribute to those brave police officer who step forward under the most exceptionally difficult circumstance for the service they perform thank my hon friend for his service too remember the day sir david amess be tragically murder very well be serve as lancashire police and crime commissioner at the time and remember have initial conversation with serve member of this house include the former member for hyndburn sara britcliffe who along with her dad have be lifelong friend of sir david learn an awful lot about the sort of man he be and how much he mean to people in parliament from the reaction of the members speak to that day will turn to the minister statement the reviewer identify six issue will not read they all out in full obviously but they include not tackle all the vulnerability identify problematic record keeping the rationale for certain decision not be explicit responsibility between police and local authority be blur the tool use for identify the individual vulnerability to radicalisation be outdate and so on these word and phrase could have be take from the statement about the tragic incident in southport something else that be incredibly important to we as fellow north west mp but they could also have be take from many inquiry review and statement over many year on similar case the shadow home secretary point about the differential between the number of murder that have islamist terrorism at their heart be over while only of the casework be link to islamist ideology be also quite stark for the issue here be around process the quality of follow process and quality of work and the interlinking between different public service but also around culture and how our public service in different way have dance around the issue of islamist extremism and whether prevent have deliver in identify the threat and effectively deal with it echo the suggestion that it be time to take step back from all the individual review inquiry and statement and take look at the big picture be not go to press the minister for specific answer right now in line with the tone all member have take this afternoon do not think this be the time for point scoring or try to secure individual commitment at the dispatch box would just like to ask the minister as he go forward look at this issue southport and other to step back and ask whether prevent be serve its intend purpose and offer value for money whether it be keep the public safe from terrorism and whether it be time to take broad more strategic look rather than case by case look as former police and crime commissioner the hon gentleman bring weight of experience to the house that we appreciate hugely he be right that the learn review identify number of point that can not just sit on shelf they have to be action we have to ensure that the process that be in place be as effective as they possibly can be agree with he on the disparity between the number of islamist attack and the number of prevent referral will repeat my early point that there be increase in those specific referral in the year end march but agree with his analysis he make some important point what can say to he be that there be number of measure include measure have reference today as well as other in my southport statement last week that think will go significant way towards address the concern that the hon gentleman have rightly raise will have to ensure that the house have confidence on that he make particularly interesting point at the conclusion of his remark about step back and take strategic look at whether the process and resource that be in place be appropriate will do that will also work very closely with lord anderson who will bring huge amount of analysis and value in this area very much welcome the opportunity to work with he and with all member include the hon gentleman as we accept this as share endeavour to ensure that these attack never happen again first want to put on the record my sympathy for sir david family and friend as new mp do not have the privilege of know he but vividly remember the day he be murder from the warm word speak across the house he be clearly highly regarded and be sorely miss thank the security minister for his detailed statement can he assure that the lesson from these prevent learning review be learn that all recommendation be implement and that there be appropriate tie in not just between local authority police national security and national crime agency but with the defend democracy taskforce so that we can work collectively to ensure that tragedy such as this can never happen again be very grateful to my hon friend for his remark he make an important observation about the importance of co ordination and of ensure that locally regionally and nationally all the relevant agency and service be in place and be talk and communicate with each other in the most effective way he be right to refer to the defend democracy taskforce mechanism that chair which bring together whole of government response and ultimately provide the fulcrum point for discuss and act on these matter in government it be our specific responsibility to ensure that the service he refer to be properly resource and co ordinating properly with each other be grateful for the point he have make agree with colleague that sir david amess kindness know no party boundary in particular reflect that he find himself in place of unexpected and certainly unsought popularity in the snp group in when as group of new mps it turn out that barely any of we have not receive kind word little bit of advice or certainly some direction from sir david in those opening week he be remember kindly by everybody in our group give that it be group of newbie at the time so want to put that on the record and send my thought to his family thank the security minister for the statement will he set out how an ongoing assessment of the efficiency of prevent and channel will be undertake go forward do he feel that he have the full co operation of social medium company in particular in take forward his work be grateful to the hon member for his point and for his reflection on sir david he make an important point about the mechanism the government will use move forward clearly the public inquiry will provide very important forum to ensure that the lesson that have be identify and further lesson that will no doubt be identify be properly action and implement in advance of that as think he will be aware we have commission lord anderson to look at these matter think he will acknowledge as other member will that lord anderson be precisely the right person independent of government with previous experience as an independent reviewer of terrorism legislation recognise legal mind with credibility and authority in this field and member of the other place we want to work collaboratively with he to ensure that we satisfy ourselves and therefore member across the house and people right around the country that the mechanism in place be fit for purpose that be significant priority for the government and can give the hon member an assurance that we will not rest until the process in place be fit for purpose associate myself with the comment from both side of the house about sir david amess one challenge in address islamist extremism be the proliferation of hate preacher around the world both online and in person be very concerned about the prospect of the preacher mohamed hoblos visit middlesbrough later this month will the minister set out the step he will be take with regard to that specific case and the broad action he will take to address hate preacher around the world be grateful to my hon friend for raise that issue he will understand that be somewhat limited in what can say but can tell he that the united kingdom have range of disruptive immigration measure at our disposal to refuse entry and cancel permission if it be assess that foreign national presence in the uk be not conducive to the public good can give he an assurance today that we will look carefully at the circumstance that he have helpfully raise thank the minister very much for his word none of we who be privileged to know sir david amess be not mindful of both his goodness and his faith he and share the same faith as nation blight by terrorism and action by evil people who believe that they have the right to take life it be clear that the power to address those people must be accessible by intelligence service and that fund to suit must follow appropriately the action that result in the death of sir david and those three precious little girl be shocking it be clear that there be not enough support for the prevent programme indeed it fail and we all acknowledge that we do not say that in an objectionable way but in way that be factual and evidential and it be point that we want to make hope that thing will change think that be what we be all look for so that uk citizen be safe from known suspect how can the government ensure that public official and mps staff who we have responsibility to look after be safe in our place of business while always remember that we must be and will be accessible to our constituent who elect we to this place be very grateful to the hon gentleman as always be both he and sir david be and be true champion of this place know that the house be grateful to he for the important and constructive contribution he always make his interest in and experience of terrorism be well known and long standing he make very important point about accessibility all of we as constituency mps rightly want to get out and meet our constituent and make sure that they feel as if we be accessible to they there be on occasion balance to be strike to ensure we be able to perform our function and duty at local level without fear or favour while at the same time ensure that activity that take place locally and nationally be as safe and secure as possible give he an absolute assurance that these be matter to which we attach the most profound importance we be work very closely with mr speaker on the work he be do on the speaker conference can give the hon gentleman an assurance about the priority we attach to that important work as new member sadly never know sir david amess but from what people have say about his dedication to his constituent and his good humour across the house he be model for all new member to follow at the home affairs committee last week we hear from the permanent secretary about how prevent be change and how the terror threat be change as we can see from the learn review there be clearly gap and there be lesson that still need to be learn that require independent scrutiny and independent oversight will the minister tell we how the new prevent commissioner will be able to provide the scrutiny we need be very grateful to my hon friend and completely agree with his characterisation of sir david as model for all member he be absolutely right about that he raise very important point and completely agree with his assessment of the learn review it do identify number of gap and those be gap that will have to be close he will understand what mean by this but need to be careful not to seek to provide too much direction and guidance to the independent prevent commissioner not least because know lord anderson do not think he would take too kindly to it what be completely confident in be that lord anderson have all the requisite skill experience and credibility to provide that function he be an outstanding appointment the home secretary and look forward to work very closely with he far to the work he will be seek to do can give my hon friend and the house an assurance that we will leave no stone unturned in do what need to be do to ensure that prevent be fit for purpose and provide the confidence that people rightly want as we have hear today and previously in this place from so many hon member on both side of the house sir david be loved and value colleague and not just an mp but man with family and friend sadly do not have the privilege of work with he in this place we know that sir david killer exit the prevent scheme many year before the attack take place future action be tragically too late for sir david and his family but what step will be take to ensure that all relevant agency along the line do not just learn from but act on the lesson from the killer ability to evade detection in the period lead up to his attack completely agree with the point that my hon friend make she be right to highlight the difference between learn lesson and implement and act upon they can give she an assurance that through the process announce previously and today we have the mechanism to do that that say we will continue to have conversation with the amess family and other to look at area where we might want to do more want to have those conversation soon rather than later my final word be sure on behalf of the whole house be to reiterate collective tribute to sir david amess he be an outstanding parliamentarian he be greatly miss and we will never forget he point of order on point of order madam deputy speaker hansard will confirm that during question to the secretary of state for science innovation and technology early today the secretary of state who be in his place say that no conservative ministers have meet astrazeneca representative follow the announcement of million investment to expand its merseyside vaccine facility the secretary of state be wrong publicly available transparency datum from the treasury and the secretary of state own department confirm that meeting do take place between astrazeneca and my right hon friend the member for godalming and ash jeremy

opportunity to apologise and correct the record for the house thank the hon gentleman for his point of order and for give notice of it trust that he notify the secretary of state of his intention to raise it should the secretary of state feel that the record need to be correct there be process whereby he may do so but the hon gentleman have put his point on the record far to that point of order

apologise to he for say what say early official report february vol should also correct the thrust of my argument this morning which be that there be insouciance during the period between the march

that will take big money out of british politic protect our democracy from foreign interference and restore public trust in our electoral system for too long our politic have be expose it be far too easy for those who do not have the national interest of our country at heart or who have make their wealth through illicit mean to funnel money into british politic the bill be simple in its aim to ensure that it be the people of this country not the deep pocket of foreign billionaire oligarchs or corporate interest who decide our country future in election and referendum trust in our political system be falter many people look at our politic and see system rig in favour of the rich and powerful recent poll by yougov find that more than two third of the british public support limit on political donation not for profit organisation such as unlock democracy spotlight on corruption and fair vote say that that we should take swift action to tighten electoral finance legislation or else risk democratic backsliding the message be clear people want change we want big money kick out of politic under our current system however there be no limit to what single individual or business can

be the past donation to the conservative party from individual with link to the russian government this be not just about fairness it be about national security britain have long pride itself on be beacon of democracy but we must not be complacent our political financial regulation have glare loophole that be open for exploitation by foreign money funnel through uk register company opaque financial network and questionable donor malign actor who do not share our value of tolerance liberty and the rule of law should not have unrestricted access to our democracy we know that hostile state seek to undermine our democracy all the time we have see it in cyber attack and disinformation campaign yet our political finance law remain riddled with loophole that allow foreign and dark money to shape british politic the bill seek to close those gap ensure that our election and referendum belong to the voter and not to foreign interest this bill seek to deliver two fair necessary and overdue change first it will introduce fair cap on political donation as determine by review and secondly it will close british politic to the influence of foreign money by prevent foreign donor from fund our politic these be essential measure that must be bring into effect we must protect our election from manipulation and ensure that there be further transparency in political funding in do so we will help to restore faith in our democracy and introduce vital safeguard for our political institution there be already consensus in the house that foreign donation have no place in british politic but that gap in the law allow this to happen we must act now to close the legal loophole that allow these donation to flow unchecked we in the house have responsibility to uphold the integrity of our democracy and it be our duty to drive the change that our country need britain have always be nation that stand for fairness democracy and integrity it be time for we to take firm stand against undue influence in our politic and ensure that our democracy serve the people the bill be not radical it be reasonable necessary and long overdue it will ensure that political influence be not buy but earn through genuine public support introduce cap on political donation be not about limit participation it be about make sure that every vote every voice and every citizen matter equally in our political system let we give control of british politic back to our constituent not to unaccountable tech billionaire or those who seek to buy influence let we renew our commitment to an open and fair democracy one that belong to the people of this country now and for generation to come question put and agree to order that manuela perteghella dr roz savage ellie chowns liz jarvis sorcha eastwood james maccleary claire young mr alistair carmichael wera hobhouse sarah olney and martin wrigley present the bill manuela perteghella accordingly present the bill bill read the first time to be read second time on friday may and to be print bill datum use and access bill lords second reading beg to move that the bill be now read second time the government be use technology to grow the economy and create new job in order to empower citizen and deliver small smart state but none of that be possible without datum successive governments fail to set out the extraordinary opportunity that datum present our citizen have count the cost in slow growth few job and flatline productivity in community that feel less safe because police officer be spend more time fill in form and less time out on the street where we need they in hospital where patient be leave wait long for the care that they so desperately need and when people queue up to register the death of love one or struggle to rent new home without the decade old document that they need to prove their identity an outdated approach to datum be hold britain economy back this bill will take the brake off unleash new era of wealth and opportunity for all the secretary of state say that successive government fail to act but be it not the case that this bill be almost identical to the one that the last conservative government introduce which very nearly make it on to the statute book be grateful to the right hon gentleman for point that out indeed lot of this bill be base on the one that his government introduce they call general election which halt it in its track we offer to get that bill through in wash up but that be turn down by the government we be here today to discuss bill that his government could well have get through of course they have year to do so be grateful to he for point that out and for no doubt support bill for which he claim so much credit the smart datum measure in the bill could make switch energy supplier as quick and easy as switch bank account consumer will be able to compare utility price and find well deal put money in their pocket business will be force to innovate and improve their service too fast grow firm will also benefit from the digital verification service that this bill enable today people spend month wait to get paperwork sort for new job by help people to prove who they be without physical document we will cut the time it take to get on the payroll and give business the freedom to get on with growth one of the big barrier to growth be the appalling state of britain crumble infrastructure today street be be endlessly dig up and re dug up by different firm repair gas one year and water the next at the same time big infrastructure project have stall and fall silent for year by offer complete and accurate picture of the underground infrastructure the national underground asset register will strengthen britain building bureaucracy it will cut the time it take for worker on site to get the datum they need from six day to six second that mean that they will be able to get on with build the road railway and home that britain so desperately need today siloed approach to datum be slow the state down patient be put through the same test again and again and prescription error mean that they get the wrong medication this be simply unacceptable the nhs have one of the deep most diverse dataset in the world but the people who need that datum can not access it by introduce mandatory information standard for all information technology supplier this bill will ensure that information can flow safely securely and seamlessly through the healthcare system can the secretary of state outline the benefit that this bill will have for my constituent in harlow be think in particular of resident with multiple prescription who struggle to quickly have the datum at their fingertip my hon friend be champion his constituent and be pleased to inform he that the bill will deliver much more streamlined access to the healthcare system from primary care right the way through to hospital where information should flow freely not just because of the incentive be put in place but the actual requirement of course when patient travel to their gp or to hospital they will be able to count on far less disruption on the pavement and in the street simply because of the underground asset register those be just two example of how this bill will benefit his constituent the bill will make it easy to introduce transformative new technology such as artificial intelligence it will reduce duplication and error and save our doctor and nurse time so that they can focus on the patient who need they the most the same go for the police officer keep our country safe the measure propose in this bill will save they million hour every single year engage with the state today take time and effort but see no reason why it should create the new government digital service to deliver efficient convenient digital public service that be shape around citizen life this bill will bolster those effort open banking benefit million customer every year by allow they access to their datum it have be great success do the secretary of state see that as model for how citizen can access their datum hold by the state smart datum underpin the service that the hon gentleman refer to we see boundless opportunity for smart datum to be apply in new way and the bill before we will unlock some of those opportunity be grateful to he for get that on the record an electronic register of birth and death will make life that little bit easy for new parent or those who have lose love one however some of my constituent have raise concern about how their information will be keep safely in the online register of birth and death how will the secretary of state ensure that the government keep such information safely it be imperative that we reassure people up and down the country that their datum will be use safely and wisely and that they will always remain in control of how their datum be use can give my hon friend those reassurance the house will notice that this government have act with transparency when it come to inform the public how datum and the algorithm that process that datum be be use just last week release more algorithm for public scrutiny so that they can be put into the algorithm playbook that we have release from department to department more of those algorithm will be make available as our resource allow that be just one example of how we be use transparency to earn the public trust in the year before the general election just one department release an algorithm for public scrutiny there be great deal in this bill that we can all support but some difficult concept lurk within it as know the secretary of state will recognise he be talk about datum transparency one of the issue of concern be about precisely what we mean by the scientific research on which datum may be employ and precisely what we mean by the public interest that must be serve by that scientific research we will not examine this issue on second reading but may ask he to commit to proper examination of those concept as the bill move forward so that we can all understand what we mean and the public can get the reassurance that he describe be grateful to the right hon gentleman for his inform intervention can assure he that we take this issue very seriously can also assure he that this be one of the issue on which we will go into considerable depth in committee and be sure that his whip be hear of his interest in get on to that committee he be clearly volunteer to put in the hard yard to make sure that we get the bill right none of the thing that have outline will succeed without trust people will not use technology unless they be confident that it be be use safely but we often lack the rigorous evidence that we need to take decision about the safety of our rapidly change online world the provision in this bill will allow researcher to access datum hold by platform enable they to conduct robust independent research into online safety be grateful to peer for their dedication in rigorously scrutinise these measure we have listen closely and in response we have make some important change to the bill first we have bring forward measure to strengthen data protection for child information society service provider likely to be access by child will now have clear legal duty to consider how good to protect and support child when design their data process activity secondly we have add provision to help charity use email to engage with people who have previously support their charitable purpose thirdly we have commit to make it easy for people to navigate datum protection measure in world transform by technology in two rapidly grow sector automate decision making and edtech we will ask the information commissioner office to publish code of practice to give people the knowledge and confidence they need to use personal datum legally the secretary of state will be aware that clause remove the exist right of individual not to be subject to solely automate decision make process unless it involve category of special datum in practice this might mean that journalist could have their datum process through adm which could pose significant risk to their source what reassurance can he give that these concern will be explore and assess as the bill pass through the house the bill improve the automate decision make process but individual attribute and sector will be impact and we will of course take that into consideration in committee where be sure that issue will be raise be grateful to my hon friend for put it on record on second reading peer also add several measure during the bill report stage first baroness owen run an admirable campaign to outlaw the creation of intimate image and deepfake this horrific form of online abuse have devastating impact on its victim the government will work with baroness owen to ensure that the drafting of intimate image abuse measure in committee keep woman and girl safe secondly my ministers will work with opposition members to explore the possibility of new security guidance for user of the national underground asset register as propose by viscount camrose be confident that we will find solution that be satisfactory to all thirdly viscount colville add public interest test for scientific researcher seek to use clause to process personal datum however expect scientist to define the outcome of their work in advance go against the unpredictable nature of research many groundbreake discovery come from research with no clear public benefit at the start the mrna base vaccine that save million of life during the pandemic draw on curiosity drive research that for year have have no practical application today ai revolution draw on decade old neural network research that be long think unimportant as the royal society have say this additional public interest requirement would be an undue bureaucratic burden on researcher for these reason we will seek to overturn the measure fourthly many member will have observe baroness kidron campaign on ai and copyright with keen interest one of the extraordinary thing about britain be our ability to support cutting edge ai sector and world lead creative industry at the same time both be fundamental to our future prosperity and standing in the world and refuse to choose between they rise rise will finish this section of my speech and then give way to those member who have considerable interest in this area let say what have to say and then will hear what hon member would like to contribute and engage as fully as can the final framework must reward human creativity incentivise innovation and provide the certainty require for long term growth in both sector but the importance and complexity of this issue mean that it should be consider through the live consultation as say in that consultation legislation be ultimately likely to be need of course the creative industry be excited about the inclusion of clause to which they see as their guarantee and protection against the ravage of generative artificial intelligence those clause be in the bill to protect our creative industry will the secretary of state assure the house today that he will respect they and keep they in the bill with no attempt to water they down pay tribute to those in the creative art sector who be in the house today know that for people who engage in that kind of activity it be not just job it be passion that come straight from the heart they be emotionally connect in profound way to the work that they create which be credit not just to they as individual but to our entire country can assure they that have no intention at all of stand in the way of respect for their work as we go through this process it will be essential that we listen to the voice from both side the consultation that be currently live be meaningful one and assure the house that be engage with it look forward to hear all the voice in the consultation and as have say it be likely that legislation on this specific issue will come out of it that would give the house an opportunity to go through this issue in enormous detail at the appropriate time be listen carefully and want to engage with all the voice throughout the committee stage and ensure that the debate continue some creative be argue that the current consultation could be undermine because it already promote preferred option which be the handing over of creative intellectual property to the ai sector that would include creative such as composer lyricist and writer one of whom the secretary of state be sit next to some of they be struggle to earn fair living although perhaps not our hon friend the minister ai model be be train on those creative work without their knowledge or consent without adequate protection for those creative and without great transparency over when their intellectual property be be scrap the creative industry as we know they will cease to exist will the secretary of state commit to ensure that those creative voice of whom there be million in britain be hear throughout the committee stage be grateful to the hon lady for her offer of advocacy for the minister for creative industries arts and tourism my hon friend the member for rhondda and ogmore chris bryant have never know he to lack voice for self advocacy however should the time arise know that she will be on his speed dial the issue that she have raise be of profound importance as have say recognise not just the economic issue but the personal connection that creative have with the art and work that they create have absolutely no intention of disempowere they in that relationship and certainly have no intention whatsoever of take away any right from those individual without any consultation we recognise that people in the creative art sector be make representation as they absolutely should be and listen carefully to they but this country have the third large ai market in the world there be young people currently study in school college and university around the country who aspire to work in the technology sector and they should not have to leave the country and work abroad in order to fulfil their potential of the people who have contribute so much to our economy of course those in the creative art be absolutely front and centre alongside they be the technology sector which be provide enormous opportunity in job creation wealth creation and innovation right across the country part of this country be become magnet for talent not only from this country but from around the world and do not want anybody to feel that they have to leave the country to seek opportunity to exploit their talent and potential as individual believe there be way forward and assure the hon member for chichester jess brown fuller that whatever people think of the consultation be listen very closely the minister for data protection and telecoms have be engage fully and we take these issue incredibly seriously we will continue to do so in committee and beyond be great admirer of the secretary of state and admire his belief in his cause today the creative sector will have hear his commitment to listen and thank he for ensure the openness and engagement of his ministers on this issue in the spirit of listening will he agree from the dispatch box today to meet those creative who be keen to have an audience with he on this significant issue be grateful for my hon friend work on the culture media and sport committee in scrutinise these area and for be voice for the sector it go without say that would be delighted to meet the people he reference and the same go for member on both side of the house whether can fit every one of the million people who work in the sector into my office do not know it be big office than have seven month ago but be not sure can fit everyone in however will do my absolute well be here to listen and learn as have be from the outset and be here to find way through it be time to reconcile these issue and to give certainty to people in both the creative art sector and the technology sector believe the bill be the moment for this house to provide the certainty that both side need as we move forward fifthly and finally let say word on lord lucas amendment people will use digital identity to buy house to rent car and to get job the intention of clause be to force public authority to share whether someone information such as their sex have change when disclose information under clause as part of digital verification check that would mean pass on an excessive amount of personal datum share such change by default would be an unjustifiable invasion of people privacy and be unable to say that clause be compatible with human right law which be why we will seek to overturn the amendment the secretary of state be very generous in give way before he finish may ask he about the situation we be create with this bill and the online safety act of set framework within which regulator need to operate and cover good deal of ground do he think the advent of these piece of legislation make strong case for new committee of this house and perhaps joint committee to maintain scrutiny of ongoing digital regulation if so will he be prepared to advance that case that be the right hon and learn gentleman second audition of the day be open minded on these issue and take leadership from the leader of the house on committee matter congratulate the secretary of state on this bill and on set out the importance and ubiquity of datum the current confusion on datum sharing data format datum processing and data usage and the lack of action by the previous government to address some of these issue give the evolution of ai technology its simply be method of process datum and its grow importance and application can this bill possibly address all future issue be this bill the government last word on datum or be it their first word of course we should have have this bill two year ago we have see enormous progress on ai technology since then have be at the paris summit for the past few day and see where this technology be head huge advance in the power of ai and the move towards artificial general intelligence be happen fast than anybody imagine can not guarantee that this bill will be sound for time immemorial but can say that it be fit for the moment in which we be live reassure my hon friend that all our regulator have be task with assess how non frontier ai as apply throughout the economy and society will impact the sector they regulate the department for science innovation and technology be offer assistance where need as we assess the impact across our society my hon friend refer to general purpose technology and it will therefore be apply and deploy in different part of the economy and society in very different way we must make sure that as society we deploy it safely once we ensure that the technology be safe we can embrace it and explore all the opportunity that it offer it be hard to imagine dataset in which it be more important to maintain confidentiality than patient datum this bill make change to the health and social care act can the secretary of state guarantee that there be no change to patient confidentiality be pleased to give the hon member that assurance datum reform could not be more urgent or more necessary government have spend year wax lyrical about the immense promise of technology will the secretary of state give way will carry on be afraid the failure of previous government to deliver datum reform have undermine that promise stall economic growth and leave our public service wrap up in red tape and our citizen have pay the price this bill will smash the silos stand in the way of reform and remove the brake that be hold britain back call the shadow secretary of state the conservatives want britain to be science and technology superpower and that mean fully unlock all the benefit of datum as country we must make the appropriate use of datum more widespread that would cut red tape make research easy create new job deliver economic growth and enable people to access public service more efficiently data enable economy and society be good for everyone which be why we introduce the groundbreaking data protection and digital information bill before the last election and progress it through all commons stage as my right hon friend the member for maldon sir john whittingdale rightly say we still believe in those reform and call on the government to build on they but we also recognise the concern around individual right privacy ai and copyright that have be raise in relation to labour bill when the previous government leave office last july we have turn britain into one of the world lead tech economy we be home to more tech unicorn than any other european country and more than france and germany combine britain have become the world third large ai ecosystem with pioneer start up create new job and innovative product we lead the way on develop safe ai through the world first ai safety summit and ai safety institute our original bill complement those achievement and would have accelerate britain progress towards become highly datum enable economy and society in particular our proposal for digital verification service framework be replicate in this bill it be also clear that this bill have be inform by consultation carry out under the last conservative government on the governance of digital identity similarly put the national underground asset register on statutory footing be conservative idea and we welcome its inclusion in this bill more than different organisation dig hole to install and maintain underground asset every year expand and standardise the digital map of pipe and cable will help local council utility provider and other to well co ordinate their activity hopefully reduce the accidental damage incident that occur every year however the security of the register must be of the high possible standard give that the information be highly sensitive the amendment table on register security by viscount camrose and lord markham in the other place should be take seriously by the government while the asset register provision will turn our aim of join up thinking into reality this labour government approach to ai and copyright be total failure and no join up thinking have happen at all last december the government finally launch their consultation just as the christmas break start why do labour wait six month when this area of policy move so quickly with ai firm the creative industry and the public need legal certainty and firm answer when the consultation finally arrive the creative industry sector be unanimous in describe labour proposal as completely unfit for purpose for the sector labour idea of impose requirement on creative such as journalist songwriter and film maker to proactively opt out of datum mining be not the solution labour proposal could align the uk approach closely with the eu regime under the digital single market copyright directive which have produce widespread uncertainty about what constitute valid reservation of right labour approach to copyright and ai be the ultimate test of its credibility on tech and creative industry issue and it have fail the entire sector know it rather than solve problem labour be the problem know the hon member fancy himself as bit of tech bro but he should recognise that much of the anxiety in the creative industry sector be cause by the dither and delay of the conservatives time in government and their failure to grasp the issue as ever we on the government benches be do the hard work the last conservative government leave britain with world class creative industry sector it be labour dither and delay that be cause huge anxiety as will go on to say rather than solve problem labour be the problem one way to resolve that be to accept the conservative proposal table in the other place to develop international technical standard for watermark which the secretary of state refer to we welcome the agreement by the minister in the other place to take that work forward and both houses look forward to the outcome with great interest as have say the creative industry sector be valuable it be worth billion to the uk economy and employ over million people they will all be damage by labour approach and they all deserve well so why have an impact assessment not be publish at the same time as the consultation what have labour get to hide have listen very carefully to the hon gentleman as do during the debate on the creative industry few week ago during that debate member on the conservative benches give the impression that they be for the opt out solution that the labour party be put forward be he now tell we that he be against that and that he will support the creative industry in see off the challenge from generative ai the creative industry sector be tell we that that solution be not fit for purpose we will hold the labour government to account because the creative industry be extremely important under the conservatives we become the second large exporter of television programming and the fourth large exporter of film while also be home to world class theatre music broadcasting and journalism on that point will the hon gentleman give way make progress but will give way shortly on the conservative benches we have many well respect champion of the creative industry sector be especially look forward to the contribution of my right hon friend the member for maldon who bring his insight as former secretary of state for culture media and sport creative industry minister and chair of the culture media and sport committee be also grateful to my hon friend the member for gosport dame caroline dinenage the current chair of the culture media and sport committee for her work and leadership on the issue my right hon friend the member for daventry stuart andrew the shadow secretary of state for culture media and sport and my hon friend the member for meriden and solihull east saqib bhatti the shadow dcms minister be both long stand advocate for the creative industry they have both engage extensively with the creative industry on ai and copyright issue and together we will continue to champion those industry in this house and beyond the hon gentleman do not answer the question ask by the hon member for perth and kinross shire pete wishart do the hon gentleman agree with the opt out or not he seem to disagree with it but then he describe exactly the same process as we have in the consultation the secretary of state need to listen to the creative industry sector so far he have ignore that sector issue consultation late and give it no faith whatsoever the timing of the consultation and the bill be fully faulty reflect labour entirely incoherent the government consultation on ai and copyright be open for another two week and it will take they many month to respond to the view express on top of that more time will be need for the government to come to any sort of conclusion and that be before the chancellor and no panic take control of the policy edge out the secretary of state and cause even more delay on that point will the hon gentleman give way be not in government so will not give way until later although if the secretary of state want to come to the dispatch box to explain why his consultation and review be late and why he have not give any certainty to the sector be happy to give way but do not think he want to do that let we go back to the okay be happy to give way well we certainly do not take year to do that but will the hon gentleman answer this do he agree with the opt out system yes or no the secretary of state keep ask question but be not in government it be for he to answer it be for he to bring forward consultation and legislation and to give certainty to the creative sector there be no point ask question be not in government what can tell the secretary of state be that it be extremely unfortunate that this legislation be pass through parliament now while the consultation be still ongoing amendment be be table by member from all part of both houses lead to legislative position be crystalise even though the consultation have not yet close if the government really take seriously the view of the public the tech sector the creative industry and other stakeholder they would not be follow this approach or timetable therefore we will table amendment call on the government to respond to their own consultation more quickly labour consultation provide the bad of all world it do not provide any legal certainty or allow the view of those who have respond to be take seriously however labour should take the view of parliamentarian seriously include those of its own back bench mps who have voice concern at the government approach in this very house labour should also take seriously the view of those in the other place the secretary of state acknowledge that the government have already be heavily defeat on several amendment include the conservative amendment table by baroness owen of alderley edge on sexually explicit deepfake image which secure wide range support the government be also defeat on conservative amendment table by lord lucas and lord arbuthnot that recognise the importance of accurate datum particularly when it come to gender and sex confuse biological sex and elective gender put patient safety at risk the bill be lengthy and we will continue to properly scrutinise it as it progress through the house labour track record to date on science and technology issue be so bad it need all the help it can get in just eight month in office the labour government have already commit eight act of harm on science and technology issue they have impose national insurance job tax punish tech worker and business lose million investment from astrazeneca do away hundred of job launch an ai plan with no new funding or delivery plan which create two new quango and more red tape cancel the uk new exascale supercomputer hamper our scientist while our competitor race ahead skip the international ai summit of world leader start by the conservatives but ignore by this labour prime minister scrap million of funding for the ai research resource which fund computer power for ai abandon conservative plan for the national maths academy harm the next generation of datum scientist and align britain with the eu fail approach to ai and copyright labour approach be analogue government in the digital age slow uninspire and not good enough for britain labour promise so much but it have deliver only failure order can now announce the result of today defer division on the online safety act category category and category threshold conditions regulations the ayes be and the noes be so the ayes have it the division list be publish at the end of today debate thank the secretary of state for set out the reason why the bill be so important welcome the measure that will help to make people life easy and unlock the full power of datum to deliver the government mission include the important mission of grow our economy after two false start with datum bills in the previous parliament it seem that the third time be the charm that may be consequence of our particularly charming front bench as point out early but it be certainly right that we have before we data bill that address the way in which datum have increasingly become fundamental to our society and our economy it really be fantastic to see the government lead the way on action to make the most of datum potential some of business handle digitalise datum and the british datum economy represent around of gdp use those two statistic to emphasise that data be not remote and abstract it be part of our everyday life and of our business lifeblood and that be precisely why the bill promise to be so transformative want to emphasise that we be all walk datum generator we all generate datum all the time that do not mean that we have to be wear fitbit or some sort of smart device though we all have two or three generally we all generate datum when the select committee that have the good fortune to chair be look at the algorithm of social medium company as part of our inquiry into those algorithm and the southport riot it be clear that social media advertiser and other be effectively generate digital twin of we all the thing with digital twin which represent we in datum be that there be not just one and it certainly be not under our control many company and organisation and all those who wish to understand their potential customer or user have datum on we and be track datum include that which we generate therefore to have government who lead the way in ensure that that data be manage generate store and share in the interest of the general public and that it be well understand by government and the public service for which they be responsible be so important drive high productivity through the smart use of datum not only will grow the economy but as the secretary of state set out will make all our life easy in an era when we increasingly interact with public service online the measure in the bill will enable modern digital government which will save people time boost our public sector productivity which have be stubbornly low in recent year will help to deliver the efficient effective public service that our constituent expect and deserve that include free up to million police and nhs staff hour year to focus on protect we save life and provide well nhs treatment and all the other service that need to be people drive an important part of the bill be that it recognise that free up administrative effort through well join up data sharing collection storage and so on give people great opportunity to deliver service for other particularly welcome the national underground asset register before become an mp as may have mention at some point work as chartered engineer in what my constituent continue to call proper job as the head of technology for ofcom spend an amazing amount of time try to work out what bt have underground think that in part it be bt be reluctant to share their knowledge of their underground cable and system part of that be their duct and so on because of that open they up to competition eventually realise however this be some time ago so hope they will not mind say this now that they do not know what they have underground and their own system do not reflect what be under the ground or what their asset be when it come to repair fault or improve or upgrade to new network therefore not only be there the additional cost of try to find out what be there but system be design slowly or wrongly the secretary of state refer to traffic jam be cause by road be dig up in the wrong place that be fundamental example of the impact of not have simple accessible and secure datum on our asset it seem amazing that be work on the issue as regulator or year ago and that only now under this labour government be we address that essential national asset will also briefly mention advance in digital identity which will deliver tangible benefit to the public make task such as open bank account start new job or rent flat that much easy will not go into the debate on whether digital id should be mandatory but will certainly say that it should be available and accessible to everyone have constituent who be oblige to take photograph of himself with the the chronicle the local newspaper of the day in an attempt to prove to the department for work and pensions that he exist because he be disabled and could not go into the jobcentre that be the only way open to he for verification because he do not have passport or drive licence hope the measure set out in the bill will enable digital id to be accessible to those who need it the bill also promise an approach to datum that be in some quite literal way cradle to grave include for patient passport electronic registration of birth and death and critical service such as benefit and so on which have refer to it be therefore vital that the public have confidence in our country datum protection regime have long argue and it be great to hear the secretary of state say essentially the same thing that we can unlock the benefit of datum only if there be public trust often my constituent feel that advance in technology be do to they rather than with they and for their benefit critically our constituent need to feel they have agency over the way in which data impact their life rather than feel empower by digital innovation too many feel the opposite disempowere undermined dehumanise track and attack as an engineer with year experience before enter parliament find it deeply disturbing to follow the trajectory of tech from boring but incredibly useful which be how it be when start my career to exciting but exploitative which be how too many of my constituent view it now always say that come into politic for the same reason go into engineering which be to make the world work well for everyone think the bill can significantly contribute to that with its emphasis on high standard for protect personal datum include the strengthen role for the information commissioner and the new measure to protect the datum of child deliver the improvement promise by the bill must therefore go hand in hand with respect the right of citizen to control and manage their datum so important be datum that already in the first few month of its existence the science innovation and technology committee which chair have extensively discuss many of the issue be address by the bill in our session with the secretary of state we discuss the problem of legacy system and inconsistent standard for information in the nhs it be good to see that the bill look at address that the secretary of state make it clear that he understand the scale of the challenge and think he have deliver on his pledge to we to deliver bill that safeguard datum we also discuss the considerable unmet demand for digital id which the bill will meet and the need to focus on outcome with the chief scientific adviser echo in her session with we the idea that datum gathering must be proportionate seek to answer specific question and not hoover up datum willy nilly this bill be in that spirit take pragmatic approach that seek to use datum to solve problem not to needlessly extend the role of government or big tech in our life we have hear about the exciting way that datum can help solve problem right across government in the committee session yesterday the science minister lord vallance speak about the importance of datum to the health secretary ambition to move from cure to prevention in the nhs and the role that genomic and the revolution in life science could play in transform healthcare hope the minister will address in his closing comment the single data health record for the nhs it be important to have consistent safe secure and share understanding of patient treatment and ask he to address how the evolution of the role of genomic and the detailed personal datum in any genomic record will be reflect in the provision of the bill in the committee session on the budget we also discuss the data environment the infrastructure around datum and how that be critical to our future success in support private sector growth and deliver modern public service welcome that the government have make data centre part of our critical national infrastructure that recognise reality that have be there for some year now last week the committee launch our inquiry into the digital centre of change in the machinery of government that the new labour government make centre digital transformation and digital government in the department for science innovation and technology in order to enable the revolution in public service delivery that be part of the labour government ambition the effective implementation of this bill be essential to the rewiring of datum in digital government it be also critical that there be the political will to ensure that the effective sharing of datum across government serve the bill intention of support public trust consistency of standard and consistency of datum format when the minister respond to the debate will he say little more about the role of open standard and open source the secretary of state have already speak about transparency but will the minister talk about the role of open standard and open source in ensure that we have consistent framework for datum share across government look forward to engage with ministers in the department in the month ahead on the committee inquiry and on the progress of the bill which mark an important and overdue step in deliver digital government fit for the future call the liberal democrat spokesperson data be the new gold it be by use good datum and lot of the stuff heap that we will cure disease empower consumer and business find solution to societal problem and unleash economic growth behind that datum however be the life of everyday people and the decision make with that datum will impact everyday life we must ensure that datum and the value from it be use in the service of the british people that be why the liberal democrats welcome this bill effort to modernise and clarify our data law and to unleash growth and opportunity the digital landscape be evolve rapidly and it be right that we seek to keep pace the bill mark an improvement on the previous datum bill introduce under the conservative government however although this bill contain some positive step it also contain significant gap and miss opportunity we must seize this opportunity to get the legislation right and to ensure that the data landscape we put in place serve all of we across the uk maintain public trust in data safeguard be vital as the ada lovelace institute emphasise trust about datum and technology be must in order for our democratic principle to be uphold citizen must be able to trust how their data be be use that be even more important as the data drive digital interface of government increase trust be also two side of the same coin inclusion and adoption one be critical for society and the other be crucial for growth that be why in the name of constructive opposition and the interest of firm up public trust we would like to highlight concern and miss opportunity as the bill pass through the house we will be seek to interrogate and strengthen it where necessary one of our primary concern lie with the power grant to the secretary of state particularly on recognise legitimate interest and the framework for digital verification in essence the bill allow ministerial decision that bypass meaningful parliamentary scrutiny that risk situation where change to how datum be capture or share be make unilaterally without the thorough check and balance that parliament or the public expect both the delegated powers and regulatory reform committee and the constitution committee have highlight these issue the open rights group highlight concern that govern party could change the rule on election datum for example or have undue influence on the information commissioner decision make process and jeopardise impartiality although there be drive in the bill to formalise digital identity framework the liberal democrats believe it be crucial to strike the right balance we support harness digital verification to make service more efficient provide there be robust transparency and independent oversight of how personal datum be store and use we urge ministers to tighten this area with clear ethical safeguard to genuinely foster trust rather than undermine it secondly modernisation should not come at the cost of transparency several clause appear to dilute individual right to information about how their datum be collect and process notably in respect of legitimate interest and automated decision making clause for example risk seriously water down the right of datum subject and in do so seriously hamper public trust in datum processing the national data guardian and the british medical association for example be worried about the clause erode transparency in how health and social care datum be use for research if we truly wish to harness the benefit of emerge technology from ai to digital verification we must earn and maintain that trust and that depend on be open about how datum be use and by whom that bring on to the bill proposal on automate decision making they currently focus on special category datum which leave our ordinary personal datum less shielded ai and algorithmic process increasingly determine people credit insurance and even job prospect there be risk in restrict enhanced safeguard to only certain category of information without further amendment to protect individual the hon lady be absolutely right about that tendency but it do not have to be like that we can either build society that be about personal interaction and familiarity or we can allow society of the kind she describe to develop which will destroy the tapestry of those interaction that make up the wellbeing of each of we and all of we there be definitely lot of opportunity in automate decision making but the safeguard must be in place to make sure that human decision and the right to safeguard around the impact of those decision be uphold because restrict enhanced safeguard to only certain category of information without further amendment could exclude wide range of significant decision from meaningful human review and create lack of transparency again do so undermine public trust and hinder the adoption of ai and emergent technology we share the concern of organisation include justice and the open rights group that clause weaken safeguard by broaden the scope for automate decision although the clause make safeguarding requirement more explicit there be concern that it also provide the secretary of state with considerable power via secondary legislation to amend or set aside those safeguard the liberal democrats be firm in our conviction that where person be the subject of automated decision making there simply must be right to explanation right to appeal and meaningful human intervention hope the hon lady recognise that one of the change we have make to the bill be to insist on there be meaningful human involvement that be not in the previous version of the bill think that that help considerably with the issue of automate decision making thank the minister for his intervention for we it be question of make sure that any input from the secretary of state whoever that be do not undermine those safeguard interruption be sure that the current secretary of state will be around for while what do you know know nothing shall continue with data adequacy we must be mindful of our data adequacy agreement with the eu and other partner and know that the government be all too aware of that by water down protection we risk undermine our international credibility and endanger agreement that be essential for british business academic institution and cross border collaboration it be paramount that our reform do not jeopardise those vital partnership and it be vital that as we update uk datum law we protect our position as lead trust partner for international datum sharing at time when international water look increasingly choppy this be more important than ever there be real opportunity for the bill to go far and promote data trust or data community where group of individual collectively manage their datum for wide societal benefit such as medical research or tackle climate change the bill could champion that approach thereby boost public interest innovation instead it be largely silent on collective or community drive data governance and miss crucial chance to build genuine public trust in how technology can help we all by go far on data trust or data community we could far unlock economic growth as be exemplify by open banking consumer and small business can use this and small provider can grow and compete more effectively furthermore consideration over access to datum on energy consumption could help improve sustainability and drive down energy bill the bill have come to we from the other place and commend the work that have take place in the house of lords in recent week to scrutinise and improve the legislation there be several area where the change make in the other place will have the support of the liberal democrats on ai and copyright we have be very clear that the current government proposal would fail creative the conservative shadow minister be not clear on his stance on the question of opt in or opt out so the creative industry have be leave unsure of whether the conservatives will support it be happy to take an intervention from the shadow minister if he want to clarify his position say to the minister and will say it again for the hon lady it be for the government to bring forward their proposal once the consultation close we will respond that be the proper order in this house thank the hon member for his intervention as liberal democrats we have be very clear on this and we have listen to what the creative industry have say so far will the hon lady give way let finish my point and then would be very happy to give way we be against the opt out system because we want to preserve the right of copyright it be easy for those creative to opt in whereas opt out be hard especially for small business or creative in their own right be go to say to the hon lady half in jest and half in reality that the liberal democrats will say whatever they need to say in any part of the country and on any issue that be the reality like anyone in this house we can say whatever we want to say within the rule of the house of course and under the eye of madam deputy speaker we have be clear on our view and on our value we have listen to the evidence and we have say what our view be which be that we do not support the opt out our creative be one of the uk great export which be why we support they our world leader in this area should never be ask to give up their exist right we also welcome the provision of clause to protect child datum and introduce legal duty for datum privacy by design for service that be likely to be access by child across all area of technology and the online world safety by design for child be concept to which we be firmly committed and this be an important step finally we welcome the measure in clause on deepfake sexually explicit deepfake have devastate far too many life in this country and it be very welcome that the bill now contain consent base offence and that enforcement will have real tooth with the possibility of custodial sentence this be long overdue step that have to be take overall we support modernise data framework that uphold digital right while stimulate innovation we want dynamic tech economy that address real world challenge from healthcare to public service to climate resilience indeed the liberal democrat vision be of digital future that spread the benefit of technology across society while protect fundamental liberty none the less the bill need further amendment to safeguard fundamental right and embed proper scrutiny we will work with colleague across the house as well as with civil society organisation such as big brother watch liberty and the ada lovelace institute to ensure that those important protection be not overlook we welcome measure that clarify or simplify how organisation may use datum to develop new product support research or improve public service for instance the concept of datum trust and data community where individual pool datum for broad societal benefit have the potential to create public interest innovation while retain trust and control by improve oversight mechanism reinforce transparency and embrace idea such as datum trust we can create bill that truly balance public interest with economic growth we owe it to our constituent and to the future of our digital economy to deliver legislation that foster innovation and secure individual right in equal measure look forward to explore these issue in committee and ensure that we seize the opportunity to shape robust right respect digital landscape for the uk would like to draw the attention of the house to my membership of the writers guild of great britain rise to contribute to today debate on the data use and access bill as creative who work as screenwriter before enter this place to write good script take discipline focus sweat and tear have find that tea and biscuit help too we mere mortal can not create something out of nothing creativity be an act of synthesis pull together the flotsam and jetsam of our experience and observation and apply they in an original way we pour our life experience into our work create the humanity behind the line which lift character from the page and into the public consciousness if the public want to hang out by watch the show that we create we have on our hand the rare of commodity hit many year ago work on the hit show new tricks it be cold case cop drama that run to series on the bbc create by nigel mccrery who die this week new tricks be and remain very popular show twice year receive the royalty collect for by the authors licensing and collecting society be pay fairly for my original work when it be rebroadcast around the world or on digital platform this week discover that the subtitle from one of my episode for new tricks have be scrap and be be use to create learn material for artificial intelligence along with thousand of other film and television show my original work be be use by generative ai to write script which one day may replace version produce by mere human like this be theft and it be happen on an industrial scale as the law stand ai company do not have to be transparent about what they be steal therefore welcome the principle of the amendment in the bill before we today which address this issue the amendment require generative artificial intelligence firm to be transparent about the content use to train their model allow creator to know when our work have be use another amendment expand the exist copyright regime which be completely clear that the unlicensed use of creative content to train ai model be theft to cover all gai model market in the uk over in the united states thomson reuters have just receive summary judgment on its infringement claim it be the first pure ai training case decide in the us and the judge have say that ai training be not fair use welcome the secretary of state statement and his listen mode but the creative industry worry that the government prefer position of creator of original material opt out of have work scrap be not workable because no such model currently exist anywhere in the world we be worried because creator build our industry the creative industry be at the heart of our industrial strategy fully endorse much of what the hon lady have say we as house be slow to regulate the internet when it first emerge the fascination with the new blind people to the damage it could do we have have the online harm bill more recently and so on and so forth the risk in this case be not that we go too far but that we do not go far enough it be important base on what she just say that we take swift decisive and firm action to avoid the eventuality of reduce human as she describe they to mere puppet the right hon gentleman make an important point and it be crucial that the government take that into account at the end of the consultation we have hear lot of voice from the creative art sector the point of the consultation be to hear from all sector so far in the debate we have not hear representation or voice from the technology sector look forward to the contribution by the hon member for north norfolk steff aquarone but have be reassure by the technology company that they be engage with the consultation and be try to present the technological solution for which my hon friend inquire that be why the live consultation be so important so that and we as house can judge whether the submission from technology company be robust and implementable enough and can see where the technology will go the consultation be still live during this debate and hope that by the time we be in committee we can have more of an informed discussion even though as say before there be the likelihood of further parliamentary involvement down the line in fully inform way thank the secretary of state for his reassurance know that creative be worried because the scraping be happen now and will carry on until we have solution we must protect the creative industry they grow by over third between and in term of gross value add far outpace growth in the uk economy as whole they be worth more to the economy than life science car manufacturing aerospace and the oil and gas sector combine they be glorious british success story they make we proud they make we feel good they shape the nation identity they make we well we they be represent in every corner of the uk with million worker of whom live outside london they be writer musician photographer artist all manner of wonderful creative folk power one of our great success story and one of our good engine for growth in my constituency of scarborough and whitby have be entreat by individual creative and small and medium sized enterprise to ask the government to look after their right and to protect their income recently proudly serve on the employment rights bill committee bill that will see the big improvement for work people in generation creative be work people too creative work be work the secretary of state for culture media and sport have talk about her determination to take the brake off the creative industry and turbocharge growth if the creative industry be fast car the creative be the driver without we it be the equivalent of driverless car fine maybe to get from to but if we be to produce the kind of quality script behind the superb television drama that entertain comfort inspire and as recently show in the case of mr bates vs the post office effect meaningful change we need human being at the wheel to have human there we need to ensure that they be pay for do what they do good be original we should inspire the rest of the world to adopt high standard lead from the front and amplify our influence on the global stage britain creative industry deserve dynamic licensing market that protect copyright and drive growth and innovation in both the creative and tech sector look forward to the outcome of the consultation on ai and copyright and to work with the secretary of state and the minister to find future proof solution which protect original work and the ability to earn an income from it the labour party be found on the principle of fair day wage for fair day work be in government be our opportunity to fulfil that principle for uk creative it be pleasure to follow the hon member for scarborough and whitby alison hume whose speech be absolutely spot on agree with it completely it will not surprise the government front benchers that welcome the bill there be very few part of it if any with which disagree perhaps because it bear an extraordinary similarity to the data protection and digital information bill introduce by the previous government which spend many happy hour take through committee and report as the secretary of state point out unfortunately that bill fall as result of the calling of the general election and share his regret that it be not possible to get it on to the statute book that be another reason among many why regret the calling of the general election at the time choose by the previous prime minister the right hon gentleman refer to all the happy day he have but do not think that he really enjoy the report stage of the previous bill think nobody else will notice if he admit it here now that he do not really like everything that be in the previous government version of the bill and that he rather prefer our version although the hon gentleman and have robust but nevertheless amicable exchange on report it be in fact his colleague the hon member for barnsley south stephanie peacock who take that bill through committee it be not until report that the conservative government decide to add measure to the bill measure that fully support of course but which nevertheless make the task little more difficult as they result in lack of agreement across the chamber which have previously pertain throughout the passage of the bill it be pleasure to debate these matter again and indeed to see not just the hon gentleman but some of the official who labour to take that bill through committee with and be now task with do it all over again one point about the bill that the secretary of state do not refer to be that lot of it seek to improve the working of datum protection law in this country and make datum more accessible while safeguard important privacy right however the fact that we be able to make change to improve our data protection law be consequence of britain no long be member of the european union otherwise we be trap by the gdpr requirement this be an example of where we can draft legislation to benefit people in this country and not have to accept top down impose legislation from brussels another reason why be an enthusiastic supporter of the previous bill one issue that feature lot during the previous debate and which be slightly surprised have not be mention so far be whether the change make in the bill would in any way jeopardise datum adequacy recognition by the eu interruption be sorry the hon member for harpenden and berkhamsted victoria collins do mention it but the secretary of state do not data adequacy be an important issue and concern have be express outside the house that the bill might put it at risk we be very keen to ensure that that be not the case and we work closely as be sure the minister continue to do with the information commissioner john edwards who have lot of experience in this field have previously oversee the data protection regime in new zealand which enjoy data adequacy but be not identical to gdpr be sure give that this bill be so similar that there be no risk to datum adequacy which be of importance to many large firm the bill cover lot of other area that we regard as important and which have remain largely unchanged such as the operation of the information commissioner office digital identification the national underground asset register the electronic use of the register of birth and marriage the extension of smart datum use automate decision making and the retention of information where require by coroner after child death all those area be include in the previous bill and be delighted that they be still there in this one if may will take this opportunity to explore some of my right hon friend knowledge and expertise in this area will he comment on the balance in this bill between safeguard on the one hand and freedom on the other would be interested in his thought if my hon friend be refer to data protection it be careful balance people be rightly concerned that their datum be protect and that they should have privacy right and there be campaign organisation out there that have examine the bill and express concern we be careful to ensure that the standard of datum protection require be maintain and be sure this government take the same view at the same time this be where there be small difference between the previous bill and this government bill we be keen to ensure that datum protection do not impose unnecessary burden particularly on small business there be one or two area where we be able to slightly relax the definition and to reduce the burden on business but this government have take different view they be relatively minor and relatively technical area but there be thing such as the definition of vexatious and excessive which be an issue that occupy lot of discussion the government have now remove that and revert to the previous definition which we feel be unnecessarily burdensome there be also the whole area of subject access request that would occupy huge amount of firm time in try to respond to they we feel there need to be at least some safeguard to prevent those become as we define it vexatious so regret the fact that the government have not proceed with that element however those be relatively minor area and in large part the bill be one that previously enjoy cross party consensus when it go through this chamber in the last parliament and that suspect will continue to enjoy cross party consensus as it move into committee in this parliament the secretary of state be no long with we but hasten to add that be not volunteer to serve on the public bill committee have previously endure many hour do so do not particularly want to repeat that experience perhaps in part because the bill enjoy lot of support across the house there be inevitably particular element about which there be real concern and that be the area of copyright protection and artificial intelligence it be worth say that that be not originally in the bill at all and congratulate baroness kidron who manage to persuade the clerks in the other place to allow she to move the amendment to insert it into the bill and it be now part of the bill think those amendment be very important and very much welcome they the hon member for bury north mr frith refer to the fact that the previous government have not act in this area and he be right the conservatives do not act because we feel and continue to feel that the law on copyright be clear and do not need change this government have propose to change the law to bring in the text and datum mining exception that will create the opportunity for ai to take scrape and ingest creative content of the kind the hon member for scarborough and whitby mention use an exception that the government be bring in it be propose under the last government but can tell the house that the last government reject it precisely because we feel it would drive coach and horse through copyright law and do real damage to the creative industry the right hon gentleman speech be very helpful and he be make some useful point the shadow minister would not give we any clarity about his party position on the opt out mechanism so could he help what be the opposition position on that do they support it yes or no be very happy to address that be not on the front bench but will tell the hon member my view which be very clear have profound reservation about the opt out which reverse the whole principle of copyright law the owner of right will have to go and say that they do not want to have their right take away from they otherwise there be right for other to use their content would prefer to see an opt in or in actual fact licensing method whereby right holder could agree if they wish to do so that their content could be use if only the right hon gentleman be on the conservative front bench on these issue we would have little bit of clarity but he be absolutely spot on there be no issue with copyright at the moment and no confusion about what be require in the law all the government be do be try to create some sort of smokescreen so that they can start to dismantle and water down our copyright regime what do he think about those attempt and will he join the rest of we in stand up for the copyright regime as it stand where there be no question about its legality assure the hon gentleman that have no wish to replace my hon friend the member for havant alan mak who be do an excellent job nevertheless the hon gentleman and have be involve in discussion on copyright for many year and share his view indeed welcome the debate that we have in this place just couple of week ago on the creative industry where lot of these argument be rehearse and the minister helpfully agree that there be no workable opt out technology available the exist opt out which the european union have suggest simply do not work on top of that it be unenforceable the minister and the secretary of state have suggest that they would not proceed unless workable opt out could be develop it would be first if it be in any case be opposed to opt out in principle but it be at present practically impossible to introduce hear the secretary of state talk about the technology company work to bring workable solution forward but hope that the minister will again make clear that the government will not proceed unless there be viable workable technological solution that allow right holder to make clear that they do not wish to have their work use by artificial intelligence training model and have that enforce think it might be easy if respond to that now yes completely and utterly agree with the right hon gentleman that be our settled view we want to get to process where there be more licensing of content and we have say that repeatedly it be one of the aim of our consultation he say that copyright do not need change but the amendment table by baroness kidron in the lords do change copyright law we will somehow have to square that circle at some point during the bill progress the amendment that baroness kidron table put in clear term what we believe the law be already number of case be go through and the hon member for scarborough and whitby refer to one in america that important judgment say that ai training do not constitute fair use that be an american court but previously we have be tell that america be ahead in encourage and promote the use of this technology it be reassure that even in america they recognise the importance of protect creative work news publisher bring forward that case it be important that we recognise that creative industry in their broad definition be affect by this issue and the newspaper publisher be particularly anxious about the consequence one of baroness kidron amendment which be now in the bill emphasise the importance of transparency and know the minister agree with that but it also require company to make clear in meet the transparency requirement exactly what kind of activity the web crawler be involve in newspaper publisher depend upon search and it be important that the search engine can find and flag up their content because without that they will not get the audience they need that be different exercise from training for ingestion and ai create content if the bill be about require transparency the amendment pass in the lords seek to achieve that and hope they will be preserve because it be important that we have that transparency not just as general principle but in detail in that way two week ago the minister give some welcome assurance and he have do so again this afternoon we need to continue the debate as he say if the government proceed legislation will be require in due course which we will obviously want to examine carefully view have be express on behalf of the creative industry and publisher that while the minister and other member of the government have be open to discussion the secretary of state have not meet they so be pleased to hear he early give the assurance that he would meet they because this be of such vital importance to they as my hon friend the member for havant say there be lack of any economic impact assessment on the proposal in the consultation paper hope that the government will produce such an economic impact assessment this be subject that be not intend to be include in the bill welcome the fact that it be but it be obviously one that we will debate again many time in committee perhaps outside committee as well will rely on my colleague who serve on the committee to carry out the work at that point as well thank the minister for his willingness to engage and assure he that we will continue to do so it fair to say that if we do not work with datum we do not really think about it too much but when we do we realise how much of it surround we in multiple form every day in this place walk past shelf groan under the weight of volume of hansard an institutional memory of all that have happen here new technology offer we an opportunity to take all that knowledge of what have come before and use it to help shape what we do next data be powerful but often underappreciated and undervalue commodity the bill be to be welcome have no doubt that it will help grow the economy improve public service and make people live easy however when it come to the creative industry we must recognise that creativity be more than just the sum of its data part novel be not just word song be not just note and lyric and painting be not just pixel or brush stroke the poem of robert burns be not merely letter on page they come alive in our mind in way that no dataset can fully capture when we treat creative work as nothing more than datum point we risk undervalue the talent the skill and the human expression that make they meaningful start my work life as broadcaster at year old secure work placement at central fm which be still proudly broadcast independently across the forth valley go for week and stay for year present the breakfast show drag myself out of bed at in the morning my parent be more impressed that their teenage son could get up that early than they be about my career choice back then only radio station be available in stirling today my teenage son can stream thousand of station podcast and song from device in his pocket the march of technology be relentless it can sweep people up or it can sweep people aside in radio see that march at first hand first come digitisation then networking and then automation and with each step job disappear my last full time broadcasting job be in leave because see too many friend chase too few job that pay too little money now we be at another turning point ai be powerful tool with huge potential but it need vast amount of datum and that datum have enormous value at recent public accounts committee evidence session we hear from academic expert who tell we that once we hand over our datum whatever promise be make and whatever covenant be place on it we have lose control if unchecked and unregulated or regulate improperly technology and the datum it use do not care whether it make people live well or bad we be deal today with the good and the bad consequence of decision take by tech company and regulator in relation to social medium and smartphone let we learn from our mistake not repeat they the amendment propose in the other place particularly on copyright and transparency resonate greatly with and much of the creative community urge colleague to give they due consideration in the next stage of the bill passage through the house be hearten to hear the secretary of state positive comment to that end in today debate and welcome the government separate consultation on the issue there will be other opportunity to consider these point but the concern of the creative industry must be hear and act upon copyright protection be not barrier to ai innovation and competition but safeguard for the work of an industry worth billion per year and employ more than million people we can enable world where much of this value be transfer to handful of big tech firm or we can enable win win situation for the creative industry and ai developer where they work together base on license relationship with remuneration and transparency at their heart technology do not care what or who it replace but we should the world need data scientist and it also need poet creative worker be right to be nervous about ai far erode their ability to monetise their work if we do not act carefully we risk future where technology exploit creativity rather than support it datum and technology drive progress but progress must not come at the expense of those who create innovate and inspire ai have immense potential but without proper safeguard on it and its datum it risk sweep creative worker aside or bad replace they all together as we embrace the opportunity that ai and data drive technology present we must ensure that progress do not come at the cost of our creative industry human expression can not be reduce to mere datum point the livelihood of those who enrich our economy and culture must be protect it be our responsibility to force innovation while safeguard the right of creator we can build future where ai enhance human creativity rather than undermine it and where both well pay data scientist and well pay poet thrive in digital age it be an absolute pleasure to follow the hon member for stirling and strathallan chris kane he be spot on in remind we that datum have always exist in various form throughout the century whether in volume or in little thing that we can plug into computer the only difference now be that all that datum be scrap and ingest into huge machine which regurgitate it into some form that only they will decide the hon gentleman be also spot on in remind we about his work at central fm very fine radio station this hon member be always available for interview at any time that central fm come calling this be an alright bill it be good it be quite fine it be reasonable in its approach and intent it be good shot at try to redefine our data regulation law it will do good job of ensure that our public service be more aligned and mainstream and that access be available to all our constituent however it be much well bill because of some of the amendment make in the house of lords the amendment that be add at the later stage go far on child protection in online datum and look into deepfake which be particularly helpful and congratulate our colleague down the corridor on bring they forward it be much well bill because of the amendment that be deliver by baroness kidron on copyright and transparency they significantly improve the bill to make it something worth defend and protect hope that that will be the main mission as it continue to go through this house you will know madam deputy speaker that it be unusual for to congratulate our be ermine unelected friend down the corridor but this oiky nat will doff his cap to their lord their lady their baron and their earl because they have do good job at shape the bill it be certainly much well bill than it be on second read down the corridor have few issue with the bill there be concern about the security of some of this datum be particularly worried about some of the relationship within the eu uk partnership and just hope that whatever be propose in the bill do not drag we far away from the mainstream when it come to the european union the right hon member for maldon sir john whittingdale and agree about most thing when it come to the creative sector but we do not agree about the european union and the benefit of this country leave it be passionate remainer and hope that at some point will be able to take our country back into the european union as proud member of the scottish national party my intention and ambition be that we go back into that fantastic union of nation that have do so much to enrich our culture and our life the hon gentleman be right that we do not agree on this particular issue of course be we to rejoin the eu we would then be bind by its legislation on this very issue which include the opt out this be where the right hon gentleman and do profoundly disagree look at this arrangement and the partnership across the european union as positive it be good thing we be major contributor to some of the eu directive put forward on copyright and artificial intelligence they miss we and we miss they we be just so much well when we be in partnership think we will just have to respectfully agree to disagree as we go forward on this particular issue be keen to emphasise that it be of course possible for we to align ourselves with the european directive that the previous government construct before leave the european union in order to be able to maintain good creative copyright protection for our creative without we necessarily have to rejoin the european union absolutely the hon lady be spot on know that several member across the house be look just now at some of those who take part in the debate we have on the european copyright directive and what it be do again there be disagreement about its value the hon lady be right we can keep ourselves alive that be my hope just hope that the provision of the bill do not do anything to far alienate we from our european colleague because it be very important that we keep that alignment this bill be also important because it remove number of the unnecessary and harmful clause in the previous conservative government bill we will just have to take with pinch of salt the ambition of this bill such as the billion in growth anticipate from it all will say be that have hear that all before know this be government desperate to find growth anywhere they have make such mess of the economy since come to power that everywhere they see the green shoot of growth we will wait and see whether we will get this billion of growth the government have first test which come with clause to we do not know if we will get growth from the bill when it come to datum but we do know that we get growth from the creative industry in this country which in contribute billion to the economy and provide million job that be real growth we should not mess with that and undermine it in the way the government might be do with the watering down of the copyright provision and give generative ai access to our nation creative treasure will just say that gently to the government however do very much welcome the inclusion of clause to the hon gentleman have talk quite bit about clause to he may end up on the bill committee in which case we will be able to talk through the intricacy of those clause then several of they actually require ministers to introduce very significant change via secondary legislation be that really what he would like surely such matter should be properly include in bill yes at this stage it be definitely what would like because we have get they they be in bill that we will decide and vote on and look at in committee they be security and guarantee for our creative sector because they be already in piece of legislation that we will hopefully pass rise if the minister be go to say something positive about ensure that we respect our copyright regime that it will stay intact and continue to do the job it have be do so effectively for the past few decade then will look at this now think hear the secretary of state say something about another piece of legislation it might be necessary to bring in another piece of legislation and think we would all welcome that however it have to be on the basis of defend and protect our intellectual property and our copyright regime will give way once again to the minister be very grateful the hon gentleman be be generous completely agree that we need to ensure that the right of right holder be protect that they be able to be remunerate properly for their work and that human creativity be at the heart of everything the amendment table in the house of lords state that government ministers should basically write the law in secondary legislation so it would not be on the face of the bill he normally oppose such power make power be give to government ministers so be slightly surprised that he be so passionate about they now wonder whether it would not be well for we to legislate properly with all those thing lay out for proper scrutiny again be grateful to the minister for intervene in such helpful manner be not particularly averse to secondary legislation it have its place and purpose and if it help achieve desire outcome then have no issue with it this be what my constituent want have be knock out by the number of email have receive and secure from my constituent ask to support the creative sector in the consultation on copyright and ai and to back the amendment as the bill go through the house there do not seem to be any doubt that most of our constituent seem to be in partnership with their artist and the creative sector on this matter think what they want to see be the government show the same determination and ambition for our creative sector and our artist they have that opportunity will be patient with the minister he have hint occasionally about have some sort of solution that defend and protect our copyright regime while at the same time supply what he require to ensure ambition in the ai sector we be all look forward to do all that thank the hon gentleman very much for give way do not include this point in my own contribution because do not realise that the ai copyright issue would be such big part of the debate but just want to let he and the house know that the science innovation and technology committee and the culture media and sport committee sit together with creative and technologist to discuss how the technology solution the minister be look for could address the exact point that he be make support copyright and provide access to datum google and openai refuse to take part because they say their response to the consultation be ongoing as an engineer think that you should always be able to explain what you be do in the midst of you do it but that be their position however the technologist who be there have view that technology could there be not consensus support that although not necessarily immediately be grateful to the chair of the select committee she be absolutely right her committee have central role in look at these issue and wish she well in any of the inquiry she launch it be particularly disappointing that google and other ai company will not come to her committee hope that she use the power that know as former select committee chair can be use to oblige reluctant witness to come in front of she be pretty certain that somebody who be as determine an individual as she be will be able to secure that the hon gentleman be make powerful case as ever and agree with much of what he be say do he agree with that we should be ready to point out where those who contribute to this debate be proxy or fund by tech company not appear in public to make the case but instead make argument through small organisation that can be little bit more assertive and nimble footed and not quite as accountable that be very interesting contribution from the hon gentleman it would be useful exercise to find out who be speak on behalf of certain company if they be reluctant witness we should not have reluctant witness in this house people should have an obligation to appear for parliamentary scrutiny it do not matter whether it be the big tech brother or the small company in our constituency he be right that that type of transparency would be really useful we should not be naive about this because the tech company have form all of their pedigree suggest that they can not be trust to do the right thing to manage their affair or to protect either the public interest or the interest of the creative industry so hope that the government will take exactly the robust approach that the hon gentleman have describe perhaps one way in which they could do so give that copyright have be introduce into these consideration via the amendment be to extend exist copyright to the internet so that people who publish online be subject to the same restriction they already be the minister say that they be but they should be subject to exactly the same restriction as those who print and broadcast far be it from who be on my foot to get in the way of conversation between the right hon gentleman and the minister be interested by that little exchange the right hon gentleman be right we have to be careful when it come to issue such as this give his experience of the house he will have observe over the year some of the way in which people who be able to make representation can be abuse as we go forward in such critical area he be right to issue warning and think the house have hear what he have have to say clause to be the creative industry safeguard and guarantee in the face on an almost existential threat to their ability to sustain themselves and continue to bring that uncontaminated joy of human imagination to the people we represent they would help to tackle the unauthorised use of intellectual property by big tech company scrap datum for ai they would enforce transparency and lie out redress procedure they would explicitly subject ai company to uk copyright law regardless of where they be base in the world that mean and this be critical point that those company would have to reveal the name and owner of web crawler that currently operate anonymously most importantly they would allow copyright owner to know when where and how their work be to be use to develop and thrive our artist need the good possible condition and political environment and we have deliver that over the decade that be why we lead the world when it come to our contribution to the creative industry and why we make such massive gross value add in every single sector in which we be predominant our lead artist give we soft power that be the envy of the world and we must not do anything that threaten our ability to retain it we have gold standard ip right framework enshrine in uk law we have copyright regime that protect our artist and ensure that their wonderful work be properly recognise and that they be remunerate for the product of their imagination be interested by the hon gentleman remark about the importance of these clause amendment from the other place which in principle support he have also mention the importance of ensure that proper scrutiny take place when it come to for example the tech company make representation in this place but those amendment suggest that that would be deal with only through secondary legislation if we have an opportunity as present by those on the front bench to suggest that we could have proper primary legislation why should we accept the idea of secondary legislation which do not allow for sufficient scrutiny to ensure that we be provide the necessary protection when we should be debate primary legislation in this chamber have probably not explain exactly what my fear and concern be and that be probably typical of what we currently have in the bill be guarantee that we will respect copyright and ensure that there be transparency until be present with something that cover all the issue that be cover in clause to with all the security that they would give our creative industry will back those clause to the hilt and will do everything possible to ensure that they remain within the bill if the minister as he seem to be suggest be go to come back to we with different bill let we see it let we see if it do all the thing that we all want when it come to back our creative sector if it contain all the provision that will ensure that our copyright framework be respect and if transparency be on the face of it will back it in flash but until see it this be all that have get and all that the house have get and we should make sure that we defend and protect it there be an idea that somehow our copyright law be break they be not break at all our copyright law work perfectly well the only people who have an issue with our copyright law be those run the ai tech giant who find that such law get in the way of what they want to do and achieve their intention and ambition be to ingest our creative heritage and to scrape the world for the last bit of human imagination and creative content that be what have create difficulty and confusion about our copyright regime there be nothing wrong with our law they be really good and the envy of so many and they have serve we well will support the bill as it go through the house as have say to the minister it be good bill that generally do all the right thing when it come to datum use which should be support it be well bill because of the amendment and will continue to support it but if the minister have bill that he want to present to this house could he please get on with it there be consultation go on just now which end think in two week on wednesday at that point we will have the information that we require and suspect that we will find an overwhelming desire to see our copyright regime protect and defend if the minister have bill bring it on in the meantime we must support the provision and clause in this bill it be pleasure to have the opportunity to contribute far on this important bill thank ministers particularly the minister for data protection and telecoms for their ongoing attention and for be in listen mode particularly on the copyright matter that have be so dominant so far the bill rightly modernise data regulation which will spur growth and improve public service make everyday life well when put to good use and use fairly and effectively datum can enhance efficiency across sector from food supply chain and commercial forecasting to healthcare it be powerful prospect with enormous benefit the challenge be in ensure that those benefit reach everyone give the demand place on the bill by the amendment table in the other place hope that it proceed into committee as it do so we will gain insight from the government ongoing and related consultation on copyright and ai today debate be concern with the use of datum to drive progress it speak to how we can live well and how we can live good with ai we do not need to accept the false choice of innovate versus regulate in consider the country either side of we it can feel as though there be only two option one or the other zero or one but the uk must act now this be national cause with international consequence face with demand for innovation while other call for regulation we should bid for harmonisation harmony be the language not of compromise but of complement value great than the sum of its part we must understand the strength of all contribution to that harmony no country have get this right yet and this be our chance to learn from blend of approach international example should be observe ai should be harness to be an honest broker which be why transparency be key in silicon valley exception have be make to the us general approach and the creative and tech industry be balance accordingly the uk should embrace transparency and maintain the strength of both sector europe understand the role of transparency though there be little evidence that this have lead to more licensing for copyright holder we must not assume that one will automatically lead to the other or that this will alleviate the concern of our creative sector singapore have broad ai training exception but it have minimal creative sector the uk with its proud creative industry should not make flawed comparison with country without the same creative strength output and export just as transparency be demand in our supply chain so too must it apply to our code chain argument suggest that transparency would be too burdensome feel disingenuous in select committee hearing the argument for transparency which represent giant step forward in resolve the tension between ai and creator seem to have be deliberately oppose by those seek to excuse themselves as well as those they represent by proxy from pay for the work of other the government commitment to an industrial strategy include our brilliant creative industry but discussion with those industry should focus on how we advance and enhance they we risk make this about how we can protect their very existence if we do not take seriously the deep alarm voice by creator over the threat pose by ai we also risk lose the very thing that make life rich urge the government to introduce requirement for transparency if an ai system be train on the work of thousand of musician author and film maker they have right to know and right to be pay this could include register we do not tell manufacturer energy provider or tech firm that their product should be freely use to build billion dollar business without compensation the same principle must apply to creative work copyright be not barrier to innovation it be the foundation that allow creativity to thrive this threat to creator livelihood be particularly acute for small right holder who lack the mean to navigate complex system or enforce protection against unauthorised ai use these independent creator be the backbone of our creative ecosystem more than of they be base in our town and region away from the city where for they level up mean make up without they the uk creative engine will begin to fray and diminish creativity thrive not just through the marquee name but through the countless independent voice expression and creation that enrich our experience the argument that restrict ai access to copyright work will stifle progress and leave we trail behind other territory be incorrect ask again what progress be we pursue if it undermine the position of strength that we start from have see no economic impact assessment that state that exempt music and other creative content from licensing or introduce ai training exception will boost the economy yes job in data centre will be welcome but they be minimal in comparison to those sustain by our creative industry at its heart ai be about capability and capacity it should not facilitate the casual but disastrous dismantling of copyright the job gain must come from skilled input and employment that put ai to work the harnessing of ai must be human tethered we must remember that ai be great enabler and for our advantage it be not stand alone sector it be transformative technology for all sector our focus must therefore be on its use not on sweeping legal exception that weaken copyright and risk hollow out the very industry we be commit to grow if there be technological answer digital fingerprinting solution or pay as you go ai model we should keep an open mind but it be leap to expect these solution to come soon enough for the urgent issue at hand the anxiety have outline can not be leave unresolved while we wait my hon friend be like musician be it any wonder that creative particularly musician be concern even by the language that have be refer to across the chamber ingestion speak of consume and let we not think what else it speak of scrap be also horrible word hopefully we can reach situation through the consultation that the minister and other be engage in where we can use well language in this space that give more reassurance to the creative sector instead of ingest we could use collaborate for example and instead of scrape we could use reward we might then protect our wonderful creative sector agree with everything my hon friend say and suspect he be well musician than be he be yes the minister get the memo ai be give the creative sector indigestion frankly and this be the problem we be face so aim for smoother future through collaboration be absolutely right as with previous technological shift such as the introduction of the internet or indeed the printing press law should be base on use not on the technology itself the principle of tech neutrality should be reaffirm as guide principle for our law and culture in the absence of clear solution we must return to first principle and stand for transparency fairness and the fundamental right to be pay for one work or will we entertain the risk of an opaque system build on unnecessary secrecy freely extract value from copyright work without payment we be in defining moment innovation should uplift not exploit the future of ai must be build on trust so urge this house and this government to ensure that ai innovation do not come at the cost of our world lead creative industry opposition member be broadly supportive of this bill and its aim which build on the work do by the previous conservative government and refine by member of the other place will focus primarily on deepfake and ai generate image specifically in relation to clause and commend baroness owen for her work on non consensual image and deepfake and for press the government to address this issue with more urgency her work bring about turn on the intent base amendment push the government to agree on solicitation and push they to act on the deletion of content remove the intent base amendment remove huge hurdle for victim hurdle that would have require victim to prove the intention of their tormentor this would simply have place more pressure on victim while abuser would have be more likely to excuse their crime it be right that solicitation be now include in the bill as many case have show that it be not enough just to criminalise creation we must also criminalise the people who ask other to create these image and video for they otherwise we run the risk of loophole where image be post on to site and people from other jurisdiction create the content and send it back to the person request it the government try to prevent custodial sentence from be an option for these abuser as they argue that omit reasonable excuse may breach the european convention on human right give the content can not see how perpetrator right trump the right of victim but the change be make thank to baroness owen and members from across the party in the other place who persist in make sure that the government take all action need to stop this grow criminal scourge we have see surge in deepfake revenge porn and nudifying app this technology be the wild west and unchecked pose danger to many in society we must act to protect the most vulnerable from harm welcome that clause establishe requirement for the commissioner to report on what action have be take it be right that we see what be be do to combat these crime we have hear many report of sexual image of child be generate and spread this cause so much damage and once such exploitative image be create and disseminate they be near impossible to eradicate as technology advance we need to keep pace with new threat lest technological change outstrip the pace of legislation for too long the law have be out of touch with fast change reality there be app just few click away that allow user to generate their own ai boyfriend or girlfriend and some of these app can take real image and change they into sexually explicit figure that be already terrifyingly real this be just one example of why we need further restriction with clear penalty for both platform provider and user one app undress ai process over image of woman within day of launch these be ordinary woman with no knowledge that their image be be doctor in such way and use even trade for the gratification of other this be simply not right although consent be at the heart of aspect of the bill we need to look closely at provision for withdraw consent this must be seriously consider particularly where an image that be consensually exchange be doctor into something that be never consent to though welcome aspect of the bill we must ensure that we keep up with the rapid pace of change app that cause great harm be readily accessible hope to hear more about what can be do to assist people to withdraw consent so that we can end this vile abuse will focus my remark on the impact of generative ai on musician refer the house to my entry in the register of members financial interests and be member of the musicians union with background in the music industry share friendship with many musician and as fan have be inundate with concern from musician about how ai could affect their livelihood the music industry have long be structure in way that exploit musician streaming service have make that far bad and our musician will once again lose out if ai copyright law be not handle correctly big tech company should not be able to generate and profit from music without permission or payment how can we justify take money away from british musician and hand it to tech firm for free that do not support growth it undermine it in reality many household name artist whose music we all know who have have top hit and whose poster once adorn our wall be struggle new musician can barely get foot in the door and be often not pay for year song be play more than ever yet songwriter see less of the money someone be get pay but not the people who create the music unless they be at the very top make good living as musician in this country be become nearly impossible even those who can sell out venue of couple of thousand people across our town and city be barely scrap by the balance be completely off but we in this place have the power to help to change that unlike our european counterpart in this country we have fail to introduce proper protection for creator pay over the past decade as the party of labour with commitment to make work pay this government should ensure that artist songwriter and musician be fairly pay for their work and protect from exploitation by faceless tech company ai can be powerful tool transform industry like healthcare and science by reduce admin burden and free up skilled professional but ai that tokenise the toil of artist and spit out soulless imitation do not support human creativity or make it more productive no one have ever love song because of how efficiently it be write as james oppenheim write in his poem our life shall not be sweat from birth until life close heart starve as well as body give we bread but give we rose if work be our bread then music be our rose musician across the country be closely watch today debate the consultation be ongoing and these matter will be address more in due course thank the minister for his ongoing engagement in the matter but will he assure that the government will strive to get the bill right for musician and that musician will not be overlook in the introduction of al technology will attempt not to give rerun of the speech make during the general debate on the creative industry the other day no paddington the minister will be delighted to hear that there will be no paddington reference minister have set out the core objective of the bill grow the economy improve public service and make people live easy no one be go to disagree with any of that those aim be laudable and support they as do the liberal democrats however there be concern will focus on an area that other have already touch on and speak in support of amendment that have come to we from the house of lords relate to the creative industry and copyright while the bill seek to improve life we worry that the consultation currently be undertake by the government leave open risk that incentive for human creativity will be remove entirely and that we will end up in future with many ten of thousand of shade of pale grey at the heart of our creative sector be the ability of the human hand to paint or draw or to write music that move we and of the human brain to compose verse that persuade people make the hair stand up on the back of our neck and change the world for the well protect that must be absolutely central to what we do as we embrace technology but the risk of ai be that those protection be lose for the avoidance of doubt and in the absence of clarity from the official opposition we back system that would protect the ip of creative that is an opt in system would give way to the shadow minister if he want to clarify the conservative party position he do not the default must be that creative content be protect even ai model if we ask they admit the risk to human creativity if ip be not protect by an opt in model while the conservative party have criticise we on that at least we have an opinion want to emphasise and build on what my hon friend the member for knowsley anneliese midgley point out in relation to music we need to understand which creative sector be most vulnerable to generative ai it be those that have be easily replicable through other form of technology in the past music writing and the visual art in particular photography say that because it be sometimes misunderstood that some creative sector be more vulnerable than other and if we do not understand that they have different regime for how they be protect there be risk of not be able to properly protect they the hon lady contribution be as right as all the other she have make during this debate and the general debate couple of week ago will immediately move on to the point that data be an abstract term and be be use to cover all sort of information in these debate yet all datum be not equal and our legislation must properly reflect that for example there be clear and obvious role for ai in process health datum in way that help doctor with diagnosis and benefit patient with fast treatment the same might apply to the chat we have with our local council about bin planning or licensing yet even though no one will disagree that the uk firm innovate in science medicine climate change and other key industry must not be stymie the training datum for other ai system the datum we be talk about be literature poetry music and art those be thing that be creative in essence it be not just datum it be creative endeavour and an extremely human form one of the option in the current consultation would abolish the copyright protection that underpin the livelihood of our creative sector and as other have say that would be ruinous for the creative industry furthermore the unintended consequence could actually harm the long term development of ai model that we will all come to rely on high quality datum be essential for train good ai model but publicly available human create text datum might become the minority online we have all see the mistake that ai can produce and model train on bad datum will only produce bad result the government be rightly ambitious for ai and part of that ambition must include produce model with traceable datum that the public can be assure meet high standard minister should be embrace our copyright law precisely because that be means to improve ai as well as protect our creative reliable licensing system will ensure that ai model be be create use high quality human generate datum oversight of what be use to train those model will only help to build trust in what be very new technology that the public be sceptical about to that end the liberal democrats support the amendment that have come from the house of lords which seek to strengthen the right of creative the government must think carefully about which side of the argument they support and have be pleased to hear some of the secretary of state and the minister reassurance today we will be watch closely we can take more positive from other part of the bill and to reflect on that will move on to discuss some constituency matter be more optimistic about the bill potential to improve the situation of bereaved parent which the minister and have discuss fairly recently and hope ministers will confirm that that opportunity will be take many in the house will be familiar with the story of my constituent ellen roome who tragically lose her year old son jools to suicide in her search for answer about the circumstance lead up to jools death ellen have come up against outdated law and social medium giant take an intransigent approach to share datum that should naturally be her as parent we be talk about the thing that in the past she would have be able to find out by look through her child bedroom thing that might have be in wardrobe store under the bed or in school note these day those bit of datum will be on multiple social medium account this be the subject of my private member bill the social media access to accounts bill also know as the jools law bill this bill would give parent access right to their deceased child datum automatically so other grieve parent will never face the challenge and the huge legal cost that ellen have have to endure note the plan announce by minister include establish an information commission with duty to ensure child datum be protect this be welcome step which hope will strengthen the protection child badly need online but we must ensure the commission be effectively resource to take on the social medium giant who have make it clear that they only want profit first offer my deep condolence to the family concern in my constituency also have challenging case where young boy lose his life it be entirely appropriate that the government be take this forward and commend ministers for their work on it and also thank the hon gentleman for his work on this important matter thank the hon gentleman the purpose of my point today be to make sure that while the datum bill progress consensus be build in this house that we all acknowledge that parent should have the right to their child datum in case where child have die of suicide that be simple principle and be sure the hon gentleman would agree with it as know minister do that consensus must be bear out in the legislation that we pass be hopeful these circumstance will be cover in the final bill and that the jools law bill will become law so ask ministers today will we have clarity on the government plan in this area and will they support parent like ellen will the government accept the principle my constituent ellen be pursue it be simple ask that parental access to social medium account datum be protect in the event of child death that social medium company be oblige to retain that datum for suitable period of time and that datum be make available to inquest so coroner can make judgment to prevent such tragedy from happen again be grateful to have the opportunity to speak in this debate and be pleased to follow the powerful speech of the hon member for cheltenham max wilkinson this wide range bill cut across many aspect of government and people life we must harness the power of datum to drive economic growth to support modern digital government and build more efficient effective public service and to support people to have improve live more generally for too long this potential have not be fully realise hold back business public service learning and education and people up and down the country more generally this mission lead government plan for change deliver economic growth well public service and action on the environment can not be fully realise without some of the opportunity that this bill create measure in the bill be expect to free up million hour of police time mean officer will have more time to tackle crime rather than deal with admin this will be welcome in community blight by antisocial behaviour and among retailer who have be affect by shoplifting or violence against shop worker the co op in oakwood in my constituency be an example it will also be welcome in term of the service victim of domestic violence receive from the police as they will have more time to take preventive work and support victim include my constituent hayley who come to to talk about her experience of domestic violence it be also estimate that measure in this bill will free up huge amount of time within the nhs for clinician potentially save life as well as make service more accessible and responsive to people need that be vital as the government have inherit from their predecessor the long waiting time in nhs history the bill will also improve the information that regulator receive enable real time view of how service be perform old model of regulation where inspector would go in on periodic rolling basis be often insufficient and not responsive to service current situation we have see example in the nhs and education where extremely poor service have not be of standard that people have right to expect there have be abuse in some case but regulator oversight have not be modern enough to capture that and drive regulatory action presume that my hon friend be move on to range of other benefit of ai have he consider the importance of ai in support medical and scientific research there be great deal of evidence to show that the power of ai apply to this area could speed up the development of new drug and many other treatment in addition to diagnostic that be an important aspect of the benefit of ai to medicine and be not always report well in the medium my hon friend be right there be tremendous opportunity to anticipate people need throughout their life and also drive scientific innovation so that we can live long and healthy life the health secretary and other ministers have be clear that the huge investment that the government be make in public service must go hand in hand with reform since change will not be deliver solely by spend more money and this bill will help to make that possible be also pleased that the government will strengthen safeguard on personal datum that be key to ensure that people have trust in the service that they use and to prevent those who would exploit personal datum from be able to do so look forward to follow that aspect of the bill as it progress through its future stage also wish to touch on the national underground asset register national map of the uk underground infrastructure in derbyshire people find it so frustrating to find that their street their road or the highway that they use have be dig up again by yet another utility company or another person who need access to the cable or the infrastructure underground not only be that frustrating for people as they try to get around but it be believe undermine the integrity of the road that we use and drive our pothole problem hope that combine with our journey to local government devolution our road will be another area where people will be able to see tangible difference during the bill passage through the house of lords effort be make to strengthen copyright protection for creator include artist photographer author musician composer and lyricist welcome the work that the house of lords have do to push those issue far up the agenda strong protection for creator be something that will always seek to support artificial intelligence have benefit for sector such as music yet more transparency from ai firm on the music art and literature on which their system draw be absolutely necessary although the technology be new some of the argument that we have hear here and today in the wide discourse on this bill be decidedly not new be remind of the century although be not there when johannes gutenberg roll out his printing press for the first time people be worried about the effect that that would have on scribe and the monk who transcribe the religious text the hon member for perth and kinross shire pete wishart who be no long in his place speak about the volume of book that we have here in parliament say gently to my hon friend that the difference be that then people understand from look at the book whether it be print or scribe whereas with ai generate work it be sometimes hard to distinguish which be why we need labelling and additional consumer protection in this space thank my hon friend for his intervention shall get on to those point when talk about the consultation that be currently under way we need to ensure that the benefit of ai be manage and that our creator be properly protect this be billion industry which employ more than million people it be an expression of who we be and contribute to our understanding of ourselves and each other and it take we on journey where we can walk in somebody else shoe and build more tolerant cohesive and engaged society if we do not get this right all that be threaten that would be bad not just for the global star the household name and the people whose record cd and download we have in our home and cassette yes and cassette it would also be bad for those at the start of their journey we must cultivate up and come talent and support emerge artist across all those sector we have moral duty to do so and to find an equitable solution and commend the work that uk music have do to point that out know it be not the bill intend purpose to address copyright and ai the consultation which close on february be under way and know the government do not want to predetermine its outcome because we want to get this right we need to get it right for the economy and for our culture give that this issue have be conflate with those in the bill would appreciate an assurance from the minister that if we can not proceed with progress well protection to ensure the uk legal framework for ai and copyright for the creative industry at this stage we will consider the matter follow the closure of the consultation look forward to work with ministers and colleague across the house to get the good solution possible for our creative be enjoy the debate and feel regretful that no long have any disclosable interest in the creative industry be grateful to member for share their powerful testimony do have couple of disclosable interest in relation to tech and want to address my comment to some of aspect of that over the course of human history we have find ourselves in possession of resource that can radically change how our society operate and the quality of life that we lead over thousand of year we have revolutionise society by harness fire oil electricity and even cassette tape truly believe that the great opportunity for our generation be to harness the power of datum for the public good before come to this place work with large company across the world talk to they about how they should restructure and reform their organisation to make the good use of the power of datum not only to improve their business but to improve the experience of their user and customer when they use datum well they bring prosperity to their organisation and make people want to come back to they time and again how many of our constituent could honestly say that they want to engage with departments and public service time and again we have to face hard truth when citizen engage with government they be far from impressed in so many case they feel that they be battle with sclerotic bureaucracy and system build of silo which feel design for the convenience of the administration and not the user my big gripe be that everywhere go in the country when need to park my car have to download new app because the local authority have decide what app it will use smart datum might actually allow we to have an interoperable interchangeable system for park our car could not agree more some of the conclusion that be reach through the procurement of technology service by local council defy sense and be utterly baffle be sure that all of we be guilty of that will not go any far than that so you guilty all of we be guilty be sure of be part of decision that sometimes defy sense when it come to usability can speak only on behalf of the citizen who contact about have to go round in circle share the same story dig out new and old reference number and wonder why nothing seem to want to work for they be sure the minister would agree that it do not have to be this way we have already see the transformative impact of the improved usability of service and that be just the very front end of the machine total transformation of how datum be use in our public service could radically change how we deliver service for citizen hope the government will look to estonia for inspiration on how to have truly data drive government with the citizen at the centre it be place visit in my past life to talk about data drive success story be sure that it be no coincidence that for the past year the estonian digital transformation have be lead by liberal government from our estonian sister party after the fall of communism in the late estonia embark on an ambitious programme know as the tiger leap to expand internet access and computer literacy the first step in embed the digital environment into all level of the citizen and government experience their government proudly say that their cabinet which streamline the decision make process bring the average length of an estonian cabinet meeting down from five hour to minute an appealing prospect to those on the treasury bench be sure estonian citizen can access of their public service online at any time the estonians have transform their healthcare system with the health and prescription initiative which free up gp time by allow prescription refill to be deal with online and ensure fast and simple access to key medical information during emergency although all digital service be desirable we should never freeze out those who be not digital savvy give that over million people in this country do not own mobile phone for example do the hon member agree the hon member make an excellent point for which be grateful will address it in moment if may road describe as the backbone of estonia be secure datum exchange platform that allow smooth and seamless use of datum between organisation it carry out billion transaction every year and be estimate to save estonians year worth of work per annum the platform have be describe as have radical anti silo agenda my experience so far of the structure of parliament and government have convince that we would all benefit from heavy dose of radical anti siloism that data transformation save the government money and the public like it saving worth up to of estonian gdp have be make thank to that efficient datum environment saving that if replicate in the uk would easily fill the chancellor budgetary black hole for of the service survey of citizen or more say they have make use public service easy call on the government to be bold ambitious and above all citizen focus in such design and delivery visit estonia last year and speak to our ambassador there we be now on our third agreement between the uk and estonia on government service and digital collaboration that be underutilise by the previous uk government it would be great to see the minister and his colleague step up the work with estonia and bring that sort of work here give that those agreement be in place this be absolutely not pitch to be member of the bill committee but would certainly be grateful for the opportunity to implement my view in the design and delivery of britain very own tiger leap into the data drive revolution estonia be crystal clear example prove that the result of such transformation be not just the preserve of tech geek category into which place myself but provide tangible benefit for individual and not just by make they use digital stuff at the front end which the hon member for windsor jack rankin will be glad to hear think about the lady in her whose openreach engineer understandably refuse her fibre upgrade because the local council have not share with they the fact that she use telecare device also think of the farmer who be baffle by the system use to issue flood recovery payment because the data be not transparent do my hon friend agree that the key to extract value from dataset be datum retrievability absolutely there be so many layer upon which datum governance data infrastructure and data practice must be establish and data retrievability be one of the thing that sit between those layer and the application or interface that use they understand that one reason why estonia have sophisticated tech and ai capability and great many protection in how it manage that datum be that it face threat from russia and be keen to ensure that its digital integrity be retain be glad that we do not face quite the same threat in this country but we can learn lesson from estonia and be glad that the hon gentleman have raise that do not doubt that that be an enable factor but one reason why be citizen focus work so well be that it be much easy to build trust and credibility bit by bit by tell people why do something differently will be well for they in that way we do not end up in the horrendous situation of face yet another billion abortive it project that can not quite establish public trust and collapse again draw attention to the success of some of our european neighbour to go back to example that be not just about the interface but about the underlie enable tech an exasperate constituent contact to tell how the department for work and pensions have refuse to email he he have ask it to send he detail of his conversation with it by email rather than by letter to try to save the government money and he be tell that it have to post this to he by letter because that be how the system work harness the power of datum must not however come at the cost of our right or civil liberty be very concerned about some aspect of the bill that have be touch on by other hon member such as the reduce accountability mechanism for law enforcement when handle datum potential watering down of our gdpr right and give more scope for automated decision making without human oversight although have be partially reassure by some of the comment from the minister for which be grateful be also concerned that along with the provision in the bill for create digital id system there be no equal right to non digital id not only do this create concern about datum freedom but in area such as north norfolk where digital exclusion be high than in many other area be worried about how many of my old resident will feel comfortable or confident use any digital system their right must be preserve and their experience and fear give equal worth the bill seek to tackle difficult but very important subject it be right that the government venture into datum transformation to deliver for all our constituent and make their experience as citizen interact with the government far well than be currently the case guess my reservation be about who it be write and work for and why be try to make sure that this bill be build not around convenience for the administration but around genuinely citizen centre design principle the bill tackle issue such as datum handling but would like it to start to set out vision for data drive society be bit disappointed in that as it stand it could be more ambitious and innovative in this regard and seek to carve we out as datum pioneer among our international peer hope the government can see the evidence from successful data drive society and be confident they do hope they hear the frustration of citizen at their experience and think they currently do hope they will make this bill one that can be laud by future generation as the launchpad that transform our society it be an honour to follow that great contribution from the hon member for north norfolk steff aquarone much of which will echo like he before be elect to this place work lot with datum understand it use it deploy it in tech company academia and then politic be huge supporter of the secretary of state and the minister agenda and broadly of the enormous potential for datum and data drive tool such as ai and machine learning because they can drive productivity growth boost earning and crucially save constituent time and money whether it be register the birth of child kid go through school access gp or enter the workplace would like to underscore few aspect of the bill that have not be speak much about but would also like to make wide argument about the importance of this agenda and about go far in some area in the year to come particularly in the connection between datum and risk so madam deputy speaker hope you will forgive slight and quick diversion the word datum have its root in the word for fact but in the world of machine learning and ai it mean something broad the information we choose to record about our world to analyse and use to make decision datum begin as demographic information because state that want to build an army or fight war want to know what kind of people comprise its populace now we collect datum about driving sleep and click online to help we navigate or get fitter but also to push we mindless advertising what datum we collect depend on what we want to use datum for and that require constant judgment about risk where we be willing to take risk how much risk and what kind of risk in many way we have become society and country too averse to risk to failure we create new regulator and give they enormous discretion because we want to minimise risk we create new tsar for this that and the other and give they broad power because we want to minimise risk the effect be that we avoid failure on small thing but we also lose the opportunity to maximise our output and our success because success require risk and datum often force we to make clear and confident judgment about risk the topic of this bill be an opportunity to begin to shift our culture in our economy and crucially in our state too but also for politician like we in this house to be clear about where we welcome and embrace risk and where we do not and to take responsibility as elect member for failure will focus on two area in this bill where believe datum be force to the surface different appetite for and judgment about risk healthcare and social medium briefly will say something about copyright which have be well cover in powerful contribution by other be pleased that the secretary of state say that he be look at this area in the ai consultation and look forward to hear more about the detail of that consultation and what come from it we should be optimistic it be possible to do what other have argue for and place our creative industry on secure and stable footing while also ensure that ai be unlocked in this country hope that the secretary of state will hear the powerful contribution of my colleague today the two example will focus on be those that matter to many of the work people in my constituency of makerfield as the secretary of state say datum be at the heart of how this government must break through barrier and inertia to deliver for work people that be why be so glad that this bill be not about killer robot or space age ai but be focus on the transformation of government and service that impact my constituent every day the first example be healthcare and this be an area where we should embrace more risk systematise the collection and recording of datum in healthcare unlock the possibility of use datum to spot pattern of contact people ahead of time instead of fin they if they miss their appointment as they do in my borough of wigan and of save people time that they do not have to unleash the full potential of datum in healthcare we need to be confident about build population level dataset control and own by the public anonymise through tool such as encryption and then use those dataset not just for academic research but to improve service and delivery this bill take initial step in that direction which welcome in greater manchester my constituent benefit already from share patient care record between primary and secondary care and data science platform that bring in datum across local hospital patient already feel the benefit of that every day in healthcare we can go far and fast we must be cautious about inadvertently slip into risk aversion caution and stagnation particularly in relation to concern about privacy for much of the past year and the period have be involve in this debate debate about datum have be dominate by concern about privacy but whose interest do the privacy lobby serve often think tank and ngos fight in the name of work people to stop datum be use to do thing that work people want do there be lot of good evidence that the public be relax about population level anonymise datum be use to save they time and money and improve the service they use especially in healthcare do the elderly woman see in my constituency surgery last week who have be struggle to see her gp for week now care if her datum sit in an anonymised database and be use to unlock more facetime for her gp to see patient and to make it fast for she to get an appointment do not think she do therefore welcome the change in this bill to the eu sprawl gdpr framework if one of brexit much fame opportunity be to lead the way in diffuse the collection and use of datum we should embrace it wholeheartedly subject to the data adequacy requirement more generally in healthcare we must ensure that we do not inadvertently build barrier that block the collection and use of datum control by those accountable to the public for the public good where datum can drive well outcome and improve experience the second case will consider be social medium social medium collect datum about our unthinking scroll to build highly optimise engagement algorithm that rake in advertising revenue that contribute little to growth national security or indeed the welfare of humanity the digital verification market that this bill create will be vital digital age verification be central to protect our child especially once the online safety act be in force want my young kid to grow up in country that protect they from harmful content such as sexualise violence and from spend hour mindlessly scroll through content waste their time and corrode their mind also welcome the bill provision to allow researcher to access online safety datum hold by technology company and hope that we will continue to deepen those provision this be one area where actually think we should be more worried about risk rare exception to my general view that we have become too risk averse because it be about the mind and character of our citizen and the strength of our democracy at present the information environment of our nation be be pollute sometimes deliberately and often by foreign adversary government communicate with citizen and citizen with each other in space design to drive they apart as we have see in past month know what be circulate online and how be in the public interest hope that the bill be just the beginning of our government use every possible lever to rebuild the fabric of trust in government politic and each other in this new digital environment historically state collect datum to wage war and raise taxis this government should harness datum to put money in the pocket of work people to make public service more efficient and easy to access and crucially to rebuild our public realm and restore trust in our great democracy be grateful to have the opportunity to contribute to the debate which have really enjoy listen to particularly enjoy the contribution of the hon member for scarborough and whitby alison hume who talk about writer and story her discussion remind of the book be read with my son andy griffiths and terry denton the storey treehouse where they have just build book make machine and have go off to enjoy themselves while the book be write do not quite know how the story will end yet that remind we of the balance between the benefit that innovation such as ai can bring and the challenge as the hon member say of ensure that people be fairly remunerated for their effort whether they be on build the machine or write the story will direct my remark to two particular area of the bill first clause deal with what it refer to as purport intimate image otherwise refer to as deepfake pornography image there be image of all hon member and majority of our constituent online fully clothe at least hope so but individual can take those innocent image of we or our constituent and use computer software to insert they into another image generate image that appear to show an individual in an intimate state undressed or engage in sexual activity why do they do that for their own sexual gratification to share with other perhaps for money or to humiliate threaten or control the individual in the image or their loved one that have devastating effect on people life no hon member will be surprised to hear that of victim of that evil crime be woman it be important to recognise the work of baroness owen of alderley edge she introduce private member bill in this area last december it be unfortunate that the government choose not to support her legislation at that time but be grateful that they have draft this clause of the bill which have the same effect it be baroness owen tenacity and explanation that persuade the government to ensure that the threshold be consent rather than the victim need to prove intent in the use of image she persuade they to increase the penalty to include imprisonment reflect the severity of the crime she also persuade they of the need to amend the sentencing act to end the somewhat farcical situation in which an individual will be prosecute for create an image and at the end of the court case have that same image hand back to they as part of their property the government give the baroness one further undertaking sometimes image be not discover immediately after they be take or if group of image be find on someone computer it may take while to identify the victim in such case six month timeout loophole can cause individual to get away with these hideous crime the government undertake to amend section of the magistrates courts act which limit jurisdiction to within six month of crime to ensure that people catch for crime after six month have elapse or whose prosecution take place after six month have elapse can still be hold to justice and account ask the minister to explain why can not find that in the bill it may be there and just can not find it if he could clarify that point would be grateful the other point want to raise be accuracy we have talk lot about datum but data be useful only if it be accurate we will all have hear the story of baby lilah beautiful baby girl bear in sutton in ashfield who be register as male by accident it be not very easy to have side note in digital datum how do we ensure that datum be accurate three clause in the bill may help we with that clause say that information must be accurate clause and suggest that the secretary of state must check list organisation for datum reliability and clause require the secretary of state to produce data dictionary to ensure that we know the definition of all the data point the secretary state speak about the huge opportunity that datum offer the nhs refer member to my entry in the register of members financial interests as be consultant paediatrician other have talk about the huge opportunity that ai and datum use and research can present to the nhs but there be also risk how do the minister intend to define sex the labour cabinet and the prime minister have repeatedly struggle to define what be woman leave that to secondary legislation consider in small committee be not sufficient scrutiny for such an important matter early in the debate the secretary of state refer to the power that the bill give the secretary of state under secondary legislation and why thing be not include in the bill itself this issue should be give more scrutiny than that of an si committee it be important to protect woman woman sport woman privacy and woman single sex space it be important for intimate care many people want to receive intimate care particularly domiciliary care by somebody of the same sex how will they know if the data be not available datum be also important to protect those with trans identity many blood reference range be different for male and female haemoglobin vary from laboratory to laboratory but be roughly to in male and to in female if data be not complete or accurate some individual may receive unnecessary investigation datum for screening and other health message be important we do not want male people call for cervical screening or man not to receive prostate information the hon lady be make some excellent point on sex and gender and the collection of datum she know that share her view on that it be incumbent on the minister and the secretary of state to ensure that datum be collect accord to sex however do she agree that the previous government put we in the situation that we be in it be certainly true that across the western world at the moment there seem to be some confusion on some of the basic of biology and humanity data be important for protect child too one data provider list in clause be the disclosure and barring service gb news report that there be prosecution between january and june of people on the sex offender register who do not inform police of datum change it be crucial that datum be accurate and up to date so will the secretary of state commit to the integrity of biological sex datum in the bill and in the government dataset last september the uk health security agency release datum on sexually transmit infection by sex and sexual orientation which be important because of the different epidemiological nature of infection in the different population however the footnote say that man be define in the datum as cisgender and transgender man and woman as cisgender and transgender woman that somewhat undermine the data integrity and the purpose of split the datum in the first place datum that be wrong unhelpful mislead or misuse by malicious actor can be dangerous many be concerned how do the minister plan to define sex and what be his plan for incongruous datum in the debate in the upper house it be report that people have change their sex datum in their passport and have change it with the driver and vehicle licensing agency on their driving licence it be say in the house of lords debate that up to people may have incongruous official dataset between item such as passport and drive licence how do the minister intend to resolve that if we be to have one large dataset for each person finally clause set out that person may need to pay fee in respect of disclosure will we expect people to pay for their own datum and if so how much know labour be very keen on increase taxis but can the minister guarantee that the cost will never outweigh the admin cost of produce the datum it be pleasure to follow my medical colleague the hon member for sleaford and north hykeham dr johnson in this debate this be wide range bill but would like to talk this afternoon about the role of datum access in healthcare and what think be transformative proposal for the patient passport nhs it and case record be chaotic know about this chaos from my own clinic where spend or waste too much time look at pdf reader we also have dictaphone and we even still have fax machine half the consultation can easily be spend open up website and computer program for all sort of different thing the standard of information keep by different hospital vary quite widely and it interoperability be often very poor so that if transfer patient from one hospital where work to another hospital where work the other people in the hospital can not easily work out what be go on with the patient sometimes we be unable to treat the patient because we be unable to access their medical record imagine an elderly lady lie on trolley in hospital corridor at in the morning unable to give full account of her medical history if we can not access her file how will we well treat she that be not an imaginary situation it be an actual situation that be probably happen in our hospital today therefore welcome the measure in the bill that will standardise information and improve the flow of datum between hospital actually be pleased that west suffolk hospital in my constituency have very good it standard and hope the bill will allow more hospital around the country to follow its example however urge the government to look far when consider reform to medical datum here be what think may be transformative proposal we should give ownership of the medical record directly to the patient let we make the clinician ask the patient to see the record and not the other way around nine out of britons want well access to their medical record and we should simply listen to they let we create patient passport that have all the patient medical datum on it it would be transformative people organise their life on their phone so let we put the passport there we could just expand the nhs app to become digital front door for the health service people be happy to bank on their phone send email on their phone and book flight on their phone my mother in law be not well the minister mother in law might not be do not think it be such leap of the imagination to let everybody access their medical information in this way as we hear from the hon member for north norfolk steff aquarone who have go for cup of tea other country such as estonia do this urge we to think carefully one record one patient it would simplify so much of our healthcare and this bill be the opportunity to do it be hearten to hear that my right hon friend the health secretary support such proposal it will be the future of healthcare so let we simply make it happen stand in support of the objective and aim of the bill have work with datum and technology for more than year wholeheartedly support the ethical responsible and equitable use of technology and datum to benefit and make easy the life of the people of the uk and to increase the efficiency of service delivery in the public sector also pay tribute to campaign group include big brother watch and justice for their work to protect the vital privacy and datum protection right of people in the uk want to share some concern have on the bill focus on two area clause and clause urge the government to take note and amend the bill to ensure that the british public privacy right and right to equality and non discrimination be not compromise clause will weaken protection around personal datum processing thereby reduce the scope of the datum that be protect by safeguard in data protection law be particularly concerned about the executive power to determine recognise legitimate interest which will allow for more datum to be process with few safeguard than be currently permit and reduce exist protection that ensure the lawful use of datum be also concerned about the increase power of the secretary of state to amend the definition of recognise legitimate interest through secondary legislation without appropriate parliamentary scrutiny currently automated decision making be broadly prohibit with specific exemption clause will permit it in all but limited set of circumstance that will strip the public of the right not to be subject to solely automate decision which risk exacerbate the likely possibility of unfair opaque and discriminatory outcome from adm system limit individual right to challenge adm permit adm use in law enforcement and intelligence with significant carve out in relation to the exist safeguard and give the secretary of state executive control over the adm regulatory framework through secondary legislation they may not be direct example but horizon and the many department for work and pensions scandal show the failing and risk of rely solely on automation and ai the bill introduce new regime for digital verification service it set out series of rule govern the future use and oversight of digital identity as part of the government road map towards digital identity verification the framework currently lack important safeguard and human right principle that prevent the broad sharing of the public identity datum beyond its original purpose far the bill miss the opportunity to take positive inclusive step to codify right for member of the public to use non digital id where reasonably practicable such right be vital to protect privacy and equality in the digital age the right to use non digital id where practicable would protect accessibility inclusion and people choice in how they choose to verify their identity when access public and private service legally protect the million of people who can not or do not want to hand over personal identity datum online where an alternative be reasonably practicable return to automated decision making it be clearly insufficient to move the burden of safeguard from the data controller who be currently responsible for prevent harm to the individual to complain if the adm be unfair since people may not complain due to lack of knowledge or confidence intimidation and various intersecting vulnerability understand the point the hon gentleman be make but do he not accept that the bill very clearly explain that in case where any automated decision be take there would have to be the right to proper explanation of the decision which would probably address lot of his concern and that there must always be right for an individual to make representation about the decision and obtain human intervention if that be what they want welcome the limited protection in the bill but know from experience that many application for benefit especially disability benefit and personal independence payment that be process through automate system be refuse and the applicant have to go through complicated and laborious appeal process in order to overturn those automate decision clause introduce significant change to the lawful basis for process personal datum while the aim of those change be to streamline data processing for legitimate interest they also present challenge relate to privacy protection parliamentary oversight and the potential for misuse it be essential to balance the facilitation of legitimate datum processing with the safeguarding of individual right and freedom although the bill be intend to modernise datum protection law the propose change to automate decision make right in clause raise significant concern the potential erosion of individual protection increase power imbalance reduced transparency and the risk of discrimination highlight the need for more balanced approach that safeguard individual right while accommodate technological advance while welcome the positive element of the bill urge the government to ensure that it do not deliver the propose benefit along with diminished human right and right to privacy increase discrimination and other unintended harm to individual the wide public minority artist and creative public service or our country as whole welcome the bill give its potential to boost the economy by billion it be huge win for so many sector and brilliant example of the difference that this labour government can make technological innovation will improve efficiency and reduce unnecessary administration allow our key worker to focus more on the thing that matter most police officer and nhs worker for example protect we and save life and in free up million hour of police time and nhs staff hour every year by cut out excess administration work the bill will help they to do that how many police officer equivalent could we make from million hour of additional work it be incredible our nhs have be break by the conservative party that require funding to fix which be why in the budget this government rightly pledge an additional billion in resource spending for our health service however it also need reform and have be pleased to hear that message clearly understand and prioritise by the government through bills such as this at present each part of the system find it difficult to communicate with the other partly because of issue relate to datum sharing which put more strain on patient and more strain on our nhs staff the bill would change that medical record would be share between health professional which would mean quick diagnosis and treatment and those record would be subject to strict security protocol only the most relevant staff would have access to non anonymise patient datum these change be hugely important and can not come soon enough in north west cambridgeshire the improve datum access in the bill will allow for great connectivity between all the health service that my constituent use whether they have an appointment at peterborough city hospital at hinchingbrooke hospital or far afield and whether their gp surgery be at old fletton lakeside botolph bridge or beyond the bill will ensure that their healthcare professional have all the information they need to do their job quickly and effectively on our street people be rightly concerned about crime police be stretch to the limit and strip to the bone under the last government and the percentage of people see officer on the beat have drop by two third over the past year we be give police their time back by reduce the administration burden and allow they to do their actual job protect the public and make our community safe as someone from science background be particularly interested in the bill reform to datum access for researcher this have huge potential to help scientist to conduct more impactful research and drive critical innovation in everything from pharmaceutical to manufacturing technology and more and the benefit that that could bring to our economy be enormous when work in the research space could see significant problem with datum sharing and access so know that this bill will make real difference colleague in the university sector have give their feedback on the bill emphasise that provide researcher with secure access to government datum be crucial for research that drive economic growth productivity and inclusivity link academic and government datum enable well research take my field of pathology critical work be go on to understand the genetic cause of disease so that we can develop new treatment we need huge dataset for that and it make complete sense for the government to work with partner to provide they in response to the hon member for dewsbury and batley iqbal mohamed lot of our scientist particularly those work in genetic rely on dataset from other country particularly nordic country which have know about this issue for quite long time and have make lot of datum available to researcher we need enormous dataset to be able to do the necessary analysis particularly around drug development there be lot of inclusivity problem because particular ethnic group be lack from the country on which we be dependent for the datum for example there be often not enough information about how particular drug affect black people in order to deal with that we need the datum to be available so that we can look at the genetic if we get too catch up in not allow anonymised datum to be share with researcher for that purpose it will really harm inclusivity it will not help at all it be worth make those point university colleague have highlight the new national data library spearhead by the department if design effectively it have the potential to facilitate research from the outset and to help drive improvement in public service for the benefit of all uk citizen hope the government will make sure that we get university and private sector research partner around the table when we set up the library to make sure that it will work for they and their need this bill will allow researcher to seek broad consent for area of scientific research while ensure high standard of datum protection notably personal datum will be able to be use for research purpose only if it be process in manner that do not permit the identification of the data subject that go back to the point make by my hon friend the member for makerfield josh simons we talk about risk to privacy and personal right but this be anonymised datum usually at very large scale no one be look at individual record in my field we look at thousand and thousand of genome at the same time to identify association between certain area of genetic and disease this bill pose no risk to patient and we do people disservice if we engage in scaremongere so be glad that member have not do that the bill will give scientist more tool for innovation and discovery and people can be reassure that their data be safe and their privacy respect the quantity of datum that we need to draw strong conclusion in research be huge which have historically be barrier be really pleased that the government have publish page impact assessment with this bill welcome the particular emphasis on trust but we need to make sure that we get the comms right particularly around protect privacy and ensure that what we have say in this house become more widely know by the public the bill make important clarification about the use of ai in decision making we know that this be the direction in which lot of organisation be move and there be lot of potential but strong safeguard be essential so be pleased to see the bill place serious emphasis on put they in place wales creative industry be cornerstone of our culture and economy it generate billion in the last financial of our gdp and much of that success rely on strong copyright protection creative must be pay when their work be use include for ai training too often creative datum be be scrap without permission undermine livelihood do the hon member agree that clause and to of this bill be vital step in safeguard our creative industry the hon lady make her point well and we have already hear from the minister about the rationale behind those clause there be real issue with put such measure through in secondary legislation because this house should have more ability to scrutinise they we know there be consultation at the moment and we have hear from the secretary of state that he be very open to have conversation on this issue and make sure that we address it be sure we all agree that we need to do that properly on safeguard the bill make it very clear that where an organisation make automate decision an individual have the right to proper explanation of those decision and the right to make representation about the decision take to obtain human intervention and to contest the automated decision those be really robust safeguard but they be key provision that must be show to work in practice we can not enter situation in which automate decision be make wrongly with no recourse strongly support the bill and these safeguard but note that the british medical association have raise concern around clause and clause would be grateful for the minister response to those concern around dilute protection for health datum hold by non public body be sure that he have response and it would be good to hear it to wrap up the innovative use of datum follow strict guideline and datum protection rule will massively improve the efficiency of public service and grow our economy it be right that the government take this route the uk should be lead the way in innovative technology and fully utilise technological development to improve people life and believe that this bill will do that call the shadow minister as self profess datum the minister look quite surprised at that well be now self profess myself as data geek and it be real pleasure to wind up this important debate on behalf of the official opposition as the original architect of the bill the opposition welcome the fact that the government have recognise the potential of these conservative lead policy to make people life easy by be able to prove identity quickly when deal with statutory agency and service provider to streamline and enhance public service delivery such as by harmonise the information available to healthcare professional across nhs setting and to boost economic growth through the innovative use of smart datum in short this bill will bring into effect the previous government ambition to harness and exploit datum as the currency of the digital age the staggering pace of recent technological advance present not only enormous opportunity but challenge that demand further scrutiny early the shadow secretary of state my hon friend the member for havant alan mak rightly point out some of the area where the government approach to the science and technology sector conflict with the outcome that they want we have have an extensive debate today with hon member cover range of topic some of which shall refer to shortly perhaps it be ironically apt that the data use and access bill have have so many iteration and this recursive second reading but must pay tribute to those who have be work before we to get it to the state it be in today much of the bill be technical and uncontroversial but some of it still need to be thrash out and debate and look forward to take it through in committee would like at this point to pay tribute to lord markham and viscount camrose be particularly pleased to hear the government response with regard to security around the underground asset register also pay tribute to my right hon friend the member for maldon sir john whittingdale who be sure be glad that he be not do another second read speech and hopefully not take the bill through committee for this side and of course to baroness owen for the incredible work that she have do the tribute pay to she by my hon friend the member for huntingdon ben obese jecty be far well than anything could put together from this dispatch box and thank he for his comment by my count we have have or back bench speaker and would like to draw particular attention to the intervention from my right hon and learn friend the member for kenilworth and southam sir jeremy wright who point out the wrangling that take place in the house of lords regard datum that be use for scientific purpose be sure that the definition of public interest will be discuss in further detail in committee also particularly like the speech from the hon member for dewsbury and batley iqbal mohamed as have say much of this bill this big tome be in some way uncontroversial many member focus on few specific area but be interested that he look at the whole scope of the bill particularly around the civil liberty component and the gdpr issue which be what much of the core of the bill be about there be few point would like to focus on start with data accuracy my hon friend the member for sleaford and north hykeham dr johnson who be not in her place remark that to empower the public and business to take full advantage of the speed and simplicity offer by digital verification service there must be high degree of confidence in the accuracy of the datum provide by public authority in the other place the minister acknowledge this concern state that as far as the datum underpin digital identity be concern we must have single version of the report house of lords january vol however he do not support the amendment seek to guarantee the accuracy of datum hold by public authority for the purpose of digital verification service and nor do the secretary of state in his opening remark today while the reliability of the datum that support digital identity be fundamentally important across the board an area of particular importance be the accurate recording of biological sex this be vital for ensure that service such as medical care be deliver properly and to protect female only space biased datum be bad than no data and wrong datum be bad of all we call on the government to ensure that datum be robust and accurate as matter of priority we must ensure the digital infrastructure be in place to support the bill aim we welcome the inclusion of provision for nhs datum sharing and should declare an interest as former doctor whose wife be doctor have speak many time of the importance of datum sharing we focus on ai but we need to get the basic right nhs datum sharing if implement effectively will enable the fast and seamless transfer of patient datum between healthcare setting it will lead to well clinical decision making and improve outcome for patient and the hon member for bury st edmunds and stowmarket peter prinsley will be able to see his patient more efficiently and more effectively pay tribute to the strength of his argument and hope he take the mantle have when my party be in government of push for this to happen as quickly as possible to harness those benefit the government have acknowledge that healthcare setting it system will need to meet common standard to facilitate datum sharing across platform the previous government set out bold plan for upgrade the nation digital infrastructure this government must continue and expedite that work to ensure the nhs have the tool it need to implement the bill reform finally on the important subject of ai and copyright the powerful debate both in the other place and here highlight the challenge the complexity and the importance of make sure we get this right particularly on the government proposal for data mining opt out as mention in the consultation many member have raise that point include my right hon friend the member for maldon and the hon member for scarborough and whitby alison hume for stirling and strathallan chris kane for perth and kinross shire pete wishart for bury north mr frith for knowsley anneliese midgley and for cheltenham max wilkinson we can not hold back the tide of change that ai have bring with it nor can we put the genie back in the bottle but we must do everything in our power to protect and promote our creative industry so that they can continue to thrive and grow as they do with the support put in place by the previous government during the pandemic the government consultation on ai and copyright remain under way my hon friend the shadow secretary of state speak about the overwhelming need for the government to respond to the consultation as soon as possible the government must engage constructively with the industry and the official opposition to identify solution that turbocharge our develop ai industry while protect and boost the growth of our creative sector all of we both those who work in the creative sector and those who benefit from it understand just how important it be for our national identity live music be one of my passion it be the thing miss most during the pandemic the idea that we could end up cause harm to our creative industry fill with horror the opposition want to make sure we get this right not only for those whose livelihood depend on the industry but for all of we this be complicated and difficult if it be not there would already be an answer the europeans would have an answer this be difficult situation that we need to get through as the hon gentleman say it be vital that we support our creative industry will he clarify the conservatives stance on opt in versus opt out which be the current proposal our position be pretty much exactly as have just set out in my speech government consultation be under way that present four option include the government prefer opt out option there be challenge with that opt out approach as well as with whole range of different approach as have previously say from the opposition dispatch box whatever we do we must think about how that co ordinate with what can happen in other jurisdiction it be complicated issue and we need to ensure we get the legislation absolutely right as say we need response to the consultation as soon as possible so that we can chew through this far to find the good solution in his sum up hope the minister will update the house on that the creative industry have be very clear about their position the shadow minister say that he wish to support the creative industry and that that be the position of his party but would it be too much to suggest he might go step far and say that he support the opt in position which be the position support by the creative industry that would give they reassurance that there be support from all part of the house for the position they be take the shadow dsit team include our shadow secretary of state have meet representative of industry in general have meet representative of the creative industry and be fairly sure the shadow secretary of state have too that be what the consultation be there for it would not be appropriate to make unilateral declaration from the dispatch box when live consultation be look into that complicated area that would be not be reasonable opposition or good for anybody there be no easy answer to some of the challenge but we should not shy away from they give the clear gain for the public and the economy that many of the reform set out in the bill will deliver his majesty official opposition and the shadow dsit team stand ready to work with the government wherever possible to find solution on these press issue effective engagement between government and opposition will promote confidence among tech company and would be investor that the uk be open for business the last government vision be to harness the uk competitive advantage in tech industry to boost our economy and revolutionise the way we live for the benefit of our population we remain committed to that goal in opposition call the minister be dsit minister today but the debate feel remarkably like the creative industry debate couple of week ago when be respond as the minister for creative industries arts and tourism will get on to some of the point about ai and copyright later so if anybody want to intervene on they can wait for that bit will start with some of the point hon member have make the measure on the nhs and datum be among the most positive in the bill and be welcome by everybody today it be not in the previous version of the bill it be one of our report february vol correction the other day colleague be tell about her local hospital and be strike by the fact that it employ people simply to carry around physical medical record we have put our back into change that that be not good way to preserve record or to ensure they be secure and not get lose let alone anything else my hon friend the member for bury st edmunds and stowmarket peter prinsley be absolutely right when he talk about patient passport we need to turn the issue on its head so that people have access to their datum and can participate in and make well decision about their own healthcare as say to my hon friend yesterday that be similar to the change that happen few year ago after an appointment consultant use to write to gp about the patient in doctor gobbledegook but now many of they write to the patient in plain english copy in the gp that be the kind of change we need to see be very hopeful about the change that will be introduce by the bill as my hon friend the member for north west cambridgeshire sam carling say they will make dramatic difference we need to ensure the interoperability of all the it system use across the whole of the nhs would like to extend that beyond england and wales would not mind if we could manage to do the same for scotland and northern ireland but fear that even my friend the hon member for perth and kinross shire pete wishart who like sometimes would baulk little at united kingdom wide approach to such matter be also excited about the element of the bill on smart datum which have barely have look in in today debate but which could be transformative in many sector many of we will know that when we use our banking app we be enable to go not just to our bank but to our insurance include our car insurance and all those thing can be relate to one another in secure way that be because of the smart datum system that have be in existence for the last few year we need to roll that out in many other sector and that be precisely what the bill allow for instance in the gig economy it will mean that uber driver and those deliver for deliveroo will have well understanding of whether they be actually earn living from each delivery thirdly nobody have refer to the reform of the information commissioner office it be an important part of the bill there have be brief mention of the register of birth and death which basically bring the modern world to the register office as former vicar suppose be more interested in that than most as have hatch and dispatch quite few in my time will my hon friend give way on birth and death of course thank the minister for his excellent comment want to point out that welcome the strengthening of the information commissioner role hurrah incidentally the right hon member for maldon sir john whittingdale refer to john edwards who in my experience be very capable leader of the team there be sure my hon friend and her select committee will have he in for evidence soon couple of member refer to datum adequacy include the hon member for harpenden and berkhamsted victoria collins that be obviously important to we as the right hon member for maldon say the secretary of state have be work keenly with the european commission unfortunately the previous government end up with data adequacy agreement with the eu that expire later on this year that mean that our time be tight to make sure we maintain that that be absolutely vital to our economic success as country and for that matter for the rest of the eu know that everybody want to get there it be not for we to tell the eu what process it should go through but we have have very constructive conversation so far they will not want to comment on bill that be still in flight so the soon we can get it on to the statute book the well my hon friend the member for knowsley anneliese midgley refer to music remuneration for the issue of remuneration of musician be not just about the ai copyright debate there be many other issue do not think we have finish with the issue of streaming incidentally have successful meeting with the record label lot of musician and the musicians union on monday afternoon have give they clear timetable for come back with well offer to make sure that musician be properly remunerate quite famous tenor who will not name texte yesterday to say musician all feel that they have be sooooooo rip off by streaming that be so with seven do not know what hansard will do with that use to get two or three concert fee as advance royalty for cd now it be effectively zero it be theft really those remark have be repeat in different context today we be work on that and be determined that we will have proper look at how we properly remunerate our musician in this country even if it be only to make sure that the shadow minister who declare that live music be one of the most important thing in his life have people to go and listen to the hon member for north norfolk steff aquarone who have just come back into the chamber make very good speech about digital government all the point that he make be one that we be determined to take up several members refer to estonia tallinn incidentally be one of the good city in europe to visit but we also need to make sure that there be digital inclusion element to that if of poor home in the uk have no access to the internet they will not have any access to government digital service either we need to transform all that and the secretary of state and will probably have something to say about that in the near future the right hon member for maldon note one other labour change on subject access request we would argue that one of the problem with the previous bill be that it would have make it more difficult for people to get subject access request information that be why we have system where we think we have strengthen those right and that we think be well for the average person in the street the hon member for huntingdon ben obese jecty refer to baroness owen amendment we be not quite sure that these be right we want to ensure that we have workable solution that everybody agree with by the time we finish in committee be not sure whether he will be serve on the committee but perhaps that be debate we will have look forward to that we be very open to see how we can make sure that all the be in the right place and all the be correctly cross not dot the hon member for sleaford and north hykeham dr johnson make some important point although have to say that disagree with she she may not be entirely surprise by that in relation to the amendment bring forward by lord lucas public authority must assess what information be require for particular purpose this govern whether and how sex or gender datum be process in give situation or give case they be bind by data protection legislation to ensure that the personal datum be accurate for this purpose where sex at birth be not an essential part of an identity check for instance when rent property organisation be not lawfully able to request this information think that be absolutely right for protect people privacy my hon friend will know that be one of the first labour mp to raise in the chamber the issue of sex aggregate datum can he assure that the government will ensure that datum on sex be accurate and reliable where necessary and will he expedite the publication of the sullivan review we have to make sure it be accurate to the precise process for which it be be use just as passport have to be accurate for the precise purpose for which it be be use be not sure whether my hon friend be intend to be on the committee as well indicate assent oh dear she be be not sure about have world class rugby player on the committee but it be one of the issue be very happy to debate with my hon friend we want to make sure we have get it right and that we manage to embrace everybody as much as we can rise oh dear have start something off be interested in the hon gentleman concept of for the purpose can he be clear that when he be write his dictionary of definition as per clause he will ensure that the definition be clear so that when people be look at information on sex they know whether they be deal with biological sex or some other definition that the minister may have come up with be go to call the amendment or whatever we have and say that will write to the hon lady on that we be get bit more technical than be able to answer precisely but my bottom line be that if somebody be apply to rent property the landlord should not have to know both sex at birth and gender that be an inappropriate invasion of people privacy should add that the hon lady also refer to people be able to change in change room and completely agree with her point about woman be able to change in protect space it just seem to we need to use great deal of common sense in this area the chair of the select committee my hon friend the member for newcastle upon tyne central and west chi onwurah refer to the national data library and open standard and open source again will have to write to she as she will know this area be move fast in relation to legislative and it idea so we will want to work with people include her select committee to make sure we reach the right set of decision turn to the hon member for harpenden and berkhamsted make mistake early and have to apologise to she when refer to automate decision making talk about meaningful human involvement that be indeed in the original bill introduce by the right hon member for maldon but think it be vital addition to the current framework which be why it be important be pleased that our new government have go far by commit to require the information commissioner office to do code of practice on automate decision making and ai to make sure this really work in the interest of everybody that will support the safe adoption and deployment of the technology the hon member for cheltenham max wilkinson quite rightly raise the case of his constituent ellen roome which we have discuss previously unfortunately be unable to speak in the debate he take part in because be speak in the main chamber at the time can tell he that coroner will be able to use data protection process under the bill and we hope that will be sufficient but be quite happy to discuss whether we can go far have discuss with several member the question of whether family should have access to their child social medium account there be obvious danger in that because of safeguard issue that might arise but think he understand that as well to clarify the jools law bill would simply require access to the social media account and datum of deceased child there be no risk to those child in those circumstance because they would already be dead that be the original point that be try to make and obviously do not make it as well as the hon member do so congratulate he on that the hon member for dewsbury and batley iqbal mohamed be bit critical of article but think that he be be bit unfair the requirement in subsection and and then later in and of the article be very clear about the circumstance and they be the only circumstance in which the secretary of state can bring forward change of the kind to which he refer hope that we will be able to please he if not appease he if that matter appear in committee or on report just want to finish with some comment on ai and ip not least because there have be so much focus on this area all of we on the front bench want to have data bill because we think that it be really important for our economy and for so many different aspect of the way that we deliver government service we also want debate about ai and copyright which be why we launch the consultation but it feel odd to be do bit of that in this bill let turn now to what the shadow secretary of state say early ask chatgpt what the view of the shadow secretary of state be on ai and copyright it reply regard his view on copyright there be no publicly available information indicate that he have express specific opinion on this matter well yes we hear that this afternoon do we hope the opposition manage to find some idea at some point this be very serious matter and it be one of the trickiest issue that any country have to face at this point think that it be tricky for our country than most other because we be the third large ai economy in the world and we be probably the second or at bad the third great ip country in the world we have creator in every single sphere some country specialise in one particular form of the creative industry but we manage to do all of they that be why be listen very attentively to the contribution from my hon friend the members for bury north mr frith and for stirling and strathallan chris kane and the hon member for perth and kinross shire and many other as well just want to focus on the thing on which there be some agreement think there be agreement across the house on the idea that transparency be an important part of what we need to ensure in this legislation and on the aim of control over intellectual property right and on possibly end strong version of right reservation for the creative industry can announce that we have set up two work group in the past week both of which have people from the creative industry and from the ai company in they one be specifically look at transparency and what that look like to be effective and proportionate and it will start work on that next report february vol correction secondly on the question of right reservation fully understand that people be sceptical about whether there be simple technical mean of everybody be about to assert their right will the minister give way will in moment if the hon member let finish this point know that people be sceptical because such means do not exist at the moment have say before that the system do not work it effectively mean that person be wipe from the internet and lot of people do not know how to use it it be far too technical if as my hon friend the member for bury north say there be system of simple digital fingerprinting where people could say no you can use my work or yes you can use my work for large language model training once you ve remunerate that would be great outcome for everybody because it would lead to new system of remuneration that could be do individually or for an artist it could be do through dac and for musician it could be do through their record label will the minister give way will in moment that be why be keen on not sell the pass on that possibility by have undermine it before we get there the minister be right there be not much difference between we now we be get to place where we be begin to agree about the way forward but we be deal with this bill which have clause that protect copyright and ensure transparency what think he be ask we to do be to set those concern aside for bill that might come in the future which may include the provision that we already have be that roughly correct characterisation of where we be go no it be not what be true be that as say we want to get to concrete idea of what transparency might look like not enough work have be do in the eu or in different territory in the united states of america for instance where different state have different arrangement and we need to do more about what that should look like in the uk as say if the creative industry and the ai company can do that together that could give we nugget of useful progress likewise if we can get to what be call fingerprint for want of well term know there be system of fingerprinting that would get we to the licensing of or and that would be significant do not want to sell the pass on that whole package by take too many step at this point but we will discuss this in committee and on report be conscious that have margate behind so give way it be not only margate east thanet have three cultural driver margate ramsgate and broadstairs all with phenomenal amount of cultural engine throughout the century many writer such as wilkie collins and jane austen be well out of copyright musician visual artist and writer often earn little money it be great to hear that we will have those work group they need to be confident that they will be pay by the machine as it be because otherwise they will end up even bad off than they be at the moment some of greeting card designer have lose their job because of this issue urge the hon gentleman to come to margate to hear what be be say by the creative industry here and be glad to hear that the secretary of state be also keen to meet those in the creative industry tracey emin and russell tovey have also invite to margate so think it be inevitable at some point we be try to get to win win and we do not believe that be unachievable which be why be keen on stick with the process of the consultation we will respond to the consultation as soon as we can although large number of people have respond and we want to take the response seriously whatever we choose to do in the end would have think that it will look like full stand alone bill that may include element of what baroness kidron have put in element from elsewhere or for that matter bit of the copyright directive such as article and which the former government help draft and then do not incorporate into uk law it might be whole series of different thing but it need to be consider in the round will my hon friend give way oh lord be sort of try to get to the end share my hon friend desire to get to the end and his faith in the ability of technology to deliver solution as say in an early intervention my science innovation and technology committee and the culture media and sport committee bring together technologist and creative with exactly that ambition be pleased to hear about the work group that he have put in place but urge he to be transparent about who be in they not necessary now but perhaps he will write to my committee so that we can see how they be progress in transparent way it be important that the technological solution be view as openly as possible yes we will be transparent about the transparency work group it be good point for that matter be happy as be any of the ministers to give evidence to my hon friend committee or to joint committee on those inquiry the minister be be extremely generous with his time and everybody else he talk about deepfake pornography the purport intimate image one undertaking that the government give baroness owen of alderley edge be that they would remove the prosecution limitation of six month from the offence be commit however have not see that in the bill do the government intend to table an amendment in committee or would they accept an opposition amendment at that stage will not accept an amendment that have not yet see but that be one issue that we be definitely already work on and we intend to address it in committee government amendment for committee must be table within fortnight from yesterday so that will all be happen fairly soon if the hon lady can bide her patience for while would be grateful we be work to get to resolution that everybody will be happy with will make few final point about ai and intellectual property several members speak about legislative change in that field completely agree that there will have to be legislation change and think it would be well if that be do in single stand alone bill that be why we launch the consultation my hon friend the member for mid derbyshire jonathan davies be absolutely right to say that we must get this right for this country creative people and our economy it be about both those thing together my hon friend the member for makerfield josh simons be absolutely right there might be win win solution that provide certainty clarity and remuneration for both ai and creative industry and that be what we be strive for my hon friend the member for scarborough and whitby alison hume be rather shy about her own success in life in she be name royal television society writer of the year for summerhill hon member hear hear she be absolutely right about three thing first that we should look after the right of creative and agree secondly that we should protect their income and agree and thirdly the importance of human being agree the shadow minister the hon member for runnymede and weybridge dr spencer with whom look forward to give the bill the proper scrutiny that the house expect in committee alongside our liberal democrat counterpart the hon member for harpenden and berkhamsted victoria collins say that he like live music do too the next gig be go to be kylie again be not stereotype at all last night go to the royal opera house to see festen the new opera by mark anthony turnage base on the movie and the play the shadow minister be right that absolutely nothing beat live music and we will do absolutely nothing to undermine it interestingly the libretto which be write by baroness kidron husband end with the word of dame julian of norwich

be grateful for the opportunity to bring forward this debate know that the labour government have inherit broken system of special educational need and disability provision break by year of tory under investment mismanagement and chaos even know this be shock by the number of amber valley parent and carer who have reach out to desperate for help they have be let down by national send system in measured decline and in derbyshire by county council demonstrate widespread systemic failing send provision throughout the country be in bad state but in derbyshire it be at crisis point this government be commit to break down barrier to opportunity where previous conservative governments fail we will succeed in rebuild our send system and ensure it be properly fund in derbyshire however we must go far derbyshire county council be fail our child that be the story have hear over and over from parent carer and educator in amber valley it be therefore no surprise to read of widespread and systemic failing in ofsted damn report on derbyshire county council send provision by the time ofsted publish its finding in november have already hear about those failing at first hand through countless email and surgery appointment want to get true picture of the scale of the issue conduct survey on send provision in amber valley the result speak for themselves with of respondent rat send provision in amber valley as poor and only say it be good some complain of long waiting time say that provision in mainstream school be insufficient and say that they have experience problem obtain an education health and care plan which be the first step in access support for their child commend the hon lady on bring this debate forward speak to she beforehand it be heartbreaking to hear what she be say about her constituency and understand that but the situation be replicate across this whole great united kingdom the number of member who be here to speak be an indication of how many want to voice their concern she be right to talk about those who be wait do she agree that early diagnosis and early intervention be all that really matter if we can get that do early we can save child it can give child future and an opportunity and it can take the pressure off the parent as well thank the hon member for his intervention on matter that know be close to his heart he be absolutely right the delay be real concern and diagnosis at an early stage be important but that be not what we be see in derbyshire that be the worry have read the ofsted report it be clear that the send operation in derbyshire county council be in complete chaos with what appear to be revolving door of senior officer unfilled post consultant and temporary position my constituent claire tell that the council be completely unresponsive and that point about nobody ever get back to people be recur theme do my hon friend agree that it be imperative that derbyshire county council get its act together and start respond to parent who be in such desperate need absolutely agree with my hon friend think that every derbyshire mp will testify to the same thing that phone be not answer and email go un respond to it be not sustainable for this to be the status quo so many people in amber valley want to talk to about their experience what be plan as small intimate roundtable event soon become large town hall meeting full of concerned parent each with story to tell from this clear picture emerge child and young people be be fail at every step in the process family be wait far too long for the education and health assessment to allow they to access the specialist help that they need as result many child be miss significant portion of their education with some fall out of school altogether that be all while derbyshire county council fail to communicate just as my hon friend say as my hon friend know represent the nearby constituency of rushcliffe in nottinghamshire where the average waiting time for neurodevelopmental assessment be week that be actually an improvement from year ago when it be week do my hon friend agree that lot of what she be describe be systemic as have be mention and that this government need to address it urgently absolutely agree with my hon friend the government need to grip this issue across the country unfortunately we understand his plight only too well in derbyshire parent and carer talk about barrier at every stage of the process and about how they be ignore by an unresponsive council big part of our challenge in fix the foundation of send provision be of course funding that make it all the more shocking to learn of the send budget leave unspent by derbyshire county council in debate in the chamber on april my hon friend the member for chesterfield mr perkins highlight that of million receive since only million have be spend that be nothing short of million unspent that money be specifically allocate to create new school place for child with special educational need and disability derbyshire county council claim that it could not rush the allocation of the fund but we be talk about six year child will have start and end their secondary school education in that time what it have manage to spend however be about half million pound on two consultant for strategic help on child service the family have speak to say that despite that they have see no improvement they say that have the council just engage with parent carer and educator they would have receive wealth of advice for free our child and their family be pay the price these child be miss education be label as disruptive and suffer from poor mental health while derbyshire county council be fail to create the new much need and fund send place my constituent chris spencer son be miss school chris tell that his son have be assess as need place in send special school but that none be available his son be miss out on vital education make friend and the support he need without school place chris be care full time for his son at home make it impossible for he to go to work he tell want job want to work but can derbyshire county council not only fail to supply chris son with promise school place but issue he with two fine for non attendance the first be withdraw by the council after intervene on chris behalf but the second go to court where the judge throw out the case it should not come to this for an mp and judge to have to intervene before anything be do be afraid that that story be just one of dozen angie hardy another constituent of mine after year of fighting on behalf of her three son each with send be still wait on an ehcp an annual review and the much need transport that have be promise as result one of her son have not be able to attend school since february yet another child miss out on education and the support they need to succeed many other parent talk about resort to legal challenge they have find tribunal and judicial review not only extremely stressful but with legal aid solicitor now so hard to come by another victim of tory austerity be afraid and one that the justice committee of which be member fully understand extremely costly that be common experience one mother tell that judge be award place now not the local authority have be support parent in derby north who currently face wait of more than year for their child send tribunal cause agony as they be leave in limbo we know that the historical lack of funding for local authority suitable school place and educational psychologist have contribute to the delay do my hon friend agree that the delay be yet another example of send system that as the education secretary say have be neglect to the point of crisis agree crisis word that have already use in this debate be what we be face right across the country be very concerned about that in derbyshire we face that very challenge as well as all the additional challenge of the systemic problem in the county council as high as the legal cost for family can be the emotional cost be still high all parent and carer want the good for their child and find it impossible not to feel for family who time and again talk about be exhaust from constantly fight for timely accurate diagnosis and care plan for the little provision that be available and even for the transport need to get their child to school many family be at break point they say that it should not be so hard and they be right the conservatives at derbyshire county council have acknowledge the failing and issue an apology that be necessary first step but it be far from sufficient it have be five month since ofsted uncover widespread and systemic failing although the council claim to be make improvement the pace of change be far too slow only two week ago fellow derbyshire labour mp and meet representative of the national association of headteachers the story that they tell mirror the frustration and heartache experience by the hundred of parent and carer who have reach out to we in desperation they tell we that they too face daily fight to be hear by derbyshire county council too often their email go unanswered they be make to jump through bureaucratic hoop to access the support that should be in place and the revolving door of leadership have lead to confusion and uncertainty while the leader and the plan might change we be tell say that there have be no tangible improvement ehcp which should be process within week long time for any parent to wait can take more than week as my hon friend the member for derby north catherine atkinson say that be practically year not only do educator not feel confident that their concern will be hear they fear petty reprisal more worrying still they say that the lack of funding be affect not only their most vulnerable pupil but all pupil as class size increase and teaching capacity can not keep up thank my hon friend for secure this incredibly important debate my constituency neighbour derbyshire and recently hold roundtable on send provision with parent and teacher from school and college the issue that repeatedly come up be funding and the disparity in funding not just between school but across local authority area do my hon friend agree that we need consistency of send provision across county line in order to provide good quality send provision for all our child agree that we need more consistency one of the concern in the ofsted report just for derbyshire be that there be no consistency because of the lack of clearly define joint strategy the support be describe by parent as postcode lottery we have that problem just within derbyshire itself teacher be work so hard for the child in their care but they still feel that they be fail they through no fault of their own school be rely on the good will of staff just to function due to insufficient funding stress and exhaustion we be lose amazing teacher who give their all every day that be the real life impact of widespread and systemic failing many family still feel helpless as their child be label disruptive and parent ability to be good parent and provide adequate care be call into question bad of all hear from parent of child some as young as who have become so desperate that they have consider take their own life these child should be thrive in stimulating learn environment enjoy make friend and develop their skill they should not feel so forgotten and lose that they tell their parent that they want to die as have say we be at crisis point in derbyshire we can not allow this situation to continue the child of derbyshire deserve well their family deserve well and we as labour mps demand well be grateful to the department for issue an improvement notice on january set out the requirement the secretary of state have place on derbyshire county council to ensure improvement this decisive action appear to have make the council jump to attention with its priority impact plan publish two week later however madam deputy speaker you can understand the scepticism of educator across derbyshire give that they have see it all before with no few than eight plan put in place since this time must be different if this conservative county council can not or will not make these improvement with the urgency they demand the voter can replace it with labour council that absolutely will my fellow labour derbyshire mp and have promise that as hard as teacher parent and carer have be fight we will fight too we be fight for real change real accountability and real commitment to provide the education and support that every child with special educational need and disability deserve that be our promise and it be one we intend to keep rise order you can all see that number of members wish to contribute this evening will just issue point of clarity the adjournment motion will have to be move again at pm so whoever be on their foot at that point should be aware that will interrupt they it would be courtesy to fellow member if you could all restrict your comment to five minute or so start by commend my hon friend the member for amber valley linsey farnsworth for secure this important debate and for her impassione plea on behalf of the child and family of derbyshire as dad know that parenting be at one and the same time the hard and most amazing experience we can have as society we must support family well in high peak derbyshire county council have be fail family on an industrial scale in every canvassing session and advice surgery conduct invariably meet family struggle to secure the right support for their child with special education need such be the scale of the challenge in derbyshire the family have meet in my constituency be frustrated exhausted and angry they feel they be face system that seem to be actively work against they rather than have their back as my hon friend say in her speech ofsted find that the conservative lead derbyshire county council be responsible for widespread and systemic failing in support child with special educational need and their family of all the myriad failing of the derbyshire conservatives and there be myriad the way they have let down child with send and their family be the most egregious it be deeply worrying but sadly not surprising as we know that between november and june derbyshire county council pay nearly in compensation to family it have fail last week visit whaley bridge primary school where more than of the student have special educational need meet with the headteacher seren hathway and the chair of governor ian bingle and see for myself the amazing work they do to support child with send if derbyshire county council have just half the level of commitment and professionalism as seren ian and all the family have meet we would not be here have this debate today my hon friend reference very high percentage think in nottinghamshire each month over the past month we have see increase in send diagnose in comparison to the year before do he agree that more research must be do to understand the relative growth in special educational need so we can get to the heart of the issue yes it be vital that we understand what may be drive some need at the end of the day though this be not problem of increase need but the result of absolute systemic failing in derbyshire county council and the system more widely be pleased that the government be determined to fix this break system and see that our mission to remove the barrier to opportunity for all our child be achieve this be fundamental part of that mission end the year of failure of derbyshire county council will not be easy be determined to work with family in high peak and with my derbyshire colleague to put pressure on derbyshire county council to finally provide the support our child desperately need first thank my hon friend the member for amber valley linsey farnsworth for secure this extremely important debate put simply this be an issue hear about from constituent every single day as do all my derbyshire colleague in erewash send family face an uphill battle conservative derbyshire county council have as we have be hear about consistently fail my constituent as it have fail constituent across the county cause anxiety and frustration in make any progress on the education and care of our child we have hear already this evening about the ofsted report which confirm what many family in derbyshire already know that send provision be fail at almost every level if not every level the issue raise with repeatedly by my constituent be rightly highlight in the report communication between family and the local authority email and phone call be roundly ignore mean that family be not update they be leave in limbo for month we hear about the incredible length of time that some family go through to get their ehcp in place sometimes it take year and that leave send family feel alone indeed many of my colleague will be receive multiple new case every week write to derbyshire county council multiple time every week to raise these issue at send drop in hold in erewash be tell of the case of child who need specialist education much like we have hear from colleague this evening he be offer place in school that be ready and able to provide support all derbyshire county council have to do be approve the placement however the council take three month to respond and by the time it do the offer have be close the child current school put in an emergency review which again have no response from derbyshire county council so it then have to go to mediation since the response to mediation there have be no further progress the child be still not receive the require education have only two day of alternative provision week the process be complicated long unnecessarily draw out and incredibly painful for the child and family involve to make matter bad that child and their family have have no few than nine case officer over the past several year an incredible lack of consistency that make communication between the local authority and the family even more difficult derbyshire have crisis as we have hear from multiple colleague this evening send family be be let down time and time again conservative run derbyshire county council be fail our most vulnerable child every single day while derbyshire now have labour representative in every constituency it be incredibly disappointing that not one conservative member of parliament have join we this evening to hear about our plight with derbyshire county council be pleased hear in the budget that the government be provide an extra billion towards send service be also very pleased to hear that the government will be review send service evidently these service all over the country but especially in derbyshire need to be review and must be repair the conservatives be responsible for this chaos but believe in the power of education to change life and that all child regardless of their circumstance have fundamental right to an excellent education special educational need provision across derbyshire be dire be thrilled that my hon friend the member for amber valley linsey farnsworth have secure the debate but be horrified that special educational need provision be so awful that it have come to the attention of parliament to those who live in barlborough pinxton calow pleasley or anywhere in between that be no surprise mum from shirebrook be in tear on the doorstep because her baby have be let down so badly teaching assistant in creswell tell how overwhelmed she be because the demand for resource be so high and the resource available so low and little boy in clowne be self harm because he just want to go to school like all his friend all those people know why thing be as bad as this do not have to tell they sixteen million pound underspent by conservative control derbyshire county council they repeat that to time and again this be never about lack of money it be always about local conservative choose to fail our young people bolsover resident know that the conservatives at derbyshire county council have million with which to support they and their little one and choose not to spend it it be therefore no surprise that ofsted find widespread and systemic failing with family wait too long and feel ignore and child miss large amount of education conservative failure have hit bolsover very hard one in six pupil there receive sen support and far more need it when meet head from across bolsover last year special educational need failure be the first issue that they raise one school have student on the send register but have to park those who do not qualify for additional provision because it do not have the capacity to give those child what they need another have five child who need special need school place but have be unable to obtain one with one of those child remain in the nursery class for several year as result local family move to bolsover from essex bring their autistic son ehcp with they conservative control derbyshire county council lose the paperwork it do not respond to email and it do not respond to my staff the six school consult say that they could not accommodate the child because they already have too many sen child on their register they do not have enough staff and they do not have enough resource so that child have no school place he have not be at school during the current academic year and have no tutor allocate his parent be do what they can to ensure that he do not fall behind his mother have turn down two job to stay at home and educate he the parent be angry and frustrate with the council lack of communication or concern for their child education every one of those story be personal tragedy for the people involve childhood be be lose family finance be put under strain relationship be break down in battle to help special educational need child to reach their potential parent and teacher be hit brick wall headteacher tell that they think the conservative county council see they as the enemy when those who care for our baby be make to feel like that how can our child special educational need ever be meet be under no illusion politic do matter this be the good example of the difference it make to all our life for bolsover resident for derbyshire resident this be the negative impact that politic can have our child be be fail by conservative politician at derbyshire county council with million underspend long waiting list fail ofsted inspection school drown kid suffer family in crisis the conservatives have have their chance and they have fail the only way to change this be for labour to win control of the county council in may labour government back by labour county council be our only chance of see real improvement in special educational need provision for bolsover and beyond thank my hon friend the member for amber valley linsey farnsworth for secure this crucial adjournment debate as she rightly indicate send provision in derbyshire have reach crisis point her point about conservative run derbyshire county council unspent send funding and the heartbreaking consequence for family be sadly all too familiar and echo so many of the story bring to by my own constituent who be in desperate need of support the scale of this issue be staggering throughout my election campaign it be no secret that send would be key issue for if be elect week after be elect hold my first community send meeting which be pack what have not expect be that after seven month in office third of all my constituency casework would relate to send and the number continue to climb in my inbox at my surgery and on the doorstep across south derbyshire parent tell heartbreake story about the decline mental health of their child who be out of education or strand in inappropriate setting many parent include those work in education describe extreme stress financial hardship and lose work time as they navigate broken system other who be less familiar with the process find it totally overwhelming meanwhile their child mental health deteriorate as they be leave without the support they desperately need lack of communication from derbyshire county council leave parent feel unheard and their child forget in some case send caseworker have leave post without inform family leave they email outdated contact in desperation and without response gap in specialist provision mean that many child particularly those with social emotional and mental health need be not receive the support they be entitle to under section of the education act if child be out of school for day or more the local authority must provide suitable full time education my constituent tell that this be not happen there be lack of alternative provision lack of tutoring option and lack of accountability despite parent school and professional agree that mainstream setting often can not meet send child need the local authority continue to name unsuitable placement on education health and care plan that force many family into lengthy and costly tribunal that can take over year to conclude valuable placement in appropriate school be lose due to local authority delay leave child strand and without education consider my constituent theresa and nathan their daughter have cerebral palsy autism and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder transition into mainstream secondary school severely affect her mental health lead to self harm and suicidal thought delay in her ehcp process mean that she lose place in suitable special setting at year old she be on antidepressant and have remain out of education since january that be over year theresa nathan and their daughter deserve well the ream of family who contact for support deserve well and the countless family across derbyshire who be fight to secure the right provision for their child deserve so much well this government have make very clear and welcome commitment to turn spare classroom into nursery do my hon friend agree that where demand for nursery support be low we could look at alternative way of use those classroom to enhance send provision at local level agree but frankly it would be great if derbyshire county council could get the basic right although my team and will always work constructively with the local authority to right the wrong endure by send child and family across south derbyshire the council chronic mismanagement of this crisis be indefensible school be struggle parent be out of work and their child be leave without opportunity to thrive stand firmly with my hon friend and fellow labour mps across derbyshire in hold conservative lead derbyshire county council to account and call on it to spend the million of pound in unallocated funding to make this right the status quo can not continue would like to start by thank all the previous speaker for their heartfelt contribution it be clear that this be an issue that affect we all and thank my hon friend the member for amber valley linsey farnsworth for secure this important debate motion lapse standing order no motion make and question propose that this house do now jones like all the other member from derbyshire sit here today have receive hundred of email on the terrible state of send provision in derbyshire and hundred of story of child and their family be let down by conservative lead derbyshire county council while our wonderful staff member all do their good to help and to deal with these case we know that behind every number there be heart wrench story of family who want the good for their child yet despite all the love in the world feel that they be prevent from give they this one of these story concern my constituent lacey who contact we in despair over her son spencer who suffer from rare genetic condition call mucopolysaccharidosis type or mps the condition which affect every bone and organ in spencer body mean that he have special educational need he be mean to start secondary school in september an exciting time for any young person the family be look forward to buy his first ever secondary school uniform and take the big photo outside his family home for his first day at big school devastatingly this do not happen in june his family be tell the news that his choose school have no place for he and that even bad there be not single send place suitable for he available in derbyshire at all this be failure of planning the issue here be clear it be derbyshire county council that have fail member do not have to take my word for it as we have already hear ofsted say in its inspection just last year that there be widespread and systemic failure lead to significant concern make it one of the bad in the country want to put on record just how serious the situation have become in derbyshire we know that send provision all across the country have be struggle in general but it be clear that there be other factor at play in derbyshire to result in such dire finding the ofsted report make it clear that this be the result of several year of uncertainty at derbyshire with senior post unfille or fill by interim and contract staff shockingly some senior staff be not present for the inspection itself clearly there have be failure of leadership for several year now by the conservative leadership of the council and the conservative cabinet member for education in not grip the problem or realise what it take to deliver long term plan instead they have be too content to let consultant provide they with shiny powerpoints instead of deliver real change for our constituent we desperately need real change at derbyshire county council because for as long as the conservatives be in control of the council fear that the situation will not improve will not throw my hand up and say oh it be what it be send be difficult everywhere like my colleague would like to say to my constituent who be worried about the challenge face their child will never stop fight we will never stop fight and stand up for those child to get the education they need and deserve want to thank my hon friend and constituency neighbour the member for amber valley linsey farnsworth for secure this important debate for we tonight because whether you be young or old in derbyshire it feel like you have county council that be not on your side send make up big amount of my postbag as do the decision to consider close the ada belfield care home in my constituency which be greatly value across the community for its quality and safety and for its kind compassionate person centre care that be concern to many local people as well we have widespread selection of issue in derbyshire for which the county council be responsible read with interest although not surprise the ofsted report that be publish just before christmas as colleague have say it identify widespread and systemic failing in the send provision in derbyshire and have to say that it be not surprise to read that report that be what local people have be tell for quite some time but think the report give they sense of vindication up to that point they be almost feel that maybe it be they maybe they do not understand or appreciate the situation or maybe they be the only one but that report give local people sense that they be not alone there be many people in mid derbyshire and right across the county who be hold back by the situation with our special educational need provision in the county spend little time think about how we get here colleague have rightly say that the council make strategic choice political choice that mean the service it be provide be not effective enough we have hear that the council do not spend million of the money it have to support our child and young people with special educational need and find that level of incompetence absolutely staggering be conscious that council across the country not just derbyshire county council have face decade and half of the most appalling funding cut derbyshire county council budget be around billion year in which be around billion in today money understand that today its budget be million so around half of what it be in real term we know from the send report that there probably have not be enough integration between the nhs and the county council on this issue one good thing the last government do be to set up the integrate care board as well as the integrate care partnership that oversee those board be proud to sit on the derby and derbyshire integrate care partnership prior to my election to this place some good work come through but understandably give the state of the nhs primary and acute care take up most of the body time would like the integrate care board and the integrated care partnership to spend more time on the wide determinant of people health particularly people with disability and long term condition as the government plan for change be implement hope we will see acute and primary care restore to where they should be so that local nhs leader have more time to support send provision the government be make significant investment in local authority and be pleased to learn early this month that we will be provide more than billion of funding to council which represent cash term increase in core spending power we also have billion come for school include billion for send aspect of the autumn budget be truly remarkable and lay the foundation for rebuild public service and give our child and young people opportunity in life be sorry to say that some have use our child wellbeing and schools bill to talk about another sinister issue in society but that bill will give real boost to child and young people in derbyshire school particularly through the breakfast club ask the minister to make sure that child who benefit from home to school transport be able to attend and participate in those breakfast club do not want to come to this debate just to outline situation that our resident know about and that we all know about from our constituency postbag also want to outline solution for the council this government be respond to council need and invest money in our child and young people and now we need derbyshire county council leader to take that forward if they can not they will have to step aside at the next election and allow new leadership to do so congratulate my hon friend the member for amber valley linsey farnsworth on secure an adjournment debate on this important subject and on her powerful and heartfelt speech know that she like all labour members here today have real interest in and passion for support family in her constituency who be navigate the special educational need and disability system and all the challenge that clearly present thank everyone who have contribute to this debate thank my hon friend the members for derbyshire dales john whitby for derby north catherine atkinson for north west leicestershire amanda hack and for rushcliffe james naish for their intervention and thank my hon friend the members for high peak jon pearce for erewash adam thompson for south derbyshire samantha niblett for bolsover natalie fleet for north east derbyshire louise jones and for mid derbyshire jonathan davies for their powerful speech hon member have speak incredibly powerfully for their constituent and they be very much hear as hon member recognise improve the special educational need and disability system across the country be priority for the government we want all child to receive the right support to succeed in their education and to lead happy healthy and productive adult life every child regardless of their individual need deserve the opportunity to achieve thrive and succeed at the moment we know far too many child be not be give that chance and far too many family have be let down year on year by system that be not meet those need over million child and young people in england have special educational need figure that be increase year on year with more child require send support and even more child and young people be identify as have specific need that require an education health and care plan as the education secretary mention in her keynote speech at the centre for social justice just last week the recognition of those additional need and the debate around how we support child with send be sign of progress but clearly there be much more to do one of the reason the county council have get into this mess be because it be around decade since ofsted previous inspection of its send provision when approach ofsted official say the reason be that that be what ofsted have be contract to do by the government we need more agile regulation as we discuss on the second reading of the data use and access bill today but do the minister have plan to look at ofsted regulatory model and the frequency with which it inspect if the provision in derbyshire have be inspect early we might have less of problem to deal with now my hon friend raise an important point we be look across the system at how to reform it to make it well for family and for child who experience the need for additional support and to improve outcome to assess all those issue we need an inspection and accountability framework that drive improvement will come to the specific issue raise in the inspection of derbyshire county council it be inspect under new inspection framework that throw significant light on the current situation as exemplify by the various heartbreaking story hon member have share today improve the send system be vital part of the government opportunity mission we be determined to break the unfair link between background and opportunity by give every child with send along with all other child the good start in life we be prioritise early intervention and inclusive provision in mainstream setting as we know that early intervention prevent unmet need from escalate that will support all child and young people to achieve their goal alongside their peer we know it take vast workforce from teacher to teaching assistant early year educator to ally health professional to help all child to achieve and thrive we be invest in each of those area to improve outcome and experience across the country we be commit to work with the sector and our partner to ensure that our approach be fully plan and deliver in partnership we have already begin the work by appoint strategic adviser on send to engage with sector leader practitioner child and family we have establish an expert advisory group for inclusion to improve the mainstream education outcome and experience for those with send and we have set up neurodivergence task and finish group to provide shared understanding of what provision and support in mainstream educational setting should look like for neurodivergent child and young people within an inclusive system my hon friend the member for amber valley understandably raise concern about education health and care plan timeline the plan have significantly increase in number year on year since their introduction in with nearly child and young people with an ehcp as of january last year over time flaw and lack of capacity in the system to meet low level need have add additional strain on specialist service and that have have detrimental impact on the experience of those access the ehcp process there have be late identification of need and intervention low parental confidence in the ability of mainstream setting to meet that need inefficient allocation of resource across the system and inconsistency in practice and provision base on location hon member have express the particular challenge in derbyshire that have clearly manifest over many year those have all contribute to push up cost and have create an increasingly unsustainable system the late datum show that in just of ehcp be issue within the week statutory timeframe that be leave young people and their family without appropriate and adequate support the government want to ensure that ehc need assessment be progress promptly and plan be issue so that child and young people get the support they need to help they achieve positive outcome we know that local authority have be struggle to meet the increase demand for ehcp so we be constantly work with they to improve those response time the government be acutely aware of the challenge that family face in access the support their child need and actually of how adversarial the ehcp process can be independently commission insight that we publish last year show that if we can get those extensive improvement to the system if we can use early intervention well and if we can well resource mainstream school that will have significant impact more child will have their need meet without have to even go through an education health and care plan process because their need will be meet in mainstream setting with their peer we be listen to parent local authority colleague and partner right across education and as hon member have rightly identify across health and social care because we need to work out how to address and improve the experience of the ehcp process for family and reflect on how we can roll out practice that will be more consistent nationally every child and young person should have access to high quality service to set they up for life for work and for the future and local authority and their partner be key to ensure that child can access the support they need ofsted and the care quality commission jointly inspect derbyshire in september and find widespread and systemic failing that lead to significant concern about the experience and outcome of child and young people with send across the county of derbyshire the publish report make it clear that the local area partnership which consist of the local authority and the integrated care board must address those concern urgently and identify six area for priority action as result of the inspection his majesty chief inspector require the local area partnership to prepare and submit priority action plan to address the identify area team have be put in place to track those outcome against the action plan progress be be monitor and the department for education have appoint send adviser to work collaboratively with an nhs england adviser to challenge support and work with derbyshire county council and the integrated care board to drive those improvement be sure that that be good news for hon member to hear but clearly that progress need to be make as quickly as possible because as hon member rightly set out family can not wait any long for the support they need we absolutely want more child and young people to receive the support they need and ideally to thrive in their local mainstream setting with their peer so that they do not need to travel long distance to find specialist place that can accommodate they and they can have their need meet with their friend in their local school we know that many mainstream setting already go above and beyond to deliver that specialist provision locally through resource provision and sen unit and we know as well that there will always be place for special school and college for child and young people who have the most complex need it be vital that we see the investment that be need to create the new place in mainstream and special school and in specialist setting that be why we have announce million of high need capital for we will set out those allocation to local authority in due course hon member have raise concern about the underspend in derbyshire county council and we really need to see that money invest in those specialist place whether in mainstream or special school to make sure that place be available with the support that child need the government be absolutely committed to work with derbyshire county council and with school leader and sector partner locally and nationally to develop and improve the inclusive education within mainstream setting that every child deserve thank the minister for speak so clearly on this important issue on the intervention make early about empty classroom we be see in nottinghamshire that there be not the demand for nursery place that there desperately be in other part of the country do the department have any appetite to think about how those space could be use to try to deal with the issue we be talk about today my hon friend raise really important point that manifest itself in many part of the country we have shift in demographic and as he identify early year place be open up more quickly in some part of the country than in other that be why the secretary of state announce the funding to create early year place in particular but it be also why we have this capital funding that will be allocate to local authority so we can utilise all the available space to make sure that we can provide these specialist place obviously we want local authority to be able to apply the funding in the way that will well meet the need in their local area that might mean repurpose space to create specialist unit within mainstream school create more accessible space within mainstream school or create specialist place in whatever way school be able to if local authority be able to support they that funding will be available to create those space my hon friend be absolutely right to draw attention to that thank my hon friend the member for amber valley for bring this debate forward member here tonight be clearly very grateful for the opportunity to air their constituent concern and for this issue to be highlight and it be absolutely right that it be because send outcome in derbyshire and nationally be an issue we all care passionately about acknowledge the challenge that far too many family face when seek to secure the right support for their child with special educational need and disability and that the system absolutely need to improve and we be determined to make progress and to make the change want to conclude as always by recognise all those who work in our education health and care system in the interest of our child and young people with special educational need and disability in derbyshire and right across the country we need to deliver the very good for all of our child and young people include those with send we need to give they the very good start in life and prepare they for life work and the future thank all who work to deliver that tirelessly day in day out despite the challenge set out tonight be confident that together with determination we can see that change question put and agree to house adjourn deferred division
